In the image, a man is seen in a white outfit, likely a uniform, standing next to a cow. The cow, which is brown in color, is standing on a dirt floor. The man is kneeling down, possibly to milk the cow. He is holding a bucket in his hands, which is likely used for collecting the milk. The man is also holding a white object, possibly a tool or equipment related to milking. The background of the image is not clear, but it appears to be a barn or a similar structure.
