In the image, a man is milking a white sheep in a barn. The man, dressed in a white shirt and a red cap, is kneeling down next to the sheep. He is holding a metal container, which he is using to collect the milk. The sheep, which is lying down on the ground, is facing the man and is partially covered by a white blanket. The barn where this is happening has a gray wall and a wooden floor. The image captures a moment of calm and routine in the life of a farmer.
