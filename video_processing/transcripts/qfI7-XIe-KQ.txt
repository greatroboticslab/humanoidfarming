Education
 Pigs naturally bulldoze their way through any obstacle or threat. So how do we teach them to respect the electric fence? Now cows generally touch the electric fence and once shocked, they pull back away from it. But pigs are short, muscular, and have discovered that running through harm is far more effective than running from it. Once shocked, they will run through the fence. So we place pigs into a training pen. It has strong goat panels or cattle panels as a perimeter fence. Just inside that perimeter fence, we string up electric fencing. When the pigs are shocked, they are unable to escape the electricity trying to go through it. So they quickly learn to go back into the center of the pen. Within a few days to a couple weeks, they are ready to go out to the pastures. But there's always one or two that try to be difficult.
