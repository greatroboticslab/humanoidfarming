 So, we're pleased to have Dale doing this week to present. Dale leads the CC efforts in the New York City Watershed Ag Program, helping to coordinate multi-agency efforts to protect the unfiltered... Janice, I'm not hearing you. Oh, not at all? I can hear you, Janice, but I don't know... I can hear you. Me too. Okay. Is there anything else in the Q&A? Just that April can also hear. So, yeah, and Liz, so I'm wondering if it's on Jen's end. Okay. All right. I will just continue. Sorry, Jen. So, Dale works in the New York City Watershed Ag Program and helps to protect the unfiltered drinking water source for the 9 million water consumers. in New York City. Dale has over 35 years experience as a field crops educator with a focus on production of quality forages. Okay. Thanks, Janice. Thanks. Yeah. So, we'll dive right in here, I guess. And thanks to the team that put these things together. All the other workshops we've had these previous weeks have been great. And I hope to live up to the standard or quality that everybody's had before me. So, just thinking about forages. Well, there we go. Here's where I want to be, this slide. So, basically, one of the things that I started to think about is, yeah, let's, can we get some respect for forages? We have more acres of forages than anything else by far in our state. You know, our biggest industries are dairy and livestock farming. And, you know, the majority of the diets for those animals are forages. Our forages protect our soil quality, prevent erosion, sequester carbon, do all kinds of great environmental services. They're perennial. You know, there's a lot of things to love about forage. And so, I'm glad we're able to talk about it today. And, you know, what do we want? When it comes to forage, we want yield and we want quality. And yield's easy to understand, right? We just, we want more, right? We want as much as we can get. But what's quality? Quality is a little more elusive. And quality means different things to different species and different classes of animals. And so, when we talk about quality, we really need to know what do we want to use this for. But we also know it matters a lot. If we have the wrong quality for the wrong group of animals, we're not going to get the performance we want. And so, in this sort of idea of yield and quality, you know, Jerry Churney, our forage specialist on campus, says often, quality times yield equals yield. You know, in economic analysis, yield usually overwhelms quality in, you know, the dollars and cents analysis. And so, we can't ignore yield by any stretch. But then, you know, we have this yield and quality sort of tension always when we're talking about forage crops. And so, that's going to be a theme as we go through these slides. And, you know, if we're going to talk about what it's worth, you know, quality is really a, you know, really is about what is a forage worth. And if we're going to do some economic analysis, we need to know what this stuff we're producing is worth. But it's not like corn or soybeans or wheat, right, where there's a market price and it's well-defined. Market prices are hard to find. There are some USDA market reports out there. There's some auction reports. But there's really no standard way of valuing forages. You know, part of that is because is it a small square bale or a big square bale or a round bale of baleage or a silo full of something? You know, all of those things are more or less saleable depending on who you're selling to. So valuing forages from a dollar to a cent point is hard. Buying forages is difficult. Who has the quality that you need? Who has the amount of the quality that you need? And how do you find it? And, you know, so even just the act of trying to buy forage is costly. I mean, so really the bottom line is the forage you make has a lot of value. Because replacing it is really hard. You need to have enough. You know, so it's not easy to put a value on it. But it's probably worth more than you think. And it's probably worth more than just what the market price is. And so let's talk a little bit also about high forage diets. High forage diets have been the trend for our dairy diets, you know, recently, you know, for good reasons. High forage diets, you know, 60% forage or more is one of the ways that we define a high forage diet in our precision feed management program. Healthier cows, a lower ration cost, you know, better components, you know, usually higher profits. Also, if we're feeding more on farm forage, we're importing less feeds from off the farm, fewer concentrates that are high cost. But also, it's good for the mass balance on our farm from a nutrient balance kind of idea. So we have some challenges, though, right? Because if you want a high forage diet and you want high performance, you got to have high digestibility, right? And if you have high digestibility forages, you have faster passage rates, you know, you have lower NDF, so you can pack more of that in the room at any one time. And so you have higher dry matter intakes or intake intakes, I guess, if you read my slide. So if it's higher quality and they eat more of it, then you need more inventory, right? So, you know, it's just a thing that spirals, that we improve quality, they eat more of it. So not only do we need more of it, right? It's sort of compounding. And so, again, it's this interaction of yield and quality that's really important in planning this forage production on our farm. So thinking about quality, here's this graph. We've been doing scissors cut sampling in Delaware County. At least I have good data going back to 2008. We did it a few years before that on a limited number of fields. But looking at 2008 through 2022, just tracking, and often, you know, we do 35 to 45 fields per year that we track through the month of May, trying to predict first, you know, the right first cutting day. So if you look at NDF and NDF digestibility, which is two of the things that we measure in our scissors cuts, you can see that over the course of May into early June, NDF goes up steadily. You know, you know, you know, not quite a point a day, but, you know, lots of times we talk about, you know, 1.9 NDF per day is not unusual to see in May. And then the digestibility of that NDF continually goes down. And so from a quality standpoint, there's more NDF. And that NDF is lower in digestibility. So the energy that the animal is going to get from that, you know, sort of going down in two different ways. And so, and this is just a chart of grass forages. And so 50 NDF is kind of our cutoff for where we would like to see the start of grass harvest. So again, it's not because of the weather each spring varies. When we get there is a little bit different each spring, but on the average, it's about May 16th in Delaware County that we get to 50 NDF. And, you know, if our tolerance for quality is somewhere, you know, you know, in the high 50s, you know, sort of, we'd like to get our whole first cutting crop in that between 50 to 56, 57 maybe. You know, so that really defines, what this really defines is our harvest window, right? So if that's the quality that we require, our harvest window is that seven or 10 days, you know, the third week of June, right? Or excuse me, third week of May. You know, if there's some legume or if, you know, legume fields are often out here, you know, getting to optimum around the first of June, you know, for us. So we're talking about harvesting grasses, you know, a week before, you know, high percentage legume stands. We find that something that's 50% or less alfalfa grass, you know, 50% lower percentage alfalfa, often, you know, those fields are prime kind of in this same window as our grass fields are. You know, maybe a few days later, but, you know, not too much later. So again, we've got this sort of, obviously, yields going up every one of these days also, right? As the hay matures, there's more yield. So again, talking about yield and quality, you know, we've spent, you know, these last, you know, couple decades really worrying about dairy quality forage. Well, what if you're a livestock producer? You have beef cows, you want to feed beef cows. You know, if you've got steers that you're trying to get to have a high number of pounds of gains per day, you probably need something that's very similar to this dairy quality forage. But if you're overwintering brood cows, you want something that's very different. You're looking for something that is closer to this high 60s NDF kind of stuff. And so you're probably looking to wait out until the first week of June or the second week of June to make that first cutting. You know, so again, you know, the animals you're feeding really matter. So just thinking again about harvest window, let's just say you have 100 acres of grass hay you need to harvest. Not every day is harvestable, you know, it rains. And in May in Delaware County, it rains a lot. And at least three days a week, it's usually rainy. If we're lucky, we get that many sunny days. And so if we say, you know, sort of something just before 50 to about 55 is our target. You know, when you do the math, you've got to do about 25 acres per day to hit that harvest window. Again, this is kind of calculation we like to do with folks and just say, you know, if you've got these acres and you know what your harvest window is, you need to think about removing the bottlenecks that'll get you to that number of acres per day. So if you're a large farm and you got, you know, you know, 1,000 acres of grass hay you need to do, that means you have to do 250 acres a day. You know, so it's not hard to see why we see some of the large equipment that, you know, that's around. You know, it's really a race when we get to that early first cutting window. And it matters. You know, it's, I think it's the most significant event on a dairy farm all year long is that first cutting window. So again, we're talking about the foundations of success. So we can't talk about the foundations of success without worrying about soil pH. You know, pH is really does, has a lot to do with nutrient availability, phosphorus use efficiency. And, you know, low pH, you've got a lot of aluminum, manganese, and iron, which end up being toxic to plants and plant roots. Nodulation of, of legumes really doesn't happen well unless we're above 6.5. So pH really matters. Again, here's sort of our, you know, you can see the solubility nutrients here. And we have an awful lot of soils in Delaware County that are in this, you know, 5 to 6 kind of pH range. And you can see a lot of the important nutrients that we care about in our forages are lower availability at low pH. And I think this is really where it's even more important. This manganese, aluminum, boron are toxic in this, you know, below 5.7. You know, and so we just get a lot less root growth. And the more we're talking about soil health and microbial activity, these low pHs don't lend themselves to that high level of microbial activity that we'd like to keep our nutrient cycles powered up and going. So again, this is just some textbook pictures of what do roots look like under different pHs. And you can see that at low pHs, root growth is really hindered. And I think that's the foundation or the reason why we really need to be looking at that pH. Again, what are pH requirements? We want for alfalfa. We want that 6.5, 6.8 kind of pH for our clovers and grasses. 6.2 will do the job. But you really need to be over 5.7. Get to that 5.9, 6.2 kind of range. And that's really where this sort of aluminum toxicity kind of thing starts to turn off. And our plants can thrive. So we had a project where we did a bunch of liming on some of our farms in the New York City watershed. And a colleague of ours on the nutrient management team here, Carrie Sheridan, put these slides together. So we looked at 43 fields where we had soil samples before the liming. Of course, we had the soil sample so we knew how much lime to put on. And then we had a soil sample again a couple years later after the liming had happened to see what the results were. So on the average, those fields were 5.6 before we did the liming. And generally, we put on the three tons of ENV equivalent, 100% ENV equivalent. And that got us to a pH of 6.4. So right where we wanted to be. You know, so that's three quarters of a point. Remember, pH is a logarithmic scale. So one whole point is 100 times more acid or 100 times more basic, right? So manganese, one of these sort of not healthy for roots nutrients, decreased by 20%. So again, all those going in the right direction, we should expect greater root growth, enhanced nutrient uptake, you know, healthier plants. Magnesium increased by 21%, which is not surprising because essentially all lime contains some amount of magnesium. And then soil phosphorus. Magnesium increased by 21% of the time. Again, lime doesn't have any phosphorus in it. But when we got the, we saw an increase in phosphorus soil test because of the liming. Again, remember, especially with our Morgan extraction that we use for Cornell recommends, it's a fairly weak acid. So as that phosphorus becomes more available because the pH is higher, we should see the soil test come up a little bit because there's more extractable P with the Morgan extraction. But especially in the watershed, isn't increased soil phosphorus a bad thing? And, you know, often we would say, yes, you know, phosphorus is our enemy when it comes to eutrophication and a lot of water quality problems. But I think what's really important to remember is we're doing more than just that. So we've got improved pH is creating healthier root systems, which is for more soil. Those roots access more water and nutrients. We get more yield. We've got a larger pool of nutrients that are actively cycling. Phosphorus removal per acre goes up because yield goes up, because the access to phosphorus goes up. So that's really mitigating water quality problems. So the total P in the soil really didn't change with liming, but the availability of that phosphorus improves. And so our plants actually can take it up. And we're actually removing that and having a large active site pool cycling phosphorus, which gives us control of that phosphorus. So, again, just on liming, remember, know the ENV of the lime you're buying. We've run into some challenges of folks selling lime here that really is substandard. Make sure you get a lime tag and know what the ENV is. Use a current soil test so you know what your rate is. And the other good thing about lime, there's really no bad time to apply lime. If you can get on the field and not run over the crop, it's a fine time to put on lime. So let's get into more of what we really wanted to talk about today. Let's talk about alfalfa and high percentage alfalfa grass nutrient requirements. Remember, the alfalfa is going to be fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere. You know, it does it all by itself. We really don't need to supply any nitrogen. Phosphorus is really important for establishment and for, you know, general plant production. But we're going to see that especially at establishment, phosphorus matters. Potassium really helps with plant health and winter hardiness. You know, it's one of the, it's probably the key nutrient when we talk about fertilizing alfalfa. We often have questions about boron and sulfur with alfalfa. Again, these are, they're not quite micronutrients, but they're minor nutrients. Boron can at times be a problem, especially acid, low pH, sandy soils with not much manure history. In those situations, you should pay attention and maybe a little bit of, you know, a pound or two per acre in your top dress fertilizer wouldn't be wrong. You can also soil test for boron and know if you have an adequate amount. Sulfur, again, as our air quality is improving, the free sulfur from the atmosphere and acid rain is less. So, again, acid, low organic matter, sandy soils with not much manure history. Sulfur might be a need. But if you've got a manure history like most alfalfa fields do, I think, at least on livestock farms, you know, maybe is not a huge problem. So, let's look at the fertilizer chart for alfalfa establishment. And I've highlighted the soil group three in all of these. I think most of the soils that are growing forages in the state are probably in that group three. If you've got, you know, sandier soils, they would be, you know, more towards a group four or five. If you've got soils with a high clay content, they're going to be down in the group ones and twos kind of area. And so, really, these charts, the only place where you see any difference is over in the potassium. Just because of the supplying power of those clay minerals for potassium. So, again, we talked about phosphorus being important. You can see that if you've got, you know, medium or low phosphorus, that's a pretty significant amount of P recommended there. And generally, that's looking at phosphorus being supplied in a band. And, you know, if you're planting with a drill, you may well be able to band that phosphorus. And there's certainly an advantage to banding. If you can't band, often I see recommendations of tripling the phosphorus if you are broadcasting versus banding. And so, again, you're in those lower, you know, those lower phosphorus sort of soil test areas. That's, you triple, you know, 60 to 180 pounds of phosphorus. That's a significant amount to get on. Manure can be helpful. The phosphorus and potassium in manure is available in the seeding year. And so, you know, a limited rate might make sense. But, again, remember, it doesn't need that nitrogen. And you might be, you know, causing some other challenges, maybe with overfertilizing a companion crop or encouraging some weeds with a higher nitrogen with manure. But also remember, most alfalfa is in a rotation with corn. And so, we're often using high manure rates on corn. And this alfalfa part of the rotation really helps mine some of that phosphorus and potassium that we built up over the corn fertilization years. And if any of you are in the CAFO world and worrying about phosphorus index, it really helps to keep your phosphorus soil test down in the low part of the high range to make manure management that's allowed with a P index easier. So, these alfalfa parts of the rotation are really helpful in mining some of that P and K out. Again, looking at top dressing, again, this is for those 50% or better alfalfa fields. You know, phosphorus becomes less important in the top dress, although, you know, a small amount is often recommended. But if you're in a medium and low kind of area of potash, fields that don't have a long manure history or might be in that area, doing the phosphorus or potash top dress is really important. And so, that's the kind of fertilizing that we usually think about with alfalfa fields is, you know, some kind of summer top dress of P and K. Again, watch your soil tests. Know what you need. I think the soil test recommendations are pretty trustworthy. If you are out there in the high and very high range, you definitely don't need to top dress these fields. And again, if you're there, it's because you spent a lot of, put a lot of manure in there. And it really is, would be beneficial for you to mine that down to a lower level and preserve some flexibility for manure spreading in the future. Okay, so alfalfa and manure. First thing, the nitrogen for manure turns off nitrogen fixation from the plants. And so, there's really no economic value of putting manure on alfalfa. And if your P and K is medium or low, you could use some manure to provide that rather than a fertilizer top dress. But again, if the P and K is high or very high, there's additionally no economic value. Sort of these micronutrients and boron and sulfur. Manure is a good source of those. And manure has some value. Again, if you're in that situation of needing it, it probably means you don't have much manure history either. So, what if you need more places to spread manure? You know, there are sort of nutrient management rules that will let you spread some manure. But still, there's no fertilizer economic value there. It simply would be disposing of manure in a place where you're allowed to put it. Probably continuing to escalate the phosphorus and potassium levels in your soils. So, there's probably a better place for manure than on alfalfa or alfalfa grass fields. So, what if we've got lower percentage legume fields? Sort of these 25 to 50 percent legume. Maybe older stands. Again, a little bit of nitrogen is needed for that grass. So, 30 to 50 pounds. You know, some P and K definitely helps legume in that. And so, a little bit of manure probably wouldn't be bad. And, you know, again, a more balanced fertilizer would be probably the way to go in a medium soil test. Okay. And generally, once we get to 25 percent or less from a fertility kind of standpoint on a hay field, we would ignore any legume there. Sort of the nitrogen fixation is low enough that it's really not giving us a significant benefit to the grass in the stand. So, let's talk about fertilizing grasses. This is getting into my passion, I guess. You know, in our part of the world, grass hay fields are the predominant number of acres that are out there. And there's significant opportunity to make some really great quality forage from these fields if we put the management package together. So, especially with intense management, we have high nitrogen needs for these grass fields. We don't have the alfalfa there to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. We have to supply it from somewhere else. Again, phosphorus is important for establishment, as in any of the plants we're establishing. Potassium is also important. One of the things we have seen in some what I call neglected hay fields, fields where somebody's been mowing the hay for a number of years and not putting anything back. We often see more grass diseases there. And when we put some potash on and those grasses are definitely more disease, you know, express their disease resistance much better. And so, we need to supply that potash from somewhere if we're going to have a productive hay field. Just one note of caution, if you're looking to have dry cow forage that's low in potash, you actually need that field to be deficient. And putting some nitrogen on a deficient soil potash field is probably the way to get, if you're looking for a low potash forage. Put some nitrogen on, but definitely stay away with manure, stay away with potash fertilizer. Put some nitrogen on, but also stay away with potash fertilizer. Again, sort of the sulfur question is a good one. If it's a field that has not much manure history, might be a little acid, might be a little sandy. You know, low organic matter in most of our sod fields are not organic matter, but those are the places where sulfur might help. And maybe blending some ammonium sulfate in that nitrogen top dress would be a way to, is an easy way to get some sulfur on these fields if you're concerned. So, the other thing that's super important here is that harvest management and fertility decisions are closely linked. You know, we're struggling on this yield and quality thing, right? And so, you really can't think of them separately, yield and, or fertility and harvest management. So, again, establishing grasses, it looks a lot like the establishing legume. You know, we're trying to get seeds to germinate and, you know, having enough phosphorus in that environment is important. And, you know, we need probably a little bit of potash to go along with it. Banding still is the most efficient way. And, again, manure can be a good source here. So, top dressing grass. Here's one of those places where our harvest management matters. If you've got a one or a two cut system, you might be able to get away with only 50 or 75 pounds of manure for, or excuse me, of nitrogen for the season. And we probably can supply that all in the first cutting and you'd probably be all right. You know, if you're looking at a intensive grass management system, especially where you're going to be cutting early, that green up nitrogen is super important. And, you know, we'll talk more about the recommendations, but, you know, you can easily get up to 150 or 200 pounds of applied nitrogen per acre on these fields. And, again, don't forget P and K. If these are fields that are infrequently manured, pay attention to your soil tests. Adding that P and K does matter. Again, could be a summer top dress kind of timeframe to keep you in good shape there on the P and K. Or you could blend it together with your, at green up, you know, nitrogen. So, again, let's look, think about manure on grasses. We already said you got a high nitrogen requirement. It's a good target for manure. And if you're manuring those, these grass hay fields, you probably are still going to need some nitrogen beyond what your manure supply. To get 150 or 200 pounds of available nitrogen from manure. So, you know, would require rates that you probably wouldn't want to apply. And your P and K rates would be way more than what you'd want to do. Again, if you got a phosphorus and potassium that's medium or low, manure is valuable there and has value up to the P and K needs. Again, if P and K are high and you don't need to apply more, there's no economic value for manure, at least from the P and K kind of standpoint. Same answer here for, you know, sulfur. If you got a field that's being minured at least once every few years, I don't think you're going to have an issue with sulfur. So you need more places to spread. This is the place. You know, grasses can really use a lot of nitrogen. You've got the sod that's that's protecting you and helping with reducing runoff and risk of runoff. So these grass hay fields are a great place to to soak up manure. Again, the only caution is if you your P and K can rise to excess if you're trying to get a lot of nitrogen from your manure and in those event that you're looking for a dry cow forage, probably not the right place for manure. Okay, so here's here's a slide I like to show. This is from a plot we did a number of years ago here in Delaware County. We've done it several times, and the results are pretty much always the same. You know, we applied different rates. So we did a lot of nitrogen, sort of the Cornell recommends rate, half a rate below Cornell recommends, and one and a half the Cornell recommends rate. So again, for intensive management, excuse me, 100 pounds at green up, and then 50 after each cutting or for each additional cutting. We did four cuttings here. We did a green up after first after second. We didn't apply any more after third. You can see where we used the recommended rate. We doubled the zero nitrogen yield, which is pretty typical. You want to do a plot where you can get visible dramatic results for adding fertilizer. You can see where we used the zero nitrogen response on a grass hay field. So it works every time. So you can see going to a one and a half rate didn't give us any more yield, and the half rate didn't perform that badly. And, you know, again, if we had some manure on a field, this probably would be not a bad treatment if we had manure coming from other sources as well. So the real question the last couple years has been, as urea prices have gone through the roof, can I still afford to put urea on if it's $800 a ton or $1,000 a ton? So I updated our analysis here. I put in hay values at $225 to $300 a ton. Remember, we're doing this cutting management to make premium quality stuff, at least something that's good or very good. These are going to be 14 or 15% protein in mid-50s NDF. You know, just sort of the prime for forage that we're looking for. So it's it's got a good value. And I got one quote or heard from one farmer saying urea is going to be around 750 a ton this spring. We'll see, you know, how it turns out or what it is in your neighborhood. But still, you know, we had like $600 return, $600 benefit per acre, even after we took out for that high priced urea. Even if it's you're getting closer to $1,000 a ton, you're still getting a really good a dollar return from this nitrogen. So it's definitely the economics are there, you know, to to put on the fertility if you're doing the cutting management that's going to get you the quality that's got the value. Again, if if you want a little bit of phosphorus or excuse me, a little bit of sulfur put some ammonium sulfate blend, you know, 50 50 or 60 40 75 25 ammonium sulfate or urea to ammonium sulfate. And you can get, you know, depending on your rate, you know, look for that 20 pounds or so of of sulfur per acre. So that's a good way to go. And also don't forget about P and K. A lot of times these fields that many of these grass hay fields on a livestock farm are getting some manure. So the P and K may well be there. But we'll look at another set of results here in a minute where the P and K really mattered. Dale? Yes, we have. We have we have a question about sulfur while you're on the topic. Sure. Anna asks, have you seen any evidence of a relationship between sulfur fertility and protein content of grass? I think we haven't looked there. We really haven't had a place where doing a sulfur comparison, you know, fit for us. But sulfur is definitely a component of protein. I wouldn't be surprised that supplying sulfur if it's deficient could improve protein. But I would also say most of the time protein is we almost always have more protein than we need in our rations, especially high forage rations. Our problem is often getting the protein, not having excess protein and trying to stay control or, you know, milk urea, blood urea, nitrogen levels. So getting more protein is usually not what we're after. We're looking for more digestible fiber. That's really where it matters, I think. So let's talk about this cutting management and fertility thing a little bit. One of our one of our plots, we had the opportunity. The farmer where we had our plot, they had not. By the time we got the second cutting in our plot, they had not done first cutting in the surrounding field. So we were able to do to sample and see what the yield was in that late cut first cutting. So, you know, late or early July. Right. So we had two cuttings in our plot and only one cutting in the surrounding field. So with no nitrogen, delaying cutting got us more in one cut than we got in two cuts without nitrogen. So we had to do that, because one of the things I would say is you don't want to, if you're putting the the investment in in nitrogen and green up on these fields, you need to harvest it at at at the right time to get the value. You know, you know, you know, so again, low yields. But then compared with, you know, again, we didn't get quite as much in the first cut of our of our fertilized plot as we did if we had waited another 40 days or so to to cut the hay. But added together, we were, you know, well more in two cuttings. So, again, it's just this harvest management and fertility go together. If I were going to be harvesting in July, I might not want to put very much nitrogen on. I'm sure if we put nitrogen here and waited, we'd had even more yield and we'd had very low quality. But if if high fiber or low digestibility stuff is what you need for overwintering beef cows. That might not be a bad practice. Dale, yes, we we had a question about nitrogen timing way back at the beginning of the webinar today. I have I have some slides on nitrogen timing. Okay, got it. In just a minute. So we'll get there. Yep. Actually, the very next slide. So here we are putting nitrogen on at green up. So when we say at green up, you know, as soon as those fields start to have a little bit of growth, I would say in Delaware County, we are not at green up yet. Although some years we would be at this date. Right. We fertilize plots as early as the, you know, 27th, 28th of May. You know, and and we had, you know, they're starting to wake up. Not this year yet here. So we started in 2019. We had this question of how early can we go and how late can we go and still get a response. So we went out essentially weekly on some plots and put out our our first cutting nitrogen. So between 75 and 100 pounds and at green up. So we started April 11th. That was green up that year. And we got the best response going as close to green up as you can. So again, I had my I'm sure we use the monium sulfate here because that's that's the easiest thing to hand apply. And, you know, with my bucket, I didn't make any money tracks. Right. So going early, that's the big challenges. Can you get across the field? How early can you get across the field? So again, if you can hit that as early at green up as you can, there's an advantage to being to being there, you know, right at green up. So again, remember, you know, we'll get that in. It's going to be on the ground. But even going as late as May 2nd. Again, remember, we probably harvested this on May, May 16th or 17th. Right. We tried to hit it right at the our scissors cut predicted 50% NDF. NDF. So even with that nitrogen only being out there for two weeks before we harvested, we still got a pretty good yield bump from that nitrogen. I can also say that when we went back and did second cutting, you could see the carryover effects of nitrogen in this plot where in this one you couldn't, right? When it was there the whole time, the plants were able to use everything we put there. When we went later, we had some carryover effect in the second. So it wasn't wasted in that sense. You know, so I would say how late can you go? I think you can put your, you know, sort of at green up nitrogen on as late as first week of May and it's still worth it. You know, you'll probably still see the wheel tracks from your application in the hay, you know, because it's, you know, pretty tall, you're running over it, but it's still worthwhile and you'll get the, you know, the yield and quality benefits from doing that. Again, so as early as you can, but if circumstances prevent you from getting out there, you know, in April, you know, even as late as the first week of May, I think it can be okay. Does that fit the, I don't know who had the question, does that fit what you're looking for for an answer? Actually, we, the question was even an extension of this. It was about fall application of grass and the impact on the spring grass for cotton production. Yeah, I mean, I can believe that happens, right? I mean, if you're making the grass happy in the fall, it's probably happy in the spring. Economically, I would question whether it really is a benefit. And certainly you're putting nitrogen out there in a time when you're going to have probably a fair amount of loss. Your leaching losses would likely be, you know, so environmentally it's definitely a bad practice. You know, we put manure on fields fall in the winter, but I would say, especially with the cost of nitrogen fertilizer, I don't, I don't think it's probably a smart move. So, and Dale, I have another way to think about this too. If, if it's compared to not putting any nitrogen on at all, then it probably does appear positive. But if it's compared with putting it on according to your information here, then it probably wouldn't be as positive. I think that that's a fair way to say it. Yep. We have, we have a related question here too from Brian. What is the risk of applying N before green up? It's related to this fall application almost. Soils aren't warm yet. Why not just go just before green up when soils might still be somewhat frozen in the morning, thawing in the afternoon? I, I think that, um, I think that could work. Um, I think you want to be careful. Um, some of these where this is bouncing around here, um, there were a couple of these days that we actually had snow on the ground when I went and did the fertilizing. And when I fertilized on a day that was really cold, even if it was, you know, in the middle of April, um, we didn't get as good a response as if it was on a day when things were growing well. Again, I don't know what the mechanism is there. Um, but, um, you know, I think some of those days that, that it's freezing, you know, it's, you know, I, I, I wouldn't be surprised. We've got 50 ish degrees today. If we went out this weekend, we'd probably see some grass greening up, you know, it's probably getting to about, you know, a good time to go. So I think there's less risk there. I do think that especially in the view of high nitrogen prices with urea using a urease inhibitor, um, you know, probably is a good, um, insurance. Um, again, the soils are cooler, you know, the, the soil's moist, you know, the, the risk of volatilization is, is a lot lower. Um, but I think that, um, you know, uh, you know, just considering the, the total cost of, of, uh, urea now, you know, going with the protector is probably a good idea. Um, I'll move on to- I wanted to ask you one more question. Yeah. Uh, did you use ureacin protected, uh, urea for the study that you're showing us? Well, in this, in all my studies, I almost always use ammonium sulfate just because it's all, we do small plots and it's hand applied. And so in a small plot, we might be putting on, you know, like 12 ounces, like a 12 ounce cup of, of fertilizer. That, and that's ammonium sulfate. If it's urea, which is twice as dense nitrogen wise, 46 versus 21, right? I would only have six ounces of stuff to spread around the plot. So it's a lot easier to do it with ammonium sulfate. Um, so that's what we usually use in our hand, hand fertilized plots. Um, so this is just one last slide here. Um, talk about these depleted hay fields. We have a lot more of these around these days. Um, you know, some of them are on our, our beef farms or, or folks that are sort of, um, have transitioned from dairy and are doing some hay sales. Um, so these grass hay fields where, um, they're not being minored anymore. Um, and they haven't been fertilized and, and they've just been mined of nutrients by continually taking hay off and not putting anything back for, you know, 10 years or more. So in one of these depleted hay fields is some, uh, a demonstration that Paul did here in, in Delaware County a year or two ago. Um, um, at green up, we put on a total of 84, 28, 63. So basically we get our, you know, 75 to a hundred pounds of nitrogen plus the P and K that soil tests asked for. So we put that on a green up. And then after first cutting, we put on an additional 50 pounds of nitrogen, uh, which is our, our normal, uh, recommendation. Um, so again, you can see that, um, even if we just fertilize the first cutting, um, we got a significant, uh, response. Um, the other thing that we saw there is not just a yield response, but sort of the, we started to see, even in that first year, a, um, a transition to a higher percentage of the desirable grass and a lower percentage of the broadleaf weeds that we don't want or that are not as productive. So we're getting more yield and we're increasing the density of, of our desirable species, which should be helping us even more in future years. Um, even using 2022 fertilizer prices, we had about a hundred, a hundred dollars per acre benefit, um, from, you know, what was really a fairly high cost, um, uh, high cost fertilizer program for this field. Um, you know, we still had a hundred dollars more, um, value after we took the, the fertilizer cost out. So this is definitely something, um, you know, we're seeing more on some of our, our, uh, livestock farms and folks that are, um, you know, looking at, you know, making hay here for the, for the hay market. Um, you know, don't, don't forget about the P and K. Um, it definitely, um, because we've, we've had manure on almost every field for so long, we forget about, um, you know, that, that, um, that P and K's got to come from somewhere. So, um, I think I've, I've used all my time, uh, although we did cover a couple questions, be happy to, um, to do a few more. What Made of P suited for now? Well, uh, this is for the new hooks that we picked up after the last year, um,vie, kitabimiento, um, I think it's 640 years ago. It's very fitting, but it's about a little short here on the welcome-up brand model that I think So, um, you know, keeping up with the mild new dividend goals and plugins like, are your habitual rumors?ático betel意ot ikvist now看到 allemaal selKES-2019 Kanem ulection up It's been a VII자- Ray?
