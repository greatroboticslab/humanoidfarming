 Our rotation strategy is one year in high value vegetables or small fruit, in our case it's strawberries, and then it's going to be followed by three, sometimes four years where the ground's rotated out. So in effect we're only farming about 20 percent each year of our total 80 acres. I implemented this rotation back in 1987 and I know at that time some farmers thought it was crazy to be resting that much ground in an area where there's high land values. But over the years I realized some real benefits. We see pest and disease pressure remain at manageable levels, the soil fertility's gone way up, and stuff grows a lot better simply by prepping that ground in between those high value crops. I think it's important to note that that 80 percent that's setting fallow is not just laying out there idly growing weeds, it's being rested by planter design and it's all part of the total farm management picture. We're doing that to improve soil organic matter level and to put the ground or make the ground in much better shape so it's easier to grow bigger and better crops which each passing year. For us, when a vegetable crop comes out or small fruit crop, I'm immediately thinking three, four, five years down the road. And what I try to do is implement that rotation so that ground will be in much better condition. It starts by when the crop is finished simply leaf mulching. We spread municipal leaves up to six inches deep. That's the maximum amount you can spread in New Jersey by law. Those leaves are worked in the following year. We then plant either hay or sudex. The hay or sudex will stay in for two to three years. We then plow that out and we go back into rye or rye vetch and then back into vegetables once again. So at the end of that time, literally that ground is supercharged. It's ready to go. Hay is a significant part of our rotation. We grow both timothy and orchard grass on the place. I prefer orchard grass because it's a little more drought tolerant. One of the advantages that I see is it's good not putting a plow on the ground for three years. You can really enhance your soil structure through the rooting action of that hay crop. You'll never get rich growing hay, but there is a significant horse population in the area now. These are pleasure horses and there's a waiting market for good, high quality hay which we can provide. It's a source of income for you when that ground is being rotated out.

Cover crops are an integral part of sustainable agriculture because of their role in soil stewardship, pest management, and crop rotation. While many vegetable farmers in the Northeast use cover crops, typically the practice is limited to small grains for preventing winter soil erosion. This video features ten experienced vegetable farmers from five states, explaining how they use cover crops in more innovative ways. The farmers describe which species of cover crops they plant and how they are managed. Viewers can decide for themselves whether a particular practice is suited for trial on their own farm.
