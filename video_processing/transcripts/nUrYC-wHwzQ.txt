Howto & Style
 Okay, so this impresses and terrifies me. They've genetically modified an avocado to grow a lime inside it. And by they, I mean the GMO for Change organization. But that's not all. They've managed to grow a clove of garlic inside the lime. This is not for sale. It's a demo of the tech. And I'm kind of blown away. And also I feel weird.
