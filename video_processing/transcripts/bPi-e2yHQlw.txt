 welcome back mid 10 y'all well we finish up valentine actually end up with 1152 1 152 bales on the uh cabal to batter so i told you guys i would do a belt better review into the year so let's start off by getting out and looking at our setup so so people new to channel who found this through other means are looking at this baler i just want to make sure you guys know what setup we run we run a 2090 case i think it's on a bb 4160e that's bather i bought in uh into march of 2023 so i got it into almost the beginning of spring this year so end of winter beginning of spring i got it from kubota we did not have a bather you can go back and look at our 2022 baling uh or hay uh section and see we ran our uncle my uncle's john deere silage bather we ran we built enough hay last year to get to be where we needed a bather to because we're running trying to run his too much put too many bells on his so we decided to buy a better share so what we were looking what i was looking for was an entry level baler that was affordable kubota at the time had a deal of zero percent down uh zero percent interest for five years and talking to a couple other guys that i know locally i know one guy that's running kubota better last two years i know a guy i know a guy who had kubota tractors no one used a couple kubota cutters and they were real big on a kubota insurance uh recommended kubota insurance recommend you finance it so i get the kubota insurance kubota insurance were so good we put a thousand rolls on this bower this year have had no major issues out of it's ran pretty good i want to get you unhooked and we'll do a walk around and we'll go over the issues i had with this year what i like about it what i don't like about it and a couple things i've done to it to make it more user friendly for me so what we have here is a bv 4160 e kubota this is a common model entry level baler again i bought it because i needed an entry level baler it has a hydraulic pickup on it right here so it's hydraulically picked up and down that is one of the reasons i bought it i've run a hydrolog pickup on my uncle's john deer by the last three years i think he's had that better once you go to hydrolog pickup it's hard not to have hydrolog picker pickup the uh it came with a set of narrow tires these are what size are these these are 11 these are 11l 15 sls these are narrow tires i don't like the narrow tires i did not give me any trouble this year i was afraid they would being there i afraid the tractor i'm afraid the better sink down some of some of our fields because they are some are a little softer than others but i actually didn't uh so i was impressed that the top trailer didn't sit down this baler does not have a net wrap option i didn't want a net wrap option i just want a string all my string goes up here i can hold six bundles one two three right here would be your if i'm looking at the better left side and one two three would be your right side and actually i've been able to put four bells of string here i run a an island based string and i can shove a fourth for each side here if i really need to all day long this right here i know you're looking at this thing well that thing will hold string there this doesn't hold string there that just holds it until this closes this bar right here on this lid is actually what holds the string in place that's what holds the string in place is that bar so this this is just hitting their way tying it up the marker wheels you know as i have green and white here i'm not too happy with these wheels uh gray and white is what they come with they come with gray and white and they show up really good at the beginning of day as you get in on the day especially day where you're knocking out a lot of rolls yesterday i bailed a hundred and thirty rolls slow i could run more i haven't run slow yesterday a lot of hay you can go back and watch the previous video on that about 130 rolls yesterday those wheels were really dark gray from all the dust so these wheels are gray when each wheels turn gray but dust these white lines here blend in and you can't see them they just blend it's too hard to see when the wind is being dusty and stuff it's hard to see when this is spinning so i come back and paint these green that's just a green color it stands out good that green will actually get darker this gray gets darker and the green gets darker so you still have a contrast in there but that white it blends in you can't see it good the time mechanism on this batter is different uh this bio ties from outside to center and then outside the center okay so you have your arms here you run here to here on one and same thing on the other side they do not cross i like to tie so far uh first hay cutting i didn't have it set right i wasn't putting enough string on it you need a little bit of extra string on the outside edge because if you break one on the outside edge moving it he snapped one he start pulling it off your unrolled half that bell and we bailed about 500 rolls the first cutting and i unrolled two out of 500. not unrolled but i guess pulled half the string off too so second cutting i've come back and just i put a little more string on it just to limit it off to knock that out with that being said also this it's that is why i paint these green because these are critical right here if one of these quit moving and you're not putting string on half that roll it may stop on one roll so since it ties from here to center if it quits running here you're still tied from here out in that roll next row if you're not looking you'll untie you won't tie from here to here at all you're gonna have that bell unrolled and not not tied i mean so it's critical to keep eye on your string i just let's cook it and while i just took a rear rear bend it down so i could see the see the wheels in the rear view mirror and so i can see my hydrochic pressure on the baler so hydrochic pressure is here that's your pressure sitting on the baler so you can sit how tight you want the baler that way i can see that and i can see uh my string going because you see here now you see with it down you're only seeing top quarter which is fine from the track track after you're sitting a little bit above it so i can see that fine if you do get a better recommend putting different colors that's white on there just if you're not running a lot of bells ain't gonna give you trouble wipe it off every day but if you have days where you're hitting 75 80 bales you need to have a different cover color on there i think i had two bales this year well i painted halfway through the second cut and i had two bells before that i missed because i had that white i i missed it safety feature wise for this one you have two lockouts for the gate you have a hydraulic lockout and then you have a manual lockout to lock your gate out uh both are handy both work pretty good no problem with that the grease fittings are marked pretty well so they're marked pretty good through here it's easy to grease there are a set of grease fittings on the bottom under here there's some grease fittings on those silver brackets on there and one uh on this bracket right in here now those you can take off this shield here which is one i don't really like i know why i could vote did it but i don't like i don't like this shield being bolted on i know what's there it's both don't because it don't rattle it's a good tight shield but it's got grease it's got grease fits behind it and to grease this i think those are 20 hour grease fittings maybe so every three days to grease those you got to take that shield off really grease it now you go another way with it what i do is i just lift the gate up here lock the gate out lock it out and then i can reach out there and grease those fittings to get around that again if you got grease fits behind it design engineering issues i really would i made it's personal preference i would like a clip just to be able to get that shield on and off i mean it's got slots holes so you got to take the bolts all the way off it's just slotted it's just aggravating having to get a wrench out to get to it and again maybe a personal preference that's that's why i just don't like it when you look at the other side one thing i really like is this chain that's a good heavy chain that's your main drive chain i have not seen a drive chain that heavy on a bother around here john deere chain chains were not heavy that's a heavy chain that's your main drive chain i like that chain i like his tensioner system here i put 1200 bells to this bother and this tensioner system is holding it i've checked a couple times i have not had a retention that that the mother we've had in the past you run 500 rolls through it you want to start tightening chains up and checking chains i have not had tighten that main chain up it's been fine the whole time uh from checking it again same grease fittings over here grease fittings are marked pretty easily to see them uh pretty easy to get to them all here's your main computer for the thing this thing runs a focus 3 monitor now focus 3 monitor i've talked about in other videos is a good monitor i have no problem with the monitor the problem i have is i'm used to run a john deere monitor john deere monitor and the focus 3 monitor are not the same monitor they're different monitors well it's like taking android phone and going to the iphone both work great it's what you're used to so the first season this you're cutting with it took some getting used to getting used to the monitor i like to monitor i have no problem with it i said it's just me getting used to the buttons getting able to use it so on the focus 3 there's a couple things on it that the common model doesn't have i wish you'd have but again i didn't buy uh a premium bottle economy with the comet doesn't have the uh steering direction which tells you if you're building if you need to go to the right or left with the bell because you're you're not level you don't have it and in thick hay and medium sized windrows that's not a problem you run tractor straight and you don't have a problem with it real thin hay you'll get a lot outside the bell uh but what we run this year we run i don't know we've had just a few fields that were really thin hay not many so it really wasn't a problem again i'd like to have it it's not on the common model uh next bather we upgrade to we'll have that option on there let's talk shear bolts it comes with a couple spare shear bolts here on your pickup so you got it had four you know it's only have two now i broke two there is a gear back here behind this plate here right down here and that's your shear bolt for your intake very easy change uh you can go back to the last video i just made i don't know what title of it is yet because i'm still making it but go back to the last video in the hay village in the hayfield uh you see me change the shear bolt out it's pretty simple change uh trick is just pick your intake up so you can turn the gear change real simple it takes you longer to get the shield off and get the bolt out of holder than to put a bolt in there and put it back on 17 millimeter bolts here that's 17 that's 10 millimeter bolts and then it's 10 millimeter shear bolt there is uh one grease fitting behind this spot here that i don't like on this gear there's a double pulley on your your in your pickup down here just pick up at the grease fitting in the center joint of that one there so it would be here let's pull it down here you have to get this off to get to that uh that's i think that's a 40 hour grease so it's once a week racing that's the one i don't like you can't get to it with you can get to it sometimes if it's set just right with the back of the batter open sometimes but it's better sometimes so i get shield off so you gotta get the shield off to get that i don't that's on a grease fitting i really don't that frustrates you when i try to grease it it's that grease fitting there pickup on this thing i like a hydrolog pickup love the hydrolog pickup picks up good it's got a lockout on it it's got a lockout on the hose here so you lock it out when you pick it up so it won't go won't go down i ain't going down the road uh your guide here what i've done is i've set my guide up a little differently than a lot of people you can adjust this guy height up and down go back to my last video and look and i'll explain more some adjustments i made to the guide and the reason why you get in real thin hay you want this guy to sit a little lower probably because the guy to actually spread the hay out they'll spread it out across and makes you gonna eat a bale easier you run it too low on thick hay and you will plug the intake up on this thing last video explains that too and that's aggravating uh it's plugging intake up it's not that bad if you intake plugs up take off your guide which is this clip here then on the other side and then pull this off you have a fancy little rake that comes with the bowler right here so you got a lake raking here pull your rake out which will reach back up and take take rake it out put your guide back in there and it should be no problem with that being said if you have a big pile in there and you got a lot of pressure on this here you'll have a pressure against your stop right here moving your pressure against your stop right here and that guide will come off easy these are 17 millimeter bolts what you do is take one of them off your guide slides off put it back on there on adjustments of this i've got this thing set loose so it will flex up they're rock up and down so it's actually picked up a little bit because the intake's picking it up right now so you see it sitting on intake again because the intake's up but i've got it so it will push the hay down but also flexes back up when i get a big wad in so don't jam it up keep your wind rolls narrow with this thing i run my rake two inches narrower than a pickup i think that's why i got set to maybe inch half narrow pickup you need to keep your wind row a little narrow because these tires right here these tires uh i'm not really fond of the tires yet i don't i don't know if i don't like them i'm just not fond of them it's a give or take i mean they did a good job holding pickup up problem is you get in a wide windrow grass will go under a tire hold it down and then it will not feed up into intake you'll get it'll hold here and be held under here and it'll slowly start to jam up and jam across the intake frustrating uh not really bad in regular grass hay i fought it in uh johnson grass you get that johnson grass hay which is real stiff i'm sure sudan would be the same way but johnson grass was a pain because real stiff it was real tall this year and i fought with that because you're going johnson grass hanging out wide from rake you couldn't rake it up good it'd get any wheel you jam the corner up and you work your way across and the next thing you know your intake's jammed then you're digging out to counteract that i figured out yesterday in the last video i know i keep saying last video but i'm working on finding tricks and tips and tricks for this thing uh the last video i didn't run my intake on the ground now intake set to run on the ground i run these wheels about about a half inch off the ground i just watch them i make sure you say about a half inch on the ground that way when the hay was wide and it would run out here this wheel would not hold it to the ground that intake would still grab it and pull it in and pull it up under the wheel that worked really good yesterday i still picked up every bit of hay in the center now some of the hay on the edge that's under wheels i didn't pick up but it's too wide in reality i do like the uh kubota hitch which is a swivel hitch i like it better uh that john there by the way he's running john everybody's got a solid hitch on it this one don't this better then it allows that better to flex a little more it don't shake his heart it don't shake a tractor it it pulls smoothly across the field that rotating hitchhike i do like that hitch a lot i guess i guess the final question is jesse are you happy with the bowler yeah i'm happy with you to do everything you want to do yes and let's be honest about it it's an economy model so i'm not gonna talk bad about it being economy model that's what i bought i'd like to have other options it's not going to because it's not a premium it's economy i'm fine with that for entry level baler it's been a solid by this year it's bailed everything i wanted to with it all in all in the day if you're looking at kubota baler and a common model entry entry level baler this is a good better get you in the market uh it'll get you there it runs good now i've bailed grass hay with it i haven't bailed wheat straw with it i haven't bailed corn stalks with the only thing i've bailed is grass hay so that's the caveat for it i've run grass hay in this all year well that's my review and again that's one main opinion other people have other opinions you know what opinion is like everybody's got one that's mine any questions drop them in the comments below uh or a thumbs up video i appreciate it hit that subscribe button if you enjoyed it nobody follows along uh you can go back to uh i'll try to throw a link in here a little bit you can go back to previous you can go back to uh you go back to 2023 hay cutting and go through all the stuff we went through this bather i do go through some different settings in different ones about setting the monitor how i set the monitor stuff like that so that's in there appreciate you guys joining us as always good lord willing we'll catch you on flip side till next day so
