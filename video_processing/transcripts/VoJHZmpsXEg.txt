 When a seed is planted in the ground, there's this tiny baby plant inside of it just waiting to grow. As moisture seeps into the soil, it eventually reaches the seed's outer shell. The seed then absorbs this water, which causes it to swell and eventually crack open. This process gradually turns the seed's nutrients into energy. And with this energy, the roots stretch down into the earth and the plant grows upwards to seek sunlight.
