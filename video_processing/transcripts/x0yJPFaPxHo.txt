 If I have $15,000 to my name, how do I start farming? Well, I'm going to- All right, to the chalkboard. Yeah, no shit, we need a whiteboard. You're going to need more money than that, probably, to start farming, I would say, at a large scale. There's so many different little sections of agriculture that are getting developed. We just talked to a guy the other day that's helping a young farmer that's growing mushrooms in a warehouse. And he's selling these mushrooms to people and he's making a killing. Like, I think an interesting sector is industrial ag in urban areas, like growing mushrooms in a warehouse, like vertical farming. Micro greens. Micro greens. I mean, there's so many little things like that that I personally don't know a lot about, but I'm sure the upfront costs of those, they're probably smaller than trying to do corn and soybeans here in Southeast Iowa or wherever you're at.
