Howto & Style
 Stop planting beans in the middle of your raised bed. Bush beans take up hardly any space in the kitchen garden. The trick is to plant them on the outside border of your raised bed garden, not in the middle. Let me show you how it works. We set up this kitchen garden. We filled this raised bed with tons of plants and then after everything was inside the bed, we added a few bush bean seeds right alongside the edge of the garden. Within six weeks, this is what these bush beans have turned into loads of beans without taking up any room on the interior of the raised bed.
