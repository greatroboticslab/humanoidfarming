 Hello, my name is Andy and welcome to my family's farm. We're located in South Central Illinois, Mattoon to be exact, just 45 miles south of Champaign-Urbana, the home of the University of Illinois. Go Illini! I come from a long line of people like me, stewards of the land, fighters of hunger, caretakers of creation, but you can just call us farmers. My ancestors found home in the Paradise Township of Coles County in 1847. That's 173 years of agriculture. Six, going on seven generations, have worked in unison with Mother Nature to feed the world from these same fields that we farm today. Our roots certainly run deep here and we are proud to call Mattoon our home. Although not every parcel or structure has stood the test of time, we are still surrounded by remnants of generations past. Our farm, which was once sprawling with livestock decades ago, now focuses its resources on producing row crops. If you're new to the channel, it's great to have you here.

Everyone do your part, go down and hit the like button because you're already going to be down there subscribing to the channel. Let's see what you guys can do. Okay, that's enough shop talk. Let's get to the main event, the reason you clicked on this video, the equipment. Tractors! Combine! John Deere! Yes! Today, I am going to be showing the machinery that is necessary for our farm to harvest the corn and soybeans that we have out in the fields, and also what we use to prepare the ground for next season. As you can imagine, harvesting crops from the fields is the most cumbersome part of the entire farming season, or at least hopefully it is because you're bringing in a bin-busting crop. Though, having too much grain is never a bad problem to have. Farmers are constantly engaged in logistical dance during harvest season. From monitoring crop conditions, coordinating equipment movement, to harmonizing grain transport, there is a lot to keep track of. Let's start with the heart of harvest, combines. Our farm utilizes two combines. The bigger of the two, the S670 boasts a 9-liter PowerTek six-cylinder engine, supplying the machine with 373 horsepower. It takes every bit of this power to operate the nearly 16.5 square feet of separating area inside the rotor. In high-yielding corn, this combine is easily capable of picking 3,500 plus bushels per hour. It doesn't take long at that rate to fill the almost 400-bushel power folding grain tank, though the 3.3 bushel per second unloading rate does help alleviate that bottleneck slightly. This combine is equipped with a power cast tailboard, allowing the chaff to be spread up to 30 foot in each direction, with individual adjustments available for each side. The primary focus of the S-series combines was an upgrade in ergonomics to benefit the operator. The cab has a very roomy view of the action below, with a very wide, unobstructed field of view. Did I forget to mention heated and cooled seats, along with a refrigerator? This combine also has the ProDrive transmission, a push-button, two-speed transmission that allows for quick and convenient gear changes to ensure quick takeoff from start and optimal torque at harvest speeds. The older horse in our staple is the 9670 STS combine. The 70 series combines were the predecessors to the S-series, and it shows from the abundance of similarities, especially on the mechanical side. The heart of the combine is the same, the 9-liter Powertech 6-cylinder engine. However, this one is only capable of 338 horsepower. Internally, this combine is almost identical, with a measured separating area of 16.5 square feet. The lack of power is certainly the limiting factor for this machine. Even with the comparable cleaning specifications, this combine is only capable of 3,000 plus bushels per hour and high yielding corn. Its grain tank is even smaller, with an extended storage capacity of only 350 bushels, though the unload rate is on par with the S670 at 3.3 bushels per second. One can certainly recognize the luxury of the S-series cabs once you step back into a 70 series. The view is much more obstructed for the operator, the cab is noisier during operation, and many of the other amenities are missing. This combine still makes use of a standard, lever-shifted, three-speed transmission. Don't let the looks deceive you though, the 9670 STS and the 70 series as a whole were some of the most loved and productive combines of their time. They can still hold their own against the new machines. Both of these combines are paired with John Deere 608C corn heads. These are 8 row heads with a 30 inch spacing to match our planters. The heads are non-chopping. With a width of just over 20 feet, they are also narrow enough that they can be left on the machine for road transport. It is the perfect size head for the 9670 STS, but 8 rows is almost too few for the S670. For soybeans, both combines will make use of John Deere's 630FD platforms. At a cutting width of 30 foot, the flexed drapers are capable of consistently and smoothly conveying the plant material to the feeder house while also being able to flex over moderate changes in terrain. For those of you that still run auger-style platforms, try a draper system out. You will wonder how you ever harvested soybeans and small grains before without one. The workhorses in our stable are three identical John Deere 9460R four-wheel drive articulating tractors. These tractors harness the power of the six-cylinder 13.5 liter Powertech engine to a tune of 460 horsepower, as their name indicates. These tractors make use of an 18-speed power ship for optimal torque and operator convenience. The cab of the R-series tractors offer more comfort than some modern cars. With a full, unobstructed view of the entire working area and power LED lighting on the outside, operators can work long hours without unnecessary fatigue. The four-wheel drives are the only tractors on our farm that are guaranteed to see action in both the spring and the fall. One of our 9460Rs is equipped with a power takeoff system to allow for operation of the J&M 1112 Extended Reach Grain Cart. This cart is capable of carrying over 1,200 bushels of corn when loaded to the brim, and the 1050 R32 tires help spread that weight out across the ground. The 20-inch bullet auger is capable of unloading an impressive 10 bushels per second. A skilled operator can have the cart emptied in under two minutes. At those speeds, even a minor mistake can be a major mess. Just take my word for it. The cart is equipped with a five-point scale system, which allows the operator to calculate field splits, predict bend space, and calibrate our machines out in the field. The grain cart will be my office for this fall. The other two 9460Rs will be found attached to two nine-shank disc rippers. The 512 disc ripper and the 2730 disc ripper are essentially the same implement, with the newer 2730 having a hydraulic downforce rolling basket. Both measure at 22.5 feet wide. These are our earthmovers, making use of large disc gangs and massive shanks to cut, lift, and flip the soil to hopefully loosen it up and break down the crop residue. With the shanks running eight to ten inches deep in the ground, the 9460R tractors will burn nearly 24 gallons per hour to pull this iron through the ground. Thankfully, they hold over 350 gallons of diesel fuel. This is by far the most fuel-intensive operation that we partake in. One ripper can cover 10 to 15 acres per hour, depending on tillage depth and soil condition. The oldest of the two rippers, the 512, has been on our farm since the early 2000s. When harvest is completed, or at least to the point where the grain cart is unnecessary, the first 9460R will be unhooked and transferred to the Landall 7431VT Plus Vertical Tillage Disc. Vertical tillage is a fancy word for a glorified disc with a very subtle gang angle and a rolling basket. It quickly chops and disturbs the top few inches of the soil to aid in decomposition without causing unnecessary soil movement. Hopefully this results in less erosion over the off-season, and the finished product can allow for no-till soybean planting in the spring if desired. This implement has a working width of 34 feet and it can cover almost 35 acres per hour depending on tillage depth and soil conditions. Many farmers have gone away from aggressive methods like the rippers to a vertical tillage system as a means of cost reduction without any substantial yield impact. I will be running this Landall Vertical Till once my grain cart duties have concluded. Due to the flex rule of one of our 9460R tractors, I have the 8310R Front Wheel Assist on here to move it around. This tractor will serve as our backup if something goes wrong. At 310 horsepower, it is capable of pulling both the grain cart and the vertical tilt, but without the same enthusiasm as the 9460R tractor. Up next is our logistics fleet. The importance of trucks cannot be overlooked during harvest season. Even with two combines running, we can usually keep up with just three trucks. The two semis in action are both similar internationals, a 9400i and a 9200 equipped with a Cummins ISX and a Caterpillar C13 respectively. Both make use of an Eaton Fuller 10-speed automatic manual transmission. Both semi-sport jet 34-foot steel grain trailers capable of a thousand plus bushels of heavy corn. The third truck is an international 10-wheeler with a 20-foot aluminum dump bed. The heart of this truck is an international 466 engine working in unison with an international 10-speed transmission. This truck may only be able to hold 600 bushels of corn, but its flexibility is unmatched. It allows us to make use of our older shorter on-farm scales as well as back up to our grain augers without having to use the drive-over pit. We also have a handful of trucks in storage, but I'm not going to mention them in this video. In order to fill our grain storage, we use two identical Wheat Heart 130X 74 augers. These 13-inch diameter, 74-foot long augers can handle over 11,000 bushels per hour when enough power is turning the screw. They can easily reach the top of our tallest bins while still remaining transportable. The augers are equipped with swing-away, reversible side dumps to unload into. We utilize an additional Batco drive-over conveyor to allow our semis easy access to the dump. This simple system lets our auger swing-aways remain in a fixed position while loading and also reduces the amount of workload for our drivers. The two tractors that will power these augers are a John Deere 7800 and a John Deere 7330. Both tractors are in the 150 plus horsepower range and capable of moving our grain at a satisfactory pace. The 7800 is not pictured in this video because it was still hooked up to the Batwing mower at this time. As you guys can kind of tell, there's a lot that goes into growing corn and soybeans here in central Illinois. As you scroll through YouTube and Instagram and all the other places where you can see all this different beautiful machinery, it's important to note that there's a million different ways to grow successful crop. A large fleet of machinery like we have here on the farm is just a tool to get to the end result. Although our equipment is awesome and I love the green and yellow paint, farming is a game of details. This equipment just allows us to work with mother nature to produce an end result. You can find two farms just down the road from each other who have two completely different ways to produce great crops. You don't need the fanciest, you don't need the newest, you don't need the biggest. You just have to have the right mindset and the right education to be a great farmer. I'm not showing you our equipment and our farm as a means of bragging, I just want to inform you of what we use to get the job done. I'm sure you can tell that we take a lot of pride in our equipment and keep it well kept, but we take even more pride in this ground we stand on right here. 173 years my family, the Dole family, has been farming here in Coles County, Paradise Township. It takes more than just fancy equipment to build an operation. It's blood, sweat, and tears. I'm not going to pretend to you that I haven't lived a very fortunate and privileged life on our farm. My dad, my uncles, my granddad, my great granddad, and all my forefathers worked very hard, blood, sweat, and tears to grow this operation into what it is today. As you guys may know, farming has not always been glorious. It hasn't always been flashy. It hasn't always been romantic. It's a hard tough way of life. It's easier for the people of my generation and I'm very thankful for those who came before me that laid the foundation for stuff like this. If you made it this far in the video, I just want to extend my gratitude. I put a lot of effort into filming all this so you guys could see our farm.
