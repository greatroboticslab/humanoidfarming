 These are the top five fruits that grow in my backyard. Number five is Cecropia. This fruit is also known as gummy worm fruit and it tastes like figs and mashed kiwi. Number four is papaya. There's nothing like a homegrown papaya. So sweet. Number three is Roxburgh fig. This is the wild jungle fig that tastes like raspberry jam. Just look at that color. Number two is praying hands banana. Praying hand bananas have a unique flavor and a unique shape. All of the fingers are fused together and the flavor is like marshmallows. And now the best for last, sprouted coconuts at number one. We have mature coconut trees that are constantly producing sprouted coconuts. Look at that spongy interior. It's like nothing else. And when you dip it inside of the emulsified fat, amazing.
