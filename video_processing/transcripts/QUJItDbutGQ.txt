Science & Technology
 Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our event today. My name is Prijesh. I'm the director of strategic partnerships at Ears Data Analytics. I'll be your host and speaker for today's webinar on the topic, Agritech Solutions for the North American Market. I'm also accompanied by Kate. She's joining us from the chat section as a moderator. You'll find the chat section at the bottom right corner of your screen. And before I proceed, I would like to know from you if you can see me and hear me well. Please let me know with a yes or no in the chat section. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you for the feedback. All right. So during the webinar, I'm sure you'll have some specific questions. So please feel free to write them in the chat section. We'll be more than happy to answer them for you. We'll have a dedicated Q&A session at the end of the webinar. So we'll select some good and interesting questions from you and we'll answer them in detail. So I will start with a slide on the agenda for today's webinar. So I'll quickly go through this agenda of today's webinar. So we'll have a clear understanding of the presentation and a good webinar experience. I will start with the... First of all, I'll start with a brief intro on EOS data analytics, like who we are, when did we start our journey and the strategic direction that we are heading to. Followed by the outline of our products and solutions for the agriculture industry. I would also like to share a review on the agro market in the US and Canada. I'll talk about the opportunities for satellite database solutions and the challenges. Then a rundown on the satellite technology and data on how they are effective on solving the existing issues in agriculture industry. This will also be a curtain raiser to the main topic in our agenda today of custom solutions, which are developed by our own R&D department. Our R&D department consists of scientists and engineers who are specialized in using satellite imagery analysis and advanced technologies like machine learning techniques, AI modeling, and big data analysis to develop interesting and unique solutions for the agriculture industry. And finally, I would also like to speak about our upcoming satellite constellation project, EOSSAT, followed by the QA session, UNA session, which will be for about 10 to 20 minutes. And during that period, we will pick out the most interesting questions from you and try to answer them. So EOS data analytics, we are a privately held company with headquarters at Menlo Park in California. Our main products are web-based platforms used based on satellite data. At present, we have more than 200 employees located in the US and different locations in Eastern Europe. Our research and development efforts are backed by a group of 15 scientists who lead the R&D department. The knowledge base and the techniques developed by them are used for providing solutions for various industry verticals. Our core expertise is in agriculture and forestry. This enables us to partner with different, I would say, different business entities and government institutions and even scientific organizations and meet their business, educational, and research needs. This time series diagram perfectly explains our journey. So you can see that our company was founded in 2014 by Max Polyakov, who is an international entrepreneur and investor known for developing successful businesses around space technology and IT. Initially, we started with development of platforms, which today form the supporting system of our current products. One of them, for example, EOS storage. It provided cloud infrastructure for storing and obtaining instant access to thousands of terabytes of Earth observation or GIS data. Then in 2016, we came out with the LandViewer platform that provides on-the-fly satellite imagery processing, very useful for GIS researchers. Using the experience from our first commercial product launch, we confidently launched the crop monitoring platform, which is a comprehensive farm management solution available as a web-based platform. Then in 2018, our R&D team got a breakthrough that enabled us to develop unique deep learning models, or I would say machine learning models, which would be used in classifying fields and its boundaries according to the crop type, clusterize fields based on a particular dataset, mask irrelevant objects on a satellite images, and for further development of custom solutions like soil moisture data analytics and crop yield forecast. This November, we are looking forward to the launch of our own satellite constellation. That's our strategic direction until 2025 to achieve complete control over the satellite data production and enhance the data quality provided through our products and solutions. With the first launch set to be in November, we'll also become the first company to launch a satellite constellation fully focused on agricultural needs. A quick overview through our product offerings, the solutions and the services that we offer to the customers in agriculture industry. So our product offerings include the crop monitoring platform, and to start using it, you need to have a subscription purchased. The data available over the platform can also be extracted through API route. The platform uses satellite data to provide various agrodata analytics that helps its users to detect crop health and governing factors that affect farm production cycle. Therefore, it helps in increasing crop yield and also reducing input costs. The platform also provides other tools to track weather, optimize nutrient application, and enhance farm operations with features that save operational time and resources. And one more additional information is that the platform can also be customized as a white label product with your preferred color, company logo, domain name, and standard features to give it your business identity. At the moment, crop monitoring platform is used by around more than 735,000 growers and farmers in 195 countries. That's about 21 million hectares of farmlands covered through this platform, meaning that's the amount of area that is processed or analyzed with the help of crop monitoring platform. And also, as I mentioned, we have the capability to develop and provide custom solutions. That is what we are going to focus on in today's webinar. So we have successfully delivered projects based on custom solutions to some of the customers, as you can see here at the bottom, to the World Bank buyer, and even like food production or sugar processing companies like Ryzen. Now, I would like to give you a quick rundown on our understanding and our observations on the US and Canadian market, the agricultural market in North America. We have been seeing an upward trend in the US and Canada when it comes to accepting innovative technologies, whether it be in farm equipment, crop protection chemicals, and even farm management practices. One of the positive effects has been an increase in the establishment of agricultural cooperatives that are appreciating the use of precision agriculture technologies and computer data to increase their output and provide more profits to their members. Even food production companies are embracing the use of technology to let go of traditional farm practices and introduce a system of food traceability. These developments are creating a bigger demand among the agricultural enthusiasts to understand the agricultural land use and the related data to implement better strategies to increase the farm productivity. Although these market observations imply the increase in data analytics, the usage of data analytics, but it goes without saying that the biggest challenge is still having an expertise and understanding of data analysis, which I personally believe is at the core of the digital transformation process. We work around satellite technology and we understand the very benefits the earth observation data brings to our customers. Farmers, food producers, and even governments and agricultural policy makers gain a lot of insights to help them make better decisions. Farmers, food producers, and other companies, and other companies, are also the preferred solution for tackling issues of climate change and food security in the shortest possible time. With the analysis of satellite imagery, we are able to provide valuable information on crop development, land use, crop rotation practices, possibilities of drought, soil moisture, and even soil degradation. At a larger scale, satellite data helps in preventing a region's agricultural output, improves supply chain planning, and also mitigates food shortage crisis and food wastage. Now I will dive into our custom solutions on how these solutions are processed, what kind of techniques we use to generate an output. I will start with the crop classification solution. Crop classification is also known as land cover classification or land use mapping and even crop type mapping. So it involves classifying the land surface according to the type of the crop growing there with multi-temporal satellite imagery and deployment of machine learning approaches. Crop classification is also known as a neural network scheme. We also call them as neural network scheme sometimes. We are able to process the data analysis based on space and time series analysis. So here we use, in our methodology, we use the convolutional LSTM model, which stands for long short-term memory model as our preferred machine learning model. So this model, what it does is that it extracts the spatial features and then the temporal features for our crop classification process, the output that we intend to get from it. To make it easier for our customers, to make it easier for them to understand, we have defined the step-by-step procedure that is implemented to get a crop classification output. So it begins with a collection of ground truth data, which is mostly provided by the customer. And we use it for further processing of the data and for analysis and for checking the availability of any duplicates or like irrelevant data, which we should not go into the processing, further processing. So ground truth data, in other words, I can also say that it is the data collected from direct observation and measurement from the farmlands, the farmlands which needs to be classified in which we have to identify the crops growing there. So to ensure a better training of our neural network model, our machine learning model, the ground truth data must be at least three to five percent of the total area where classification is required. That data set also helps us to understand the crop calendar, like the basic information about that particular crop and the fields like sowing date and harvesting state date from the either from the expected ones from the current season or from the previous seasons. So. So this is an example of a typical ground truth data and excerpt from a ground truth data. This is from coming from a project on which we worked with Ryzen in India as they are known for sugar processing capabilities. They are known as a sugar processing company, the third largest in Brazil. They also have rights over certain farmlands in central part of India. So this is an example of a ground truth data that we were able to get from them, which we used for classification of sugarcane fields in India. So further, this data was used for identification and classification of those farms using our classification techniques, which I'm going to elaborate in the upcoming slides. So before we describe the techniques that we use for crop classification, I would also like to tell you that each of our custom solutions, we also require certain like input data from the client side or from the customer side. So when it comes to crop classification, we, the main input data that we require is the ground truth data. So, and along with that, we also need a sample of the AOI file, the area of interest file, which contains the geometry of the field, some sample fields from the region of your interest, where you need the crop classification or the crop type mapping to be done. So, and then we also need to take a sample of the data that we use for the field. So, the acceptable format of the AOI file is mostly shapefile or a KML file or a GeoJSON file. This data is very important for us to analyze the extent of image coverage, check the internal processing costs, and also quality of the final result. So, and then further, we also try to understand the characteristics provided within the ground truth data, like the number of points or the number of field points that you are providing to us in the ground truth data collection. That sort of information helps us to understand whether you have really provided as the 3%, the information on 3% of the total area or not. And we also try to get more information. We are able to get more information about what is the average size of farms or how is the distribution of farms in that area, whether it's a uniform distribution or scattered distribution of farms. And we are also able to understand whether there is a balance between the different data sets that you have provided to us, if there is any possibility or chances of error in the data. So, we are able to verify all this information. This is also a vital step that we do while we are processing the ground truthing data from you. The next step is, yeah, this slide was supposed to be the explanation of that step in which we assess the quality of the ground data, in which we determine or find out what is the distribution of the farms in the ground data that you have provided, the number of field points that are available in the ground truth data, those kind of inputs, we pre-process or we do a pre-qualification of that data as a second step. The third step involves the preparation of data sets. So, here we have three steps. That is, first is data upload. Second is data cleaning. And the third one is data optimization. So, it starts with data upload to our, like the data that we have received from you, the ground truth data, we upload it to our AI model, to the neural network model, the neural network scheme model by certain processes, like by searching, filtering, and receiving data. So, we can see that data from external sources. The external sources, meaning the sources, like the data that we have received from you. And afterwards, the data cleaning and data optimization is done. So, the basic difference between the two is that data cleaning is done to remove any data that may affect the quality of output. So, there is always a possibility of some duplicates or dummy values or even incorrect data formats in the ground truth data. So, we avoid the risks that may happen in the quality of the output by the process of data cleaning. After data cleaning, if there is any, if let's say there was a heavy removal of corrupted data in the data cleaning step, it may affect the accuracy of the output. So, in order to eliminate the risks of, you know, decreasing of the accuracy of the output, we carry out a third step of data optimization. So, this step is basically done to adapt the leftover data for problem solving and increase the efficiency of the analysis as an additional step. The fourth step that we do within the crop classification is once we are through with the preparation of data sets, we begin with data labeling and launch of the machine learning algorithms. So, this is basically the process of identifying the farms. This is the process at which we start identifying the farms and start labeling them to make it recognizable for our machine learning model to learn further learn from it. So, these are some sample screenshots from our data labeling process. As you can see, the fields, they have on the left side, the photo on the left side shows certain labeling of the fields, identification of the fields and labeling of the fields. And on the right, the image on the right side shows further classification on the basis of some color coding. We are further classifying the type, the type of the fields on the basis of the crop type, the crops growing in those fields. Then afterwards, as a fifth step, we move on to the classification results for the area of interest. We start getting results based on the total area of farms that have been classified, total area of farms that are not labeled, and total area of farms classified according to the crop types. And the next steps are involved in making the result detailed in terms of the level of classification. So, as you can see that in this sample image that I'm showing to you, it is actually coming from a project related to World Bank. It was a project for identifying all the fields and identifying the fields according to the crop type in the country of Ukraine, which is in Eastern Europe. So, this project, the whole purpose of this project was to ensure, find out whether there is any deviation in the land governance, in the agricultural land use, deviation of the land governance policies in the country. So, this particular example that you are looking at, this shows crop classification done at a field level. You can notice that all the fields are classified and identified according to the type of crops growing there. So, this output of the crop classification can also be provided in a vector format, which can be further integrated to one of the products that we have, that is crop monitoring platform. Or, it can also be provided to you in the form of a report, either as a PDF or a Word document. So, as I mentioned that this example comes from one of our projects with the World Bank. We had to classify all the farms according to the crop type. And this classification was done starting from the year 2016 until 2021. So, we are also able to do a classification over multiple years. So, even if it is for the current season or the previous seasons, we can also provide you the result at different frequency for different years. Then, yeah, this image further shows the additional information that we can retrieve from the crop classification if it is done for multiple years. As you can notice in that highlighted section, we are also able to identify what were the crop rotation practices being carried out, like what crops were being grown in one single field over different years. So, this is also an additional value added information that we are able to get through crop classification. If you have any questions related to the techniques, the methods that we use on our custom solutions, please feel free to share. Feel free to drop your questions in the chat section. And we will pick out those questions at the end in the Q&A session and I will be happy to answer those. Now, let's look at the key benefits of crop classification, like why crop classification is recommended. So, we identify four major benefits of crop classification. Number one, it makes the availability of a proper inventory at regional level. So, this helps in assessing the vegetation condition and comparison of results over different years for a particular region or a particular crop type. Second, it also enables data transparency for the government and international development agencies, like for example, World Bank that I referred to. And the projects related to those different governments and international development agencies so that a claim from a farmer can be verified. It also helps in developing a database including cadastral information, declared or unregistered land or even registered land and field parcel measurement. And lastly, it also helps in understanding where and what crops are growing in a region. So, this gives a vital information mainly to the commodity traders and even to governments to fix potential crops as the cash crops of the country and also to set price points and even consider some ecological measures like use of fertilizers. We also have some additional solutions that can be integrated with crop classification to make the final output look more valuable and also more accurate. A couple of added solutions are field boundaries detection and harvest status monitoring. Our field boundaries detection solution or the technology, it actually outlines all the fields in the selected area. So, once we have done the crop classification, identify the fields and the crops growing in those fields. Field boundaries detection solution, the technology used behind the solution, it enables identifying the delineation of all the fields in the selected area. So, this can be done for the current season and also for the previous seasons. And further, this solution allows us to calculate the total acreage of the field. We are also able to define what is the size of each field within the crop classification solution. So, to accomplish field boundaries detection, we mostly use Sentinel-2 images to segment the fields with a machine learning approach. The selection criteria of images is typically from the middle stages of crop growing season when the fields are best identified as separate objects. It is also possible to use higher resolution imagery to get more accuracy in cases when we have to detect fields of sizes less than 2 to 3 hectares. And then here as well, we still require a sample AOI file in vector formats, in shapefile or KML or GeoJSON file. If you have already provided us with a vector file for the crop classification, then we can use the same sample file as well. So, the output data type that we get from field boundaries detection can also be in vector format. And the level of accuracy that we are able to reach is up to 85%, 75% to 85%, which is really impressive. The main benefit of field boundaries detection is that you are able to, first of all, you are able to detect the agricultural land, detect the cultivated area, as well as align the contours of the farms to improve the accuracy of crop classification done on those farms. So, these are the main benefits of doing a field boundaries detection. The second, I would say, another value added custom solution that which we can also combine with crop classification is harvest status monitoring. So, this is done to, harvest status monitoring is basically done to detect the level of harvest of a farm at a given date or at a given period of its, of the crop growing season. For example, if you want to identify if your farm is completely harvested or partially harvested or not at all harvested. So, you can basically understand those kinds of insights through this solution. The input data that we require here are satellite images at a frequency of every five to 10 days at least. The satellite data could be either optical data or radar based data. Then constant field monitoring by doing a time series analysis of any vegetation index. Most preferably we use NDVI index, the time series analysis of NDVI, normalized difference vegetation index. A sharp drop in the NDVI would generally indicate that it is, the crop is approaching a harvesting stage. So, that's why we use the time series analysis of NDVI. And thirdly, an estimate of harvest status index is done by a formula which is used to calculate the harvest data in status index, which is the ratio between the harvested area and the total area of the field, giving us a metric to determine the level of the status of the harvest. So, this slide describes the average data of the harvest. This slide describes this process, the time series analysis of NDVI done on a, like a temporal, the temporal, the collection of temporal satellite images and the analysis of NDVI over a time series. And we are able to detect the presence of biomass with the help of time series analysis of NDVI and determine what is the amount of harvest or what is the biomass estimate and further calculate the harvest status index. Next up, yield prediction and modeling. It is also one of the most requested custom solutions that we are able to offer to our customers. So, yield prediction is done to estimate the amount of crops that will be harvested and collected at the end of a season. So, to calculate yield values, we use field level information that includes crop calendar information like sowing date, harvesting dates from the previous seasons, crop variety, soil profile data, and the prevailing weather conditions like temperature, precipitation, and so on. So, and those kinds of weather parameters from that particular region where the yield value is to be estimated. So, these information, these statistics are further deployed with the use of multi-level machine learning algorithms to estimate the amount of yield. So, we can estimate the yield either at field level or at a regional level, depends on your requirements. So, if you want us to estimate the yield value for each individual field at a particular region or a zone, we can do that. Or if you want us to estimate the yield value coming from a cluster of farmland in a region, we can also provide you the yield output for that at a regional level, at a larger level. The accuracy of our model, the model that we use to estimate yield is over 90%, which again, which also depends on the timing of the yield calculation. So, that is, if the yield estimate is calculated two weeks before the harvesting stage, then we are able to achieve a 90% accuracy. If the timing of the yield estimation is two months before harvest, then we are able to achieve an accuracy of up to 75% to 80%. In order to ensure an accuracy and efficiency in the process, we combine two types of yield prediction models. One is based on biophysical model, and the other model is based on statistical data modeling. Biophysical model starts with data collection from the area of interest. First, those data are mostly weather parameters, soil profile, phenological data. Further, a process called leaf area index assimilation is done by, with the help of remote sensing data, like with the help of the satellite imagery, to ensure accuracy in case the statistical data is missing or if it is not available. And further, a simulation of biological parameters, like total biomass, that is represented by TGAP, soil moisture, and total water consumption is done to estimate the yield. The obtained data is updated on a weekly or 14 days basis to increase accuracy. The key difference between the biophysical data modeling and the statistical data modeling is that the latter one uses a predefined machine learning technique, like for example, linear regression, random forest, XGBoost, CATBoost. These are some examples of most commonly used machine learning techniques. And the selected model is calibrated to the problem solving needs of the project. That is, in order to estimate the yield, we find out which is the most preferable machine learning techniques based on the amount of data that we have from the customer side. On a diagram, leaf area index assimilation, the process would look like this. As you can see, the multi temporal images of the fields, of the farmlands, of the crops are collected and modeled to observe different vegetation states with the help of leaf area index. It is one of the most commonly used index to estimate the amount of biomass present on the farmlands. As I mentioned earlier, all of our custom solutions, for all of them, we require ground truth data or a set of input data. So it's the same for the yield prediction and the yield modeling process as well. So these are some of the input data that we need to collect from your side in order to ensure that we are providing you a high accurate data, high accurate result. So starting with an AOI sample file, as I mentioned earlier, like with crop classification and field boundaries detection as well, we require an AOI file to analyze the quality of the field, like to analyze what is the distribution of field in that particular region. The format could be in any of these vector file formats like shape file or a KML file or a GeoJSON file. Next, we require statistics related to the crop in that particular AOI. So those statistics are related to sowing date, harvesting date, details such as crop variety, the soil profile in that region, the weather pattern in that region. For the current season and for at least three to five previous seasons. That is mandatory that we need at least data coming, the crop statistics or the yield statistics from the previous minimum three seasons from the historical data. The more the better. Then soil profile analysis for the AOI. If it is available with you, it would be helpful. Otherwise, we can also collect it from our sources. I would say the same for the weather data as well for the AOI. If you have any, if you're using any data, if you have a track record of weather data from a local weather station, or let's say any other different provider, you can share it with us for our reference so that we can cross check the data, validate the data that what we have for that particular region. Then we also would like to understand, we also try to understand more details like general characteristics of the farms or the fields in that region. Like information, like what is a, what should be, what is a distribution between the fields? What is the average size of the farms in that region? What is the smallest size of the farms in that region? Or let's say in terms of output, what is the spatial resolution that you require for the yield prediction? So whether you require, you want us to find out the yield estimate for each field, or you want us to estimate the yield value of the crop for at a regional level for a cluster of fields. And finally, what should the output look like? What should be the unit of measurement? Like whether you want to see the yield value, get the yield value in, in kilograms or tons of grain per hectare and so on. We have also collected a case study from a real project that we did for a Canadian insurance company. So let's have a look into this case study. We did this yield prediction project in order to, with the aim to provide, with an aim to provide a predicted yield data for, on every customer that our insurance company customer has, client has, to reduce their insurance risks. So here we started with the collection of field level information, all the statistics, the yield statistics, which are based on all those factors, the crop statistics, the soil profile analysis and the weather data. And we also managed to collect some publicly available data. Like for example, since the case study was done in this project, this case study is from Canada. So we were also able to get some data, like, like the ones coming from the sources. As you can see, the links provided to those sources. These are publicly available data related to soil profile, related to weather, and even the yield statistics from the previous seasons in Canada. So we were able to get some data data sets. By combining all these data sets, we were able to, we were able to combine all these data sets and free train our AI model to get some relevant outputs related to the yield value of certain, some selected crops. So we basically divided this project into three parts, as I can say, three tasks. So the task one, the number one task was to estimate the average yield of for six major crops on 20 farms and compare it with the actual yield report in the statistical data, the publicly available data. Those publicly available data were collected from the administrative units in Canada. So we were able to validate our calculated data with those actual yield data. So the table on the top right corner shows you the model yield, the calculated yield, and the actual yield. So you can notice the level of deviation and the graph below shows the same information to understand the level of deviation in a better way in a graphical, like with the help of an image. So the second task was to estimate the yield 14 days before the harvest of selected crops in order for us to assess the accuracy of the result. So the table on the right side, it shows the comparison of our calculated yield and the actual yield from the available statistics. We started seeing less deviation from the yield. As you can see that the percentage deviation from the actual yield and between the actual yield and the calculated yield is less now. The third task and the final one was to provide our customer with the crop yield forecast to understand crop rotation practices and reduce insurance risks. So that was the main goal of the project. So here in this table, you can look, you can notice the predicted yields for the calculated yields for those selected crops from three, from different regions. And you can see that the yield values are represented in the form of the units of bushel per hectares. So to increase the further, to increase the efficiency of the result, we used a technique called Jack knife resampling, which is used in, which is one of the most commonly, like one of the frequently used machine learning techniques to reduce the risk of like overfitting data. Like if there is any excessive data available in the crop statistics or the input data that we collect from the customers. And to further get an, if there is an over like, like excessive data available, then the, to further, get an average value of this, those data to make our yield estimation process simpler and more efficient. So from this project, we were able to find out that the harvest period for the target crops in Canada for our customer, for the, for our insurance sector customer, have a growth period that last September. And we were also able to determine the accuracy of yield prediction or the yield modeling technique that we use. So we found out that two months before the harvest, the result had an accuracy of around 82%. The accuracy increased as the harvest was approaching and it reached a level of about 90% two weeks before the harvest. The quick, the key benefits of yield prediction. If we understand from this case study and also the techniques that we use, the kind of output that we were able to achieve, that it helps in decision-making for harvesting operations, even to make decisions related to storing and even transporting the harvested output. It also gives us an indication of crop profitability. And if we consider on a larger scale, an opportunity to manage food security by helping agrarian countries, the developing economies, which are more dependent on agriculture and food industry to prevent the effects of drought and implement sustainable agricultural practices. Now it's time for soil moisture analytics. Soil moisture is also, is an additional agro data that's helpful in forecasting the need for artificial irrigation. Especially if you have a regional farmland with different crop growing seasons, there is a need to ensure that, you know, you, you must ensure that you are able to, the farmers or the agribusiness entities are able to get higher crop yield throughout the crop rotation practices. Also, soil moisture data helps in, helps financial services companies as well, like insurance companies to track soil moisture, to track the soil moisture readings, to further make better decisions on the insurance payouts. Soil moisture data, if we consider, it is known as the ratio between the volume of water in the soil and the whole soil, soil volume in percentage. Our custom algorithms based soil moisture calculation, the algorithm that we use to calculate soil moisture is provided, also provided as an integrated feature on the crop monitoring platform, which is one of our main products, and also provided as an integrated feature on the white label platforms. So for our platform users in US and Canada, we already have soil moisture percentage in your platforms. But for those who would like to expand their services in regions outside the US and Canada, it will be necessary to activate soil moisture analytics on your platform. So let's try to understand like what kind of techniques we go through, what kind of techniques are methods we carry out to provide you high accurate soil moisture data on this platform, on the crop monitoring platform. To estimate soil moisture content, we use data from satellites which are equipped with radiometers. So those are mostly like SMAP from NASA and sometimes AMSR satellites from the Japanese Space Agency, if there is a need to access archived data before 2015. We are able to estimate soil moisture at two levels, at surface level with a measurement depth of up to, from 0 to 7 centimeters, and at root zone level with a measurement depth of up to 70 centimeters. This measure is taken over a grid size of 250 by 250 meters per pixel, over a grid size like a land grid size of 250 by 250 meters. We are also able to achieve this accuracy with our downscaling techniques applied to the radiometer based data to bring the spatial resolution. So if you consider those satellites that I mentioned about SMAP and AMSR, these satellites provide us radiometer data based over a spatial resolution of around 25 by 25 kilometers and 36 by 36 kilometers. But with the use of our downscaling techniques, our own downscaling techniques, we are able to bring the spatial resolution of the satellite data, the radiometer data down to 250 by 250 meters. So in order to provide you better, like high accurate data, soil moisture data, we have the proprietary techniques to do that. As the radiometer is a type of sensor which is used to detect thermal radiation reflected from the land and to measure temperature without the need of contact. So this diagram perfectly explains how the thermal radiation measurement takes place. The thermal radiation of the land to be measured creates a radio frequency, creates a radio frequency radiation, which is actually measured by the radiometer's receiver. So the radiometer which is equipped in the satellites, SMAP and AMSR. Then further we apply different techniques, different scientific techniques to ensure that the observations are tuned, are customized to achieve higher accuracy and elimination of atmospheric effects. So some of the techniques applied are time series analysis of radar observation, the radar data observations collected from radiometer sensors. For further, for spatial disaggregation of radiometer brightness temperature. Then radiative transfer models to simulate and validate surface soil moisture content with some level of atmospheric correction of radar data. Then land parameter retrieval model to estimate the soil moisture from low frequency, dual polarized microwave measurements. This diagram, this image shows, explains the workflow of the techniques used. So as you can see that it shows us how the brightness temperature and the land surface temperature measurements are combined with soil composition data to calculate the soil moisture over a region of interest, the country or the region where you want the soil moisture data to be calculated at two different levels of root zone and surface level. Further, the calculated soil moisture data is validated by a comparison with actual soil moisture data, which is like the actual soil moisture data is collected from the local weather stations for validation purposes. So different mathematical analysis are done to validate the soil moisture further at the different levels. As I mentioned, we are providing the soil moisture data at root zone and surface level. So we are tracking those, validating those data with the help of mathematical analysis and different validation techniques to provide high accurate data over our solutions, over our platform. So we are tracking those, validating those, and the other methods. Now, why is soil moisture data or the soil moisture content necessary to understand or determine the crop health? So the main benefit of soil moisture analytics is that you don't have to physically be present at the farm to check the moisture level in soil. Sufficient water level is very important for crops development. Lack of moisture or irrigation can lead to poor yield, crop yield, and less chances of survival of crops. Our soil moisture data is a real indicator of crop health since the data is also calibrated considering atmospheric inferences from evaporation, water runoff, and groundwater. On the other hand, if you consider a case of having excessive watering in the field and the farmlands, it can lead to certain phenomena like root rotting and cutting off of oxygen supply, which results in destruction or destroying of the crops. Secondly, if we understand the practicality of having a soil moisture data calculated with the help of satellite imagery analysis and the scientific techniques, we can understand why you can rely on soil moisture analytics over weather station data. So our data, the soil moisture data that we calculated is mostly measured and not modeled. So in some regions, you may observe that the weather stations are separated by a distance of like more than 30 kilometers, 20 to 30 kilometers. Then if we think about it, then the farm data for the for the gaps between the stations, if you think of if you consider that, that you will understand that the data that you get from the weather stations, those are somehow modeled and not actually measured from the you know, at a field scale. That is one advantage that we have with the soil moisture data calculated with the help of satellite and the radiometer data. Another aspect is that the soil moisture data that we offer that we provide with the help of our like processing techniques that is scalable, meaning that the data can be measured in any part of the world. And it can be calculated also calculated for a large spatial area. With this, I finish the information, the processes related to our custom solutions. But as I mentioned in our agenda, I would also like to tell you about our EOSAT project, which is our upcoming satellite constellation project. I thought about sharing information about this project as well so that you can also realize that what are the potential benefits of these satellites to our Earth observation solutions. So EOSAT constellation is set to be the first of its kind designed for the needs of agriculture industry. The constellation will include seven optical satellites to be launched into low Earth orbit by the year 2025. So at the bottom, you can see a time series representation of the timeline of this project. We began with the system requirements and design review in 2020. The following year, we did the tests on flight and operations readiness. And in this year, in November, we are ready to launch the first satellite of this constellation. That will be EOSAT 1, followed by continuous launch of satellites until 2025 to reach full operations capability. After the first phase of the launch, we will ensure high revisit rate of satellites to cover all the regions of the world. And also a possibility to revisit a targeted area in any part of the world, in any country for special agricultural projects. With no doubt, this will enable us to have a complete control over the satellite data production cycle. With the use of our processing capabilities, our data processing capabilities, and a skilled team of data scientists, space scientists, engineers, researchers with economic background, in-house IT developers, business developers. We are sure of upgrading our custom solutions and also our main products, the off-the-shelf products with higher data quality and better than ever accurate business insights to our partners and customers. If I missed out on a point that we would be enhancing the quality of data, the kind of insights that we are able to offer through our products and solutions, then this slide will give you an idea about what are the kind of upgrades or the high-quality insights that we will be able to deliver once we start processing the data from our satellite constellation and delivering it over our products and solutions. So, one of the key characteristics of this EOSAT constellation is the unique availability of multispectral bands that will enable us to work on special projects that may require insights like recommendations and insights for better quality. Some examples are like efficient input management, disease and pest prediction. These are one of the anticipated feature developments that we expect to have once we have the data coming from our satellite constellation. The multispectral bands will also allow us to enhance the output quality of our custom solutions that we cover today, like yield modeling, yield forecasting, crop classification, detection of arable land, optimal crop production, optimal crop rotation plan, and so on. So, overall, we are looking at improving the decision support system for our customers using our platforms so that they will get precise recommendation in terms of like even other benefits like other insights like input application, like recommendation on input application, irrigation and crop health analytics. So, finally, I would like to say the name of EOSAT is synonymous with sustainability. That is what we believe. The technology upgrade that will allow us to offer more complex solutions like even like other solutions like carbon emissions measurement from soil. And this can be achieved with profitability at the same time by tackling and reducing the risks caused by like certain issues like carbon dioxide emissions from agricultural operations, excessive use of chemicals which leads to land degradation, higher energy consumption for agricultural activities, and even issues such as food wastage and ongoing food crisis in the world. And we can also say that in some regions developed economies, it could be an upcoming issue. And this could be an upcoming issue, food crisis could be an upcoming issue in most of the countries. So, I would like to close this presentation with this note that EOSAT, with EOSAT, we are aiming to align our goals with United Nations framework for sustainable development goals in agriculture. Those goals are related to climate action, industry innovation, clean water and sanitation, responsible consumption and production, end hunger and life on land. So, the basic problems that we are looking at the basic problems that we are solving with the EOSAT constellation, with the quality, the data quality that we will be delivering with the EOSAT constellation. All those insights and the input, the outputs that we will be able to get with EOSAT constellation will help us to answer or complement this United Nations six sustainable development goals. So, with this slide, I come to an end to this presentation, to our event today. If you have any queries or business interests with us, then you can reach out to us at sales at EOS.com with your request in the subject line. Or also, you can also reach out to me directly at my email address, which is shown here in the slide, vrijesh.total at EOS.com. Now, it's time for Q&A session, the last segment of the event today. Before we proceed with your questions, I will take a pause for a couple of minutes and ask our moderators to post the most interesting questions in the chat section. What do you see? It's time for Q&A session. It is time for Q&A session with your webinar Now, folks, want to run back to your screen of access, but the beginning of your presentation DLC is not np. As for Q&A session today, consider these words, you will find that the link . Take a pause for a few of these instructions because of the 10th structure of the AC II available. It has some help from Q&A session and access that, which is aEurocent, which does Madame C You can also post your feedback about today's sessions if you have any recommendations or suggestions. Apart from questions, you can also share those kind of feedback in the chat section. Can we have the list of questions posted in the chat section so that we can go through all together, like some selected questions? I'm picking one question from the chat section from Haruna Alums. Hi, Haruna. So his question is, are these tests paid for separately or part of the general package? Is a satellite able to monitor crops in arid or semi-arid regions? We do more of dry season farming here. So if you are referring to these tests or these solutions, custom solutions, yes, we do have to consider the costs and the efforts separately because as you can see, the level of the kind of input data that we require for these solutions, those could differ. So we have to consider all the process, all the data with a different consideration, with a different format and using different machine learning techniques. So if you are interested to know more about the, let's say, the commercial part of how the package is delivered to you, the solution package is delivered, please write to me and we can arrange for a call to discuss it further. Okay. So we have the questions now. So first question is a bulk of our farmers from Northern Nigeria are livestock farmers. Cattle rustling is at the center of banditry in Nigeria today. Is it possible to monitor livestock using satellite images now or in the future? Yes, it could be possible in the future, but right now our main focus or the prime focus is in monitoring crops, like crops, plants, or even trees, like tree plantation areas. But definitely it would be considered in our product development roadmap, or let's say solutions development roadmap, we would be considering services or solutions to monitor livestock as well in the future. The next question, how do you classify the mixed pixels of edge of the field when determining the crop boundary? Well, that's a bit, I would say a technical question, but I will try to, I'm not sure if I will be able to give you a hundred percent correct answer for this, but for field boundaries detection, we use a machine learning technique, which we simply call as edge detection technique. That technique enables us to also eliminate any, like this kind of scenario, like if we have mixed pixels or let's say duplicate values or duplicate field points, we are able to eliminate it using some of the techniques, some of the data cleaning techniques that we have. So, the third question, I think that was the one from Haruna, we already, I already answered it, but we can discuss more about it. Like if you're interested in connecting with us, then we can set up a call and discuss further. Okay, we have more questions. What is the level of accuracy guaranteed with crop classifications? So the level of accuracy that we are able to achieve is more than 90%, which is possible because of the machine learning techniques that we use. And as I mentioned, it also depends on the quality of the ground data, the ground data that we collect from the region where we need to do the classification. But using our, like defined, like our machine learning techniques, the algorithms that we have to, in order to generate an output for crop classification, we are able to achieve an accuracy of more than 90%. If it is also one more point to be added here, if the crop classification method is combined with field boundaries detection, then we can achieve even accuracy of even up to 95%. Another question, what are the data sources used in crop yield forecasting? So the data forces, if you are referring to the satellite imagery, that is the main data source that if you consider, like if we consider the different processes that we use for estimating the yield, the crop yield? Well, most commonly we use the data coming from Sentinel satellites, Sentinel-2, which is an optical satellite. In some rare cases, we also use Sentinel-1 satellite, which provides us with radar-based data, especially in regions where we have like long monsoon seasons in which it may not be possible for us to collect the data, the remote sensing data with the help of Sentinel-2 satellite. And again, one more factor that we consider is the average size of the fields, the farmlands. If it is less than three hectares in certain regions, then we do consider the possibility of using higher resolution images, which provide us satellite imagery resolution of up to better than 10 by 10 meter per pixel. Another question is, what is the minimum statistical data required to do yield forecast modeling? So the minimum statistical data that we require is, of course, from the current season, like we need to know what is the yield statistics or the crop statistics from the current season, and the yield statistics from the previous three to five seasons. So minimum is like you will have to provide us with up to statistical data, the crop statistical and the yield statistical data, which is the sowing data, the harvesting data from the previous seasons, from minimum three seasons, three previous seasons. We have plenty of questions today. So another question is, can you also develop custom vegetation index reports? Yes, we can do it. So as you notice in one of the custom solutions, which we recommend as a combination solution with crop classification, that is harvest status monitoring. If you notice there, we do a NDVI time series analysis. So what we are doing is basically doing an analysis of NDVI index over a multiple, like multi-temporal satellite images to find out what is the biomass estimate, how is the growth of that particular crop. So we can also generate report for some custom vegetation indices. Like there could be depending on your preference, like if you may like to have a custom vegetation index report for, let's say, LAI, leaf area index or green NDVI, for example, we can do it. So if you are interested, you can reach out to us and we can discuss further about what kind of input data we might require from you and what will be the efforts required to generate an output, a report. One more question is, can you add crop classification results to crop monitoring platform? Yes, you can. As I mentioned, crop classification output can also be delivered in vector format in the form of a shape file or in the form of a, let's say, GeoJSON file. We can provide the output in that format. So most probably a shape file would be recommended or shape file would be recommended, which can be further uploaded to our crop monitoring platform. And there you can visualize all the fields classified, differentiated according to the type of crops. Thank you for your questions.
