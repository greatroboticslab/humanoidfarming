 You may not know it, but now is the time to be thinking about blossom and rot, a common problem with tomatoes. While many people blame calcium content in the soil, the problem is almost always in how you water. In this week's Grow With Care, Bobby and Laura have the three best watering practices for terrific tomatoes. Well, if you've got a vegetable garden, 99% chance you're growing tomatoes. And do you know that one of the most critical things when growing tomatoes is how and when do you water? And so much depends on the growth stage that your tomatoes are in, the weather conditions, of course, and the soil type. So all those specifics play a big role. And this improper watering is really the biggest cause of blossom end rot for tomatoes, not calcium, like the Internet will tell you. Well, consistency is the key. Tomato plants thrive with consistent moisture. Inconsistent watering can lead to issues like blossom end rot or cracked fruit. And deep watering is so important. Ensure the roots receive adequate moisture by watering deeply but less often rather than just a quick shallow water more often. This encourages the plant to develop nice, deep roots. When you water is important. When you water is important. Watering in the morning helps prevent diseases by allowing the foliage to dry out during the day, reducing conditions conducive to fungal growth. And when you're watering, consider how old or young your plant is. A young seedling will require more frequent watering until it's really established its root systems, at which point you switch to that deep watering system. Weather conditions are the most, one of the most important things you should check. If it's hot 90 degrees and the wind's blowing, you may have to get that out there and do it more frequently than you normally do. And then again, if it rains, you may not have to do it as much.
