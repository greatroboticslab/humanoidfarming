 This is a food basket in the making. In the Sahel, we find an age-old water harvesting structure called the Half Moon. This simple structure has all of this capacity to store and hold this water until the water soaks down into the ground. But that's not easy to do in a desert because this region has what's called the drought-flood cycle. Nine dry months, the land becomes parched, and when the rains finally do come, the rain can't soak in, and it rushes down, and it creates flooding in lowlands. But the basic idea is that the Half Moon's laid out on a contour, and it's dug so it intercepts the water flowing down a slope during heavy rains. Ultimately, they allow for the deep soakage of rainwater into the ground. This is one of the best ways to improve food security because...
