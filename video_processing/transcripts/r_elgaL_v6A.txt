 I'm taking you somewhere most people never see, inside an Amish kitchen. No electric bill, no water bill, just this 70-foot windmill pumping water through the house. Forget your smart home. This wood-burning beast is the stove, microwave, water heater, and home heating system all in one. What you don't see is a refrigerator. While our modern kitchens are filled with gadgets we rarely use, this Amish family at Sunnyside Farm uses this summer kitchen to transform their harvest into colorful jars of security. This isn't stepping backwards. It's stepping away from what doesn't matter to focus on what does.
