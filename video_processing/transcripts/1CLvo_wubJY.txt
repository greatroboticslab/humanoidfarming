Howto & Style
 Temperatures are starting to drop now but it doesn't mean that the garden stops producing. Here are 10 veggies that grow over winter. Lettuce, garlic, onion, cabbage, snow peas, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, kale, broccoli and radishes. Most of these vegetables take from two up until nine months to grow so it's best to get them in as quick as you can now. If you have seedlings planted the better and think about where you'll plant your summer vegetables and make sure they don't overlap.
