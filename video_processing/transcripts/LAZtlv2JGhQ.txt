 Hey, how's it going everyone? Salman with aggada.com. Really quick, this is a mistake that I made early on when I was just starting out. So, there's a huge difference between garden soil and potting mix. Garden soil is actually what you'll use if you plan to plant directly in the ground. If you read the instructions, you're actually supposed to mix this with six to eight inches of the native soil. Whereas with potting mix, this is something that can go directly inside of a flower pot. And you don't have to mix it up. Now, if you just put garden mix in a container, you're going to have a lot of issues. It's going to be really dense and you're going to have a lot of issues with drainage. So, just keep that in mind. Potting mix is for flower pots. Garden soil is for your garden. Alright, thank you.
