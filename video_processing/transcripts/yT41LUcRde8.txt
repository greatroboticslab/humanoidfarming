 My name is Nolan Jarrell. I work for RDO Equipment Company. Do you have customers looking for an extended warranty program? Ready Plus might be an option for them. Ready Plus provides customers with a detailed inspection of the machine. When the recommendations of the inspection are completed, additional in-season extended warranty is granted. Ready Plus also provides machine expert alert monitoring to protect customers against major breakdowns before they occur, potentially saving customers additional cost and downtime. Additional hours of warranty are also available. If you have any questions about Ready Plus, please contact your aftermarket sales professional.
