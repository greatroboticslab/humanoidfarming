 And then tip number three this is where most people slip up especially if they've never grown carrots before you got to keep the soil What's up lazy dog fam hope all y'all are having an awesome day it is Thursday October 5th here in South Georgia and That means it's time to plant some carrots so on today's video I'm gonna give you three really good tips for planting carrots and then we're gonna get three different varieties Planted here in the raised bed garden, but before we plant our carrots I figured I'd give you all an update on some of the things we have growing here in the raised beds So we've got a third planting of summer squash here this tempest variety We've been getting some decent squash harvest off these but the bugs have gotten really bad in the last few days You can see they're turning some of those leaves into skeletons there I don't think I'm gonna fight the bugs too hard here because I've got a bunch of cool season Transplants in the greenhouse we can put in this bed So we're just gonna enjoy the squash we get out of here and then we'll plant something else And then right here we have some flash collard plants that have made an epic Comeback this is the first time I've ever been able to keep a collard plant in the ground for an entire year So these were planted last October October 2022 They look terrible throughout the summer, but they never bolted now that things have cooled off a little bit Hey, we've got collards to eat here. So this is pretty cool I may plant some more collards in here a new round Just in case something happens to these But man, I'm tickled to have had these in the ground for so long These collard trees are a good four and a half five foot tall Then we've got our Louisiana evergreen shallots which are just growing like weeds We need to split these up and spread them out pretty soon Our Egyptian walking onions are growing pretty well Starting to get some of those gaps filled in there. Not all these Popped or sprouted at the same time But it looks like we are eventually going to get a nice full bed here And then these potato onions are just growing ridiculously fast I feel like we just planted these and you can see they're already starting to multiply I think every single one we planted came up Got a nice full bed of perennial onions there And then a few days ago I finally received all those other varieties of perennial onions that I ordered They're hanging out in the greenhouse right now We're gonna get those planted soon and show you all the different neat varieties we've got Hopefully we'll do that on a video later this week And then the last thing I wanted to show you before we plant our carrots are these beautiful savannah mustard greens here Isn't that pretty a nice bed full of greens? We could harvest these right now as baby mustard greens But I think I'm gonna let them get a little bit bigger before I harvest them that way We ensure we've got a nice big pot full of greens So that's what's going on in the raised beds right now Still got a lot more to plant in here a lot more spaces to fill in But now let's talk about carrots. You may recall several weeks ago We did a big clean out here in the raised bed garden And we got some of these round raised beds ready to plant carrots as soon as the weather cooled off So in case you missed that video just a quick little recap of what we did here for these three round raised beds We had some marigolds growing in two of them and then nothing growing in one of them We cut those marigolds at soil level Got the plant debris out of here removed our little spider irrigation system Added some mushroom compost some coop grow fertilizer and some wood chip compost got it smoothed out And I have been watering these beds regularly The last couple weeks just to keep everything nice and moist and keep all my biology active until we're ready to plant carrots today Now I always get a little bit nervous when I say stuff like this but Carrots are one of those veggies that we always do well with I can't ever remember a time where we got skunked on carrots Now last year we did have some issues because the Arctic blast came in and basically just Leveled our carrots We had some nice lush green growth and it just killed it back to the ground They did regrow and we did end up getting a pretty decent harvest not my best ever harvest But a pretty decent harvest that was a once in every 20 years kind of situation So I expect this year to be much better So we've grown a bunch of different carrot varieties over the years a lot of different types of orange carrots We've tried several types of purple carrots and several types of yellow carrots And I finally kind of settled in on three varieties I really like They may not be everybody's favorite, but they're my favorite and I've got them right here So the orange carrot that I really really like it's called Miami There's another one called Bolero that I really really like as well But Miami nudges it just a little bit in my opinion So Miami is the one we'll be planting Then our yellow carrot is called Yellowstone Really solid performing yellow carrot And then the purple carrot we like is called Dragon I can't remember all the different names of the purple carrots we've grown over the years Some of them are really hairy and have a lot of roots on them They're just really hard to clean This dragon carrot isn't that bad about that and usually gives us some really nice looking carrots I think this one has an orange inside and a purple outside Now if you're new to growing carrots or haven't grown a lot of different varieties or colors I would warn you about red carrots. You notice we're not growing any red carrots I have tried to grow red carrots several times and they always underperformed I don't know if that's our climate or that's just a red carrot thing But I thought I'd mention that yes, they look really pretty They look like they'd be fun to grow, but from my experience they'll always Disappoint you. So now let's talk about our top three carrot planting tips Now we've done a lot of carrot videos in the past some more detailed than others for this video I thought we'd keep it simple with three Really good tips and then we'll demonstrate some of those tips when we plant our carrots in a minute So here we go tip number one You got to make sure your soil temperature is right and this specifically applies to planting carrots in the fall for overwintering Like we do so ideally you want your soil temp in the 70s Now I haven't stuck a probe in those raised beds to see what my soil temp is But I know if we're getting highs in the low to mid 80s and lows in the low 60s at night That our soil temp should be in the 70s. We're supposed to get even cooler this weekend So it should be perfect time for planting carrots Number two you got to plant them really really thick I don't think I've ever planted carrots seen them sprout and thought man I might have planted those too thick There's really no such thing as planting them too thick in my opinion They'll move each other out the way we don't thin ours. We like to plant them really really thick That's why when I buy carrot seeds I always buy at least a thousand or two thousand seeds A little pack of a hundred carrot seeds is not going to do a whole lot for you unless all your planting is a little bitty pot So we're going to plant most of these packets in each of those raised beds because we like to plant them super thick Now it is important to note that planting really thick like that will give you variable carrot sizes You'll get some smaller carrots some bigger carrots That's just the way it goes if you want all equally sized carrots Then maybe you should take a little more time with your planting and try to space things out more evenly But we just like to scatter our seeds we take the little carrots We take the big carrots we take whatever we get and then tip number three This is where most people slip up especially if they've never grown carrots before You got to keep the soil moist for seven to ten days after planting carrots can take up to two weeks to germinate sometimes and Unlike say corn or beans where you can just water them in one good time and then in a few days They'll sprout you got to keep that seed bed moist Consistently moist for seven to ten days. I I overhead water mine every day sometimes twice a day after planting to make sure I get good germination Yeah, we'll be running the drip system to water some of the other beds in this plot But I also water them by hand because I don't never want that Seed bed to dry out while those carrots are trying to germinate And it's not a terrible idea if you can to kind of pre-moisten your beds before planting So we ran the drip in here all night last night I had some stuff in here that needed some water But I also wanted to get these beds nice and soaked because I knew we were going to be planting carrots today So for these round raised beds here instead of planting our carrots in rows We're just going to scatter seeds over the entire bed and then we'll cover them up because we've already got this soil ready There's not a whole lot to do here got a few little weeds. We need to pluck out of there I am going to put some fresh new staples down just to kind of hold my drip lines in place get those equally spaced Along the bed here Now that we've got all our drip lines held down with the staples I'm gonna take my little scratcher tool here and I'm just gonna lightly kind of scratch the top of this soil here Just to kind of break up that crust a little bit No need to get real deep here Just a light little scratch Alright now we're ready to plant then we're gonna put orange carrots in this bed So I got my Miami carrot seed packet here. I've got 2,000 seeds I don't know if we'll use them all but I know we should have enough We're just gonna pour some out here and then I just like to grab a pinch of them and just kind of start sprinkling Them out on the soil here. Just try to get somewhat even distribution Like I said, it's real hard to plant these things Too thick Alright, so we've got all our seeds scattered there since we didn't make a furrow and plant these in rows We just need to lightly cover the entire bed I'm gonna use some ProMix here should have mentioned this earlier But tip number four put your carrot covering soil in a dog's bucket and your carrots will germinate a lot better Even if it is a slightly faded dog's bucket It'll work much better than a Tennessee bucket So we're just gonna take some of this ProMix and just lightly cover these seeds Alright, so that's what it looks like when we're done now We need to do the exact same thing in these two other beds I think I'll put my Yellowstone carrots in this bed and then our dragon purple carrots in that one over there And just like that we're done So I'll take a little hand nozzle and soak these beds pretty well here in a minute and then probably come back out here Later this afternoon and soak them again So the next seven to ten days We want all three of these beds to kind of have that dark color that wet soil tends to have Now I wouldn't recommend planting carrots if you're going out of town or going on vacation soon after planting them But if you are one thing you can do is cover the bed So you could put a piece of cardboard over these round raised beds You could put a piece of plastic over these round raised beds to preserve the moisture So that's a good idea if you're going out of town Or maybe you're just not able to get out here and water them once or twice a day The kicker with that if you're going to cover the beds to retain the moisture You got to check on them pretty regularly because once those carrots start sprouting You're going to want to take that cover off otherwise you're going to end up with a bunch of yellow carrot sprouts And back to tip number two here another reason we plant them so thick is we don't want to have to worry about weeds We want those carrot sprouts to cover this entire bed and out compete any weeds that try to emerge Kind of like the same thing we've done with the savannah mustard over here We want complete soil coverage so no weeds can thrive So if you haven't planted your carrots yet, hopefully those three tips are helpful Now one question we always get is how far north can I steal overwinter carrots? And that's a tough question for me to answer because I've never lived anywhere but Georgia So if you're north of us and you do overwinter carrots Please put that in the comments below that way some of the beginner gardeners out there can see if they can pull it off in their area So I hope you enjoyed the video today Don't forget to check out our affiliate links and coupon codes in the description below and also go check out our website lazydogfarm.com you can find that coop grow fertilizer and the Agri-thrive fertilizer that we'll be using on these carrots And if you want to see some of those carrots that we just planted at harvest time Check out this video right here from a couple years ago in the in-ground garden where we compare Miami and Bolero carrots Along with several other varieties so check that out and we'll see you next time right here at lazy dog farm
