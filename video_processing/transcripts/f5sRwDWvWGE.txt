Solving This Barn Predicament

 Okay, I would just like to point out that last week while I was working on a 1950T, it was like right on the verge of being, you know, sweatshirt, light jacket weather, and now we have a foot of snow, and it's been in the teens with negative wind chills for the last three days. It's been kind of miserable. It was really fucking cold this morning, and it finally warmed up to the point it's actually not that bad to be outside right now. When I was plowing snow earlier, it was before the sun came out, it was kind of breezy, and it was not nice to be outside, but we're supposed to have a decent weekend ahead, and it's supposed to get cold again Monday and Tuesday. But anyway, we're going to take a quick break from the old 1950T project for this video. I'm trying to solve my barn fiasco we got going on here. I got my first quote back from a builder, and for a 40 by 60, 12-inch overhangs, no windows, no insulation, a 20-foot slider in either end, and one service door. No wainscoting, no nothing, one color, one sheet of steel all the way down, one color roof, nothing fancy. The only basic, or the only real option on it is a 12-inch overhang. If I really wanted to save a little bit of money, I would get rid of the overhangs, but that's a terrible idea for a barn. So, a plain Jane, four walls and a roof, 40 by 60 barn. First guy came back at $57,000, which I thought was kind of excessive, but I got three other quotes I'm supposed to be getting back here, hopefully within the next week, or I really hope within the next week, and I'm hoping at least one of them comes in lower than that. But, uh, I came, or after I got that, I was like, well, shit, the guy that owns the property where we've been using that, the barn we have now, offered that property to dad with the two buildings on it, and there's 5.6 or 5.8 acres, it's not quite six acres there, and in about an acre and a half of its woods. Um, so, the red barn that we keep equipment in is garbage. I mean, you couldn't even add on to it, it's so far out of square, it's not, it's not level, as far as, like, setting, when they set the posts, the posts are, like, the roof line's not level, there's nothing, you couldn't even add on to that barn unless, yeah, the red barn is basically trash, it's, it got us, it's, it, yeah, it's, it is what it is. The gray barn that's there is actually a nice barn, it's got concrete in it, um, that was put up by a good reputable builder, so, but it's only, I think that barn's only 30 by 30 or 30 by 40 with a 12 foot ceiling, so, I mean, we could fit, like, the grain trucks and stuff in there, but anyway, um, he offered that property to dad a few years ago for 85,000, I was like, well, shit, as much as I don't want to borrow money, if I could borrow another 20,000 more and have, you know, six acres of property with two barns, so, I called him the other night to see what he had in mind for price, he's like, well, I had it reappraised when I was talking to the realtor, and it came back at 110,000, I was like, no, um, that's not, not, not for no six acres, uh, no way, I mean, if there, if that red barn was a nice barn, and it wasn't right on the freaking highway, and I'm trying to figure out how the hell it ever appraised that high, because that property is, it's narrow, and it's long, and the reason it's narrow is because you're landlocked, it's got about 250 foot, 250 to 300 foot between the highway and Amtrak, so you're literally deadlocked in between the highway and a set of railroad tracks, a busy railroad tracks, so they're, they're obviously appraising it as a building site, but I don't know who in their right mind would want to build a house there, because you're pinned between a busy two-lane highway and railroad tracks, and right across the street from the two-lane highway is an active gravel pit, who the hell would want to build a house there, I don't know, so I don't know how the hell that land appraised that high, other than the fact that it's right on the highway, but last I knew, I don't even think it's zoned commercial, I think it's zoned Ag B, so to do any commercial building out there, you would probably have to get it rezoned, so I, I don't know, but regardless, that, that basically shot that wide, because for the two acres that's tillable there, and the two barns, and six acres, it's not, in my mind, worth 110,000, you could buy farm ground around here cheaper than that, you could buy, you could, around here, you could buy 40 acres for that, so anyway, you know, probably not 40 acres, I bet you could buy 20 acres for that, 20, 25 acres for that, but anyway, um, so that basically got me pinned down to building a barn here, which in the long run is probably gonna be a better option, because I need a barn here anyway, and, and as far as like the future goes, so basically, it would have been a lot easier to see this yesterday, when we only had three inches of snow instead of a foot, but you should be able to see the flags I got marked out here, so I got, this will be a corner, well, okay, so we'll start you off here, this is a corner, and I got a flag here, I got a flag there, a flag there, a flag there, so basically what I got flagged out here is these two flags, and there's a flag there, and a flag there, these four flags mark out a 40 by 60 footprint, so this is gonna be step one, it's just get a 40 by 60 put in here, um, that'll get me somewhere to start, that'll get all, all three combines in, that'll get the white in, that'll get the planter in, um, that'll get a decent chunk of what we have in that red barn under a roof, some stuff can have to sit outside for now, but that can be taken care of probably my midsummer, um, which we'll talk about that here in a minute when I walk over the other barn, but, so, that's, this is gonna be the start, it's a 40 by 60, um, that'll get me 40 foot off of my property line, which is just the other side of those two pine trees, um, and there'll be a 20 foot slider there, a 20 foot slider here, and then probably a man service door right here in this corner, so that's step one, that'll, that's gonna be build number one, and then the other set of flags, so that guy, and that guy, and then that one at the far corner, and that one at the far corner, mark out two 20 foot lean twos, um, and this lean two will put me 30 foot off of my back property line, so I've got, I've got at least my 20 foot setback all the way around, um, I can't really do anything more as far as, at least on this lean two, I can't come forward anymore because of that power line right there, which screws me on building, um, so, basically, my plan is gonna be this lean two, which would be from here to that flag, is gonna be a 20 foot drive through, so it'd be open on both ends, and then this lean two on this side, um, that one, we should be able to start the roof of that lean two at the roof line and just follow it on down for that lean two, this one, the way I want to do it, is probably gonna be, we might have to start the, the trusses for this lean two actually up on the roof of the 40 by 60, because I want to make this one walled on either side, and back in from this way, that way, like, my semi mount plows, the chisel plow, anything like that, that is just easier to like, back in, um, you can do, do it like that, and then that way, that one, you're walled off to a west wind, and this one, everything's just come over top of it, so you don't got to worry about anything blowing back in, is kind of my plan, but the lean twos will be a couple years out, we'll have to start getting the main building paid down, and recover from that price shock, um, I couldn't believe it came in that high, because lumber's down, it makes me, I priced out a 40 by 60 three years ago, before all this shit started, and I wish I'd have built it then, because it came in at 21,000, for a 40 by 60, which to me, back then sounded expensive, but now it's like, damn, that's cheap, but I shoulda, coulda, woulda, Teeter, come here, you don't belong out there, she got herself a squirrel earlier today, I was getting ready to plow snow, and was warming the tractor up, and what not, and I couldn't find her, I started calling her, and I heard her, she was over here by this pine tree, she would not come, would not come, would not come, and I kept hearing this screeching, sound like a baby, baby bawling its eyes out, and I went over there, she had a squirrel, tackled down in the snow, had a tail all tore up, and I tried saving it, and it got a hold of my glove, that, that little red spot right there, on my, on my thumb knuckle, it got through the glove, um, damn, squirrels hurt when they bite, I tell you what, but that thing latched onto my glove, and its tail fell out of my glove, and I'm trying to keep Teeter from jumping on me, because she wants this damn squirrel, and she got a hold of its tail, and this thing has latched onto my glove, and I can't get my glove off, so her and I are tugging on this poor squirrel, I'm scared we're going to rip it in half, finally I get her to let go of it, oh, it was a fiasco, so, so, anyway, um, obviously, that's a low spot, down there, but it's the flattest spot I have to build on, that gets me clear, of, this power line fiasco, I wish they'd have what, went, like from that pole straight back, followed the property line, but anyway, cause I actually looked into having to move that, but it's eight grand a pole, minimum, that's a little excessive, cause they'd have to set, probably one, probably at least three poles, to get back to that pole, that'd be, that'd be pretty salty, but the drive, I would put two driveways in, the main one would be, down behind the barn, and then I'd put one, from the house, down between the corn crib, and the pony stable, back to here, um, but to get some of the fill, I got, there's a knob right here, that we should be able to cut down, because it's gonna be too steep, going down anyway, for this driveway, so we should be able to get, a big chunk of fill, cut out of here, to push back in there, to get a grade set, and then they can bring the rest up, with sand, um, as much as I don't want to, probably gonna end up, cutting this pecan tree down, because it's starting to really, sketch me out, because it's rotten down here, through the center, and one of these days, that thing's gonna decide to, go both ways, and, it's gonna smash the corn crib, and, come down on the power lines, and all sorts of fun stuff, so, that tree, and at the very least, is probably gonna have to go, um, that second, is that, this tree and that tree, are both pecan trees, and, you gotta have two of them, to make nuts, so, it might end up, that both of them, end up coming down, but I had, I might be able to get, a little bit of money, out of them, because when I had, a log broker come out, and mark all my trees, he offered, he said, if I ever cut these trees down, let him know, because he wanted to saw them up, for making furniture, because apparently, pecan makes furniture, I don't know, not my deal, but if he wants them, I'll buck him up for logs, and he can come get them, and give me money for them anyway, so, that's the plan for that, and then, for, the other small stuff, that doesn't need all the headroom, and I've talked about this before, but for the people that are new, we'll give you the refresher, um, I'm gonna set the camera down, I'm gonna put my gloves on here for a minute, it's, it's, it's still a little chilly, I need to rebuild this door, at some point too, all right, let me get in here real quick, let me, get some gloves on, global warming can kick it anytime, and, oh, it's only been winter for less than a week, and, I'm over it already, so, um, we've obviously got wasted space down here, I could get like, the sickle bar more would go in here, the hay rake would go in here, my baler would go in here, um, the super 55 could fit in here, um, some of the plows would fit down, and basically anything where you don't need, you know, I got seven, about seven foot of headroom down here, and, if I knocked this floor out and sunk it, I could probably get eight foot, but, obviously there's no door, because this was never meant for equipment storage, this was for animals, so you got your two sliders for letting cattle in and out, and that was it, but, the way this barn's built, you got a main beam here, and you got a main beam here, and this is your center bay, and obviously your west bay and your east bay, so, the way the back wall works out, is we can take the block out from here, to this grout line right here, and it would keep the main beams sitting on a wall, um, I could get, I can't remember what this measured out, I think this measured out at, like 12 foot, 10 foot, 11 foot, somewhere in there, so, you could put a little double slider in here, and, uh, or for that matter, just one big slider, and slide it that way, but you could get a slider in here, and use this for equipment storage, um, so, either, how, if it warms up enough, this would be, a, late winter project, um, because in all honesty, it will not take that long to do, because what we're gonna do, is they got this rounded block, here, um, we're gonna, the plan, the plan is to attempt to save, these edge blocks, to keep that round profile, because they're already here, that we're not gonna have to touch this wall, because this is already in a, in the perfect spot, so, we'll try to save, these edge blocks, for those, or those edge profile blocks, and then, go in, and cut the block out, on that grout line, so that we can put those block, back in, and form that corner, the rest of the wall, is just gonna get knocked out, um, and then, going to have to, make, a, the way it's made, this back beam, cannot be self-supporting, over that kind of distance, so we're gonna have to make, some sort of steel frame, that'll sit in, and help support that beam, um, but other than that, I mean, a, if, you had, two or three guys working on it, had a good solid weekend, you could probably have this done, like, have the door on, have that wall knocked out, whole nine yards, that could probably all be done, in, in a weekend, if you had, not freezing ass cold temperatures, and, what not, um, and then, for the time being, would probably end up, just like, pouring, and or making some sort of, small ramp on the outside, that way, you can, get up the step, um, long term would be, because this floor is shit, they got, like, you can tell, it was part of the original floor, and then you got this section right here, where they filled in a manure trough, and, there's a bunch of patches, and shit in here, and, it's not level, and, it's probably not even that thick, to be honest, and, you can see right there, there's, where they cut the milking stanchions off, but, uh, shit, like I say, should be able to knock this floor out, and drop it about a foot, and re-pour a new floor, to get more headroom, but that'll be a later project, because, uh, last I knew, concrete was about 160 to 170 bucks a yard, so, um, but the other thing we'll have to do, is this post, is getting a little, sketchy, down at the bottom, and then there's supposed to be a twin to that, that, dovetailed in right here, that they obviously took out at some point, for some reason, probably because it rotted off, so, what we're gonna have to do, to replace these, I'm gonna replace them with, I, probably I-beam, or box tube, whatever I can find, for a reasonable amount of money, reasonable amount of money, and then go in, and saw out, around, and get a square, laid out, where you can, where we can, pour a concrete pillar, and then take that, or, for a footer, and then, um, put flanges on both ends, of whatever I end up using, for a new post, and end up, probably put a wide flange, with, and gusset it, up on top, and then just a, a square plate at the bottom, and, end up lagging it, into the main beam here, and, bolting it down, on top of that footer, and do one here, to replace this wood post, and then, come in, and gonna have to put a plumb bob in here, and find the center of this hole, and come in, and do the same thing, cut out a big square, and probably stick plywood, or something in there, to form it, that way, when we knock out, the concrete around it, um, it, you end up with a nice, you know, nice looking, formed, pillar, because the floor, it'll obviously end up being, at what is current floor level, or whatever we gotta do, because, Lord knows this, the floor could be four inches higher, over here than it is over there, Lord only knows, so, basically, however high, we gotta make them, to get them top, or get them even to the top, where they sit right now, and not be below concrete level, because you don't want them, sitting full of water, or anything like that, um, and then, when we pour the new floor, you'll obviously be down, 12 inches from the top, so you want a nice, reinforced, and, good looking, footer, for that post to sit on, and then we can get rid of that, jack post, and that jack post, and, you'll have, plenty of room, so, but like that, any, anything that's small, could go in here, and then, for the milk, or over here, in the milk house, um, you got, these walls, that don't belong here, they put these walls in, when, uh, he was using this, for his office, when he ran his plumbing business, out of here, but this wall, these, or this wall, and that wall, are going to come out, and, uh, I want to put shelving in here, and use this for like, a part storage area, for the time being, and I need to remake that door too, this door is actually, supposed to be wider, I do believe, I don't remember, what it looks like, on the outside, can't remember, if the hole was bigger, and it had a, had a wider door, like the one, over there, in the corner, or not, but there's your, that was where you, where the, milk truck stuff their, uh, sanitary hose, through to pump your milk out, so yeah, that's where we're at, so, like I say, well, this project will hopefully be, late winter, we'll have to see what time frame we got, between getting the tea done, getting the planter ready, um, and that other barn fiasco, and I still got to finish up, cleaning up that field, um, at the very least, we'll get it done, after planning, so, like I say, some of that small shit, it's gonna have to set outside, once we get that barn out, for the time being, I don't like it, but it is what it is, um, and then, once we get the other barn up, between that, and between the storage space, I got down here, because this is a 30 by 40, um, everything should be back, under a roof, so, hopefully, because that, the barn I put up up there, I do believe, will actually be, just a shade bit bigger, because I don't think, that red barn, that we use now, is actually a full 40 by 60, I don't think, we've never measured it, but I don't think it's 60 long, I think, might be 40 wide, but I don't think it's a full 60 long, so, I have to play a little bit of shed Tetris, my plan is on that one, the, the south facing door, all the combines will be in there, um, my mounted picker, should be able to get that, lined up all against one wall, um, the white and the planter, the white and my new planter, the 540, hopefully, will go in there, um, all three grain drills for now, after we get this in here, um, depending on how, that door measures out, um, one of the drills can go down here, we got a 10 foot model 64, that would fit in here, but I don't think our 38, and the 64 I use, will fit through there, I don't believe, um, so, yeah, it sucks, I wish it, I wish we had more time, to get this situation figured out, I wish lumber prices, were a little lower, so that it wasn't so freaking expensive, to put up a barn, I wish I could do it myself, but I don't have time, the way things are working out, it's just, sometimes life throws you a curve ball, and you gotta deal with it, but, I'm not stressing over it, as bad as I was last week, as much as I really don't want to go, talk to the bank, about borrowing $60,000, to put up a barn, so, anyhow, the other thing we'll have to do is, you know, like that bench back there, you have to get cut up, and get out of here, I want to keep that one, because that's actually a nice bench, that one is, and so is actually, that one, those are actually nice heavy benches, but, I have to figure something out, and then there's that steel bench, that's not, it's not like, a super duper heavy duty work bench, but that's a nice bench, I don't know, so much shit, so anyway, I was thinking, tomorrow, I was going to be overworking on that field, because I didn't think my parts, were going to show up for the three speed, but, because they didn't ship till last night, but they showed up this afternoon, and, frankly, I don't feel like wading through a foot of snow down there, trying to figure out what's, because, last week, the guy got down there, with a big excavator, and laid all the trees down, so everything's on the ground now, everything, except for, he missed three of them back in the corner, but, that was my fault, for probably miscommunicating, but anyway, this is all light fluffy shit, so if we get, we're supposed to get, like, mid to upper 30s, this weekend, so, if we get that, this stuff will all settle out, and as light and fluffy as it is, I bet, once this stuff all lays down, you've only got, three inches of snow here, total, because that's all fluffy lake effect stuff, right now, and, everything will melt off of the trees, and whatnot, so you'll be able to see what you're doing, and, so, hopefully, next weekend, we can get down there, and start doing some burning, and cleaning, and take care of some of that mess, Friday, or Monday, I got the block, the head, and all that fancy stuff for the T, take them down to the machine shop, I got the injection pump down to Crown Point, they're going to overhaul that, put the updated weight cage in it, bench test it, and I told them, if it's set anything over 10% right now, turn it down to 10%, because, I don't want to, I don't want to hurt that tractor, and if it was turned up a bunch, that could be, part of what got that, well, I mean, most of what got the bottom end of that motor, so slopped out, was it never had any of the updates done to it, but if it was turned up more than, more than 10, 15%, that's really hard on the bottom end of them motors, because it's only 310 cubes, so, like I say, they're going to reseal it, you know, go through all the stuff, check it, put the weight cage in it, which eliminates the flex ring, it's supposed to, obviously the flex ring is, a composite material, and over time it breaks down, and it'll plug up your return line, and make it where the tractor won't run anymore, and, these days, with the low sulfur, no sulfur diesel fuel we got, they took all the good shit out, that's supposed to lubricate all the stuff, in your pump, and injectors, and whatnot, they say those flex rings, only give you about 10 years of service, before they start to, start to degrade, so you can, they put, get rid of the flex ring, put this weight basket in there, and, it's obviously, not composite, it's supposed to have, a lot longer service life, it's supposed to make the governor, a little snappier, and, whatnot, so, that's about an extra hundred bucks, to put that in, versus putting the flex ring back in, so a lot of guys don't do it, because they're T passes, which if it's just a show tractor, and you're restoring it, well, a lot of guys that restore show tractors, would slap a coat of paint on it, and not even touch the injection pump, but, um, if you're not going to work it, or farm with it, or anything, a flex ring is perfectly fine, throw one back in it, it'll outlive the rest of the tractor, if you want to farm with it, the weight cage is the way to go, so, um, I should have that pump back, hopefully next Friday, the way they talked, um, I got another $2,000 worth of parts, from Abaw today, for, between the engine, and the three speed, so I should have everything, I need to put the three speed, back together this weekend, which is my plan on that, um, there were a couple parts, I couldn't get new, so I had to, well, we won't go down that road, I'll explain that stuff, as we start putting the engine, back together, but, uh, the crank's out to get ground, um, he's going to try to, get the head magna fluxed, sooner rather than later, for me, that way, if I end up needing to find a new head, which God, I hope I don't have to find a new head, but I got time to do it, um, and then, the rest of the engine work, will be out, the balancing rotating assembly, he obviously can't do, until I get the crank back, from grinding, and, I'm probably at least two weeks out, on getting the crank back, from grinding, um, and all the machine work, on the block and what not, he was about four weeks out, from start, so, by the end of the month, we'll be putting the engine, back together, so, that's the plan, but anyway, um, like, this is just a, little update, on the barn situation, some people said, they were interested, in how all this was going to do, to turn out, so, um, a bunch of people, recommended a hoop barn, I do not want to go down, the hoop barn path, they are an eye, in my opinion, they are an eyesore, I do not like them, um, yeah, they're cheap, but in the long run, they're more expensive, because I could go back there, put up a hoop barn, but I'd have to put, concrete footers in, for building code, um, because, at least around here, they won't let you, just set them on the ground, they have to have, some sort of foundation, to anchor them, um, I still don't think, that if you did that, they counted as a permanent building, but, regardless, so you'd have to pay, for the concrete, to put the footers in, you'd have to pay for the barn, you'd have to put the thing up, it would be there, and, first off, you'd get content with it, and, I don't want to get content, with a part, with a temporary structure, I want a damn pole barn, back there, um, that I can, build up, and grow into, um, and then, if you did decide, to, get rid of the hoop barn, the resale value on them, is garbage, because when they take them down, normally you can't, you reuse the covering, you can only reuse the girders, and then you'd have to go in there, and tear all that concrete out, so that you had a spot, it's just no, we're not going on the hoop barn road, and, and I was pricing Quonset huts, which I don't think look too terrible, um, they give you that, usually give you that 50s vibe, because in all honesty, they haven't really changed much, in the last 50 years, as far as the way they look, but, uh, god damn, right now, they're, they're, pretty much right in line, with how much it costs, to put up a pole barn, so you might as well put up a pole barn, because, the problem with the Quonset is, you lose storage space, on either side, because you got the curvature of the roof, so, we're going down the pole barn road, I'm just going to bite the bullet, spend the money, put up a barn, put it up the way I want it, I wish I could put it up a little fancier, but, we're going to be spending enough money as it is, so, anyway, um, I've rambled on enough, so, with that being said, I guess that's it for this one, and, we'll catch you guys on the next one, working on the tee again, in the shop, where it's warm, and, you know, I guess I apply it and Iaper, how well there's a pair of gyms. Then, I just, I got to run the club stuff, and, I could do it again, if it will never be on schedule, but there happens a lot, rather, rather, with that being fermented, that's an airline, and then, somewhat higher than the same thing, you know, and, you know, I mean, I don't see it. You know. I mean, I've just, I feel like were moved, about, somewhere in the کorp, and I check out the club. I'm, and you know,
