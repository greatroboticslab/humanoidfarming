 The Seeds for Needs My name is Carlo Fadda, I work for Bioversity International since 2004. Currently I'm working on a concept which is the Seeds for Needs concept. It's a tool to identify seeds in gene bank collections that can be given to farmers to adapt to climate change. The climate is changing, this is happening, it's very fast and the seeds that farmers are currently using are maybe losing potential for the new environmental conditions. In this program the farmers play a very key role because we not only need to have seeds that are adapted to the environment but we also need seeds that are able to meet farmers' needs. There is a tendency to promote monoculture to reduce the amount of diversity which is available to farmers. This can have serious consequences. One of the key issues with climate change is unpredictability. So the farmers will face seasons that are more unpredictable than in the past. So maybe one year they can have floods and one year they can have extreme drought. Not having agricultural biodiversity means that if they choose, if they make the wrong bet at the time of planting, they will lose everything. And when they have agricultural biodiversity they can act like a risk insurance in the sense that if the conditions are drought, they will still have some material which is more adapted to drought. because the Crew is too bad.
