 Hello friends, the giant Brahmana cow farm is a symbol of modern agriculture, where millions of giant cows are raised and managed. In this article, we will learn how this farm efficiently raises and transports millions of giant cows, ensuring their resistance and good health. In the 1900s and early 20th century, the giant Brahmana cow was present in the United States, and became an important part of the livestock industry. They often live in warm and tropical areas, such as states like Florida, Texas, and Louisiana. We are at the premier ranch in South Florida. Most farms that raise Brahmana cows release them into the grass fields on the farm in the morning. They will be warmed by the sun and freely graze. Baby Brahmana cows also live close to their mothers during the early stages of their lives. They are breastfed until adulthood, around six to nine months old. This helps them grow strongly and ensures the best care from the mother cow. They are breastfed until the mother cow. They are breastfed until the mother cow. They are breastfed until the mother cow.

After finishing the inspection, the Brahmana herd will enter the farm's yard. This is where they can continue to enjoy the natural and comfortable space after a serious day of work. When it gets dark, they will be brought back to the farm. When it gets dark, they will be brought back to the farm area to rest. Before resting, they will be fed by the breeders. They will mix grains, cornmeal, and silage, which are the main foods for cows. To ensure all cows on the farm absorb enough nutrients during the day. On average, each adult cow will eat about 2% to 3% of the amount of food corresponding to their body weight. The farm's clean water is always provided because cows drink a lot of it. On some other farms, cows will be fed a new type of food. Here, the farm owners will cook grains with water to feed the cows. Do you know about this feeding method? This is a method that many farm owners have tried and is especially effective. Nutrients and grains help cows absorb them more easily in mixed forms. And the daily food volume of cows will be more guaranteed, making it easier to control the daily food and water intake of each cow. This type of feed can be fed to all types of cows. And from the moment they are weaned, they can eat this type of feed. When cows reach a standard weight, they will be exported to other countries. Cows will be loaded onto specialized transport vehicles with many storage compartments. Each trip can transport about 100 animals. The vehicle storage compartments are provided with additional food and water for the cows because the journey to the airport is quite far. According to data from the United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, in 2020, the United States exported about 3.1 million tons of beef and livestock products worth about 9.1 billion USD. After arriving at the airport, they will be transferred to specialized containers on the plane to ensure that the cows cannot escape. Cows will be able to rest before boarding the plane so that they have a comfortable mind and ensure that no bad situations happen to them. Each container is transported using modern machinery. They are loaded and neatly placed into containers in the aircraft cabin. The aircraft cabin is quite spacious to ensure passengers have a comfortable space. The conveyor system in the storage compartment is completely automatic and controls each box of cows individually. The camera will help monitor their behavior so they will be safe during the flight and reach a new land to live in. And in this presentation... I'm glad you joined this episode!
