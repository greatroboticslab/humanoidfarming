 If you live on a small piece of land and you want true self-sufficiency in your home, there's only a couple of meat animals that really make any sense. With the sheer utility you get from meat rabbits, they really take the cake. You can't be self-sufficient on meat chickens because you can't breed them effectively yourself. The chicken meat you buy from the grocery store is called Cornish Cross. That kind of chicken is raised up to eight weeks old. By then it weighs about six pounds. If it lives any older, it has organ failure. It grows so large that its body can't keep up and its legs break under it. And even if it lives till maturity, you can't breed two Cornish Cross together and get another Cornish Cross. Because of the genetics that go into making that chicken, it doesn't breed true. Meat rabbits, on the other hand, have very similar growth rates. They eat less food and they breed true. Meat rabbits stay fertile for many years. They can live for 10 years or longer. You can raise them in a colony like this where they get a better life than any meat chicken. They're far easier to process, especially in your own backyard without any equipment. If you have any interest in a cheap video series on the whole process of raising meat rabbits, everything you need to know about their enclosures, their health, breeding, and raising them from start to finish, please let me know in the comments.
