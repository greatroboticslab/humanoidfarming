 Gestation cages, or sow stalls, are used in intensive pig farming to separate pregnant pigs from each other. A typical cage measures slightly larger than the pig's body, allowing the pig very little room to move. The sow will stay in the cage throughout her four-month gestation period. The cages have slatted floors to allow excrement to escape, and are usually constructed in rows of around 20. The phase-out comes after a prolonged campaign by animal rights groups.
