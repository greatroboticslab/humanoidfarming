 This is a 60-65 open station power shuttle tractor. Very, very nice size tractor with Mahindra. This is kind of the reason I went after Mahindra was this tractor and then there's another one over there that'll come in here in just a bit. We did have this same version of tractor was supposed to be here this morning and we were going to hook up to that rake but didn't show up so we got a different tractor on that. This series of tractor through Mahindra, what has changed on this over almost every manufacturer of the same size, Mahindra being a tier four tractor does not have to have a DPF in it nor does it use urea. So it is the only tractor in North America that does not use those two pieces on it and still meets tier four emissions. Mahindra spent a lot of money on that engine to do that. It's a very nice system. Every other, like I said, every other manufacturer uses a DPF or DEF or both. One thing that Mahindra sacrificed a little bit whenever they did that, she doesn't have the low end torque that a lot of the other tractors will have. She's a little doggy at the very bottom end and that's kind of going to be all of them but that's what they sacrificed was a little bit of that low end torque to get away from any of that emissions stuff that had to go on it and still meet tier four emissions. This is a 65 horse. They do make this same caliber of tractor in a 50, a 55, a 60, and a 70 that are mechanical shuttles instead of the power shuttles. The front ends on these are a true driveline ball joint exterior planetary as opposed to a need style planetary that's on a lot of the little tractors that you see today. This system will handle the hay stuff better. Any bales that you put on the front end, the front end of this tractor will take it as opposed to some of the other ones that you'll see. Even a lot of our little Branson tractors, if you look at the front end of them, you look at this one, if you're handling a 15, 1800 pound bale, this front end will stand up to it a lot better than the other front ends will. Um, this tether on the back, uh, or interossi will build this in a 10 foot pull type, 17 foot, 3.17 foot pull type, 21 foot, or is it seven? There's 21 as well. 24. Um, this is a four rotor 17. You are going to see over there that we cut most of that hay that we're doing with that 16 foot swather. This has all it wants to do to reach out and grab two rows with a 16 foot swather, how we had the conditioner set on that. It ain't going to be perfect, but you'll get the idea when we're running it. If you don't know what the tethers are, what they do, this will take your windrow and spread it back out again. Um, sounds kind of crazy to do every once in a while, but, um, if you're in heavy grass hay and you're up against weather, this will cut your dry time down by at least a day, if not a little bit more, just by spreading it out, drying it up, raking her back together and putting it in. It's a very simple tool to use. It doesn't require hardly any horsepower. The, uh, the draw bar type don't take hardly any. This one takes a little bit just to lift it because it is quite large and kind of massive machine, but the little 10 footers are just a two rotor. Um, they're, they're just these two center sections like this. They don't have the wings that fold down. And then the 24 footer is a big one. Uh, but all this is going to do is it's going to grab it. You'll see it when we turn it on over there and it's just going to explode the windrow and put it just like if you would cut it with a sickle bar, it'll put it all down and go. Uh, most of the time, this is, uh, not an alfalfa tool for most of the stuff. This is a little rough on it, but it is a, it is a grass tool and it is a heavy grass tool. Granted, everything I got out here is on the verge of being way too dry already. Um, we didn't know what the weather was going to do. So we cut it early to make sure it was dry, but it's, it's going to be plenty dry and this will beat it up a little bit, but at least you'll get the idea what it will do with that.
