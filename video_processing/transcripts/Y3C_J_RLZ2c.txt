My insane late-season garden harvest...

Howto & Style
 My garden is popping off in August. Come along with me for a harvest. My corn's growing so crazy it fell over. Here's how to know if it's ready. This part, called the silk, should be brown. Sometimes you'll get a top like this, where some kernels didn't form. That's totally okay because you can do this. When corn's straight out of the field is one of the best tastes you'll ever have. Here's one you probably never heard of. This is a fennel bulb, which most people harvest and roast, but if you take an unopened flower cluster and eat it, it tastes exactly like a licorice candy. My sauce tomatoes have definitely looked better, but I'm still getting them so I'll keep them going for the season. The more of these I can get, the better. I grabbed a bunch of the remaining onions of the season and then it's time to harvest every pepper I can find. I have a mix of hot and sweet peppers in here and they are prolific this season and I do mean prolific. I spent the last 10 years learning how to grow my own food and it's worked out pretty well so follow up if you want to learn more.
