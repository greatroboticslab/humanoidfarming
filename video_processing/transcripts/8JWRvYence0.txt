 The farm wife, stereotypical, wearing an apron, cooking all day in the kitchen isn't technically what I look like, but I'm still calling myself that because no matter what I'm doing, I'm supporting work getting done on the farm and keeping that needle moving forward. I don't think that's stereotypical of what a farm wife looks like. I know lots and lots of women that are driving tractors, grain carts, combines, hooking up heads. My wife does cattle chores, skid loader, operator. Maybe that's changed. You're the rancher's husband. Yeah, I am.
