 In this Canberra greenhouse, Dr. Liz Dennis and her colleagues at CSIRO are working on crops that could help feed the developing world. When crosses are made between varieties of some plants, the hybrid offspring have a better yield than their parents. It's therefore common to use hybrids to produce food crops such as rice and canola. The problem with hybrids is that they only last one generation. So in order to capture those higher yields, farmers have to purchase hybrid seeds every season. So we've been trying to capture that first generation hybrid figure into lines that can be perpetuated. These so-called hybrid mimics could have a major impact on food supply in poorer countries. Dr Dennis has long been at the forefront of plant innovation. She was co-recipient of the Prime Minister's Prize for Science in the year 2000 for discovering a key gene that determines when plants begin flowering. Dr Dennis and her research partner, Dr Jim Peacock, determined the gene action could be overridden by exposing a plant's seed to extreme cold.

Together with friends, she's helped regenerate an old dairy farm on the NSW South Coast, planting more than 40,000 trees. Dr Dennis and her research partner, Dr Dennis. To see that come back, the birds come back and the animals come back, it's really wonderful to see. Dr Dennis says she feels particularly honoured to receive a medal named after Ruby Payne Scott, who, like her, was a pioneering researcher at CSIRO. Dr Dr Dennis she was a great unrecognised really or mostly unrecognised worker researcher and it's terrific to recognise her. And, so for me, it's a great honour to be part of that stream of women scientists. Thank you.
