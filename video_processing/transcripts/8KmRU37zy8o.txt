 When someone falls into a grain silo, they immediately become anchored to the grain as soon as their knees are submerged and start to slowly drown as the grain starts filling their airways. So in the U.S., rescue teams use these modular panels to create a tube around the person, as this tool effectively creates a barrier allowing the grain to be removed safely. However, if the space is tight, an auger is used which expels grain at 1.5 bushels per minute, and once the pressure is reduced significantly, the victim can now be lifted out safely.
