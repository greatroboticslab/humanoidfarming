 Today I'm doing a quick review and demonstration of the Fitzger's Rotary Cultivator. If you're looking to loosen up that dirt, this definitely does. You do have to put a little elbow grease and it is a little weighty, but it does work well. It's just really repetitive and you do have to put in a little bit more effort. I wish it was a little bit lighter, but overall it's a really great tool. Here is a quick after so you can see just how well it broke up that dirt. This is definitely a good garden tool to have on hand.
