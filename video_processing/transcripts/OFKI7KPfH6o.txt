 Well here I am at another farm equipment auction. Welcome to my cluttered garage. You know I'm really glad you're here. Yeah! All right, there you go. Thanks very much. Thank you. So this is interesting. Here at the auction, they have a sale table set up, but this is just items for sale, not for the auction. So you can just buy stuff here. That's wheelie a lot of tires. A bunch of these Chinese mini excavators here. And there's a little bit of equipment down here too. Looks like a lot more equipment at this sale than the last one. Now the last sale I went to was about three weeks ago and it was really cold. Now today it's in the 50s, which isn't so bad, but man, it is windy out here. So it's still a little bit uncomfortable, but it's not as cold. Here's an old stand-alone stump grinder. And when I say old, I mean old. What would it take to make that thing work again? I suppose somebody with skills could do it. The wind is incredible. It's a little bit of a sound. Now 12. Now 12. Now 12. Now 12. Now 12. Now 12. Now 12. 11. now 12. Now 12. Now 12. Then 10. Then 10.

What do you think that'll go for? I'm going to guess $500 Let's see how close I am. Let's see how close I am. How about that? I called it just right on that old wood chipper, $500. It feels to me, or it looks to me, like things are going pretty reasonable. I saw that front-mounted stump grinder, which is for a skid steer. What did that go for? $17.50? Something like that? Yeah, I feel like things are going pretty reasonable here today. So I don't know what the story is for that. You know, it's tough because you have to know what things are worth. And you kind of have to know in the moment. But anyway, it seems to be like they're going pretty reasonable. Here's a whole other row of equipment. Some tractors here. Look at that old Ford 8N type tractor. Look at that front-end loader. My goodness. It would take all the lift capacity just to lift the loader up. But look at the cylinders on this thing. Holy smokes. That's like a two-inch cylinder. Wow. That is ugly. Here's a nice little tractor. Old John Deere 1050. I like that. Just for the fun of it. Looks like maybe no power steering. I don't know what year this 1050 is, but... Just a basic tractor. Looks like it needs a little TLC. Fun little tractor to have. Another little old Ford 8N, 9N, Aero tractor. The old Farmall A, Cub cultivating tractor. Well, this old spreader meant for $25. I'd call that lawn art. But still, $25. Kind of neat. All right. I really don't know anything about these tractors. John Deere 5075E. Pretty low hours. Beautiful shape. No front end loader. That's a farm tractor. I don't know. Something's telling me like $12,000 or something like that. So the guy that owns this 5075E is actually here. I was talking a little bit about it. And he said it's a perfect tractor. He just sold it because he bought a cab tractor. Because he said the kids these days like air conditioning and heating. So that's why they're selling this one. Anyway, he's here. He did say he set a reserve on it. So I'm curious, whatever it goes for, if that's going to mean his reserve. Welcome back. 5075E, boys. Right there. All right. Out of the way, right there. For the St. Louis, little Queens.

Hey, I wasn't too far off. I guessed 12,000 and went for 12,250. I had a hard time getting there though. The guy, he backed out a couple times and then he jumped back in again at 12 and then he stopped again and went for 12,250. It's incredible. update. So I just talked to the guy that had that John Deere and he got his reserve for it. He set the reserve for $10,000 but he said he was hoping for $15,000. So sold for $12,250 and he let it go. All right they're coming up on these mini X's. Chinese mini excavators. Let's see what these guys go for. I think they're normally like $3,500, $4,000. Could be a little higher than that. I don't know specifically because they're all a little different but that one over there is really tiny. Probably has a little preaching stratton engine in it. This one's diesel. It says it right there. Diesel. So this one would go for more. A little bigger machine. Right here. Got this one. All right. It's an 18. Hydraulic thumb. Got the swing boom. Change. Now back there. $4,000. $4,000. $4,000. $4,000. $4,000. That's a little mini-ex with a diesel. Let's go $7,500 on that one. Got a bigger one here. Diesel.

Apparently that happens. It did not sell the $6,000. $3,000. $3,000. $2,000. $2,000. $5,000. $5,000. $5,000. $5,000. $5,000. $5,000. $5,000. $7,000. $3,000. $6,000. $30,000. $5,000. $5,000. $5,000. $3,000. $5,000. $5,000. $3,000. $3,000. $31.00. $31.00. $31.00. $31.00. $31.00. $31.00. That wasn't bad, $31.00 for that little Mini-X. I don't know, again, what they go for off the lot, but they're brand new sitting here. So, I don't know. Not bad, but I've never used one, so I'd be afraid to buy one without really knowing how it's going to perform. Alright, let me guess what this Hummer's going to go for. I think I'm going to call that one at $6,500. Johnny, we're down to this, aren't we? Long-oh, many-o-okay- Podahore just like you're paying a generic audience for 10 locations. Sure, here, in the Just wildcat. Round two to 23,000 D I got 82 and a half, 85. We try and go up there. 87 and a half. 87 and a half... 85, 87, 87, 87, 87, 87, $8,500. It's been kind of a fun game trying to guess what things would go for. I was off with the Hummer, but not too bad. Would it go for 75, something like that? A little more than I, or maybe it went for 85. Now I forget. Anyway, it didn't go for the 65 that I guessed. But they've got a few more things here, and it looks like they're going to wrap up for the day. Look at that. John Deere 1025R with a backhoe. Now that is a hot machine. Very popular. Nice front-end loader. Nice setup. It's a great-looking machine. What in the world would this sell for? Again, I don't know. 18,000? 18? 15? It's got to be at least 15, right? That's a little John Deere. 1025R, boys. 1025R. 22 mile-a-boats. Three points laying in the bucket. 8? Right there. 8, 5, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2. 8, 28, 25. Down to the bail. 25, down to the bail. 25, 25, 25. 20. 25. Has transferable warranty. Go along. 25, 20, 20, 20. 10, 12, 5. 10, 12, 5. 15. 15, 15, 15. 15, 15, 15. 15, 15. 15, 15. 15. 15, 15. 15, 15. 15, 12, 15. 15, 12, 5. 15, 15. 14, 15. 15. 15, 12, 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 15, 16, 12. 1, 2, 3, 3. 6, 9, 10. 16, 10. 17, 17. 17, 17. 17, 17, 17. Day is doing nothing but saving money. 17, 18. 18, 18, 19, 19. 11, 1, 2, 3, scan. 18, 19, 19, 19, 19. 18, 19, 19, 19. 19, 19, 19, 18, 19. 18, 19, 19. 18, 19, 19, 18, 19, 18, 19, 19, 19, 19, 20, 19, Point 18, What do I ask? 18, 5, 19, 18, 5, 19, 18, 5, 19, down a little bit on 18, 18, 5, 19, down a little bit on 18, 19, down a little bit on 18, 19, 18, 5, 19, down a little bit on 18, 5, 7, 1⁄2 yet? 18, 5, 18, 7, 1⁄2. We're going to have to sell it to him with a call. We got a call with that guy. He wanted more money, but we think he'll take it. But 18, 5, give me your number. Well, the little John Deere sold for 18, 5, but it didn't actually sell. So the bid went up to 18, 5, which is right about where I guessed it would be. But you heard the auctioneer say the gentleman who's selling it had a reserve price on it. So they have to see if he'll accept that offer for it or not. But interesting day here at the farm auction sale. And I'm going to get out of here and try to get warm. But I hope you enjoyed this video. If you did, please give it a thumbs up. If you've not yet subscribed on YouTube or followed on Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok, I invite you to join me. Thanks for being here. And as always, I look forward to seeing you next time. Ford Ranger. And you'll be riding with the tow truck driver, one person? Yes, just one. I'll ride with. Okay. We are about 90 minutes. That's an estimated time. Dispatch will keep you informed about the status of your service call. Is there anything else I may help you with? That's all. Thank you, Barbara. You're welcome. Have a great day, sir. You too. Have a great evening. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye now. You too. Bye-bye. Ford Ranger. Broken down. You know, while I was driving to the auction in the Ranger, I thought I smelled a little tinge of antifreeze. Now, I just put a new radiator, new hoses, new thermostat in this truck. And driving home, I was freezing cold, so I turned the heat up, and no heat was coming out. I watched my temperature gauge, and it was rising from cool to warm to hot. So I was getting ready to overheat. So I pulled over in this parking lot, and lo and behold, I saw some coolant underneath the truck right under there. And I messed around with some hoses here. There's a heater hose with a T connection, plastic. It's broken, and the coolant just spilled out. So, we are AAA members, which, when you have older vehicles, it's not a bad service to have. So now I'm waiting for a tow truck to come take the Ranger home. And me. All right. All right. Number two. Where is my presättal RNA? Yes. We are here. You know, the other one is the spokesman. You know, the other one day. That's all right. You know, we were too close to you. We're either not usually, like, or �地 stations, or something. You know, I'm going to be able to pop open to you. Actually, this is a weird one. I'll be able to catch it. You know, come out of this one. We've got blocks for my travel. I don't know if you want to run long at that one. Come, are tinha in contact with landmarks. He's broken, and that's a weird one. So this is simple.
