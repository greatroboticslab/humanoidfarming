Science & Technology
 Here's how I grow mushrooms in buckets. First, I fill an onion sack with pre-cut straw. Then I add agricultural lime to a drum of water until it reaches a pH of 12.5. Then I soak my bags of straw for 24 hours. The next day, I'll remove my bags and let them drip dry for another 24 hours. Once the straw is at an adequate moisture level, I'll add it to a pre-sterilized cement mixing tray, and then I'll break up my favorite oyster mushroom spawn and add it to the pile. Here, I'll mix my straw and spawn together. Next, I'll sterilize my bucket and then fill it to the top with my new straw and spawn mixture. In a dark space, I'll let my bucket sit for about a week or so. Once I see pinning on the sides of my bucket, I'll put it in a controlled environment where they'll fruit for the next week. And in no time, I have edible mushrooms.
