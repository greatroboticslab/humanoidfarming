Howto & Style
 For many gardeners, visiting a garden center for the first time in the spring feels like being a kid in a candy store. With rows upon rows of plants bursting with vibrant colors and the sound of buzzing bees and the gentle rustle of leaves in the breeze, each step is filled with excitement and anticipation as you envision all of the possibilities in your own garden space. But with each step through the aisles of plants, tools, soils, and supplies, even an experienced gardener may become overwhelmed by all of the options. Even the presence of busy staff members may create additional pressure to ask the right questions and make informed decisions. Hi, this is Amy from Gardening Know How, a former garden center manager with 20 years of experience and plenty of dirt under my fingernails, and I am here to share 10 secrets garden center employees would like you to know. The staff at your local garden center love what they do and they are gardeners just like you. By learning a few of their secrets and money-saving hacks, you'll be able to simplify the shopping process, choose the right plants for your space, and even have a more productive interaction with the staff. The first secret is when to shop. Weekends and holidays can be hectic to say the least. If possible, consider shopping during the weekdays. Visiting during the week allows you to avoid the crowds, experience shorter wait times at checkout, and garden center staff may have more time to provide expert advice. Plus, your best selection of plants is often during the week as trucks typically deliver fresh stock on weekdays. The garden center may seem overwhelming with plants spaced in even rows in all corners of the lot, but most of the time, the placement of these plants may indicate a clue as to their light requirements. For example, if you are in need of shade tolerant shrubs, look for sections that are under black shade cloth, pergolas, or awnings. Also, if plants are placed in hot blazing sun all day, it can be assumed that they will tolerate those same light conditions in your garden. By carefully examining these clues, you can make informed decisions about which plants will thrive in your garden's light conditions, ensuring the happiness and health of your plants. Many plants have an informational tag attached to the pot or hung from the foliage. The information provided on the tag is crucial and should be reviewed before purchase. It may indicate light requirements, mature size, soil preferences, and more. For example, you wouldn't want a 10-foot tall shrub in a space under a window as it might block your view. Plus, nearby informational signs may offer additional information not found on the plant tag. The same goes for a packet of seeds. The small pieces of information found on the packet contain valuable details for properly growing the plant. Likewise, do not be afraid to analyze a plant. Gently pop it out of the pot to take a look at the root system. If a plant is severely root-bound or has very minimal root system, you may want to consider selecting a different plant. Many larger garden centers offer soil and mulch in bags and in bulk by the cubic yard. Receiving a delivery of a large pile of anything may seem daunting, but opting to purchase these items in bulk rather than individual bags can yield significant cost savings, even with the added delivery fee. Maybe you'll save enough to pick out a few more plants. Plus, bulk purchases minimize plastic packaging and reduce the number of trips needed to obtain all of your supplies. Your local garden center employees know your climate and know your native soil, and they know what your plant will need to thrive. They may suggest compost or peat moss to improve the condition of your soil, especially in areas with heavy clay or large amounts of sand. They may also suggest a specific fertilizer for your acid-loving plants, such as azaleas or hydrangeas, to help maintain the correct pH of the soil for optimal growth. These products may seem like an unnecessary expense, but may provide essential nutrients and improve the soil structure, which could otherwise hinder healthy plant growth. You may be most attracted to the heavily promoted flashy plants in fancy pots, but do not overlook classic native plants. Garden center staff know and love native plants, as they are well adapted to your local climate and soil conditions, making them easy to care for, low maintenance choices for your garden. Plus, native plants are less prone to insect and disease issues, and can benefit local wildlife and the pollinator population. So, on your next shopping trip, be sure to seek out native plants over newer cultivars and hybrids, especially if you prefer a hassle-free landscape with minimal upkeep. Another secret that garden center employees will share is the suggestion to plant in multiples of odd numbers, as this is one of the fundamental principles of good landscape design. Odd numbered groupings create a sense of visual interest, creating a balanced and visually pleasing design. They may suggest three or five of the same plant to help create that natural balance in the landscape. Sure, you may need only one tree or one single specimen as a focal point, but smaller shrubs and especially perennial plants are best planted in drifts of odd numbered plantings. Annual flowers are the backbone of many garden center businesses. However, like you, garden center employees have limited free time and understand the time consuming and costly nature of planting the same plants every year. For this reason, they may suggest incorporating perennials into the landscape to help maximize your gardening budget. You will plant them just once and they will return year after year, eliminating the need for yearly replanting expenses associated with annuals. Many perennials offer a diverse range of bloom times and boast attractive foliage that provides texture and contrast throughout the growing season. You can also divide perennial plants after a few years of growth to expand your plant collection for free. Not only will you save money over time, but you'll create a sustainable landscape with minimal effort. Secret number nine is advice that is tough to take. Your eye may be drawn to the plant in full bloom, but it is wise to buy a plant with buds, not blooms. Blooming plants may offer instant gratification, but budded plants have the potential for a longer bloom time once planted in your garden. You'll be able to enjoy an extended period of flowering as the buds will open gradually over time. So while at the garden center, take a moment to admire the plant in bloom, and perhaps even take a picture. But consider taking home a plant full of buds, not blooms. Last but certainly not least, some plants come with a warning right on their label. If you see the words vigorous, aggressive, or robust, you must first consider the potential implications of your garden or landscape. If you're looking for a petunia to fill a large container, the word vigorous may be beneficial. But if you're in need of a small patch of ground cover and you pick up a bugleweed that is listed as aggressive, you may have an out-of-control plant in a short period of time. These plants are not necessarily considered invasive, but they could spread rapidly and smother their neighbors. Mint would be considered another example of a vigorous plant and should be grown in containers only, never in the ground, as they spread rapidly by underground runners, quickly dominating garden beds and potentially requiring constant diligence to prevent it from spreading beyond its designated area. Now you're armed with all of the insider secrets to make informed choices and create a thriving green space.
