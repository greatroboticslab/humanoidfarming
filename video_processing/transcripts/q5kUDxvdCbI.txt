Benefits of Diverse Crop Rotations

 If we can grow corn and beans we sure as heck can grow rye. It just takes different skills. I think there's study after study that shows that diversity on the landscape yields benefits. Our longer rotation, our diverse rotation, should help us with our soil fertility. The small grains do a good job of scavenging nutrients. The cover that comes underneath the small grains will be contributing to fertility for next year's crop as well. In addition, the green manure that's going to be coming up underneath these oats should contribute to our organic matter, should raise our organic matter and improve our soil health altogether. The diversity is both a challenge but it's also very rewarding. Just to learn something new about a different crop, understand why we get kind of caught into this whole corn-soybean paradigm that that's all we believe we can do. And the reality is there's a lot of other opportunities out there if we ask the right questions and look around a little bit. I think any way we can enhance the diversification of cropping systems with deep-rooted species that offer near continuous living cover is going to come out a net winner for Iowa. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
