 Hello folks, Dan Sullivan, Sullivan Auctioneers. I'd like to bring you a preview video of a really nice retirement auction, Sullivan Absolute at Unreserved Auction on Tuesday, March 2nd at Clarkson, Kentucky. That would be about 70 miles southwest of Louisville for David and Rebecca Stussman. And we're going to kind of give you some of the highlight items we're going to feature on that auction. We'll be starting out with the 2014 John Deere 835R tractor. That tractor only has about 1,900 hours, just a little over 1,900 hours on the Stussman Retirement Auction, March 2nd. Standard of the tractor line is going to be a 2005 8420 tractor, obviously mechanical front, 4,611 hours on the 8420, a 2005 model. Also on the tractor line is going to be a 2014 6125R tractor, mechanical front. That tractor is going to sell completely with a John Deere H340 loader, 1,371 hours. Been a lot of interest in that tractor on the Stussman Auction, March 2nd, right up there at Clarkson, Kentucky. Also at 099770 Combine, going to be four-wheel drive, 2,764s on the engine, back to 1,741 on the separator hours. Folks, there have been a lot of calls. I know that our sale manager, Cody Holtz and Matt Sullivan, has talked about the sprayer. You know, the sprayer is going to be an 06, has a little age on it, but it's machine repeat. He just talked about the equipment that's well cared for, low hours, has a good story behind it. Obviously a lot of interest, only 2,132 hours on the John Deere 4720 sprayer. Also with a fast approach, you know, much anticipated planting season, I want you to take a look at this 06, 1770 planter, 12 row 30 inch. This planter has everything hanging on it, you can put on a planter. It's absolutely loaded up, precision, and if you have any questions, give David a call. He'd be glad to answer any questions. Also, on the auction, folks, there's a full line of farm support equipment to go along with it. There's construction equipment, there's dozers, and the list goes on and on. If you have any questions, reach out to David or Rebecca. They'd be glad to answer any questions for you. Also, our sale managers, Cody Holtz, has had a lot of calls on it. My nephew, Matt Sullivan, their numbers are posted online as well. Again, all going to be sold at absolute unreserved auction Tuesday, March 2nd, Clarkson, Kentucky. No buyer's premium. Again, until further notice, Sullivan Auctioneers are paying all the internet buyer's premium. Everything sells at absolute unreserved auction, transparent auction, and we hope to have you participating in the March 2nd Stutzman Auction. Thank you.
