Howto & Style
 Grab a container, adding drainage holes in the bottom. Fill it with high-quality potting mix and whip out your tomato seeds. Sprinkle a bunch on top and cover them slightly. Water in and set your container under grow lights. Use a seedling heat mat to increase germination. Cover your container with plastic to create a warm and humid environment. Bam! One week later, you'll have an explosion of tomato seedlings ready to transplant.
