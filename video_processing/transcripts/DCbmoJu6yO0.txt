 Earlier this summer, I built five identical raised garden beds and began a bit of an experiment to see if hay as mulch actually results in more weeds than straw. To do this, we covered one of the raised beds with hay that had been stored inside. We covered the second with hay that had gotten wet and moldy. And for the third, we mixed the same amount of hay into the soil to simulate tilling it in. Finally, we covered the fourth bed with dry straw. And as a control, we left the fifth bed completely bare. And now, about a month later, let's see the early results. As expected, the bare soil has sprouted a pile of weeds, as has the bed with the hay mixed in. And while the two beds with old and new hay have sprouted a few grass plants around the edges, so has the bed with straw. Which means that, so far, when it comes to weeds, hay and straw as mulch have performed exactly the same. But there's also plenty of time left in the season, so stay tuned for the final results.
