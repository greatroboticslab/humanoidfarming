 Yes, is there need of consultation in organic farming? According to me, yes. There are some aspects of the organic farming and organic supply chain where you need the guidance from some experts. The first aspect is about certification, organic standards, which organic standard has to be selected, which certification body has to be selected. At this level, we need some expert guidance. Second aspect of the consultation is about the disease and insect management in the organic farming. It is a totally different than your conventional farming. Here we have to use some tactics, crop rotation, crop mixing, and there are many other aspects which has to be known from the expert or we have to study ourselves on that. And third aspect required in the organic farming consultation is about the market and labeling. Means how to label your organic output and as per the which standard and how it should be the label and what are the rules and regulations to say the product organic and how it should be labeled. So labeling is the one thing and second thing about the marketing of your organic output. Means where is your organic buyer, how you can reach to him, how you can contract with them and how actually supply chain stages happen. At this level also we required someone's guidance in the organic farming, in the marketing of the organic output. So at this all three stages, we required the organic consultation. This is the requirement of organic consultation in the organic farming. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
