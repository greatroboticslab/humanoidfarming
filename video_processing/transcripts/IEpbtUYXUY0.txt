 From dirt to daisies, let's uncover how plants pull off their incredible transformations. Alright, let's break it down. First, it all starts with a seed. Think of it as a plant's secret starter pack. When the seed finds just the right spot with water, sunlight and soil, it wakes up and starts to sprout roots. Next comes the seedling stage. This is when the plant pushes up through the soil, showing off its first tiny leaves. With more sunlight and water, it keeps growing and growing, becoming a mature plant. Now, here's the cool part, flowers. Flowers aren't just pretty, they're plant factories, making seeds through pollination. Bees, wind or even rain can help move pollen around so seeds can form. Finally, the plant drops its seeds and the cycle starts all over again. That's how a single seed can lead to fields of flowers or forests of trees. Nature really knows how to put on a show, right?
