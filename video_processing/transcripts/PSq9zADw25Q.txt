Howto & Style
 If your brush hog shaft seal is leaking, it's real easy to replace and you don't even have to take apart your gearbox. Take off your PTO shaft and then using a wire brush clean off the shaft so that when you put on the new seal you won't damage it. Drill two holes in the old seal and then take in some external wood screws, put them into the front of the seal and using a set of vice grips, pull the old seal out. It should pop out pretty easily and make sure that you have a pan underneath to catch the gear oil. Put some clean oil on the shaft so the seal will slide on easily, push it on with your hand, use a wood block to make sure that the seal is started evenly all the way around and then use a brass pin to fully seat the seal. And here comes a black snake to check out my work. It only took 30 minutes to replace this seal and we were back brush hogging and after eight hours it was still leak free.
