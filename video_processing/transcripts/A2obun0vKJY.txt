 Here we are today at Vantage Point Equestrian. We are getting ready to rebale. We started our rebailing of our 100% Timothy. And what we're doing is net wrap, cutting the net wrap and then bailing those up. We're rolling them here with the top line feeder, bail feeder, the chainless feeder. And running a little 42.30 for the baler. And a 50.70 New Holland baler with a Coons 1034 accumulator. And this is about a 10 bail accumulation is what we can run with this guy. And then we slide them onto a deck and then we got our little grapple and skid steer that kind of puts it all together for us. And then we put it up in the hay shed. So there you have it. There's our little setup today on our rebailing operations in Alberta, Canada.
