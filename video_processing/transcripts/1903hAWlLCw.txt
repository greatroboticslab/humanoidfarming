 Agroforestry System Design In order to make benefits from the interactions between trees and farming, it is important to develop a plan for establishment and management. This acronym can help you oversee the future of your own agroforestry design. It is made out of simple questions, purpose, advice, measures of success, agroecology, starting points, adaptive management, layout. There are many purposes you may need to achieve. Let's take an example. You may need to maintain the same level of food crop production on the land and produce energy. Solution can be a wood biomass planted in a right way which does not necessarily reduce crop or animal production too much, but which is, in the same time, sufficient enough for production of biomass. So, both the crop and energy is produced from the same piece of land. You may consider forming a partnership with the partners which can handle woody components instead of you. Success measures is a crucial parameter which can decide wherever your agroforestry plan is effective. Simple counting of yield per unit area or live weight gain per unit area may not be the best practice. Agroforestry adds timber volumes per unit area, so it creates multiple outputs that must be counted from a single piece of land. Imagine field of one hectare of walnuts, from which you can harvest 100%. Same field can also produce a 100% of wheat. But if you combine those, you can get 40% of walnuts and 80% of wheat. If you want the same production without combining, you may need 20% larger field. Getting carbon footprint lower is a benefit for the nature and production as well. Planting of trees on pastures can improve the animal welfare and their productivity. Trees and shrubs can improve soil fertility, control erosion and water loss. And deep-rooted tree may get its nutrient requirements from a deep layer of soil to avoid competition with a crop. Radical change is not necessarily the most appropriate. You may be able to gradually adapt your existing systems. For instance, planting trees into your pasture land or introducing animals into orchards. With trees becoming part of your production, you must make a plan to protect them. Avoid damage from pests and livestock. Agroforestry system layouts need to be ergonomically designed to ensure access of machinery and consideration of safety. Agroecological considerations also affect the layout design. For instance, to decrease wind velocity, plant trees in a solid row. lil Isa lows From great To help us identify the signs and signs for the sake of종imen.
