Howto & Style
 Five years ago we decided to move to the country so we bought 20 acres of forested land, had it cleared, and planted five acres of pasture. After several years of mowing and maintaining the pasture we decided to try our hand and making some hay. We own this Kubota L3901 compact tractor but all the other equipment was borrowed from a friend. First we cut the hay with a sickle bar mower and if you haven't used a sickle bar it is one of the most satisfying things to mow with. After letting it dry for two days we raked it and baled it. Now this being our first time using this equipment there was a steep learning curve especially with the baler and I actually got the very first bale stuck in the baler and had to pry it out. But after that things went pretty smooth and after a couple hours we had a hundred bales of hay ready to be picked up.
