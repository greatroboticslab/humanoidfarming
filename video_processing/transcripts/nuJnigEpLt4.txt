Storage Shed - Easy Low Cost Strong Solution (refilling with mulch hay)

 Just got back from picking up 34 square bales of mulch hay from the same person who I just recently bought some round bales of hay. Really nice tight bales. They're unsprayed. They'll stack well. They're dry. They were stored inside. They're going to make great bedding for our chickens. And so now before it rains and before we get a visit from my mom, I'd like to get them undercover. So this will be a review of the really simple cattle panel structure that was put up. I forget exactly when, but I'll link here to the video where I talked about the building of this. This is three panels. Boy, it's been a minute. So yes, three panels. A very professional documentary here. Three cattle panels. Really simple. They're open on both sides. This worked really nicely for an informal way to hold hay and leaf bags that we had kicking around in the fall. And so now what I'd like to do is pack it to the absolute gills with these square bales. And it'd be interesting to see a three cattle panel little storage shed like this. How many square bales can it hold? There's a whole lot of water that periodically will run under this area. I'm trying to redirect it to the outside, but just a provision for that potential. We're not going to definitely not put the bales directly on the ground. That will ruin them. And definitely don't want to put them just on pallets on the ground because the pallets will rot away quickly and the water won't have a chance to get out. So we're doing pallets on logs. That was how it was set up in the fall. And that worked really nicely. The leaf bags that were in here stayed pretty dry. And then where we need a little extension, we've got milk crates and a board. And we'll pack in the bales in such a way that as Sasha harvests into here for bedding for the chicken coop, once we get this section done, she'll be able to more comfortably walk in and access them. But yeah, it works pretty well. There's a little bit of snow drift into here, which I'm going to sweep out a little more. The only reason that happened is because this was mainly empty. And I suspect once it's packed right up to the very top with the bales, it should do just fine. But we might end up putting another plastic flap on one side or the other just to keep drift out. I'll start packing in on the middle of this side. And then once that's full, we can pack around to the other side. Good old sled will let me bring three in at a time. A little bit of a dry run here, but the snow should make it easier for the rest of it. Four at a time seems sketchy, but I'm going to try. We'll see. Gotta love this little jet sled thing. Boy, I'm glad I invested in that. The nice thing about a good stack system in the truck is that it tends to want to stay on the truck. And since I wasn't driving real fast, I was able to do what I call the farmer strap down, where you got the nice ratchet strap. It didn't reach all the way over, so it's tied into a bill. At least it looks neon green. Looks safe, right? The little lady's pretty neat. She's very independent-minded. She's the only one hanging out with me over here. Everybody else is elsewhere, but she's catching all the fun worms and the bits. Got about a little less than half the truck. It's going to easily fit in here, I think. We shall see. Square barrels in a rounded space. It's not going to work out to be exactly an easy stacking system, but they're packing in really nicely. And still a fair bit of room to go, and I haven't gone on to the far east side yet. That is all 34 square bells packed in. And very clearly, if I had been more organized, or I had kind of planned a little further in advance, I could have gotten out to the edge. Although it's nice to be tucked in a bit to keep most of the rain and snow off. And that's 34 bales with almost this last whole panel worth of space available. So the hens can duck into here if there's a rain out of nowhere, or hawk or something like that. And if they can get up there, there's a couple of nooks where they can lay some eggs, but that's also easy for us to see. They like laying eggs in and amongst the bales. So as long as we can lay it out in a way where we can get to them later, then it works. This really simple structure took a handful of hours to build the three cattle panels. I bought used from a hog farmer who was wrapping up their operations, and they sold me each panel for $8 a piece used. I had to hammer out some bits here and there to make them smooth again, but overall they're fine. So you can find used cattle panels and they're much cheaper. So $24 worth of cattle panels. The greenhouse poly, the UV stabilized greenhouse poly, that was free from a high tunnel that was getting re-skinned. You can see the line from the old pipe that used to run through it. No need to buy new greenhouse plastic, especially for small structures like this. And then the rest of the the lumber that built it out is very low cost waste wood from a local mill. The pallets were free. So this is a sub $30 project, quarter of a day worth of effort, and it holds, it would easily hold 40 bales of hay for or straw for bedding or for feeding animals. Strongly recommended. Next pass would be to actually organize and clean up around here. But this time of year everything looks pretty, pretty grumpy, and we'll tidy up when there's actually some time. But yeah, that's my half year review of a very inexpensive, very simple, very approachable structure for storing materials. Something like this could also be for a riding mower or for tools or for some hybrid use, maybe a divider in the middle. The choice is yours. Use your imagination. Thanks for watching.
