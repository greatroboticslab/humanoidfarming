 The U.S. cattle herd is at a 70-year low due to liquidation from drought, pushing cattle prices to record highs earlier this year. But how long will that market last? Tag Day's Michelle Rook joins us with an update on the state of the beef industry. Just how long the tail is on this historic cattle market is a function of both supply and demand now and moving forward, and especially how fast producers respond to market signals when it comes to herd rebuilding. Market experts tell me that while herd contraction is slowing, it hasn't reversed, which could keep supplies tight and prices strong for a while. Cattle numbers are record low. In lieu of USD's mid-year cattle inventory report, CattleTax released their own projections, estimating beef cow inventories 400,000 below a year ago. Beef cow slaughter has been down sharply, but not enough to overcome the record low beef heifer inventory as of January 1, 2024. It's pretty unavoidable that it was still ticking smaller yet year over year as of July 1. It still looks like it'll be fractionally lower as of January 1 of this coming year. He says beef replacement heifer inventories are likely steady to slightly higher, but remain historically tight. Estimated up a narrow 50,000 head from last year, but will be influenced by the return of drought. The point is that that's only fractionally so, and numbers are still more or less at cycle lows and record lows, dropping below the prior lows in the last cycle. CattleFacts also projects the 2024 calf crop to be record low, reflecting a smaller breeding herd coming into the year. We're anticipating that this year's calf crop will be about 700,000 head smaller or down around 2% compared to 2023. That will continue to translate into tighter feeder cattle and fed cattle supplies. Certainly with the placement distribution, we're looking for tighter fed cattle supplies for the remainder of the year. That should be price-supported. And it also sets up an optimistic five-year outlook. We're still seeing, you know, in that time window, a cycle high. We'll see prices increase and markets contract. But at the broader view of this market, we still have a very positive view for the market overall because beef demand has been so robust. Yet he sees increased volatility and cautions that while rebuilding has been slow, producers will still respond to higher prices. Slow rebuild is just not the way market was. That combined with increased efficiency, higher carcass weights, and the beef on dairy revolution will offset the lower numbers now and for the next five years.
