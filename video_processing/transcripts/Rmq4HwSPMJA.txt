 Here's how you can take control of bugs and insects around your farmyard. First, there is a BT specifically designed for mosquitoes and black flies. You can put these tablets in standing water around the farm to kill these pests. Second, use dry imidacloprid. That's the active ingredient from gaucho seed treatment and spread it on your lawn once in the spring and once in the fall. Immediately water it in with an inch of rain or irrigation. Third, spray Temple or Talstar at least once a month around your house and farmyard. By following these steps you should have a relatively insect-free summer and if you're worried about safety consider this. BT is a natural protein labeled even in organic production. Imedacloprid is from the nicotine family and is relatively safe to humans and animals. Tempo and Talstar are synthetic reproductions of the insect killing portion of the chrysanthemum flower. All are pretty safe products but lots of dead bugs.
