Howto & Style
 If you've got bananas that are way too ripe, don't throw them out. Instead, chop them up, then put them in a blender cup, add two eggshells, and a tiny bit of water. Blend it. Empty it out into a bowl. What you have now is a natural fertilizer from things that you normally would have thrown out. This is perfect for when you're transplanting your plants or your seedlings. Dig a little hole in the soil, add a little bit of the mixture in it, and then plant your seedlings. This will give your plants the boost they need to flourish.
