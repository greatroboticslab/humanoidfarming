 Let me explain how the Sumerians revolutionized agriculture with their smart crop rotation techniques. You see, instead of depleting the soil by continuously planting the same crops, they understood the importance of alternating crops to maintain fertility. For instance, they often followed cereal crops like barley with legumes, such as lentils, which naturally replenished nitrogen in the ground. Suddenly, this approach not only improved yields, but also ensured their fields remain productive year after year. In fact, these early innovations laid the groundwork for sustainable farming practices we still use today. But it was not just about smart farming. This technique supported their growing populations and thriving city-states. So, as it turns out, the Sumerians were not just farmers. They were agricultural pioneers shaping the future of food production.
