 So my tomato plants are due to be pruned so I'm gonna make a video to show you how to do it. When you're learning how to prune tomato plants it can definitely be very overwhelming but it's actually really easy. You only need to do two things. You're gonna prune for good airflow and to get rid of all the suckers. That's it let me show you. For good airflow and to prevent your tomato plants from getting sick you want to take off anything that's gonna touch the ground. So this guy right here needs to go and this guy right here needs to go. So we'll clip them off. To get rid of the suckers you're going to look for your main stem and then find a branch that's going straight out. Anything in the armpit of that is a sucker. So this guy right here is a sucker. So we need to get rid of him. Sometimes the suckers are really little like these guys. These are easy to get off but the suckers can actually get huge and be the tallest part of your tomato plant. Like look at this one. Holy cow look at how big that was. Now look at how much better that looks. Way less bushy so you're gonna have way better airflow and now that all the suckers are gone the tomato plant can actually start working on making tomatoes instead of making more tomato plant. That's it it's that simple. Don't overthink it. Happy gardening.
