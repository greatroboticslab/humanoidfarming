Why Graze This Cover Crop With Pigs Instead of Cows?

 I spent a couple hundred dollars planting the cover crops on this five acre field around me here. Why in the world would I put pigs on it when they can root it up instead of cows? The summers in Mississippi are hot and it is incredibly difficult to grow forages that are highly nutritious for our pigs. Pigs require much more efficient nutrition than cows do because of their gastrointestinal tracts. So I grew this highly nutritious cover crop for our pigs so that I could reduce my feed costs. They may knock it down. It may not regrow as well but I will save more money by growing this cover crop for pigs than if I just purchased feed for them. During the fall time of the year we have acorns and pumpkins and many other things that our pigs can eat and reduce their feed costs. However during June and July we do not have a whole lot nutritious forages so I put the pigs in this large cover crop field so that we could reduce their feed costs and increase the quality of the pork they produce.
