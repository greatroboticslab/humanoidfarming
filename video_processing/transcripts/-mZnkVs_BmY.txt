Howto & Style
 Let's grow some onions in containers. Onions are a versatile and delicious vegetable that can be grown both in gardens and containers. Start by choosing the right container, onions do best in well-draining soil. Select a container that is at least 12 to 18 inches deep and has a good drainage system. Prepare the soil by loosening it and mix in some organic compost or adding bone meal and manure to feed your onions to improve the soil structure. Grow the onions by spacing them evenly in the container, keeping the main bulb about one inch below the rim. Cover light layer of soil and water them well. Water and fertilize, onions love moisture, so make sure to keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy. Once the plants have established themselves, you can reduce watering to once a week or even less, with a little care and attention, you can successfully grow onions in containers. Happy gardening!
