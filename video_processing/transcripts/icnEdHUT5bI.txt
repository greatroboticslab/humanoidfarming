 My name is Daniel Cassioppo. My wife and I own All-American Rentals. We have all sorts of customers. It's just your typical homeowners up to smaller contractors in the area, small tools all the way up to you know skip loaders and backhoes and small tractors and such that they like using. Tory Williams, sales manager RDO Southwest for the Compact Construction Equipment Division. We've been working with All-American Rental for just over three years now. With the products that we had and the service capabilities that we had we fit very well with his business. We had to go in, sell RDO, sell ourselves and really build a relationship. It's something you can't buy. You have to build it and so we worked with him for about a year before he purchased anything and it's just kind of taken off since that point. We had a lot of different brands of equipment it was kind of hard to maintain and get parts from several different stores and not have just that one location to be able to go to. Switching over to the newer equipment with RDO has really helped customers just be happier with newer running equipment you know that can actually get the job done quicker and more efficient. How long is it going to take to get fixed? You know how many millions of dollars of parts do you have on the shelf? How many service bays do you have? How many service trucks do you have where if the machine's out on a job and it's down and I can't haul it in? How fast can you guys be there? The availability of the parts is probably the biggest thing. I don't like to keep a lot of stock if it gets expensive after a while so if something does break or I need a replacement part or a seal kit or something like that they have a lot of that stuff on hand already so I'm able to drive out there and get it and replace it pretty quickly so that there's less downtime. Really the other thing too was our RDO Promise was a big selling point for him as well as you know in the first year of ownership when that machine goes down being that it's brand new we'll roll another one out there take the other one back roll a new one out he's happy and also his customers happy so for us it's kind of a two for one and at the end of the day if his customers happy and all American rentals is happy they're going to be a customer for a really long time.
