 Did you know it's super easy to propagate a sensitive area from a leaf cutting? Let me show you how. First, grab a healthy plant and make sure it's well hydrated by watering it a couple days prior to propagation. Now take a sharp blade or pruners and disinfect them. Take a leaf that's not too old and use the entire leaf or cut it into segments like this that are at least two inches long. The angle cut just looks better and will help you remember which side is up and down. Now let's set our cuttings to the side for two days so it can callus over and dry. We're almost done. Take our cuttings and place them in a propagation mix. Place the pot in an area that'll receive bright indirect light. Water when the soil is dry and just make sure it's not soggy. Check them occasionally and be patient. The end result will be worth it.
