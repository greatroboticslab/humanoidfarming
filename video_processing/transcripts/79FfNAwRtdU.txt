 Stop planting the same crops every year. Here's why you should switch it up. Crop rotation is the practice of growing different types of crops in the same area across a sequence of seasons. This simple technique can prevent soil depletion, reduce pests and diseases, and improve soil structure. By rotating crops, you're essentially giving your soil a break and replenishing its nutrients naturally. Healthier soil means stronger, more resilient plants and ultimately, better yields. So, mix things up and watch your farm thrive. Happy farming!
