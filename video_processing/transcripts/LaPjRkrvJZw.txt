 all right guys welcome back it is Sunday morning Sunday morning and I have a dilemma here I guess it's a good dilemma to have but maybe not all right first off I got some of this hay baled it gave a lot more than I thought I think I do have all my yields from last year recorded I go field by field and log the number of bales that each field gave as a reference and so I got two wagons here and I think we did like 200 and I don't know we got to bear with me here we did have a dump truck load taken off of these wagons um it was over 200 bales which doesn't sound like a lot but I'm not done the reason I'm not done is I could not finish last night and it was five o'clock when I started baling and tell me the battery's dead in this thing I was afraid it was on in the box the other day and that seems to be what the problem is so I started baling around five o'clock uh had a stop we loaded up the uh loaded up the guy kept going and sure enough it got to be too tough the hay got uh uh we started getting due pretty early yesterday evening yeah battery's dead so I can't even all right uh the moisture monitor was spiking up to I'll set this aside so I remember to put a battery in it the moisture was spiking up to 25-26% uh in the in the evening now during the day from about 5 to 6 30 uh it was like 14 so 14 is good enough for me um I had to leave yeah some of these are wet uh I had to leave uh two windrows under the trees I left because uh it was up to 35 that's way too wet those bales will never dry and they're not going to dry anyway so um I did leave two windrows under the trees and probably what's going to happen I'm just going to take the tedder up and ted them apart uh and just let it just let it in the field it's green manure for uh next year but the problem is I could not finish last night I had to stop I stopped around 7 7 30 and I have three windrows left up in the field which three windrows may not sound like a whole lot but that is that real long field that's on a contour that's probably a quarter mile long or more so till you get from one end to the other long story short I probably have 75 bales still in the field um to bale all right today's Sunday I'm not big for working on Sunday but there is a chance of rain today uh more so in the late evening I'm going to wait and see what kind of a day this is going to turn into it's morning now it's pretty early um I'm going to see what the what the weather's going to do today if it's pretty much going to stay clear till the evening I'm going to take the rake back up and just roll the windrows from one side to the other just to move them around a little bit um make sure they're dry and once they get dry I might take a wagon up and bale those last 75 bales so uh that's a long way to say I didn't get done last night because it just got tough so um the uh everything's working fine mechanically I didn't have any problems um and the uh oh the weights the 986 with the wheel weights um I have to I put 600 pounds on here and uh you do feel it the tractor does feel a little bit heavier the thing I noticed is it's a lot rougher it rides a lot rougher than it used to um but that's okay so um I forget how many bale I have to look I wrote it down how many bales I actually did yesterday I'll have to see I went through a uh a ball of twine per per knot or per needle per side so uh but they're pretty heavy pretty heavy bales and you know some of them are just I have to be very careful when I put these away because some of these are a little wetter than I'd like them to be so I have to see I'm hoping we're not going to get any kind of yeah there's a wet spot hoping we're not going to have any type of molding or anything like that so so I still have hay in the field it's raked didn't get to bale it last night um and if I do go to bale some today I'm gonna have to pull everything out of here I gotta pull these two wagons back out and get a fresh wagon we didn't get to unload anything it just got late last night so here we are I'm gonna have by the end of today I'm gonna have three full wagons and uh weather wise I should cut more hay today because it's gonna be nice but I'm just gonna let it go for being on a Sunday I don't want to go too wild here so it's supposed to be we have a heat wave coming more back up in the 90s which is good hay drying weather so we'll um I have to keep an eye on the forecast but um yeah I got two loaded wagons and a dump truck load out of here and it's already uh it's already more than I did last year even with the about 75 bales I have left to to bale today so I'll uh keep you guys posted and find out what we do um if we do decide to go out and bale some more so I'll come back so now I'm going to give you guys the PA farms swamp update here you've been following the progress of this wet hole so far all summer the water's gone um so in a matter of a week here without any rain or uh I shouldn't say a week without any rain without torrential rains um this has finally drained off uh the uh there's no more standing water here so we just have to wait till it's not so muddy wait till it dries up we do have a heat wave coming at least three days in the high 90s with no rain in the forecast so I'm thinking we'll be able to get into this I want to try to do it all in one day I want to rip it around again and plant the tillodradishes we're also putting in some turnips and a couple other little things uh the deer will probably love it this winter and fall but uh get some organic matter here so like I say the plan is to rip it up again plant the seeds uh we're going to drag over the top to cover them and a lot of that loose hay that I have up in the barn and some of the wet bales we're going to put I'm going to just coat the top of this with some uh organic matter I guess you could say just let it grow up and see what happens I haven't decided yet if I want to run the vibra shank through that dead corn right there you see all that corn is dead and there's no grain there um so we might widen this a little bit uh or just let it there I don't know if you guys can see it I'll zoom in you'll see right there it's walking away from me there's a little fawn there's a deer fawn here it still has its spots um it's there every day uh all day long uh just eating the grass on the side of the road um there was a mother and two young ones here in the spring and I think the mother got hit out on the road because it was laying there and uh now this fawn I think was one of the orphan fawns from that mother um so it's just here eating every day it's it's spooky of people so you can't really get close to it but uh yeah it's a little pet fawn here that's here every day so uh more grain eaters but I'll just let it go so yeah that's what we got going on the uh wet hole is dry you you
