 In today's society, monoculture can be very harmful to the agriculture industry. This can drain soil nutrients, allowing only one type of plant to be grown in an area, and also causing soil erosion. To solve this, crop rotation should be applied to farmlands. This can increase biodiversity, give soil nutrients, and lessen the chance for soil erosion. In turn, the increase of biodiversity can provide a variety of foods to the rapidly increasing population, and increase the amount of time fertile soil can be used. This method can also address the problem of rapid urbanization due to a wider variety of produce provided in higher population areas. Also, a big plus for crop rotation is that it uses less land compared to monoculture. So to conclude, crop rotation can be seen as a viable solution for rapid urbanization. Thanks for listening.
