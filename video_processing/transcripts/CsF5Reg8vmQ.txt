 Welcome to the first video of Minecraft Skyblock here on PvP Wars. The server just reset about 24 hours ago, a little over that, but the point is it's a brand new reset and I can't wait to get started. If you guys are going to come and check out the server, make sure to use my custom IP on screen, nc.pvpwars.net. The first thing I recommend when hopping on Skyblock is to go to this NPC, the tutorial NPC, and go through all the tutorial stuff because you'll get a lot of free loot. As well, if you do slash streak, you can get your daily streak, what gives you a ton of good rewards, a ton of crate keys for free for logging on the server every day. The loot gets better and better over time. But if I go on Pv1, I did all the tutorial stuff and I got a ton of cool items I do want to go ahead and go over. We got some spawners we'll probably use at some point. We got a kit that I probably don't need, but we got some XP vouchers. I'm going to claim this farming XP voucher. I don't know if that was good or not. We'll do it with the mining. And we got to level 3 on our mining skill because what these do is basically upgrade our skills. We'll go ahead and do the combat one as well. If we go ahead and type slash skills, you can see there's a ton of different skills. So far in mining, if I take a look, we have a decent bit of loot from here. We got a rare orb, but I don't know what that does. Let's go ahead and take a look. Oh, it's an enchant orb. That's pretty interesting. And then we got some XP we'll claim. How much XP do we have? Oh, we have 125,000. Wow. We got a basic orb. We'll go in PV12 and put away the enchants. And we got a crystal key, what is a pretty good key. I'm also going to go ahead and turn off my toggles. And I'm going to disable a few things. I'm going to toggle off the quest navigation because I don't need it currently. Scoreboard time, I think I'll toggle off. And we'll get rid of the item in our inventory that's taking up the ninth slot. Okay, we should be good for now. But anyways, we have a ton of crate keys we need to go ahead and open. I believe we have six vote. What? We can get a ton of good loot to start out with. A ton of money, mob coins, and all sorts of good loot. So we'll go ahead and open up the vote. We got 1,000 emerald mob coins, what is pretty good. An infinite player shop. 100,000 in money. What's not bad? A million XP. 200k in cash. And another 150k in cash. What isn't too bad? We go ahead and go into the void crates. We got 2,000 emerald mob coins, a water wand, a glitch kit, a self money booster, another one, and money. Perfect. And then we're going to go ahead and go to the crystal crate, open this up. We got a watering pot for seeds. What are custom seeds on the server? So we'll probably use that at some point. And we also have pet candy, what I'll save for now. We also did get a tutorial pickaxe, which is pretty decent. But I want to see if kit glitch, the top rank, is better than the actual pickaxe that is given here. It is indeed better by a long shot. We're going to go into PV, I believe, 12. And we're going to go ahead and put away some of this stuff that we, of course, do not need for now. We got all our tools and our armor we'll go ahead and put on. And there we go. We are situated with all our tools and whatnot. There's quests on the server that we're going to save for a different time. But quests give you a ton of free loot just by doing them. So we'll do that at some point. But now the moment of truth, we got to create our island. So slash IS. And we're going to do the original island template. Which should give us a small island and our cobble cube or tower gen, I should say. Because back when I played this server years ago, this used to be called a cobble cube. So that's why I called it that. But it is actually now a tower gen. Tower gens, you can go ahead and upgrade and actually get better storage and loot within this. It's pretty OP when it gets to a higher level. But I don't need to upgrade it for now. If we take a look in shop, I want to see how much an axolotl is worth. 900,000. So we almost have enough to buy another. But I probably won't buy. But we have three of them. So easily we have 2.7 million worth of spawners already. Just in like raw money. But I think I do want to go ahead and start building a little spawner farm. I think what we'll do is use some deep slate brick. As well as polished deep slate. So we'll get the polished bit of deep slate. We'll get four stacks. And we're going to use it wisely to build a little area for our axolotl. Get it to a stack. And we'll buy four stacks of that. And that right there was like 50,000 or something almost. Put into just blocks. Anyways, the point is we're going to build a axolotl farm just to start off. So we can make some income. And I think what the plan is we're going to make it manual for now. So we'll just make a simple old axolotl farm. So I think we're going to make the floor out of bricks right here. And we're going to have to start destroying stuff. I'm going to tear down this island because I would like to move everything around. As well as the tower gen because we can move it. So we'll go ahead and get sorted with all the area of our island. We have two pieces of bedrock. For some reason, what I mean is fine. Just kind of weird. Okay, so now if I go to island go, it should be right on this block. So here's what I'm going to do. I think I can adjust where my player spawns at. So we don't have to show this bedrock anywhere. Except for when we're flying around. We'll make some slabs. Go like that and then we'll build around and see if this looks good. So if I go to island go, we should be right at the center here. So there we go. That's our island spawn point that we'll spawn at every time. What is pretty decent. So I built a little platform. I'll probably decorate it over time. But I'll probably get an admin to remove this one piece of bedrock. Because it's kind of in the way. And I would like to just not have it there. Just so we can make the island look nice. I'll go ahead and use PV2 for now for my spare blocks. That I'll use for designing. And I think I'll move the tower gen to the back over here. And that's where the tower gen will go. Now we'll make our little axolotl farm right in the front here. So right when we come to the island, we will see the axolotl farm. So I'm going to go out five blocks. Go out one. And then one, two, three, four, five. Do it on the sides as well. I'm going to buy some more stone brick. Because we're going to need it. I'm going to buy another stack of stone brick. So now I'm going to build the axolotl farm. So we need a trap door. Let's go ahead and buy a singular trap door. And we're going to put it right here. And then we'll put a slab right here. And we're going to put some on the outside as well. Now the reason we need the slabs is so we'll shift under it. And then start attacking the axolotl. And we're also going to get a singular water bucket. And the reason for that is because if we waterlog this, the axolotl won't die. And it'll stack up over time. It's pretty convenient. Okay, so now this right here is going to be where the water platform is going to go. I'm also going to redecorate this a little bit. Just make it look similar to the floor pattern. Is there polished slabs? Yes, there is. Perfect. So if I'm not mistaken, I go out about this far. And the corner would be right here where I placed the water bucket. And then we put it in all the corners. And eventually if we make like a blaze farm or something that is a mob that we can use this farm for, we'll use it. Or we'll demolish this if we need to. Okay, so we place the water down and it should not flow in there. Perfect. And we do that in each corner. Then we'll go up three blocks, have the spawner here, and then the block will be right there. And I guess we'll put three blocks tall just in case. I don't know. Just be safe. Grab out our axolotls. Place it down. Okay, so one of my axolotl spawners disappeared. I literally have no clue where it went. I'm pretty sure breaking it does not get rid of the spawner, but I lost one of them. I don't really know how. But I mean, we're just going to go ahead and stack this in. And I guess we'll deal with it. It's not the end of the world. I'm going to replace the pillar with, I believe, three glowstone. It should be good. I'm still really confused about that axolotl. Kind of annoying that we lost the spawner. Let's go into Pv2. Put away our blocks that we have here. And if I need spare buckets, I'll put those in there as well. So now if I go ahead, shift, go under here. We can now kill axolotls and get XP in the chat from an XP booster that's currently active. As well, we can also get mob coins, the gold ones. If we go ahead and do mob coins space shop, we can actually see the information of what mobs give what mob coins. So if we want emerald mob coins, we can actually go and kill iron golems, zombify piglins, and snowmen. And if we want gold, we can kill all types of other mobs. It's basically the whole system. And we also get frog spawn. With the looting five, we make even more frog spawn. But I'm kind of curious, how much does it sell for per one? Let's go to mob loot. Take a look at the frog spawn. 1.5 per one. So if I were to do a sell all, that's only $116 there. What isn't too great, but I mean, it's better than nothing. And one thing we can go ahead and do with the XP is use it in the XP shop. If I need to buy anything with XP, we'll probably buy it from here. With some of our money, I think we're going to go ahead and upgrade the tower gen before we call it wraps. So we'll go ahead and go into the loot upgrade and we'll go ahead and start upgrading this. And now if we go ahead and upgrade to level six, we get copper and then we'll keep leveling it up. And now we can get lapis. And I don't think we'll go for 16 because I don't think we can afford all the way to 16. And I'd like to do at least all the way to the emerald each time. What I want to focus on is these. If I go in PV1, we have some mob coin generators that I got from crate keys that I opened that I got from my streak. And of course, I do need to go ahead and figure out how to use these mob coin generators so I can make a ton of mob coins off of them. But if we take a simple look at them, they have speed and tier. So we get gold mob coins from these two. Every two minutes, it'll generate one. And then every four minutes and 30 seconds on this one, it'll generate a emerald. But it's actually really, really good. So we're going to do slash is go. And I think to our right is where we'll set it up. It's going to be the basic area of where we're going to set this whole thing up. And I have a simple concept on how I want to build this. I just need a lot of blocks. So we're going to go ahead and get some hoppers. So 32 for 160,000 because we need a lot of hoppers for this design. So here's the simple plan that we're going to go with. We need to go ahead and actually make the chest system. So right here is going to be where all the chests are going to be. Let's go ahead and buy a stack of chests. And we're going to make it a five by five, I believe. So we're just going to go along, make a five by five chest system. Four more. There we go. And then we're just going to copy it along the whole way here. What I think I'm going to go ahead and do is put the hoppers on the back. And then having some stacked above. And then we're going to go ahead, buy some blue ice. We'll get only a stack. So the whole concept is we're going to have a whole system going back this way that flows onto this ice. And then they'll just loop around all the loot. If it gets too full at the end, a way to fix that is making a loop. And then it'll eventually all go in. Just a good system to make sure we never overflow. We'll get some gray glass because we only need five pieces of this. I think it'll look good. So we'll put it along here. And then we'll go ahead, put the outline. Now we'll go ahead and get some pressure plates. So I think we'll get like three or four. And we need four water buckets at least to make sure this all works out properly. Okay. So I was figuring out how the water is going to work. We're going to put water here and then one water right here. Go ahead and put the pressure plates on the backside. Now it flows into one spot. Then we're going to put pressure plates on these spots. And we put the last two water buckets in. And there we go. We got an infinite loop. So if I were to drop an item over here, let's say, it's going to go around the whole system. Okay. So everything is patched up and we have the little area where it's going to flow down now into this little loop system. So we're going to grab out our first mob coin generator. I want to see before I actually place it over the void is if I break it, will it just go in my inventory? Yes, it will. And I do want to see where it actually spawns. I'm guessing it's going to spawn right on the top, but we're just going to have to wait and see what happens here in a minute in 30 seconds. Okay. So it spawns it a block above this. So technically, if I were to have a block here, it's going to spawn right here. And I think I know how we're going to make this. It's pretty simple. So we're going to go out from here about eight blocks. Now, what I'm going to do is add a little barrier around all this for the time being. And under here is where we'll put all the generators. So I believe they're all three tall. So if I wanted to place it, I'd have to place it here. And then it works perfectly. So now we go ahead, grab out the other ones, place them down. And there we go. We got our mob coin generator area. And then we'll expand this out for the whole length of this area. Oh, yeah. And there's one more thing I need to do. I need to grab three water buckets, put some down here. And there we go. Perfect. So now right when they spawn in, they'll flow down. And then we get the mob coins in the system. And then they go in the chest. Perfect. So we're going to wait for this 30 seconds. And then we're going to see if it does what I'm expecting it to do. What is to spawn right on this block, like right on the very top here. And then just flow in the system. There we go. It did what I wanted. So now it should be in one of these chests. I don't really know where it's going to end up at. But it's going to end up in the system somewhere. So that's better than nothing. And if I go ahead and farm this wheat here in the enchanted warp, it says I gained farming XP. And above my hotbar, it says I have almost 350,000 total XP. And if we take a look at skills, we need 350,000 to actually hit level four. But I need to get all the way up to exactly that. So I can hit level four to unlock potatoes. Because at warp enchanted is where I am currently. So if I go warp enchanted, it'll teleport me here. And I just go over to the wheat. But we're going to farm really quickly here for like less than a minute. Just to get our skill up to level four. One more update and we should be good. Here we go. And we got a crimson key and 2,000 gold mob coins. And before we go to the next warp, I do want to mention. Since last video, I did actually AFK. Like it's been not even 24 hours since I recorded the last video. But the point is, there's already mob coins coming in. I did change the blue ice to deep slate stone brick. Because it was having issues with the farm. Where it was skipping over this almost every time. So I needed to make it slower. Just so we can make sure the items go in the hoppers. It only skips around once or none. And I also have 20 million. What I do want to mention, how I got this 20 million on the scoreboard in my balance. I opened my premium wheel of fortunes. At warp, W-O-F, wheel of fortune. And I opened up my normal ones. What you do get from the daily login or the street command. You get them every time you claim this. So I got a lot of free loot from this. What is pretty OP. Before we go find potatoes, we do need to go ahead and go to the crimson crate. Let's see what we get out of this. We got a piggy pet. What I think is one of the best pets you can possibly get in the game. Because it gives you a cell bonus. So we actually got a good pull out of this. Now if I right click, there we go. We got the piggy pet. It's activated. I think what we'll do is level it up with some pet candy. Because we might as well get it to 64 on its level. Oh my gosh. And then we'll go ahead and put this one on. And it should get it to 155. Perfect. We almost get a 0.1 multiplier extra in cell bonuses. That's insane. Anyways, the way to get to the warps or zones is you go to the left of spawn. And you look for this NPC by the little pirate ship thing. And we're gonna go, I believe, to the castle. And somewhere in the castle, there should be potatoes somewhere. Oh, there's a helper here. Hello. Stick to where? I'm asking helper where the potatoes are. There are none here. It's apparently in Molten. Okay. I was completely wrong. It's not the castle. Good thing I asked the helper by asking where potato was. So there we go. We got potatoes. Potatoes are right here. So we should be able to mine these now that we're level four on our skill. We made off of seven potatoes about like $200 almost. Not bad. Plus our piggy pet made us 15 extra. How much XP do I get from potatoes? I'm kind of curious. So I get about the same amount as I was getting before. A little bit over. So about 200 XP more every time I'm efficiently farming. But we need to go ahead and actually get a harvester hoe off AH with our money. And I think the cheapest one is about 5 million. So we're gonna cop one of those. Get ourselves a harvester hoe. And we're gonna go ahead and look into this. So the harvester hoe is pretty OP because you can upgrade it. And you can make way more money using your emerald mob coins. Okay. So here's the plan. We're gonna upgrade our potatoes just a little bit. Not too much with all our emerald mob coins. So I spent about 500 almost there. We'll get it up another bit. No, we'll get it up three. So we got it up three levels. For about 3,500 emerald mob coins. What is quite a lot. But it should make us way more money for the time I have to spend here. So now I made off of 50. I made 1.25k. And we can also turn on auto-inv. If we shift right click to go to this menu again, we can automatically enable where it sells every second. And it also auto-invs. So now it should all go into my inventory and I don't have to worry about picking it all up. And it'll sell for me. And now that I have my piggy pet, we should be able to get going on leveling it up. Because the way we level it up is I believe by selling. Oh no, it does level up. Okay, perfect. It gets up on its XP. So now what I'm going to do is go ahead and grind this crop. And I believe to get to carrots is level 7. So I'm going to grind until I'm at level 7. Okay, since I last recorded, if we take a look at skills, we're quite literally 50,000 experience away from hitting level 7. What gets us to carrots? Also, I do want to go over a few things that I've done off camera. I got a bomber 6 off AH for 10 million. It was 100% success rate. And it's the max you can get. So I thought I'd buy it because what it does is it spawns a TNT that mines all the crops within a radius and then gives me experience to level up my skill as well as gives me all the crops. So it's really overpowered. And then I also bought a tinkerer 4 for very cheap. It had a very low success rate. I still applied it to my chestplate, like tried to apply it and it actually worked. So that's good. It basically has a chance to not consume ruins. What if we take a look at slash ruins? It's very useful for enchants. So I'm kind of glad I got that because I'm going to need it. There we go. The TNT spawn and it mined all the crops and we should get a lot of skill XP from that. Also, I'm not sure if I got the nemesis pet in the last clip, but we're using it anyways. I got it from a crimson key. So I thought I'd mention it just in case. I also got three skeleton spawners from leveling up my skills. So that's good. And I should be getting two, I think, coal generators, mob coin generators that we'll put in our mob coin farm and we get that from when we level up to level seven. So right now, if I take a look, we're making way more in potatoes than carrots and we're going to start farming carrots soon. So I think I'm going to upgrade this, I believe three times just to get the crop up just a little bit. I think I'm going to upgrade everything that like is a farm crop within the zone areas. So I think we'll only get it like up three in total. So then we make the same amount from carrot and potato now, but we're dead broke on emerald mob coins. Some might think that's not a good investment, but I'm just doing it for content. And plus it's something to do. We're less than 30,000 experience away on our skill. So let's go ahead and hit carrots really quick here. We're less than a thousand away. Here we go. One more update and we should be good. There we go. We got two coal mob coin generators and we leveled up to farming level seven. So now I need to figure out where carrots are at. So I placed down the coal mob coin generators. So we should be making two every 45 seconds. What is pretty good when you think about it? So I'm asking what warp carrots are at. I don't really know which one it's at. Okay. So apparently it's at warp castle and it should be right behind me. So let's go out here and it should be over here. Yeah, there we go. Carrots. Perfect. We'll go to a more flat area because this is like a hill. Okay. So apparently if I go ahead and farm this, it's actually level nine. I've been misinformed. So I'm going to get all the way up to level nine and then I'll come back. Okay. So I just woke up and I actually did finish last night the carrots. If we go ahead and take a look at slash skills, you can see in the farming section, I am at level 10. So that means we are able to harvest carrots. The only difference I think from carrots is I get more skill XP. Not really a money difference. What is pretty decent though, skill XP is nice. And also you can see I do have a set. And the reason I have a set now is it's a speed two set. I quite literally forgot to record myself opening the crate. I was talking for no reason and I just literally didn't press the record button. But either way, we now have a speed two set. So basically now I can farm crops way easier and at a faster pace. So that is really, really good. These apparently give money once you water them fully and then collect the loot. Currently, I haven't got these fully done. So I don't know how much they actually make. But anyways, the point of today's video is I want to make an AFK farm. Currently, right now we have 32 axolotls since I last recorded. And I do want to put these in a AFK farm. As well, if we go into PV1, I do want to put skeletons in a farm as well. So what I'm thinking is we're going to remove this manual farm here and start working on getting a AFK farm going. And I do have a plan in mind for these axolotls and skeletons. Okay, so we need to go ahead, tear this all down, and then we'll figure out what we want to do. Now I'm going to make a giant chest system because I'm going to need a lot of chests. Also, I don't know how big our hopper limit is. So I'm in island upgrades and we're able to place off default for my rank currently is 650. So I think what I'm going to do is go eight up and place five chests down in a row is at least the plan I'm going for here. Also, one thing I completely forgot about is we need hoppers for this and we need to build it a different way. It'll still be eight tall and five on the outside, but I need to build it like this so I can actually make the loot flow right to the bottom. At least that's the plan. I have to break a few of these chests and reorganize the hoppers. Let's go ahead and buy a stack of hoppers for 320k. I'll probably need them all, so it's fine. Chest system is now complete. So what I need to do is put hoppers on top of here and then I need mine cart rails. So we're going to quickly box this around really quick and then we'll put slabs on this side because in case I ever need to replace these, I'll have an opening space where I can just literally place them. So now I need to go ahead and go to shop and buy some rails. Buy a stack of rails because why not? Put them down and then we need the mine carts. First, I'm going to put one in the corner, one in that corner, one here, and then I have to quickly place these down. There we go. So now they're situated. So I'm going to go into the colors shop and we're going to buy some gray glass. We'll buy a stack of that. Go along, put it all along there. And then it's going to flow all the way along here is the plan. And what's going to happen is they're going to die right here on a campfire that's on fire and waterlogged. And then it should probably flow all the way through all these. And we do need an iron bar. Where's the iron bars at? So I need an iron bar, but I can't really use that right now. So we're going to use an end rod. I guess could be our option, our alternative. In order to make a campfire, we need three logs. So we'll add those. And then we need some sticks. So I actually need one more. We'll go ahead and make some sticks. And then we need some charcoal. So I think we need one piece of wood. And then I also need some cobble to make a furnace. And we're going to smelt this down. So we need three sticks, oak log, and a charcoal. So now if we do slash craft, go ahead, do it in the layout that we're supposed to do it in. There we go. We got a campfire. We can place down the campfire here. And I believe if we use a water wand, we can waterlog it. Yeah, we can. But how are we going to make sure water moves? Oh, there we go. So you place a block next to it, and then it starts moving. So there we go. We have a waterlogged on fire campfire. So this should kill mobs. And then what we're going to do now is put a block up here. Because we need to put the end rod facing downwards. So place it right there. Because we don't want axolotls to fit through this. I don't know if they can yet. We'll have to see. If not, then we'll try a fence. So there we go. We got the campfire situated. Perfect. So now that the campfire is situated, we need to go ahead and situate this now. So I went up about 22 blocks from where we were at previously. And the reason for that is we're going to have some lava that's going to be ticking it as well. So I need to go ahead and buy some wood again and make a sign. Let's go ahead, go here and make a sign. And I believe it's on this block right here that we put it. And then lava. So let's see. Can I buy a lava bucket here? Yes, I can. Place lava. There we go. Now we need to go all the way up. And we need to buy a ton of deep slate stone brick. Let's put some glass on the outside so we can see the mobs fall. Because why not? So the whole farm is going to be kind of a chunk outline if I'm going to be honest. That's really all it is except for that complex part down there. So it's not too difficult to build. Also, we're going to put a sign right here because we do need to block the water when it gets close to the corner. And we do need to obviously go ahead and put a wall up here. We're going to make this three tall in case we have mobs jumping over the edge accidentally from the water pushing. If I'm not mistaken, this should be the exact design that we need. I might be wrong. Who knows? But we're going to test it out. So we'll use a water wand right in the corner up here. And then we're going to put water on the outside here. And hopefully it should flow right to where I want it to go to. Yes, it does. So what I think I'm going to do is make the pillar go right here. And we'll go ahead and break all this. And we'll put glass for temporary spawner placement because why not? So we're going to grab all these spawners. Let's go ahead and place down the axolotls. Stack them all in here. And then we'll do it with the skeletons. And I don't know if there needs to be a roof for the skeletons to actually spawn in. Because light might be a problem. I'm not too sure yet. Axolotls have spawned. Let's see if this works with them though. Seems they fit through the gap. What is not what I'm looking for. So I'm going to get rid of all these axolotls because they're just not needed here. The skeletons will work though. I'm pretty sure. I do need to move the lava down. Okay, so the skeletons are in. So skeletons are only spawning because it's nighttime. So I'm going to probably have to change some island setting or do something to make sure they spawn. But as you can see, they're dying really quickly because of the lava. I moved it down one so it would reach the skeleton's top of its head. And now all the loot should be going in the system. At least that's the hope. It's quite unfortunate the axolotls do not work with this design. I was hoping they would, but I guess not. It doesn't seem to be like there's any kind of way to interact with what time it is on my island. So I guess I'm just going to have to go ahead and place a giant roof above this whole thing. So they actually spawn. But I can't lie, it is kind of tedious. But I mean, it is what it is. So now I need to see how much it is to upgrade my warps. How much does it cost? To get to two warps, I only need 325 gold mob coins. We'll purchase that. So now we're going to do IS and I think it's set warp. And we're going to do skelly. So now when the alt comes over, it'll be right on this block. Perfect. So from what it seems, the farm is working perfectly. I just want to see how much do arrows make. They make $4 per one. What is not too bad when you think of it. The reason I want to make XP is because there's an XP shop. If we go into the XP shop, you can see that there are cell wands. And I need to get some of these because I need to actually sell all the loot within my skeleton farm. Because I made it to a point where I have 15 bone block skeletons. And that's kind of a lot of loot being dropped on the ground when this thing is full. So I need cell wands because each time I sell an inventory is about 50k. So it's about 100k per double chest. But the point is we need to make an XP farm so we can even get the cell wand. So in order to do that, we're going to be using blaze spawners. But we also need to build a farm over here. I prepared the cobble cube. I moved it over there so we can build the farm over here. So I'm going to be honest, the design is really, really simple. I just need to set it up. And one thing it does involve is a magma block. What we need to figure out where this is at. If we can even purchase it. If not, then we're going to have to craft it. Okay, we can craft it. So we'll get four of these. Four magma cream. Go into slash craft. And I think we can craft one. There we go. Place it down. And you can just sit here and make XP. You could literally just stand here in this corner and let the mobs die. And you don't have to kill them. So what I'm going to do is have a little complex system. So we're going to go to redstone and we're going to buy two tripwire hooks. And we need, I believe, one piece of string. And we'll put the string here. The tripwire hook here. And then we need to put a block on this side. Tripwire hook down. So now every time we go into it, it'll activate as you can see. And I guess we could make this even a tad bit better by just using a end rod instead of a stair. So we're going to grab a end rod and put it facing this way. So then the blazes can't escape. And we can also just be in the area. The reason I need the tripwire hooks is because we're going to have on this side a sticky piston that pushes a block above. So when the mob is getting hit or ticked, it doesn't get jumped above. So we need to go ahead, go to redstone, grab a sticky piston. And I don't know if I need repeaters. So I'm going to grab a few of these. And we're just going to buy a stack of redstone. From my knowledge, I think we need one repeater. So we'll go ahead and place it, I think, right here. So now if I put the redstone right on top of there, it should activate when someone runs on it. Yes, it does. Okay, so we're going to need signs here. And we're going to go ahead and make it kind of similar to this farm, the way the mob blows in. But we're going to have it flow right into this specific spot. So it should work out pretty simple. The only difference in this design compared to that design is quite literally the outline of the farm. Okay, so I built the layout of the water flowing system. It's just I have to put a wall around the edge now. So I'll make it go up this high, the wall around the edge. So now I have to go ahead and put the wall down. Okay, so I got all the walls situated. Now let's go into, I believe it's PB3. And we can grab our water wand and start placing water down in the specific spots. So if I now place water on this wall here, we should be good for it to flow to the right spot. And then we need to put water here, obviously. So it just flows a little bit extra. And then one thing I actually do want to adjust really quick is putting a stair here. Because I feel it's going to be harder for the mob to get pushed over. So the stair will help with that. Okay, so right here is where the spawner is going to go. But before we place the spawners down, I do want to do just one little thing and make a chest system under here. So I'm going to quickly do that as well. So we need blocks here and we need hopper facing down right here. And then we break these two. Then we're going to put a mine cart rail right here. Now I'm going to make some slabs really quick because we need those. Put a slab here and one on this side. Now I need the mine cart. Where's the hopper mine cart? There it is. Now if I place it down, that should be good. Let's place that back. Okay, so there we go. We got that situated. Okay, so we're going to make a platform down here, I think. And we're just going to have a ladder system going up. The reason I want to add a ladder system is just for looks. It's not really that I'm going to use it. It's just for the detail purpose. I'll make a decent bit of them because I think I need a lot. Okay, and there we go. We have the chest system situated. Okay, so we're going to place down all the blazes. And eventually we'll make like all these blazes. Like the max kind of blaze we can get for money wise. But it doesn't really matter right now. Blazes are spawning. Perfect. I guess we'll just go ahead and purchase all the warps. Because we have so many mob coins. That we might as well just get our upgrades up. So there we go. We got all our warps. We got up to 10. I also did buy the island spawner stacks off camera. I bought this all the way up to 500. So these guys can stack up to 500 in one spawner. Previously it was at 50. But I wanted to get it maxed out. And I also did upgrade in boosters. I upgraded money. Because when you upgrade the first level. You quite literally get a two times boost. And then if you go into each other one. I'm pretty sure it's the same concept. Get a two times boost for buying the first thing of each one. So I'm probably going to buy the XP one right now. So we're going to go ahead and purchase that. So now we have a two times boost on that. So we have two times on skill, money, and XP. So the only one we're missing is mob coins. So I'll try and get this up off camera. I just realized we put blazes in here. When they're not going to die to this at all. So we need to buy I believe a creeper spawner. And then in PV6 I think I have one as well. It's a star creeper. So I think we'll go ahead. Get two star creepers for now. And that'll be our go-to plan. For what we're going to kill in this thing. So after going through a giant trial and error process. I think I found the way we can actually make this work. So we don't need the head hitting thing. That thing is basically not necessary at all. But what we do need is obviously the manual and AFK switcher. So I'm going to set this all up. And then show you guys what I did. I built the farm and it's fully functional. So it still has the manual and AFK switch. It goes down a level of blocks. And then it actually moves a block that is over top of the magma cube. And then what happens is the creeper flows down. I put some water just so it doesn't die to fall damage. And then it sits here if I want to manually grind it with a sword. And make XP manually. As well as some loot. But instead what I can do is flick this lever. And then it actually just pulls out the block. Goes down on the magma cubes. Dies. And if I stand here I'll gain the XP. And then all the loot gets picked up by the minecart still as per usual. And it goes all the way down to here. Pretty simple concept. And so today I want to go ahead and actually build a iron golem farm. So in order to do that I think what we're going to do is revamp the old skeleton farm. Because I've moved all the skeletons all the way over to this farm. What now is kind of an income source of money. Plus XP because my alt picks all the XP up. But the plan today is to simply revamp this farm. And we're going to make a whole different chest system for this as well. Because this one is probably a better option for that design over there. So we'll probably swap it around. But there are boosters active. So we are going to go ahead and sell really quickly before they expire. I am going to activate my own personal booster. Because I have a ton of these. And let's go ahead and start making a ton of money. This should help level up the piggy pet that I have. Hopefully. I'm not too sure. Alright. So we made about I'd say maybe 12 almost 13 mil. What isn't too bad. And I think our piggy pet leveled up once. What isn't too bad also. Like I mean it's extra money we get from the piggy pet as well. So I can't complain. Either way now we need to go ahead and start tearing stuff down from this farm. And I also do need to move some of this around. So I'm going to figure this out really quick. Okay we should be organized now. On all these chests. These are just all the items I get all the time. So I kind of wanted to organize them. And not have them in my pv crammed around. Anyways we're going to go ahead and start tearing down this chest system. And we're not going to get rid of this concept. We will modify it though. Just so the loot actually gets in there. And the iron golem can fit in the actual tube. We're not doing too much modifications to this design though. But yeah. In pv6 I have six iron golems. And I do have a raw iron golem. What is a really good pull. I got it from a spawner pouch. I don't know if I got it on video that we got it from a pouch. Because iron golems cost I think around 50 million almost per spawner. And then that includes the iron upgrade on that iron golem. Like the raw iron. So it's kind of op. So we technically have seven of them. And we could probably get another one if we wanted. But I might see if the upgrades are cheaper. And if it's worth it to go in the upgrades or the iron golem itself. Okay. So we have situated this. Okay. So I need hoppers. We're going to go ahead and figure out how we want to do the chest system first. And I think it's pretty simple to be fair. It's just copying the other design just a bit bigger. Because we're going to have iron golems. And they need more storage. Because we're going to get more of them. So essentially we're going to have a big tube going around the whole thing of just hoppers. So now I need to go ahead expand out a chest system right along here. And we go up all the way till we hit the certain spot I want to go to. What I believe is about here. So that gives us about seven tall. What isn't too bad? The thing is we're going to have four of these. So we never run out of storage. That is at least the plan. Now we'll go ahead and place the hoppers along the back. Since I'm done the chest. And we might have to upgrade the hopper limit on our island. Also the mob coin farm I do want to mention. We're one mob coin generator off of having this full row finished. And then I have to expand it. What is kind of crazy when you think about it. Most of them are coal. But I mean it is what it is. So I think I'm going to move these chests over again. Because I'm kind of having issues on where I want to place these. I guess we can just put it like this. And then I just transfer the items. Okay let me do that. So here is the rough layout. I just need to finish putting up all the chests and the hoppers. So let me do that really quick. Okay so I'm just finishing off the finishing touches. I do need to get some ladders. But basically I've built the whole design. We got the hoppers. We got the ring of the hoppers. We got the chest done. And then I just put a kind of design over top of all this. Because I don't want things to go in these hoppers. So I thought I'd just make a little platform up here. And up here is going to be ladders. It's going to look really weird. But I mean honestly I do not care. For me reasonably it's whatever works you know. So I'm going to make a ton of ladders really quickly here. We're going to have so many. We have about two stacks almost. That should be enough to finish this whole thing. And then I have to put ladders on the inside pillar. It's just for the look. It's not really that I'm ever using these. Because I have slash fly. But I mean it just looks nice. It gives more detail to the whole thing. Okay last side. And there we go. So now the chest system is fully done for this. I will probably need to put these hoppers back. Once we have the system fully done over here. But I don't want to do that right yet. Until we actually have the iron golems like spawning in. Because there's going to be loot dropping from me redesigning this. So we need to go ahead and block all this off here. And what we're going to do is just change this to a 2x2. That's quite literally all we're changing. And then the water system down below. I'm also going to need a lot of signs. And we have a ton of those because of previous builds. So now I'm just going to break down all of this side. I think it's the plan. Now that I think about it. We're going to make it a 3x3. And the reason for that. When you have different types of them. So let's say a bone version. Or a bone block version. It spawns a different entity. So it's going to cause unit collision. Like trying to get into here. So I think we're going to make it even bigger. Just so this actually works. And we don't have to redo it. Now I can go ahead and break all this. And this is where they'll flow. And we'll have to redo this water system on the back here. But other than that. I think that's all we'll have to change here. Maybe a bit of tweaking to this. But that's it. So the first thing I'm going to do. Is get rid of this previous part we have here. That we don't need anymore. The looping system. And then we'll rebuild the looping system in a different way. Just because we need more room. To actually make sure the iron golems fall in the right place. So instead of using a campfire. I think we're going to swap this out. With quite literally a magma cube system. And then we'll have the items flow over to here. So we need to go to mob loop. We're going to buy a stack of magma cream. And we're going to craft this into blocks. Into magma blocks. I don't know why I call them magma cube blocks. It's just kind of something I've always done. I need to get that out of my habits. We have the magma cube blocks. And basically we're going to have water flowing. Just over into this corner. I think I have this fully figured out now. I just have to build it. So I just asked in chat. I asked one of the managers. And Amad also replied. So we got two perfect double checks. But basically when you place water on a magma block here. It doesn't dry up. Like it does on vanilla Minecraft. So basically we can just have it sitting on top. What is completely good. So I put a sign there. So then the items will flow down to that corner. I'm actually going to pick up this water. Because I need to focus on doing this water system. So let me do that really quick. Okay. So from what it looks like. This water system shouldn't get stuck at all. Like no blocks should get stuck hopefully. It picked up some blocks there. But let's place it here. See if it works. I think it works perfectly. Yeah it works perfectly. So now I can close off all of this. Because this is basically done. We'll keep a trap door here. In case we want to collect the XP. Because XP does fill up in here. And I can collect it over time. So I mean it's probably good that we probably do that. And there we go. Now we put the last water bucket. And perfect. I need to clear out these hoppers. And I also do need to go ahead and finish up this tube. One thing we also need to add as well is some lava. Because this will speed up the process even more of killing the iron golems. So we're going to go ahead and put down some more signs. There we go. All the signs are down. Now we'll put a block here temporarily. And I need a lava bucket. Go ahead and buy a lava bucket. And then we'll break this. And there we go. Situated. But what I am going to do just to make sure items don't burn. And bob around in the water. Is we're going to add a stair here. Because what this will do is essentially just make sure. If it's bouncing around it'll go down in here. And not hit the wall. Or maybe I don't know burning lava. Just a safety precaution. You never know. Now let's go ahead finish up this tube. Okay now I need some glass. Where's the glass at? There it is. One thing I am quickly going to go ahead and do is remove the roof. Because we don't need it anymore. It's just kind of there. So for looks of the design we'll get rid of it. And we're also going to move down the warp one. Dell warp. And we're going to do skeleton. I'm going to do IS set warp. Iron golem. And then I got to change that on my alt system to iron golem. And relaunch the alts. So I got rid of the roof. I also got a manager to get rid of that bedrock block. That was under here at one point. So that is gone now. And I did figure out what incubators give. They give about like one to three million. So you have a chance to get between one to three million. What is not too bad. So I've been watering these just to actually get the pouches and get a bit of money. Now we need to grab the last five hoppers of the design. And we should be sitting good. Last hopper. There we go. So now we need to go ahead and actually place down the iron golems. So I'm going to grab out four pieces of glass. And we're going to break the bottom one. And then the second one here. I didn't even have to place those to be fair. We'll place the raw block. And then the regular one. And then we'll add these all in. Okay. So what I found out is the upgraded one actually drops enchanted raw iron blocks. So the upgraded one. And then the default one is like 30 per one. So these ones are going to give me about 75. So actually it might be worth it to upgrade. But I don't really know. I think I'm actually going to upgrade to a higher tier on one of these iron golems. So we're going to take one. And we're going to go up a tier. Because I think that's probably a better choice. So we'll go to the iron ingot tier. So then I'll work off camera on the iron block one. I think is the plan. So I need about another like 28 million. Oh my gosh. Yeah that's not happening anytime soon. As you can see on my scoreboard. I have 5,000 goobits. And we're going to get a ton of loot. If you do slash goobits. Or goobit. We can go into sales. And apparently there's a monthly crate bundle we can buy. For exactly 4,500. So we're going to buy a monthly crate bundle. And see what we get. Of course I'm not expecting too much. You can win a ton of good rewards. For some reason I can't scroll down. But you can win a lot of good loot. We'll also be doing some other stuff after we open the crates. But for now let's go ahead open up our first crate. And see what we get. For some reason it says summer crate. I don't know why it's not even the summer anymore. But anyways let's go ahead and start rolling through. See what we get. We got a charm pet. An extra chance to gain mob coins. We got a deadbeard boss egg. We got some spawner pouches for upgraded random spawners. We got a good cell wand. We should get a bomber six there. What are we getting here? A set crate key. Oh my gosh. That's a good pull. What are we getting here? Magnetize items for a short period. I've never seen that before. And we're getting some boosters. Super experience and super money. And how many mob coin gens? Come on give us emerald. Oh we got five emerald. And then the final reward is a puff rank. So I'd say we got some pretty good stuff from there. Not too shabby. We use pv8 for our storage for now. On some of these items. And apparently this cell wand that we got is different from what it said. It's a two times for five uses. So I'll put in my pv1. And we got a set crate key. Let's go ahead and open that up. We got a farming one set. So if we go into skins. I think we have access to the farming set now. Farming level one. What I have no clue what the buff is on that. But I mean it's better than not having farming. So I'll take it. And then we got a magnet wand. I still have no clue what that is. We got a bomber six. What I'm probably gonna sell. All right. The second crate key. Here we go. Let's do the first three. Got furniture g-kit. Unfortunate. And we got some more upgraded spawner pouches. Let's do the next three. Another magnet wand. And a droid pet. Interesting. The last three. Give us emerald mob coin generators. Oh we got emerald. And then the last item. Let's see what we get. We also got a set key. Here we go. Okay. So we got crate g-kit pouch. Open this pouch to get a random crate key. We could get possibly another monthly crate from those. And this is also a pouch as well. The furniture g-kit thing. So I'm just gonna claim that up. And then we'll redeem the boosters that we got. So I'm actually gonna wait to sell the bombers. Because I can put them all up at once. So we'll do that in a bit. Put the pets away. I don't have a charm pet. So I think I'll go ahead and put that in my pv1. But I already have a droid pet. So we'll probably sell that or something. We got some more spawners we'll eventually get to open. Let's see if we get any good crates. A toy box, a void, and a crystal. Unfortunate. We still have another set crate. Can we get something good out of this? We got money set level one. What is still better than no money set. So I'll take it. Let me go ahead and open up all these. Get them out of the way. An emerald mob coin generator. I'll take that. So let's go ahead and open up the last crate. See what we get. We'll do the first three. A ton of boosters. We got a booster bundle. That's OP. See what we get here. A large summer pouch. This could be pretty good for emerald mob coins. So I can't complain. We got more upgraded spawners. So we have about 30. And another charm pet that we'll probably have to sell. We got a mechanical gkit pouch. We got more emerald mob coin generators. Another sell one. And the final reward. A small goobit pouch. Can we get more goobits? A good amount. 1.8k. All right. I'll take it. So I guess we can open up more. Oh my gosh. We can open up another one. And by the way, just for all the people that don't know, you can get a monthly crate for free by completing the quest line now. If you get all the way to the end, you get a literal monthly crate that I just opened there. So I recommend doing the quest line if you want a lot of free loot. We'll go ahead. Open up the large summer pouch. Got a lot of mob coins. We'll take it. 40 million. What's insane in cash wise. Surprisingly, we didn't get a bomber six. What's kind of weird. Anyways, let's go ahead. Buy another one of these because we can buy for 2000. So we got a mechanical gkit. Apparently, it's actually like the full on gkit. It's permanent. So we'll claim that. I didn't have it before. So I might as well claim all my gkits while we have the time. And I know I can sell these pouches. I'm not going to open them as well as the furniture pouches. I just want to open those. Get the furniture away. And now we're going to go ahead and go back to warp crates and open up this last one. Hopefully it's the last. Here we go. Do the first three. Can we get emerald mob coin generators? Come on. Oh, we got even more. Oh my gosh. And we got three crimson. We got a harvester hoe. And then we'll open up the last three. Come on. Give us some good spawners. Okay. We got one to three spawners. What isn't upgraded? Fair enough. And we got a super booster bundle and a boss egg. Now we'll go ahead. Open up the final reward. Here we go. Maybe more goobits. Maybe a cell wand. Unfortunate. But I mean, it's three times. So I can't really complain. It's pretty decent. So there we go. We've opened everything. And now we got to actually start placing this all down. So let's see how many we have here. We have about 21 of these. Oh my gosh. And we have more placed on our island. What's even more insane. Now we have all these pouches. We're going to do the lamer pouches first. Hopefully we can get a gas spawner even if it's possible. Like I don't know. It seems it's not possible because we just got a ton of skeleton. We did get some blazes and spiders and cows. But that's all we really got. So I put the skeletons in. Now I'm going to put away these spawners in PB6. Because we don't need them for now. And I'll probably sell them. Open these pouches. See what we get. Oh, we got boneless skeletons. Add those. Wheat cows. Boneless skeletons. Oh, we got more boneless skeletons. More wheat cows. More fermented. More boneless. Another bit of boneless. Oh my gosh. Even more. Insane. We got some hay upgraded cows. Got some bone skeletons. We got sea pickle axolotls. More leather cows. More spiders. More bones. I'll take those. We got cobweb spiders. And that's about it. So I'll put these all in my PB6 for now. Like I don't really know what I'm going to do with all these. I'm probably going to sell all these on AH at some point over time to make a ton of money. And then spend that into more iron golems or something. Because that's probably a smarter choice. Now that we have so many spawners. Oh my gosh. This thing is just crazy for XP gains. The amount of loot we're getting from all this is kind of insane. Because the hopper minecart can't even really even keep up. Like none of this stuff is ever going to be filtered through from what it seems. Oh my gosh. Since we have money right now. I think we can go ahead and grab out one of these iron golems. And make it an iron block one. So we'll go ahead and do that really quick. Iron block. And then we'll take it. And we'll go put it in our farm. So now we should have every type of iron golem. What is pretty decent. So far from what it seems after like a few hours of AFKing this. It's made it all the way to this point right here. And it usually starts out at this spot. So we've gotten about like 5 times 7. What is pretty crazy. So that's about 37 double chests. In literally just a few hours too. So now since we have all these mob coin generators. I think we need to go ahead and add a new layer. So here's the situation right now with the mob coin generators. We're missing one emerald one for a full layer of just emerald. And we're missing three on this one. So the mob coin farm is looking pretty good if I do say so. While I'm at it. I think I can upgrade some skeleton spawners really quickly here. To bone block. Yes I can. We got four of them. There we go. Now that is some perfect stuff if I do say so. If we go ahead and do slash quests. They added new quests to the server finally. And I've done a few of them already. But I'm stuck on this quest that's gonna take a lot of time. So I thought I'd record for this specifically. Basically you have to go to the molten mountains in Etheria. And mine 2000 jade ore. And the way you actually unlock that I believe. Is by going to slash skills. And then upgrading your mining skill. All the way to 13. And I'm only at 9. So I thought I'd go on a grinding session for that. As well I do want to give some updates on what I've done off camera. As you can see there's no storage system anymore. For the skeleton slash creeper farm. And the reason for that is because I moved on to getting iron golems. And the reason I moved on to that is because. Cell wands are kind of limited. And I need to use them on worthy items. Like very valuable items. So I decided I'm probably just not gonna sell the loot. Unless I pick it up and just spam sell all. But I will get XP from this farm still either way. But I did actually remake the whole iron golem farm. And as you can see we have a ton of iron golem spawners. We have at least 30 plus. And I made this whole wall of chests. What is absolutely insane. And I plan to do a back side of this as well at some point. If it gets out of hand. While I'm at it I'm gonna go ahead and upgrade one of these iron golems. Up to I believe the iron tier. We're gonna go to iron. There we go. Drop in that. And I also did my daily login slash daily streak. And once you hit level 15. And then every other 15 levels I believe. On the streak command. You actually get a monthly crate for the 15. So I got a monthly crate for that. So we're gonna go ahead and open that. Before we start working on our skill. So we're gonna go ahead and open up all these crates. As well I did actually max out. All the enchants I want on my basic set. That I'm gonna wear for like farming and making money. So I have proficiency on every single piece of gear for a skill boost. What is gonna be helpful for this video. And there was an update. It is the Thanksgiving update now. So there is new loot in the crates. And a new Thanksgiving crate. So hopefully we can get something good out of all these. I'm just gonna go through all the crates that I have currently. We got some full mob coin generators. Not bad. We got 5,000 emerald mob coins. Not bad. I'm gonna put down the coal mob coin generators. Because I need to do that. As well I also did combine some coal mob coin generators. Into coal mob coin generator shards. Once I get nine of these. What I need nine generators to make one of these. And once I get nine of them. I can make a super coal mob coin generator. What's gonna just save space and make my island lag less. As well as make more coal mob coins. Anyways let's go ahead. Open up the crate. We're gonna go with the first three. See what we get. We got the god of Jupiter boss. Got a personal booster bundle. A decent cell wand. Let's see what we get next. Five crimson keys. 20 random upgraded spawners. Potentially we could get something good out of those. A harvester hoe. Not what we're looking for. Let's get emerald mob coin gens. Ah we got coal. And we got a g kit pouch. As well as a bomber seven. And the final reward. What are we getting? Puff rank. I mean that's not the best. But I'll take it. So from my knowledge. I'm pretty sure I have everything I need. To go into the molten area. So I have everything I need. We're gonna go to molten. We're done opening all the crates. And we're gonna go ahead. Go over to the cobalt ore. I believe it is. Because that is the best ore for me right now. And we'll also activate our nemesis pet. So cobalt is this blue ore over here. So we're gonna farm that. Because it gives the most skill XP. As well while we're at it. We're gonna go ahead. Activate a skill booster. And how much do we get from one? We got 39. What isn't too bad? I mean I'll take it. For how slow this is. I mean it's decent I guess. I'm also pretty sure. I'm gonna get a different type of ore. Once I hit my next level. If I'm not mistaken. Once we hit level 9. I believe. Anyways. I'm gonna go ahead and mine. Until I get to the next ore. And then I'll give you guys an update here in a second. After a while. I made it to level 9 on my skill. And apparently it's not 13. It's actually 9. That you have to hit. So it's not actually that difficult. Compared to what I thought it would be. So I have to mine 2000 of these. And look how slow it is. It's painfully slow. I don't know if my enchant. I think it's the earthquake enchant. I don't know if it applies to the task. But I'd hope so. Because it does speed up the process. So we'll see. I have a ton of money I want to spend on spawners. So I'm quickly gonna do that. We're gonna go to the island. And we'll buy some more iron golems. I think we'll just buy straight up iron golems. That's about it. We'll buy four of them. Add them all in. Perfect. Anyways. I'm gonna go back to mining at warp molten. And getting the jade ore complete for the quest. And then we'll continue the quest line. After a long time of the server actually being down. I finally got back on. And I'm able to finish up the jade ore quest part. So we're gonna get that done really quick here. We need to mine about 15-ish more. I also started using my droid pet. What gives haste three. The reason for that is because this is actually like a wood block. But it's textured. So if I use a pickaxe it's just super slow. So I need haste. Anyways let's go ahead. Mine that. There we go. Return 2000 jade to King Midas's guard. So this is where I saved all the jade from mining. I've saved it all in Pv8 and Pv7. Let's go to warp castle. And we're gonna go to the guards at the castle. So we're gonna go through the entrance. And then go all the way up to the castle. Alright we're here. Let's go ahead. Start grabbing out all the jade that we have. We should have enough if I'm not mistaken. There we go. We got our three random bosses. Okay so we got the boss eggs. Let's see what we get. Anubis and a giant crab. And then what else? Dead deer. So they're all pretty decent. I'll put them in Pv1 for now. Okay so what's our next quest? Let's go ahead take a look at the quest. So we have to lead the Midas army to some mucky water. And we'll get some exotic orbs. So we have to speak to Midas and then we'll get this going. Travel to mucky muck water. That is a weird name. So that's near Haystack. I want to see is there an option to go near there? Yeah we just have to go to Haystack and then go this way. Okay so I think I'm here. I don't really know. We're just gonna have to wait and see. Oh yeah we are here. I don't know if I can fight these. Can I? Oh I can. I need a sword. Okay well I'm getting my sword out and we're gonna fight these things. Okay there we go. So we just have to enter the area. Kill 250 trolls. Oh my gosh. I wonder how difficult it is to kill all these trolls. Because 250 doesn't seem like a difficult amount. I'm gonna be here quite a bit. I already killed 20. So I'm gonna go ahead kill all of them. And then I'll give you guys an update here in a moment. Once I kill all the trolls that I need to kill. Okay we have to kill three more trolls. And then we should be good. Two more now. One more. And then we have to do more questing. And we're pretty much done almost. And I have to find this stranger NPC. And I found it at negative 333. And then like 300. But either way we talked to the NPC. Anyways we gotta go speak to King Midas now. Go to Warp Castle. And we go back to the castle that we were at previously. Alright let's speak to Midas. And I think we get our rewards now for completing this. Yes we do. We get some exotic orbs. We still have a few more quests we have to do. We have 9 out of 11 done. So for two set keys we have to do this quest. So now we have to go ahead and speak to Priest Luther to get two set breaks. He's at the isolated isles. So let's go to isolate. I'm assuming the priest is over here. I'm just guessing. So my guess is he's over here at this place. I'm just guessing. I have no clue. Oh yep he is. Luther the priest. So we'll talk to the priest. Found the first missing piece of the book. So apparently there's a winter village I'm supposed to go to next after completing that. But I believe it's right here in the mountains. The Arctic. So if we go to Haystack we should get there pretty quick. So I'm gonna go to Warp Haystack. And get over there really quick. Because I need to get this done. So I'm here at the village. I found the piece. Page one. Now I need to go back to the priest. There we go. Second page is located near the floating purple circle at Radiant Ruins. Okay so I found the purple ring here. Let's go ahead and see where the piece is. I'm guessing it's right here. Oh it's pretty much close to there. Perfect. Pick that up. Now we go back to the priest again. So we go back to isolate. Here is your page. So the next page is at Molten Mountains. Warp Molten. Said something about mushrooms. So it's probably over this way I'm guessing. I'm assuming it's probably on the other side of this. So we're gonna take the bridge. And hope it's over here. Hope it's over here yet. Because he said something about the black mushrooms. So if I'm not mistaken this should be the area. There it is. I can see it. Now let's go back to the isolate. And return the page to the priest. For the third time. At the end of this we do get a monthly crate. So I'm not complaining. And the set crates are actually really really OP too. So I mean I can't complain. This is worth it. Here is your third page sir. We got the two set crates. Let's go. So we'll go open those. And then we'll move on to the next quest. So let's see what we get. We got a strength one. And a farming one. What I already had farming one. But the strength one is not too bad. Okay so we have to meet with the troll king. To let him know about Midas. So where that is at is Warp A stack. And then we turn around and go to the troll camp. What I believe is right here. And it's on the giant temple. All right let's go up the temple. Let's go ahead and speak with the guard here. Okay we can speak to the troll king. And there we go. We got our Thanksgiving crate. What is a monthly crate technically. And there we go. We got the first chapter complete. So let's go ahead and finish this off. By opening up the crate. Let's see what we get. Let's just open up the first five. We got a Minotaur boss. We got Emerald Mob Coin Gens. I'll take it a Grinder Gkit permanent. An Airstrike. What is not that great. Harvester Ho. What's not great. Open this. We got some super boosters. Small summer pouch. One to three random spawners. And a Fable Pet. And the final reward. Here we go. A Blitz Rank. Let's go. Etheria has a location. That actually has a boss. That happens right at this spot. And you can warp to it with this command in chat. Basically what you do is fight the boss. And you can get a ton of good loot. And I do want to go ahead and fight it. They just recently added it within like a few days ago. The boss is going to spawn in about 12 minutes. And the reason for that is because in Minecraft chat. I have a mod that tells me exactly what minute a chat message is sent. So when the boss message is sent that it spawns. It'll tell me what minute it was sent at. So I know when to come back and fight the boss. But before we go ahead and fight the boss. I do want to prepare and give a heads up on what I'm going to be using. To make sure that I can get some damage in and get some free loot. But before we do that make sure to check if you are subscribed with notifications. Because it really would support the channel. Anyways let's go to the island. I did also change the iron golem farm I do want to mention. We were losing money drops. Because the iron golems were falling too slow. And they were burning some of the loot in the lava. So I reduced it by a lot by building this upwards more. And I do want to give a rundown of what I'm going to be using for gear. I'm going to be using my set that I built in previous videos. With speed 2 even though I don't really need it. It's just the only option I can really go with. Because I could use strength 1. But we are going to be using in pv7 a ton of strength 2 pots. We only need 1 per boss fight. Because it lasts less than a minute. So it's pretty convenient that I have a ton of potions. I bought them off AH. They were 100,000 per 1. So it was pretty cheap. And right now we have a stack of iron golems in total. With 3 different variants of upgraded ones. But it's pretty good. We've been making a ton of money. I haven't sold the chest recently. Because there's really no point. Now that I think about it. I think I'm just going to go ahead and sell. So we're going to do some skins. And I think I don't need to use the speed set. I guess I can just use money. Because I do need money set on this. The only problem is when I'm farming. I'm going to be slower. So that's kind of unfortunate. But I mean I'm mainly doing bosses right now. So it's fine. So I put the money set on. Now we have a 0.15 boost. And we're going to go ahead and use sell ones that we have here. As well as one in here. And we're going to go ahead and just start selling. Oh actually while I continue this. I'm going to use a personal booster. So I can make sure I'm making the most out of this. There we go. That sell wand broke. I'm going to use these ones actually first. Because technically they have better multipliers. And now we'll use this one. I haven't sold in like half a day. So there's going to be a decent bit of loot here. I guess what I can do is just spam right click. And press shift at the same time. But isn't a bad idea. It just won't sell every single chest. So maybe if I do it upwards is a better idea. I have no clue. I'm just going to do it anyways. Get this done and over with. So we can make a ton of money. And we have about 7 minutes until boss. And these bosses give a ton of money. If you get in the top placements. Turns out the boosters expired. But we did get most of it done with the boosters. So that's fine. Can't complain about that. We still made a ton of money. And I'm going to be also using a droid pet. As well as a Zeus sword. To make sure I make the most amount of damage on this. Most people usually try to get sharpness 7. To do as much damage to the boss. But I only have sharpness 6. And that's the best I can really use. Plus it's on netherite. So it does even more damage. And then with the droid pet. It gives haste 3. My assumption is on this version. Basically haste gives a attack speed boost. I believe on under 1.8 the version. Haste doesn't do anything. So I thought I'd go ahead and use a droid pet. Just so we can get more hits in. Potentially. But we're going to go into pv7. Grab out a strength pot. And we're going to head over here in a second. Someone just bought my piggy pet for 250 million. Let's go. But let's go ahead. Go to warp. And then it's p-o-h-a-k-u. I don't know how to say that. So usually the boss spawns right on this gold block. And you can't stand on the gold block. You have to stand and shift around the edge. And attack the boss. Is currently the concept of how boss works on the server. Surprisingly there's like no one at this boss. What is kind of concerning because it does do damage. So I might switch my set out. I'm going to grab out this armor set just in case. Because I don't really want to die with this. In case the boss targets me. And the droid pet's not really a problem. I mean it is a problem. But we're going to roll with it anyways. Same with the sword. Because we want the most damage we can do. Okay. So I ate my gapple. And I actually drank the potion. So we should be ready. The boss should spawn pretty quick here. Within less than a minute. And I forgot to mention the boss is custom as well. It looks really cool. Here we go. The boss has spawned. And now we got a jump crit. So we can do as much damage as possible. Shaking our screen. Oh my gosh. Like look at this. Oh my gosh. It's shaking it. I'm clicking as fast as I can. To do as much damage as possible. I want to get good stuff out of this. We got less than 30 seconds of strength. Should be enough. There we go. We got a placement. We got I think in the top five. Because we got a heart or whatever. So we got a medium and a small turkey pouch. What isn't too bad? That's usually the go-to. For me at least right now. Is getting about this placement. Or without this. But if we open the first pouch. We can get a ton of money. And XP. And mob coins as you can see. And we'll go ahead. Open up the next one. And we got almost max amount of money. We can get from that. We got almost 200 million from that. Wow. That's insane. And then I don't know what this heart does. I'll probably hold on to it. Because it is from the boss. So I might as well hold on to it. Who knows? We might need it for recipes at some point. So if I go ahead and go to spawn. You can see we have a winter themed spawn. And I have 5,000 goobits. I want to go ahead and spend. And the reason we need to spend goobits. Is because we'll get a lot of winter playtime. In the winter wonderland world. We'll get some tickets worth hours. Potentially within the elf crate. And I'm pretty sure from the last video I made. The boss video. You can get them from that now. For placement. To get some playtime in the winter world. I currently have about 3 hours and 20 minutes. I got 20 minutes from getting placement on the boss. But I have 3 hours to begin with. I would like to get more time. Just so when I'm playing off camera. I can use that. But anyways. There are 2 limited time bundles we can purchase from. We can get the Santa set. What is useful for the winter wonderland. And we'll get some elf keys. But I think we'll go ahead and confirm that. Get that going. So we'll claim that up. Get our 3 elf keys. And our Santa set. So now if I go ahead and take my gear off. Go in the skin menu. Unskin this. Where's the Santa set? There it is. So it's on the second page. And we'll go ahead and suit up as Santa. So now we'll get better rewards. When we're in the winter wonderland. Of course you can get goobits for free. If you just play the game for a long time. Usually when there's GG waves. You get about 10 at maximum. Like 5 to 10. And you can collect those over time. They stay within seasons. So you don't have to actually pay to get this kind of stuff. It just takes time. And then the frosty bundle is a really good bundle. Because it gives looting 12. Efficiency 12. And it also gives sharpness 7 to 10. And I'm hoping we can maybe get sharpness 10. I'm not too sure. And we get a frosty spawner spear. What I have no clue what that is. But we'll go ahead and purchase this up. And that leaves us with 2000 goobits. The armor is pretty decent. But I'm going to put it in my PB3. And we'll put the tools away in there for now. And then yes. We got the frosty spear gun. Carpoon frozen fish in the winter wonderland. So we'll probably figure that out here in a bit. And what's the sword? We got sharpness 7. So we got the minimum. Well it's unfortunate. And we only got looting 9. I mean I guess I'll take it. I don't really know. I'm honestly not too sure if it's better than my current Zeus sword. Because Zeus is netherite. So I'm not too sure. But we'll put it away for now. Let's go ahead. Open up some elf keys. They have a ton of good loot. And I'm hoping we can get some good stuff. We got a winter wonderland ticket for an hour. We'll claim that. We got some cosmetics that I don't have. And then we also got a random cell wand pouch. What I do need. So we got 10,000 uses. Not bad. Anyways we're gonna go into the Goobits shop. And we're gonna go ahead. Go to sales. And we're gonna buy some elf crates. You get five of them for 1,500 Goobits. So we'll go ahead and purchase that up. The elf key bundle is pretty good. I recommend it. Anyways let's go ahead and open these up. We got another cell wand. We got a scarf. What's unfortunate. More cosmetics. What I don't want. We got 60 gas and a wonderland ticket. Not bad. And there was a GG wave. I got five Goobits for that. Let's go. So now I have five hours and 20 minutes in the winter wonderland. What isn't too bad. I'll take it. And the gas spawners I'll probably maybe use or sell. I'm not too sure. I'll just hold on to them for now. Okay so we're gonna go ahead. Go to warp winter. And that's how you enter the winter wonderland. And all the time you're in there is gonna be counted down. And the way you can check that is obviously slash winter. But we're here in the winter wonderland. This is my first time seeing this. I haven't been here once. So I have no clue where everything is. So we're gonna explore it. There's literally a reindeer here. Wait can we kill it? I have no clue. Does it drop anything? Reindeer antlers. Oh my gosh. That just made me a ton of money. What? That's insane. For two of those I made 700,000. So that's about 350,000 per one. We can use our grappler here to travel. But I don't know where I'm supposed to be going in this wonderland. Okay so there's these powdered spawners that spawn mobs. Burn rate is one mob coin. And you get one of these guys that spawn. And if you sell it makes 100k per two. What is not bad? Looting doesn't apply sadly. But it is what it is. And they spawn every six seconds. What isn't too shabby? I'll say that's pretty good. But let's see what else there is. Yeah we've got more here. We got a elf type. Because that was snowman. And then we got elf. I wonder if there's a different elf area. Because I don't want to steal that guy's elves. Okay so here's the elves. You get elf toys. And you can sell those. What aren't too bad. I'd say they're pretty decent. Two of them made 70,000. I don't get why people would be farming the elf toys. Because I heard they were better somehow. But I'm not too sure. But as you can see it takes no time at all to kill them. It takes about three hits. And then you can get a lot of money from them as well. And then the way you actually charge these up. Because you need to put whole mob coins in here. Is by right clicking this. And then typing in the amount you want to put into this. So if it ever runs out of mob coins. You just put some in. It is a good trade. Because coal mob coins are the worst type of mob coin. So I heard there was logging. So you can like farm logs. I don't know where I can. And there's also mushroom farming I think. I'm not too sure. But we're going to explore. And I'll find things that we can do. Okay so we're at a dock. And we can use our frosky spear gun I think. There's glow squids here. I don't know if that did anything. I think it gave me glow ink sacks. That makes me about 80k per four. What isn't a great method? What does the axolotl give? 70k per two. Not bad. I mean it's not like the best. And it's not the worst. But I think killing the elves is probably the better choice apparently. And the snowmen. Okay so this area I think you mine merry wood. So you would get wood. How much is four? Four is 25k. And I don't believe fortune looting or any of that stuff applies at all. But that is pretty interesting. I just want to figure out the mushroom thing. Because apparently there was something with mushrooms. Because a new enchant was added. Because they added the enchant first. And that was apparently spore. It gives more mushrooms. But yeah these reindeer antlers are pretty OP. Like I made about 1.4 mil off of four. Like that's really good. Saving those up is probably a good meta. To make a ton of money. So I might do that. To make money if I'm ever here. One thing I did here for if you're competing for island top. You can trade in elf toys. I think that's why they're kind of good. You can trade them into some NPC around here. That supposedly gives you gas spawners. So let's find that NPC. Because I do want to find that. So SJD said left of spawn. And it's a castle looking building. Okay. And apparently this amethyst I'm guessing is probably mineable. We're gonna test. Yes we get amethyst shards. What aren't even amethyst. But we'll go with it. And 9 makes about 18k. What isn't too bad. I mean all this loot is pretty good for money wise. Like it isn't too horrible. If we take a look at slash winter. Our time has ticked down. We've lost about 8 minutes. But it's fine. Because I don't plan on spending too much time in here. But I do plan on spending time in here. To figure out metas and test things out. So this is a spawn house. If we go to the left. There we go. I think this is where we have to be. They said a castle looking thing. So that's probably it. Here we are. Okay. Santa's shop. Okay. It is Santa. So you can get gas pouches. So you need 100 elf toys to get all these gas spawners. But honestly. It's not a bad investment. If you're competing for island top. It's a good way to go. I recommend it. So I realized over here. Even more to the left. There's apparently some ice mining. And you can't sell anything here. Oh. But you can when you go out of the zone. But you can mine all this. And then you can walk out and sell it all. Let's go ahead and sell. We made about 300,000 there. That's not too bad. And I think they added a pet specifically for that. And I also got a basic Christmas present from mining here. And of course that comes with having the set. I get two times the amount of presents. So it's pretty good. The Christmas present. You just redeem it. And you get the loot. So I got a cell wand there. Oh my gosh. That's actually pretty decent. I mean the cell wand itself is not good. But the actual rewards you can potentially get is good. Either way. I mined for like not even a minute. And we have a row. How much does that make me? Almost a million. Just for mining this. That's not too shabby. The only issue with this is I do kind of think I need speed potions. Or some sort of speed. Because oh my gosh. This ice is just annoying. They did add in the pets list. Two new pets I think. They added a gobbler pet. What is a new pet for Thanksgiving. And then they added the snowman pet. What is new. Like completely brand new. And I believe it's for mining in there. In the ice area. And then I believe the penguin pet got a buff. And changed to something to do with winter wonderland. For spearing fish. That is pretty dope though. Can't lie. This is going to be fun to grind off camera. I can't wait. Also while I'm at it. I'm just going to go ahead and mention that I did finish the iron golem farm. We are no longer buying iron golems. Because we have a stack of each type. I just wanted to only hit a stack. I'm currently working on the grinder farm. To get that all the way to a stack on each of these. If we go ahead and do slash shop. We can go ahead and buy zombify piglins. For 90 million per spawner. So let's buy one for now. And the reason we're only going to buy one for now. Is if we go ahead and place it down. There's an upgrade button. The upgrade menu allows you to upgrade your spawner. To drop better drops. So if we go ahead and click on this menu. You can see we can upgrade to gold nugget. Or we can go to gold inget. Or we can go to gold block. And of course we're going to go ahead. And get the gold block upgrade. Because that is the best option on the server. Of course inside shop there is a gas spawner. But they don't spawn as much. Compared to the zombified piglin. They have a slower spawn rate. So we're going to go with the zombified piglins. Overall they're a better choice. So now we have one of these. And what I want to do is build it right here. Platform complete. Now we need to build the main area. For where they're going to die. One thing I'm not too sure about. Is can we kill them to magma blocks. Because that's kind of crucial. So let's make a few of these. And then we're going to expand it out here. And then we're going to actually place down the spawner. Let me move them over. And then I'm going to put them right here. Does he die to it? No he doesn't. Just had to double check. Because I'm pretty sure they weren't going to. So we're going to have to figure out a different solution. And I think our best option is cactus. Well technically it's not too simple. But it's good enough. So basically the zombified piglin. Are going to be flowed over from right here. All the way on to this spot. And then pushed over this way. Into this cactus. While the items are being sucked down by the magma blocks. So then they don't get deleted by the cactus. We have to make a storage system a bit later on. Now I just need to build a simple little water flowing system. For the zombified piglin. Which shouldn't be too difficult. One thing I'm pretty sure. Is that they don't need a roof above it. Like those spawners. The creeper and the skeleton. I also already set up my ult. It has a warp prepared. I just have to move it to the spot. Once we have the farm done. So I'm pretty sure this is all we need. Now we need a water wand. So let's grab that out really quick. And we'll go ahead and place all the water down. There we go. And of course we got to go ahead and place the spawner down. Right here. So now we got to go ahead and place the spawner down. So I'm pretty sure I can just place it. And it will spawn. There we go. Hopefully the items do not get deleted. Okay so the items do get deleted. For some reason. Okay I think I have a better way to fix this. So let me do that really quick. So after a hour of actually building this thing. I found a solution and a design that I'm going to be using. There's mine carts within the magma blocks. I've used pistons. And I pushed magma blocks. And put sand blocks and whatnot on top. So hopper mine carts are infused with them. And then literally they're sitting on top of hoppers. So then it can go into the storage. I only think it works on this one spot. So I might have to redesign this. As you can see it's basically dropping mine carts now. But I'm going to keep this one spot here anyways. I just need to go ahead and replace the cactus. I'm pretty sure that's the only way this is going to work. If I want to make sure most of the loot does not get deleted by the cactus. So I gave it about a minute. And none of the drops are actually disappearing. Like they're actually going into this. So the cactus doesn't delete any. What I'm actually very happy about. So this is good to go. So that means we have to build a storage system. So for the storage system. I think we're just going to make a copy of the other design. Not exactly the same. But pretty much the same. So what I'm going to do from this point here. Because this is where the loot starts. We're going to go ahead and go 15 blocks out this way. And then we'll go 15 out the other way. And that's how long the chest system is going to be. And then we'll have two sides of it of course. Just like this one. I'm going to build a temporary bit of chest. And that's quite literally it. This will be the outline for the full thing. But for now we're just going to go ahead and not do that. So the temporary loop is made. Now we're just going to make a chest system on this side. And that's about it. We'll grab about a stack of chests here. We'll make it go down about five. Have it a five by five. That's quite literally it. We're not doing anything complex. Because I do just want to get this done and over with. So probably next video I'll have a whole chest system made for this whole thing. Now we'll place the hoppers on the back. And here we go. So basically we have the full farm done. But the only thing we're missing out on is actually getting more spawners. So we'll go ahead and buy I think 10 of these. So we'll take one away. And then we'll go ahead place this down. And then I'm going to add them all in. All right there we go. We got 10 of them. And now we have 11. I'm pretty sure we can buy a few more. I'm going to see if I can buy like maybe I don't know seven more. Okay so I put 18 in. I think we have a good amount. For the time being at least. So let's take a look at the loot. See how it blows in. It seems to be working fine as of right now. So from what I can say is this thing is fully working. I do want to go ahead and upgrade a cobblestone generator. It's not just some ordinary cobblestone generator though. If we take a look right here. This is a tower gen. If you right click the tower gen. You can actually upgrade it. And it spawns ores. So we're going to be using the frosty pickaxe. I got from two videos ago. It's the best pickaxe currently on the server as you can see. But basically this thing regenerates ores over time. As you see it just regenerated. And if we go ahead we can move it around. If we click this we can place it on a different block. Move it wherever we want. But the main purpose of this is actually selling and making a ton of money. And also using the upgrade menu to upgrade its loot. And its storage. So you can hold more items and get better drops. So we're going to be upgrading the tower gen. I think I have enough to upgrade its loot. But not the storage. What is kind of unfortunate. But I do want to get the tower gen completely maxed out. So let's go ahead. Go to loot. And wherever this copper is. We need to keep clicking it. Because that should upgrade it. And if you look on the scoreboard. My balance is going to go down eventually. Quite a significant amount. But not like insane. But I think we're going to be able to max this out. If I'm not mistaken. Here we go. The final upgrade. Boom. We have it maxed out. There is no more upgrades. As I'm clicking the next page button. So if we go ahead. Move the tower gen. Let's move it here. It should spawn all these now. The best ore on the server. But we're going to go ahead and move it back. And we can instamine all of this. With this pickaxe. And the fortune will apply. With the fortune 12. As you can see. We made off of mining. Just barely any time there. We've made 11,000. Obviously it isn't the greatest. But it could be better. Either way. I wanted to get this leveled up to the max. And then also. If we take a look at our pickaxe. We only have regular enchants. No custom. So if we go ahead and do such enchants. Go to the pickaxe. We need to get all four of these enchants. And they're pretty simple to get. I mean the only difficult one. I think is. Earthquake if I'm not mistaken. And Electro Buster. I think those are the only two difficult ones. So for this video. I saved up a ton of XP. We're going to start out with transfuse. What is in the exotic section. So buy 10 of these. And we'll start slow. And we're going to try and get transfuse too. We already got a transfuse one. But we don't want that. And if we get any good cell wand enchants. I'll probably keep those as well. All right. We got to scrap this all. And we're going to keep repeating this. Until I get the enchant. I got a repeat three. What is actually pretty good for my cell wands. So I can't complain on that. That's not too bad. I'm just hoping we have enough XP to get all this. But so far it's not looking too great. I'm going to splash another XP bottle. We've still got a ton of XP. We have like 10 billion total we can spend. I also do need to apply antidote to this helmet. So we're going to try and apply it. There we go. So far our luck is looking unfortunate for these exotic orbs. Oh we got it. There we go. A 33% chance. Will it apply? Yes it does. Thank gosh. So now we have to move on to I think the rare section. Because we do need to get at least one telekinesis. What is not too difficult. The only difficult one is probably going to be the legendary orb section. And we already got telekinesis. Apply it. There we go. So now we can already just scrap these. So now we have to go all in on legendary and hope we can get earthquake 5. As well as electro buster 5. So we'll see. We'll go ahead and start with 50 plus orbs. And we'll see how it goes from there. Of course if I do get health boost I do need to keep some health boost. So I'll keep those. And double dip 2 over that. I also need to apply hack to this helmet. See if it works. There we go. And I need 2 health boost 3's for these armor sets. So I'm going to try and see if I can get those. I got one of them. Apply that. There we go. Another health boost 3. Perfect. If this applies then that basically means I'm done getting any other enchant for my armor. Either way we're done that. Now we have to go ahead try and get the good enchants for our pickaxe. But so far we have not had any good luck on that. We got electro buster 4. But we'll still try and apply this. See if it works. It did not. If we get anywhere close we'll still apply it and see if it works. Scrapping is so useful because you just get a ton of xp back. It's so nice. Another electro buster 4. There we go. But we need it to get to 5. So we need to hope we can get a 5. So far we are not having any luck with the max electro buster or earthquake. So it's kind of looking bad right now. We got earthquake 3. What I mean we'll try to apply. There we go. We got earthquake 3. We're so close to running out of xp. This is not looking great. Okay. So it seems like we're not gonna get it. And I believe last time I checked it was maximum level 4 on earthquake. Now it's level 5 though. So that is kind of weird. Because it says it in the menu that it's level 5. But I've only gotten to level 4. I've never seen a level 5 once in my time. We can buy a few more. And then I think we're pretty much done. We got double dip 3. I mean I'll take that. Another double dip 3. Oh my gosh. Okay. So it seems we are basically done. So if I'm gonna be straightforward. We didn't get a max pickaxe. Because we lacked a lot of xp. And I'm pretty sure this is decent enough. Because if I look in pv3 this is the highest I've ever gotten a pickaxe. For its custom enchants. I've never gotten earthquake 5 yet. I've not seen it once. And the reason I'm not using this pickaxe is because it doesn't instamine. So this one is probably the better option. But basically what electro buster does I believe is it strikes down the whole tower gen. As you can see right there. And then you can just sell the loot and make a ton of money. Early game if you had an instamining pickaxe like this. This would be one of the best metas. But at this current state in the map I don't think it's worth it to go for this. I just wanted to test it out because I've never gotten to this point. So I thought it'd be a cool experience. So what earthquakes 4 is here at the molten mine in Etheria. What it will do is basically just strike down a big warden explosion. Then it'll give you a ton of the blocks within the range. And then transfuse gives you emerald mob coins from the coal ones. What is kind of op when you think about it. Especially when you can instamine. So it is kind of op to have this pickaxe when it instamines as well. So I do recommend getting a pickaxe that has instamine. It's just very hard to get them. This is basically the best we're gonna get this pickaxe. If you go ahead and do slash IS upgrades. There are specific ones that can be upgraded within your island upgrades to make you more money. And the one I'm looking at is the Puhaku. I think that's how you pronounce it. Soul. And basically this one you can upgrade all the way up to level 7. And it gives you more money if you level it up. And the way you level it up is with gold mob coins. Some of them cost emerald mob coins. Like the best one what is a spirit. What takes a lot of time and it's harder to get as a solo. So I don't recommend going for it as a solo. Maybe Pohaku is a good option for being solo or a celestial soul. But I recommend Pohaku soul overall as a solo. Anyways the point is we're gonna be upgrading this all the way to max. If I have enough gold mob coins. Or at least close to max. That is the plan. And then we actually have to get a ton of Pohaku hearts. I believe if we do slash recipes. This is where all the recipes are for certain items you can craft here on the server. Because you can craft things that are like purchasable on the store. Just by playing the game. So it's pretty cool. But the point is here on the first page. We can see the soul. And all you need to do to craft it is kill the Pohaku boss. And you need I believe top 5 placement. What I've been getting quite recently. You need at least 9 of these. And the way you get them is from bots or buying them off players. So that is my goal for the video. To try and get that done. And make one of those. And then upgrade the upgrade. And then sell with a cell wand. That has a 3 times multiplier. And we're gonna make the cell wand even better. Because we need to make sure it makes a ton of money. So we're gonna grab a double dip 3. And hope it applies. It applied. Perfect. We needed that. And then we also need a fire sale. So we'll go ahead and apply that. And then we need a repeat 3. But I'll see if I can find the worst one possible. I think it's this one. 70%. It failed. That's unfortunate. Can we apply this one? Okay. That one applied. Perfect. So if you're doing singular item sells. Or like just a small amount of items. So let's say recipe craft items. And you're selling them in like a chest. So you would put it in a chest. And then you right click on the chest. And sell it. With a cell wand with this. You don't really need bulk. Because that's for a full chest of loot. For like iron golem farms. Zombie pigmen. And all sorts of other mob types. So this we'll be using for recipes. So I can use a usage every time I sell one of these. Or I can do it every now and then. It really depends. So the plan is we're gonna be doing the warp Puhaku boss. Until we get a heart. And then I'll probably buy the rest of them off other players. Because I do know some players that probably would be willing to sell me some. I do also want to check when the boss spawned at. It was at 06 on the clock. So at an hour and six minutes. So in about 51 minutes. I should be able to fight the boss here. And we also need to go ahead. Go to the island upgrades. Go to the cell prices. Go to Puhaku soul. And we're gonna use our gold mob coins. We have almost 500,000. That should get us realistically to about level five. What isn't too bad. So we'll go for the first. Second. Third. Fourth. And then can we get the fifth? Yeah we can get the fifth. Can we get six? No we cannot. So I need about 250,000 from this player. I'm gonna buy them off of them. Um. How much for 250k I'm gonna say. I'm gonna see how much they're willing to do. I'm willing to pay whatever really. Just not pass like three bill I'm hoping. So we're gonna go ahead and withdraw 1.3 bill. I have to put a dollar symbol. I completely forgot. So we're gonna go ahead and give them 1.3 bill. And they should mob coins pay me. 250k. There we go. So now we can go ahead and go to island upgrades. Go here. Go to Puhaku Soul. Get the last two upgrades that we need. And we'll have a bit spare in case we need it. So now when we sell a Puhaku Soul. It's gonna be worth 250 million right off the bat. I thought I'd have to pay more than 2 bill for all those mob coins. But we surprisingly got them for under 2 bill. So that's pretty decent. While I'm at it. I have around 70,000 emerald mob coins. And I have upgraded my skill and money boosters over time. So I do want to get up the skill booster. I think to max if I can. Depends on how much it is. Because it goes up to 14. So we'll see if we can purchase close to it. We're close to getting to 13. We're a little over 4,000 shy. And then we need 30,000 to get 14. But I'll probably get at some point later on. Probably off camera. But I mean we'll still complete it really really soon. And then I have to get the money booster up. What is actually really expensive. Because it goes up way more levels. So it costs way more emerald mob coins. But it'll be worth it. Anyways I'm gonna wait for the boss. And I'll give you guys an update here in a bit. So boss is about to spawn in about 3 minutes. And I did actually go ahead and spend 300 mil on 3 of the Puhoku hearts. So we do have all 8. Except for 1. That we need to get from the boss. So we're gonna go ahead and fight the boss here in a moment. I got my strength pots. And I've got my haste 3 droid pet. Which should help since we are on a latest version. But anyways let's go ahead and fight this boss. Okay so the boss has spawned. I drank strength. I also ate a god apple. So I think we're good. Hopefully we can place top 5. That is the goal. I'm doing as much damage as I can. Oh my gosh. I just fell. That is not a good thing. That might have costed us the amount of damage I want to do. We'll see. My strength might run out. Oh no. So we got the heart that we needed. Let's go. So now I have all 9. Let's go ahead and do slash craft. Or go to a crafting bench. And as you can see we made the Puhoku soul. Let's go ahead and we'll put it in this chest. Because why not. And we're gonna check boosters. Booster. Show. And there's a super money. So we'll go ahead and activate a regular money if we can. I'm asking someone to activate a regular money booster. Hopefully someone will activate one. I'll give it about a minute or two. If not then we're just gonna have to sell. Actually I can buy one in XP shop. I'm gonna buy it really quick. And we're gonna go ahead and apply it. Because no one else is proccing it. So I'll spend 300 million XP on that. And we're gonna go ahead and make sure our piggy pet's active. Our money sets on. And we sell. And there we go. We made a ton of money. And now I'm gonna calculate this. Because I didn't actually withdraw all my money to begin with. So we're gonna take a calculation really quickly here. So I did the calculation. And in total we made 1.51 billion. Just off of that one. With all those multipliers. And every single money amount. The cell right here. All the extra boosts. And the piggy pet. As well as our repeat actually worked. So that's cool. Saved the usage. But we made 1.51 billion. That is insane. I want to actually build. A better version of the zombified piglins. Because this farm. I only have one of them. And I'd like to make more. And we're gonna move the mob coin generators. To a new location that I've been working on. If I go ahead and start flying out here. You guys can see some blocks. I've been using Lightmatica. Because I've been printing in a ton of chests. As well as hoppers. I have basically just prepared. A area for where we're gonna build. Different zombie piglin farms. Because each one of these has to have 70 blocks. In between where the new spawner is gonna be. So we're gonna build 4 of these. Because I have about 4 accounts. That is basically the go to plan. So the first thing we do need to go ahead and do. Is actually make a loop. So what I need to do is go to redstone. And we're gonna buy a ton of hoppers. We're gonna need a few stacks of these. And I'm gonna go all the way down to the very far end. And then we're gonna start hooking these all up together. Each of these farms in between all the chests. Have at least 4 chunks. So that is basically how much space you need. So a new mob can spawn of the same type. Anyways what I want to do is loop this around like this. But first we need to go ahead and start putting down hoppers in a line. Going back this way. I do have about 20 billion in my balance. I've been stocking up over time. But I just haven't spent it. Because I had no purpose to spend it on anything. Alright we just have to go ahead and place some hoppers here. And then we have to loop this around. So let's go ahead loop it. And let's go back the other way. Alright let's hook up the loop here. And I think what I'll do is probably just not put a layer on top of this. It really doesn't matter. So now the next plan of action is we need to make an actual farm for one of them. So let's go ahead get that started. Let's get the deep slate bricks. One thing I'm also going to be doing is presetting a area on all of these. Where if the hopper mine carts actually disappear. Then we'll be able to put them back in pretty simple. And I won't have to set up rails every time. So we're gonna do that. We're gonna put a slab here. And that's where the sand is gonna sit. So I do need some sand. Let's go ahead grab that. We'll get a stack of sand. And we'll get a stack of cactus. Just in case I mess things up. So we have a ton to use. So the sand goes there. Okay so I think I have an idea on how I want to build this. I want to make a piston pushing system. So every time this messes up I can just instantly put these back in. The mine carts. So I'm gonna rethink a better design really quick. So give me one moment. So I think I made a setup for this. Basically every time I am gonna redo this. I can retract the water. And I can go ahead and place a block here. Put a rail down. If I need to fix the system. And I can use a piston system to push some blocks into the mine carts. So what I want to do is go ahead place down this mine cart. And then we're gonna go ahead break these two things here. And then we'll go ahead place a block up there. Place another mine cart. Should situate it in the position we want it in. And then we're gonna do a mine cart here. And there we go. So now I can break this. And then I have to situate how I want the magma blocks to go in place. I believe it's the gist of this all. And I think I have to move this back one. So what I do is I go ahead activate this. There we go. Push that in. And then I need to go ahead place a block there. So I can start pushing these in. And I just have to do it multiple times. And it should be pushed in in the right position. If I'm not mistaken. Yep they're in the right spots. Perfect. So now that is completely set up for the first one. And then I can just break this. And break the wall back. If I need to. And it'll be fine. So that's good. And of course then I have to block off this. I'm also gonna need to move this button. I just realized. So there we go. Put it there. I'm just trying to make this more simple on myself. Without having to destroy the whole thing. But only destroying parts of it. And fixing it pretty quick. Of course we forgot the one big thing of this. We need chests. So we'll go ahead and grab some chests. I think we need about 12 in total for all of the farms. So we'll go ahead and place those down. And then when I press this. Water flows in. And there we go. That is quite literally the killing chamber in a nutshell. And how I can fix it quick and easy. Now I need to go ahead and actually build the spawner area. I do have Light Matica now. So I can get a blueprint of all this. What is pretty helpful. So once I build it one time. I'm gonna blueprint it. And move it to the position that I want to have it at. On the other locations. And that'll be that. We'll put a sign down there. And then we're gonna go ahead to the water now. This should hopefully reach if I'm not mistaken. We're probably set. Yeah we're set. Okay the water is situated. Now I need to go ahead and find the spawner's like pillar. I guess. And I guess we can go ahead and put it on this block. But we won't do it right now. Because we need to go ahead and build more of these. So now I'm gonna need to copy this all with Light Matica. And start building the other ones. Now I need to go ahead and use Light Matica. And actually select this whole build. And we're gonna copy all of this area. And then we'll use it as a blueprint to build the other ones. I gotta figure out where I'm gonna be placing this as well. Okay so everything's in place. It didn't copy the whole thing. But it did copy majority of it. So I know where to put things. So I'm gonna start building the rest of these. And I'll give you guys an update here in a bit. So it is indeed the next day. And I did actually manage to do a lot of things on the island off camera. So first of all. I did actually manage to destroy the old zombie piglin farm. And all these chests. A decent bit of them have like a ton of gold blocks in them. That I do need to sell. So I'll sell them at some point. And then destroy all this. And I also sold all of the iron golems. Because we're no longer using iron golems anymore. Since we're investing in this new design. So I will be destroying this farm as well at some point. I just don't know when. So the mob coin farm. I don't have an alt here anymore. Because I'm gonna be using all four of these alts. Over on the farms over there. But for this we do need to go ahead. Pick up all our generators. So I'm gonna go ahead and start destroying all this. And at least get all of our emerald generators going. All the way over to the new area. And turns out there's a better design I could have been using. It just uses a lot of hoppers. It's just putting a hopper above instead of packed ice. Or blue ice. So we're gonna be doing that instead. So we're gonna fly all the way over to the new location. I should probably set a warp over here. What probably would be smart. So I'm gonna set a warp. I have sip warp zp. And that's how I'll get here. All four of the farms are fully finished. They're all intact. And all I need to do is place down the rest of the zombified piglins. And I actually spent about almost 20 billion around there on getting the last stack and a half. Because I sold all the iron golems. So I used all the money from that into the new spawners. And I still have 24 billion. What is kind of wild. So on this block here. I want to basically make a platform. Just outlining this chunk overall. And then that's where the mob coin gems will go. And then when we run out of space. We'll put more in different chunks. At different alts. Just so we have enough area for mob coin gems at some point. So here's the plan. The platform is built. Now we need to go ahead and put the mob coin generators within this outline. And then there'll be chests going down here with hoppers. And it won't be like an insane storage system. But it'll be enough. So I believe mob coin generators are three tall. So let's break this really quick. I just had to double check. So what we're gonna do is put a border here. And then have hoppers all going along from this direction. So I need to get a lot of hoppers really quick. From my knowledge. I'm pretty sure my ult can reach the whole range of this design. If not I'll have to readjust things. But either way this should work for now. I just need to move the other design. Because it's kind of not necessary anymore. Okay there we go. Hoppers are done. So we put some hopper facing downwards there. And then we'll break all the deep slate. And then put hoppers feeding this way. Then what I need is a bit of chest. So let's grab out two stacks. I just need to make these all double chests. And then put hoppers on the back. And then place the mob coin gens. So we should be good from that point forward. After we do all this. Then what we'll do afterwards. Is go ahead and put our alts in position. And then we'll go ahead and place down the spawners. All right. We can go ahead and start placing down all the gens. And I'll go ahead and grab all the other ones. And then we'll be good to go. So all the generators are now down. So this system should be working perfectly. If I'm not mistaken. So now I need to set my warps for ZP 1 and 2 and 3 and 4. So let's go ahead and set those up. And then I have to relaunch my alts once I'm done setting these up. So they actually warp over here. Warps are set. So let's go ahead and relaunch the alts. Okay. So this alt is set up. This alt is set up. This one is up. And hopefully the last one should be set up as well. It is not. Give it a moment. There we go. So now the moment of truth. We can go ahead and place down these spawners. I'm gonna have to split them up in 32 so I can actually make this process way easier. So we go ahead. Place one down. Add them all in. And there we go. That is one. Let's hope this works. Okay. It spawned another stack. Perfect. There we go. Another one's up. And that'll feed into there. And then the last one. Let's go ahead. Finish this off. Add them all. And there we go. So now I should be making from compared to what I had earlier about four times. What is kind of insane. Technically I could have probably done like maybe 28 to 24 spawners in each. But 32 is fine just because it secures the amount of mobs being in each one of these. So it will never despawn unless there's an entity clear. There we go. We have our giant farm complete for gold block zombie pigmen. If we go ahead and go to this warp winter right here. They added quests to the world and they also added a new boss. So we're gonna be attending the new boss in this video. As well as you can see there's also gingerbread that drop candy canes that sell for quite a bit of money. But the point is right here we have a new boss on the server. It is called the gingerbread or the evil gingerbread golem to be exact. And you can get a monthly crate for placing first and it happens every hour and a half. What is absolutely insane for the rewards it gives is kind of broken. So we're gonna be attending this gingerbread boss in about 30 minutes from now hopefully. Because I want to see if I can try and place in top 3 and at least get an elf key. Because elf key is a reward you get per third and you get all the previous rewards as well. For the time being I'm gonna farm all these candy canes off these gingerbread here. Then we're gonna do the boss and then we're gonna do the new quest on the server. Because they added a new quest line in the winter wonderland here. So I would like to start doing that. So I'll give you guys an update here in a bit. The gingerbread boss is about to spawn in about 5 minutes. A little less. And I've been doing a lot of grinding. I've made a little bit of money off of just killing all these gingerbread for extra candy canes. So that is good but I can't wait to find this boss so let's get right into it. The boss is spawning in 15 seconds. Here we go. Beneath this god apple really quick here. And we're also gonna drink a strength pot. There we go. Let the games begin. Gingerbread boss is in. Oh my gosh. I think jumping is not a good strategy because this thing launches you in the air. So it's best you kind of stay on the ground when fighting him. So I got 5th place because I got an exotic present but isn't too bad. I'd say that is a W. We also got an evil gingerbread man head. What is used for the Santa quest. What I'm gonna hold on to because I'm gonna need that for a quest. So we'll put that right there. Go ahead open these pouches. See what we get from this. Nothing good. It was a Selwan for 2 times for 150 uses. I mean it's better than nothing but I mean we could have gotten better. So we'll go ahead go back to the island and put that in my Selwan chest. But there we go. We fought the boss and now I think we're gonna start doing the quest. So I did slash quest and the first quest is talk to Jolly the Elf and learn about the Winter Wonderland. So we're gonna go ahead go to warp winter. Jolly the Elf. Hello. Hello. And we get 20k emerald mob coins just for talking to the NPC to start our quest missions. What is not too bad. I'll take that. So now if we do quest again we should have another one. We have to speak to Santa in his house. So let's go ahead go to Santa. And we get a set crate key for this one. Hopefully from the set crate key we can get something insanely good because that would be very nice. So let's talk to Santa here. Travel to the land of the elves. So we have to travel to the land of the elves where I have no clue where that's at. I think it's over here. Yeah. And we have to find Sparkle the Elf. So I found the Elf. It's right over here. Let's go ahead talk to the Elf. And we got our set crate key already. Wow that was really quick. Now let's take a look at the quest line. See what we got now. We get two Elf keys for speaking to Ginger the Elf next to the skating rink. Okay let's go to the skating rink. What is all the way up here again. So I think I'll go to warp ginger red. And we can get here pretty much instantly by doing that. Here we are. Speak to this NPC. I do not really care for what they have to say. I just read what the quest tells me to do. So I have to mine out ice apparently from what it said. So we have to mine 10,000 tube coral. What isn't too difficult. I mean we can get that done. Let's go ahead grab out our pickaxe and let's get started. And I think we can fly in here if I'm not mistaken. Yes we can. So we need 10,000 of this. So I have to bring back 10,000. So I'm going to bring it to the NPC every time my inventory is full. As well we're going to get some presents from this. But it's not too bad. We are 5,000 tube coral in. Pretty much 6,000. Three more trips and we should be good. Let's go ahead and put the crate key away in my PV for now. Slash quest. And let's see what we got next. See if we can do it. Epic spawner pouches. What aren't too great. But we'll go ahead and talk to I believe the Santa NPC. So let's go ahead. Go to the Santa NPC. Clear out evil gingerbread from the winter wonderland. So what does that mean? I think that means kill gingerbread. I'm not too sure. Let's see. Is it just killing gingerbread? Yes it is. Okay so this is where we'll stop on the questing. I think we did a good amount of questing. But we'll go ahead and open up the crates that we got. Because I would like to get those opened. So we'll go ahead and go to PV1. We'll go ahead and open up the first elf. We got wintertime and wintertime. What I mean I still technically need. So I'm not complaining. I'll take it. And then we set crate. We got access to speed 1. What I don't even need because I have speed 2. We're going to be going ahead and building a ghast farm. Because on the server if we go ahead and take a look in my PV. We got 32 ghast spawners. And you can upgrade these with the upgrade menu. And you can get them to emerald blocks. And I want to get a ton of emerald block ghast spawners. But I do need to find a way to kill them. So I built a farm that I've used about 3 years ago on this server. And I got the basic design down. And the only thing I have to change is a chest system. What we'll do once we build this layout. Because in one of my previous videos we did go ahead and make a gold block pigman farm. Or zombified piglins. And these have been running like crazy. Making me a ton of money. What reminds me I'm going to have to sell sometime later today. But the point is I have 4 alt accounts going on top of all of these. And I'm going to build the farm for the gas right above. I think I'm only going to build one from scratch right now. But I'll build 4 probably all in total off camera. I'll have all 4 done. But we're going to start working on the first one. And I did actually use Lightmatica to schematic it. So I'm going to get the schematic hologram in really quick. So I have the schematic in place. And all I have to really do is build this. So we're going to go ahead and grab out all the blocks. And we're going to start building it. And we're going to build it right above where my alt is. So then it can afk both of these. And then we have to build a storage system over on this side. And then we should be good. Let's go ahead and get some deep slate bricks. And I'm going to need a lot. The reason there's this big chunk of deep slate back here. Is because the gas can spawn there. So I needed to fill that all in. So it is a way to hold them off. I guess from spawning. We got the first corner built. So now let's start filling this in. So while the deep slate is placed. Now we need to go ahead and get the sand. Go ahead and grab 2 sand blocks. And then we need 2 cactus. So we'll buy that. And then we need some string and tripwire hooks. So we need 4 tripwire hooks. 2 sticky pistons. Now let's go ahead and get some string. And let's go ahead and set this up. So I think I can put cactus down here. And then put string on top. So it never grows. What is a good thing? And then we need the tripwire hooks. Where did those go? There they are. We also need to make some stairs before I put the other tripwire hooks down. And we need to break these 2 blocks here. I'm going to put the sticky pistons in the back. Put some stairs down. And then we'll go ahead for the tripwires. And then we'll hook it up with string. So that should work. There we go. And now they're fully functional. Now I'm going to grab 2 buckets of water. So I need 1 more bucket. There we go. And that is the core concept of the design. And then I also have to break where the spawners will go. And there we go. We're done. Of course, the only thing we're missing is a storage system. So I do want to set one of those up. So I made a little tunnel system for all the items to flow to one specific spot. Which should be around here if I'm not mistaken. And then what's going to happen is they're going to get picked up by some mine carts underneath. And then flow into a system. Pretty simple. And I'll make the chest system off camera. But I do want to set up how the hoppers are going to be laid out. So we'll do that. So now what I need to do is grab out the hoppers and make them feed this way. And we'll put an outline around it. Now I need to get 6 rails. So let's go ahead and get 6 of these. Put them all down in a loop. And then we need to grab out 6 mine carts. Also in case this ever breaks, we're going to grab out some gray glass. And we're going to use that as a block here. To see if the mine carts are still working. Okay, one there. One there. And then we'll do one here. Put one here. And then I got to quickly place these in the corners. One, two. As you can see, now they're looping. So it should pick up on those three spots now. Since it's looping. And they're all inside of one spot. Perfect. So my next plan of action is to make a loop. Because it's going to be connecting still like all of the other ones. So we need to go ahead and make this loop. And it's going to be facing this way, of course. Because I want the chests on this side, preferably. And then we'll have chests going all the way down. Just like on this design over here. So we'll make the loop. And we'll put a bit of temporary chests down. And then we'll place the spawners. All right. So the loop is now complete. Here we go. Perfect. Okay. So I want to go ahead and get some chests. And we're going to make a little storage system going. Facing this way. And we'll make it all the way of the chunk length. And we'll make it go down three. So let's get the hoppers going. And then the chests we'll go ahead and place down as well. I'm probably going to need a bit more. So I got to buy more. But it's very convenient to have all my farms in one specific area. Because then I can AFK them all at once. So it's kind of nice. I cannot lie about that. That's for sure. At some point, I'll make sure the storage goes all the way to the bottom of the world. But for now, I think we're fine for only this much. Because we won't be making too much for now. So that is the whole design. We're basically done. So now I'm going to buy five gas spawners. Because I do want to actually make sure I have a stack in total. And then we're going to upgrade these. So let's go up here. Put them all in. And we'll get all these up for 10 billion right there. Just for a stack. Only a stack. And we're going to eventually go from having just emerald block. To having regular emeralds as well. But we'll start with emerald block in each farm. And then once we run out of emerald block upgrades. We'll go ahead and go into emerald. At least is how I want to do it. So now we have 64 emerald block gas. And as you can see, it's working perfectly. All the items are going in the system. Getting picked up. And most of the time, the items will not get killed by the cactus. Or removed, I guess. It'll actually go into the system. We'll go ahead and buy another stack of gas. And we'll quickly upgrade those as well. I think is the plan. So we'll go ahead. Put them all in. Upgrade. And then pick those up. And I think we can buy 32 more. Let's see if we can do that. Okay, let's see. Can we upgrade them all? Yes, we can. So we have 160 gas spawners now. That is insane. Oh my gosh. And they're all emerald block. Each one of these is like 30 million for island top, I just realized. So from all the gas we placed down, we got 4.8 billion value. What is insane. Even though I'm not competing for island top, like I'm not participating, it's still cool to see how much value I have at the end of the day. And if we type slash recipes, there is a few that stand out. Emerald mob coin gen shard. Gold mob coin gen shard. Coal mob coin gen shard. And what this is, is essentially you put mob coin generators in a crafting GUI. You put one in every single slot. So that's nine. And then you get one of these. And it can be used to craft a super version of that type of mob coin generator. So I want to go ahead and at least craft the super mob coin generator today of any type. If we go into PV4, I have eight coal, five gold, six emerald. And if we get one more mob coin generator in the coal tier, we can make a super generator. I already have two currently for emerald. I do want to set up a farm area because I had to destroy for the ghast farm. I had to destroy the mob coin generator area. Basically, what that means is we need to find an area that we can put super mob coin generators down. The problem with the regular ones is when you have too many of them, it can cause your game to lag. So the super ones make it so you get more mob coins while lagging very little. It's a good trade off. It just takes time to get the super one. You can see the difference on the emerald one. I get one every four minutes and 30 seconds on the super. I get every four minutes and 30 seconds. I get 200. What is a big difference? Let's go ahead and get some deep slate bricks. We're just them up and let's turn on chunks to see what we're working with here. So I found the edge of the chunk here. And what we're going to do is have hoppers going down. So I'm going to buy a stack of chests or more. I think more is probably a better option. So I want to make it so the mob coin gems are in this chunk with the alt. But then the loot gets transferred to this chunk over here. That is pretty much the go-to plan. We're going to make the mob coin gems on this line right here. So we need to go ahead, grab them out. And I guess we'll put two down for now because that's all we have. And then we need hoppers very quickly here. So let's go ahead and grab some hoppers. We are going to need a few stacks of these. So I got a few stacks of hoppers. Now we need to go ahead, make a layout here. And then we're going to put hoppers feeding this way. Now I need to place blocks here. And we'll have a hopper facing down, hopper facing down. And we'll put two different ways that this will go. So then it doesn't overflow as often. Just doesn't have any issues, of course. That's the plan I want for it. So all I have to do now is make a chest system going down about this far. I think is the plan. On each side though. It'll go right to the edge of the chunk because that's just the easiest option. So that should mean we have, I think, 16 of these chests in one row. So let's go ahead and do it on the other side. The reason we're making the chest system different from how the other chest systems are for the farms. Because I want the mob coins to actually flow down to the very bottom if I take out of the bottom chest. It's just more convenient. So what I'm doing is actually fixing the mob coin generator area because I messed up the hoppers. I'll give a rundown of what I just fixed here in a moment. So let's place the mob coin gens down. And then we're going to have hoppers feeding this way, of course. And then hoppers feeding this way. Then, of course, we have hoppers feeding along here. Okay, so I had to fix it so where all the items would go down a specific path. Like, go to one spot first. That is basically all I wanted. I needed hoppers facing down under the row. So now I need to place a ton of chests down. One thing I'm doing is placing the chest manually because using Lightmatica the first time when building is kind of weird. Like, getting a little part of it. So let's say this row of chests and then just moving it down a ton. Would just take longer than actually building it manually the first time. And if I build it manually the first time, then I can copy the whole thing for another time when I need to use it. So realistically, I think this is the better option. And then I'll copy this whole design when I'm done. Okay, so half of the chests are done. Now we have to do this side. So from what it seems, setting up the rest of these are actually very simple. I'm not having really any troubles placing these. And then we have to go ahead and put the hoppers down and we should be good. One thing we're forgetting is also we need to make the whole mob coin generator. So we have to make that as well. But let's go ahead and start placing down these hoppers on the back side here of all the chests. And so that means we can actually fill the loot to the very bottom of these. So let's go ahead and get this going. Okay, so all the hoppers are done. So we're done the layout. We just got to wait and see if this flows properly in the system with these mob coin generators here. They should be spawning in about five seconds. There we go, 200 and another 200. So it picks them up instantly and then they flow into the right spot. And the good thing about this design is I can just make it expandable on the back. I can just keep adding more generators over time if I really need to. Really quickly, I'm going to pick up these generators so I can schematic this. So give me one moment. Okay, so I finished up getting the schematic. Now we're just going to go ahead, place these down, and we're going to try and buy a cool mob coin generator off of someone. So one of the helpers, Little Cart, is going to give me a cool mob coin generator for free. I was going to go ahead and buy one, but I mean, it is what it is. I appreciate it. There we go. Little Cart just gave me the mob coin generator, the cool one. I appreciate it nonetheless. So we're going to go ahead and go to PB4, and we're going to grab out all these mob coin generators here and the gen shards. Now we're going to go ahead and do slash craft or just use a crafting table. And we're going to go ahead and now combine that. And then we're going to make a super mob coin generator. And it's for coal. So every 45 seconds, I get 200. What is absurd. So I'm going to give it one dedicated side of this whole thing. And then this side will just be for all the emeralds. But every 45 seconds, I'm going to be getting 200 coal mob coins. But I mean, they're not the best mob coin. But I mean, that's a ton. It's going to overflow this thing like crazy. And it makes my FPS slightly better. I mean, all these chests are not helping my FPS. I would be at like way more if I was further away. But the chests are just chunking my FPS down like crazy. The way we're going to make a ton of money is by using a custom mob. I've already farmed a lot of it. I'll show how much I've gotten over time. We're actually going to be showing two custom mobs. But if we go to warp winter, we're going to go to the custom winter wonderland world. And the first one is the gingerbread. It drops a candy cane on kill. And if we go ahead and do slash sell all, two of them made me about 450,000 per one. And then we have multipliers we can use to make a ton of money from them. So these are really overpowered when you farm a ton of them. It's just really, really worth it. And then we have to find the other one. It's a reindeer. They're harder to find, but they give reindeer antlers that sell for a ton. So I need to go ahead and find a reindeer. There we go. A reindeer. Two of them. Let's go ahead and kill this one here and get two reindeer antlers. We'll kill this one also because why not? But if we go ahead and do slash sell all just from four, we made 18.5 million off of four of those. And currently right now we have 37 billion. And I want to go ahead and make a ton of money using all sorts of boosters on a ton of these items. That I've stocked up over time. First, we have two dubs almost of candy canes. And then we have 10 stacks of reindeer antlers and 40 spare. And in PB2, I have a Pohaku soul, what I can actually sell as well. So I'll put it all in these two chests. It's that will sell. And the Pohaku soul is using the custom recipes. Because in slash recipes, you can craft one with nine Pohaku hearts from the boss. And we're going to be using one of the best sell ones on the server with maxed out enchants on it. Repeat three, fire sale one, bulk four, and double dip three. This will make us a ton of money when we sell both of these chests. And where we're going to be putting all the money at the end towards is gas farms. Because I already have, if I go ahead and take a look at island top, go to my island and take a look at our value. We have 15 billion value in gas spawners in the emerald block version of them. And we have 500 of those, what is crazy. So we need to increase that amount by a ton. So we need to go ahead and grab out all of our money making boosters. We need our money set tier one. So we got our full money set. Then we need to go ahead and grab out our piggy pet. So let's go ahead and activate that. Make sure it's active. So we can get a almost 0.5 multiplier. And then we have to check if there's any boosters active. There is one booster. So I activated a self money booster. We need a money booster. So we're going to go XP shop. And we're going to buy a regular money booster with XP. And then we'll go ahead, do slash boosters and activate that. And in my island upgrades, I do already have all the money boosters set up. So I get from the default amount, I get a 275% boost. So here we go. We're going to sell the candy canes first. We're at 37 billion. Now we're at 47.5. So we made about 10 bill there from what it seems. And then we have this chest with the reindeer antlers that are going to make more. Same with the Bohaku soul. Let's sell that. We're at 47.5. Oh my gosh. We went from 37 billion to 77 billion. That's 40 billion dollars right there. Oh my gosh. Just from all the multipliers and all those items. And that was like maybe two hours of grinding all those mobs within the winter wonderland. And we need to get a lot of gas spawners. So let's go ahead and purchase those. Let's buy three stacks. And then we already have 38. So we're going to put them all into here. Upgrade them all for 35 billion. And that is about, I believe, 230 gas spawners into emerald block. And we still have 17 billion almost. So we can buy even more. So let's go ahead and go into the shop. And we're going to buy another stack. And we'll go ahead and upgrade all of that if we can. We can almost do it. So we need to remove around maybe eight. We need to remove, I think, four more. There we go. We can purchase the upgrade now. So now we got another 52. And then we, of course, have 12 spare gas spawners for next time I need to upgrade more. So we go to IS Warp ZP. We need to go ahead and go over to our farms. And as you can see, this spawner here is already filled up to the brim. So what I want to do is build another ghast farm. So all it's going to take is us to put a Lightmatica schematic down. And then we're going to build it. And then hook it up to this and build a chest system. I'm quickly going to get the schematic blueprint placed down. So what I'm going to do is go ahead and get the ghast farm built. And then we'll do the chest system. So it's been a bit. And I am going to go ahead and do the chest now for this ghast farm. I've completed the ghast farm. I did configure it a bit different. And change the other one as well. The point is the farms are set up. And I did change the chest system down here. So it would feed the same way the other chest works. So it feeds on this spot first. And then goes all the way across. So I can keep track of when they're full. So I need to build this over here for this farm. So we're going to go ahead and start doing that. I'm going to toggle the blueprint. And what I do is I use a printer mod with Lightmatica. And what I'm going to do is go to shop. And we're going to buy a ton of chests. And then we're going to go ahead and place a chest down. And as you can see, I place like six of them. So I just have to hold right click and move along. And as you can see, it's placing all these chests for me. This is completely allowed on the server from what I know. So I do it because it's just way easier. And I'm going to do this with hoppers as well. Because hoppers, you can do it directional as well. Same with the chest. So it's pretty useful. All I had to do was build a wall of chests and then copy it. And then I can print this. Okay, so we're done with the chests here, as you can see. So what I'm going to do now is grab out my wand for the mod. And I'm going to right click here. Moves the blueprint right there. And then I just repeat the process. But everything is orange because it's making double chests now. So that's why they're turning all orange. It just means it's a different version of what it's supposed to be. What isn't an issue. So I mean, I'm good with it. So I'm going to get all these double chests down. And then we'll do the hoppers. Okay, all the chests are done. Now we have to go ahead and do the hoppers. So I loaded in the hoppers. Now I need to go ahead, grab out the wand. Right click right here. And there we go. Now we need a ton of hoppers. So let's get that going. So I place one right here. And there we go. It starts doing its job. Obviously, my game is going to tick down a lot of frames when using hoppers. But one thing about this is that I don't have to shift when doing this. Because usually you have to shift. All I have to do is just fly. Because it doesn't open the hopper. It's very, very convenient. All right, we're getting pretty close to being done these hoppers. And then we can go ahead and place down the spawners once we're done. Because the farm will be fully functional. Anyways, we're about to finish off here on the hoppers. Here we go. Hoppers are now done. So everything is done. I'm going to unload everything. So both of them are unloaded. Now we can go ahead and go into, I believe it was PB2, I think. Yeah, PB2. And we'll grab out all the spawners. We'll go up here. And we're going to place them down right here. 282. And this should realistically work. There we go. That is amazing. And then the emeralds will flow all the way into here. Through the system. What is very, very convenient. And one thing I do need to check is if there's any boosters active. There are boosters currently active for super money and regular money. So I'm going to activate a regular personal booster. I got 84 of these. What is kind of insane. So we're going to sell all the loot within these chests. To get some more emerald block gas spawners. I think is the plan. Okay, I got the piggy pet out. We're going to swap my set as well. Get our tier one money. And then we'll grab the cell wand. And I'm probably going to need to grab another one a bit later. But we're going to go ahead and start selling. Okay, this one is done. So let's go to the next. That one is done. Let's move on to the next two. Okay, so I'm out of cell wand usages. So we're going to go to the island. And we're going to grab a new cell wand. We're going to use this one since it has a better multiplier. And we'll go ahead and go back to this farm. Continue selling right now. That one's done. So we'll do the final one. So we have 9 billion from selling all the chests. So that's pretty much all we're going to get. I'm just clearing off the bottom of these. So then we have a bit more. But overall, that's a good bit of money. So now what I want to do is grab out some gas spawners. We're going to get another 20, I think. There we go. 20. And then we'll see if we can upgrade these all. I think we can. Yes, we can. And we can probably get some more. So let's do that. I think we can get like six. Yes, we can. Now we're like literally broke. We have 4 million. But that adds 38 more. What puts us at 320. Perfect. So overall, that leaves us at on island top number nine with almost 30 billion value. What is actually really, really decent. One of the latest money making methods. And I want to start getting into it right now. The way you get to it is by going to warp winter. And then it's all the way on the other side of the map. You're going to need a good axe. So I recommend getting at least a diamond axe with efficiency five or six at least. And get maybe a droid pet with haste. Or you can just go with a regular axe with a few enchants as well. And the enchants you're going to want is spore and telekinesis. Telekinesis duplicates the item drops as well as spore. Gives almost a guaranteed, I believe, three to five drops per one of those. And then it duplicates that. What is absolutely insane. But here is the tree. It is the giant Christmas tree right here. And everybody's been using it to make a ton of money here on the server. So you can go to it from any direction. I'm going to go from the bridge over here. That leads to the little hollow part. So this tree regenerates over time and when you don't load it in. So if I want to go ahead and mine some blocks, I get Merrywood. And if we go ahead and do sell hand with this Merrywood, we made about like maybe 2.5 million or something around there. Just from 17 Merrywood. And if I mine just for a split second here, I've already made five stacks almost. What is absolutely insane. So my plan is to get a ton of this and do a big sell and see how much money we can make and invest into more spawners. Because currently I am number nine on Island Top. If we take a look at Island Top, I'm currently number nine. Most of my value is within Emerald Block Gas Spawners. And I'd like to get another farm going because I can have four going right now. It's just I don't have the third one set up yet, nor the fourth. And when your inventory gets full, you can easily just insta-sell this. But the way people make a lot more with using multipliers is the AUC sell. And then they open this menu. They put 1 trillion, so 1T. And then they put it on AH for the time being, if you have space. So I have to go ahead and take something off of AH. Let's take down this and we'll go ahead and put some Merrywood up in a moment. All right, so we go ahead and do 1T. We click on the wood and then we go ahead and put it up. And now it's all out of our inventory and on AH for the time being. So we can transfer it to our Island. So we can sell it in a chest with a sell wand with a high multiplier. It's the most efficient way to make a ton of money out of it. It's just it takes time to get it back to your Island. And into all the chests, of course. So we go ahead and do this again. We'll do it a few more times. If I look in Pv3, I already have another 100 Emerald Block gas spawners. But I haven't even placed down yet. What is kind of ridiculous. And the reason for that is just because I haven't built a farm. So we're going to build one of those today as well. Get another one of those going. Is the go-to plan at least. But it's so nice instamining this wood. I'm pretty sure you can do it with the Glitch Axe. What is from the Glitch Kit that you can get pretty simple. Off of other players or buying it off of people and from crate keys. But you can easily get a Glitch Axe with I think efficiency 6 or 5. I'm not too sure which one. And then you just get a Droid Pet. And you can instamine all this with the Haste. Because it gives Haste 3. So once I mine the whole inside portion of this area. I'm going to go ahead and warp back to spawn. And then I'm going to come back to the Winter World. And it should reset all the wood most likely. It might not. I'm not 100% sure. But we'll give it a try at least. And one thing I also do want to mention. You can sell this to other players for more money than you can actually sell it for. Because these sell for like 40,000 per one. But some people get insane multipliers. So what they do is they make you sell it to them. So they don't have to farm it for a price under their multiplier price. So then they make a little bit of profit by doing nothing. It's pretty smart of a tactic. What I might do eventually on my island. I'm not like 100% certain. But we'll see. Okay we're going to go ahead and put the Merrywood away. Is there any on the floor at all? Nope I think we're good. Okay so we go to spawn. And then we're going to go ahead and go to warp winter. And I forgot to mention you do need winter time to be in the winter wonderland. And the best way is by fighting the boss at warp Kohaku. And you can get winter time from fighting it. So it's really really good. But anyways we got to go back to warp winter. And continue what I was doing. Also someone just bought one of my pets for 50 bill. Let's go. We can now buy spawners with that. But I want to use the Merrywood to make even more. So if I'm correct I'm going to grapple over to the tree. And it should be regrown. If I'm not mistaken. And there we go. It's already all regrown. So we just come back and forth between spawn and the warp. And we can farm this way easier. Because farming the outside of the tree is just way more difficult. And tedious. And if I want to make sure none of my items on the floor ever despawn. I can do slash next clean. And I can see when the entity clear is going to happen. So I can make sure to pick it all up once I'm done mining. Because it usually just stacks in little one stack entities based off of the chunk. So it's best to keep them there until you can actually pick it all up. And I'm not going to lie. I'm pretty sure telekinesis is bugged. Because it duplicates the items. It's supposed to go straight into your inventory. But what it does is the item still drops. But goes in your inventory as well. So it duplicates it. I think it's a very well known thing on the server. Even by the developers and admins. Yet they haven't fixed it yet. Because they have other priorities. So I see that as something decent and okay. That it's still a thing. I already have 11,000 wood. And I've not even mined this tree twice. Like that's when you know this thing is an insane method. I just can't wait to show you guys how much I'm going to make from all this. And not just from a little bit. We're going to get even more. So I'm going to go ahead. Grind out this tree. Make a ton of wood. And then I'll give you guys an update. With a ton of chests. And how much I have in them. And then we'll go ahead and do a big sell. And see how much money we get overall. So I just got back from mining for about 30 minutes. Around there. And all these chests here. This is 16 double chests. They're all full of merry wood. So with all my multipliers. I'm going to be selling with a cell wand. That has three times on it. What has fire sale. Repeat three. Bulk four. And double dip three. So that I can make the most out of the cell wand usages. And then we're going to take off my Santa set. And go into PV I believe three. And grab out my money set. For I believe a 0.15 extra multiplier. If we do so size upgrade. We can actually see our booster. And right now we currently have a max booster upgrade. So we don't need to upgrade that at all. So we'll get a ton from that. We'll get almost triple the amount. And then in PV three. We also have my piggy pet. What is completely maxed out. So we get a 0.5 multiplier. When it's activated. And last but not least. We need all our boosters. We get a 0.25 from our money. A 0.5 from our personal. And a 0.75 from our super. So here we go. We're at 57.4 billion. So one chest. And we already went up a billion. So it seems from what we're going to get. Is a billion from each of these. So we're going to make almost 20 bill from 30 minutes. What is actually really really good. When you think about it. So now what I want to do. Is go ahead. Go into shop. And we're going to buy. I think three stacks of gas spawners. And then we'll go ahead. Place them all down. And upgrade them for 28. Almost 29 billion. To the emerald block here. If we look in pv3 here. We have a stack in 36 as well. So we'll go ahead and buy another stack. See if we can upgrade the whole thing. I think we'll have enough. We have just over enough. Perfect. So we have five stacks. Plus 36. That is a lot. Plus we already have a thousand. So I need to build another one of these farms. And I need to build a chest system for it. So I think I'm going to go ahead and build that farm over here. On top of this gold block pigment farm. So we can start making a ton of money. So I'll give you guys an update here in a moment. Once I am done building the farm. So I just finished off making the chest system. As well as the next gas farm. They're fully functional. So we're able to go ahead. Place down the gas spawners in pv1. Let's go ahead. Place these all down. Put them all in. 356. Now our value is at 45 billion. But still keeps us at I believe island top 9. But gets us pretty close to number 8. And then once we get 500 spawners in here. We have to make another farm eventually. Of course if you want to actually get into warp winter. You need to go to warp pohaku. And fight the boss. And at least get in top 15. To get 10 minutes of winter time. So I have about almost a day and a half. So I'm pretty much set. Because I've been playing like crazy. So we're going to go ahead and go to warp winter. And then we have to go ahead. And look for the new NPC on the server. The NPC is really good. It's just the only problem is. You have to farm a lot of candy canes from these gingerbread. And then trade them in. So this house here. There is the NPC. That is brand new. And it is gingy. And the pet we're looking for is a chewy pet. What gives a insane buff with strength. You can get strength 5. And it does say it works in pvp. But it actually works in zone worlds. So warp etheria and warp winter. From what I know. As well we can also get a sharpness 10 netherite sword. Just by farming candy canes as well. So what I think I'm going to do. Is try and get that sword right now. Because I currently have a sharpness 8 netherite sword. So what we're going to do. Is go to my island. Because I did save up a decent bit of candy canes here. And we'll go ahead. And get our first item. That we want to purchase from there. They're the most useful items. You can get from the gingy NPC. And I believe you can also get spawners. But I don't prioritize that from that. Since it's not in my interest. So if we go ahead. Go to gingy. And we're going to go ahead. Buy the netherite sword for 450. As you can see. I'm breaking 10 sharpness 10. It is way better than this sword. So we're probably going to go ahead. And sell this sword at some point. So I'll put it in my selling pv. Because I have a whole tv. Dedicated to just selling items. So I'll sell it eventually. But it's going to be useful. To do damage against bosses. Because there is two bosses on the server. What is a evil gingerbread monster. And it's ginormous. And then we also have pohaku. What is just a boss that stands still. And you have to hit it as much as possible. So how many candy canes do we currently have. Because we need 1500 to get the chewy pet. So we currently have only 804. So we need double this amount. So we need about an inventory to even get this. So I need four rows. Is my goal of candy canes to get. So we're going to go ahead. And go to island go. And we're going to put back these candy canes. Into the chest. And I think I'm safe to say. We're going to go for right up to here. On the chest right here. And that should be enough. To get the chewy pet. So the plan from here. Is we're getting all the candy canes. And then we're going to go ahead. And fight one of the bosses. Either the evil gingerbread man. Or the pohaku. One of the two. Or we might even do both. Who knows. But either way. I'm going to get the candy canes. So we can purchase the chewy pet. So I'll be back here in a bit. I managed to get enough candy canes. Apparently I didn't need up to here. I only needed 23 stacks plus 36. That should be enough. But I do have some spare in my PV. In case it's off by a little bit. So we're going to go ahead. Grab out all these candy canes. And we're going to go ahead. Go to warp winter. And we're going to go ahead. And purchase the chewy pet. Let's go over here. And go to Gingy. Hello Gingy. Let's buy the chewy pet. So that was pretty much close enough. So I still have four stacks. Spare. That I can probably just go ahead. And sell. To sell all. Make about 300 mil there. What is not bad. So the chewy pet. Has a three second duration. And the way you can actually make sure. That it has a longer time. Because it can go up to I believe 13 seconds. On its duration. Is by leveling up the pet. And the way you level it up. Is of course by using it. But another good way to do it. Is by getting a ton of mob coins. What I currently do have. So what we're going to do. Is go ahead. And grab out the pet. And we're going to go into transfer. Now we're going to go ahead. Buy some pet candy. For emerald mob coins. And gold mob coins. And I do have. If I do such mob coins. I have a ton of these. In emerald and gold. So we should be able to max it. Hopefully. So we'll go ahead and buy. I think a stack. Of these pet candy. We'll actually start with 32. In case we overdo it. So it's currently level one. And we'll go ahead. Put this on. 800. It puts it to instantly. And I used literally. Almost half our emerald mob coins. So I think what I'll do. Is I'll get 10 this time. And that got us another. 116 levels. And then we'll go ahead. Do five. And then I think we can do. Three more. Let's do two. Just in case. Yeah. We can do one more. There we go. So now the pet. Is fully maxed out. So we actually get. 25 seconds. I thought it was 13. I guess I was wrong. So after some minor issues. Apparently level a thousand. Is currently bugged. On the server. For chewy pet. It doesn't even work. So by the time this video comes out. It might be fixed. But I suggest making your pet. Maybe 950 around there. And not going past that. Just so then you can actually. Use the pet strength. But anyways. There's a pohaku boss. In 30 seconds. So we'll go ahead. And do that boss. And I do want to take a look. At something really quick. Is if I go ahead. And pop a strength pot. So strength two. And then activate this pet. It sets it to strength five. But will it cut it back down. To strength two. Because if so. That is pretty OP. So it gets rid of the strength. Apparently. So it does not cut it back. All the way down. It just gets rid of the strength two. But what we're going to do. Is activate the chewy pet. And then we're going to switch. To the droid pet. And then do as much damage. As possible. At the pohaku. All right. We're going to go ahead. God apple. And then we're going to quickly. Go ahead and pop it. Right when it's on the last. Two seconds. Of countdown. Here we go. And then switch to the droid. And now we start hitting it. It should give us the haste. There we go. We got haste with strength five. For a good bit here. What I should probably do next time. Is use my strength one set. So then I have a consistent strength one afterwards. So I got third place. Just by using that pet. I usually get around third place. But that probably helped significantly. Using these two pets. Combined together. So there we go. We got the best combination. So far for me at least. Because I know sharpness 12 is maximum. On the server right now. With netherite. But for me right now. We have my best combination. For how to do as much damage. On a boss as possible. We're going to be redesigning. These four farms. With only gas spawners. Of each type of course. And if I go ahead. And go to ice warps dp. I set up a extra alt. So I can use a new strategy. The reason we're revamping. These four farms. Is because if I go into pv3. There is a pet on the server. It is known as the Karen pet. And it auto sells items for you. So you can just afk with the pet on you. So my plan is to make a farm. Specifically for that. I have a good idea. Of how I want to build this farm area. For all the gas types. Of course it's going to take a lot of time. To set up. So we might as well get. Right into setting it up. So the first plan of action. Is we're going to need to make. The spawner area. And I think it's going to be pretty similar. To our previous design. That I've used before. Quickly I'm going to load in. A schematic. To show you what the design was previously. As you can see. This was the previous design. And it works pretty well. So we're going to keep the same pushing system. With the cactus. And water flowing system. But the only changes we're going to make. Is really just. Having one of these. On another side. And then make two of these. So I'm going to keep this here for reference. So I can understand what I'm building. So here's how we're going to do this. We need some blue ice. And some bricks. And we're going to go ahead. Make the simple line. Of where the water is going to be pushing. For the time being. In the area. Of the chunk. For one side of this farm. So we now have the little tube. For the starting point. Of where the items will drop. And then flow to our designated location. Later on. So now I'm going to figure out. How I want to build this exactly. So this is the chute. We're going to be working with. And we're going to go ahead. Buy a cactus. And some sand. So let's go ahead. Get some sand. And we need to break this block here. So we can use the cactus. And then we need to get some string. Two tripwire hooks as well. Is what we're going to need. And a sticky piston. So where is string mob drops. Buy a stack of that. Put a string here. And then we need to go up. And then on this block right here. Is where we're going to be putting the tripwire. And we use three string. So three string there. So now I build out here. We're going to put a tripwire. And there we go. The tripwire hook is set up. Turns out I need to move this one back. So it needs to be four string. I forgot it was four. My bad. And then we're going to go ahead. Go down one. Put the piston right here. As well as a block. And there we go. We have the contraption set up. So right now I'm currently building a area. Where the water will be. But it's going to be along here. So currently if I take a look at this. I believe this is eight long. And that means we can build another one on this side. In the same chunk. What is completely perfect. So what we're going to do. Is replicate this on the other side. And the spawner is also going to be going there. We just don't need it right now. So now I need to grab materials for the next system. And the roof will obviously be on this height right here. So this is the roof height. But let's just finish this all in. And then we'll go ahead and build the second one fully. Okay. So I built the whole thing. Now we have to build the other one. So I need to go ahead and get the tripwire hook down. And I need four string. I got rid of my string because I sold earlier. We need five technically for the cactus purposes. So now we're going to go along here. Put a tripwire. There we go. So I got the cactus down. I think that's the right spot. Put a string there. Put down the signs. Put up the wall. On both sides of course. And then we're going to fill this all in. And the reason I fill in so much area that probably doesn't need to be filled in. Is because the chance of the gas spawning there. We don't want any of that possibilities. So we're going to have to add more blocks around on the sides. To make sure this works. Okay. Final touches here. And we should be done. Okay. So the farm is done. But the only thing we're missing is the expansion of the sides. So we're going to expand the sides. So then there's no chance of a gas spawning. Or has room to think about spawning there. Because I believe the radius is four blocks of how far out it will spawn. So we want to kind of minimize that as much as possible. One side complete. Now let's do it on this one. At the end of this it's going to look like a giant cube of deep slate. All right. And I think we are done now. I'm just going to double check before I go ahead and schematic this all. Now what I'm going to do is area select this all. So I need to go up one block. Area select that. And then break it. So this all should be in the rendering range of selection. And I can go ahead and copy this down into a file. That I can use and get a blueprint for the next time I want to build this. I just realized I need to make a minor adjustment before I actually copy the schematic. What I need to do is make this all blue ice. Because I only need one water bucket for this whole thing to work. Putting two makes it broken and the items will get stuck. So we put the blue ice down. And then we put the cactus down. And then we put the water in this corner. And it should be good. So let's do it on this side now. All right. Put the water down. And there we go. Situated. So now I can copy it. Perfect. Everything is situated now. Now what I'm going to do is line it up in the spot. I'm quickly going to go ahead. Finish this up. And then I'll come back with an update here in a moment. So after a decent bit of building. I got the second part done. So the whole thing is finished. As you can see. So we can put all four types of gas spawners in this. So the plan is I will eventually build one over top of here. Here. And here. And then right down the middle is where the alt is going to be. Right about here. Selling all the loot. So we're going to build that system really quick. Just so it's prepared for when I build the other farms. Because I'm going to build these off camera. The last three. One thing I'm also doing is chopping off a bit of this farm right here. Because I need water to go there. Because I don't want to chop all these chests down right now. So I got the blue ice. We'll place it down there. Blue ice. And place it here. So one thing I just grabbed is a water wand. We're going to go ahead and use that to place down the water in this. Just because it's way easier. So go ahead. Place the water right there. And put a block there. It should all flow in the right direction. We just have to put pressure plates. Actually instead of pressure plates. We're going to go ahead and use signs. So we go ahead and put a sign here. And then we'll put another water source here. And let's see how this works. Flows all the way to the end. Perfect. So let's go ahead and do it again. Sign. And then we go ahead and put water down. Boom. And then we just have to repeat this process the whole way to the spot that I want to stop at. So let's go ahead and build our way there. Okay. So the tubes are built. I just have to put the water in now. So it's time to start placing signs and water with the water wand until I hit the very end. One thing I have to be careful about here is where I'm placing water right now. So I'm going to put a sign on this block specifically just because this is the start of a whole new system. And it lines up with that one as well. So it's perfect to put it right there. So I'll just put a sign here just to remind myself. Either way, we keep continuing. My ult is going to be standing right on this spot, like right in the center. So I'm going to actually set up a warp, set warp, and we're going to do ZP5, I think it was. So then I'm going to go ice warp, ZP5. The ult is right in the center. Perfect. Now I have to build the other flowing system that flows to the ult. Okay. So I had to move the spot of the warp really quick because it was kind of messed up. So let's go ahead and set the warp now. There we go. The whole new spot is situated. So I finished building the water flowing system. Now we're just going to put the water down. I also put some signs right here because that's where the ult's standing. And then we'll put the water on the back here. And there we go. So that's where all the items will go into my ult's inventory and then sell with the Karen pet. And eventually I'll open up these areas because I have them prepped for the other tubes. And now I just got to finish off this line as well because I completely forgot about it. So I got to do that really quick. So I got the tube done. Now we need to just finish off the spawners and see if they actually spawn because I haven't even tested that. Let's go in PV7. And I believe I need like seven or six stacks of gas spawners. So we're going to go ahead and put the first one over here. So there we go. We got the first gas spawner down. It's all emerald block. Should spawn in there. Perfect. And the chances of it spawning on this side are pretty much impossible. So there we go. It should all flow down to the location. And it just got here instantly. Oh my gosh. And this amount of gas is enough for all four of the farms. I just need to get the different types. So now if I go in PV6, I have some regular emerald ones. So I just found a flaw with the system. I need to actually redo the piston system. What that means is I have to basically get rid of this whole system for the pistons on one spot and then align it somewhere else. So I just have to move this over one and it should fix it. I just need some blocks and I can fix this easily. The spawner will stay in the same spot, but I just have to align this in a whole different area. So the piston is going to go here on this side and hopefully this should work if I'm not mistaken. So now we line up the tripwire hooks and we put this along here. Go into PV7, grab out the emerald gas, put them all in. This should work. There we go. So now we got all the gas types that can work. We just have to redo this one as well and then we should be fine. Okay. So I offset the other one as well. So this one should work now. Perfect. So now that that is fixed, I can go ahead and put in all the spawners that I want to put in. So we're going to go ahead and do that now and get every other type as well. So we'll buy about four stacks of regular gas, I guess. Before I actually use the emerald ones, I need to upgrade all these. So we're going to go ahead and put all those in, upgrade them to regular emerald. So we have 410. We just need to go ahead and buy another stack. And then I think we can grab 26, I think it was. So we go ahead and put them down, upgraded that. And there we go. 500 emerald gas. So two of them are done. Now we need to go ahead and do the diamond ones. But I think I have a few in my PV6. So we'll grab out eight of them. And now we'll go ahead and buy, I think, five or six stacks. I think I just got seven. What I think is almost enough. What is fine, I guess. For the diamond upgrade. So now if I put this down, we should have 500. Perfect. Perfect. Now I have some regular gas in my PV1 that we're going to put down in here. I don't think we'll have enough to max this out. But we'll go ahead and put as much as we can into this. All right. We're pretty much bankrupt. But we almost have a full maxed out chunk of gas. And then it'll flow all the loot into this one spot for my ult to pick up. Since we have the farm set up, now we have to just focus on the Karen pet. But it's basically just going into transfer. But before we do that, I want to save mob coins. And I'm going to use a bargain one set. Here we go. I'll bargain one on all these pieces. So that saves me mob coins. Purchasing and transfer. And we're going to buy a ton of legendary pet candy with all the mob coins we have. Put it on Karen. Get it to 500 for about, I think that was 22 there. And then we'll go ahead and get more. And then we're out. And seven there only got us up 66 levels. So it's going to be hard to get this pet really high up on its level. But that's fine. Of course, one thing I want to add is put a chest here. And then the Karen pet, whenever I need to upgrade it, I'll put it in the chest off the alt. So now I have to get my alt on in that spot. So let me do that really quick. So I got the alts up. If we look at my account, it's picking up the loot. So if we go ahead and even see my alt, you can see that these items are actually selling. And the pet does level up over time from when it sells each time. Now, if we go to slash battle and look in beginning list, they already have 4 million. From just using the Karen pet, what is absolutely insane. I can't wait to get all of these done off camera. But basically, you would stand here and you would jump crit the boss and try and get placement in the boss. And it happens every hour. As you can see, Puhaku, the boss type, and there's drops you can get. Getting first place, you get all the rewards under. And you get the first place prize as well. You get a super boss egg pouch, what is insanely overpowered, if you use slash recipes to make a ton of crafts. And you get winter time, where you can go to warp winter and do a lot of other things that I'll mention later in the video. And then third, you get gas spawner pouches from a range, I think, to 2 to 4 gas from the pouches. What is pretty good, as well as 20 minute winter time. And then you get a Puhaku heart that you can sell for money. Or you can use those to craft some Puhaku souls from slash recipes. Or all the way up to, I believe, spirits and whatnot with the custom crafts. And then you get pouches, what give about 5 to 10 billion. It says turkey because it hasn't been updated, but it's actually present pouches or Christmas pouches. But they give about like 5 to 10 billion on the small. And then the medium, I believe, gives 20 bill maximum from like 5 minimum or something. What is pretty OP. So that is one way to make a ton of money at Puhaku. Now we're going to go to warp gingerbread. Of course, you are going to need winter time from the Puhaku boss to even get over here. So going to warp gingerbread will bring you here right in front of this area. And you can see there is a new boss. The evil gingerbread golem. It spawns every two and a half hours. And you get pretty good loot. You get pretty much similar loot. Except you get an elf key, what is pretty hard to get. Or you could buy that with money. But I personally would just do the bosses and try and get it. And then you get an exotic present, what can give you these rewards. What are pretty good, not gonna lie. You get the gingerbread head that sells for $2 billion. And you can use multipliers on it to make even more. And then you get the pouches, of course. What haven't been updated yet. But you get the point, they're pouches. They also give mob coins and XP. I forgot to mention the pouches. So it's pretty OP, not gonna lie. And one thing second place gets is 10 gas pouches. I've gotten this before. And I've gotten like 32 just from getting placement on here. I've gotten 32 gas spawners just from all those pouches. What is insane. One of the best ways to do damage is going ahead and getting pets. The best pets I recommend are the chainsaw pet you could use. Or you can use the chewy pet and the droid pet. Because they all give ways to actually do more damage to these bosses. So I highly recommend obtaining one of those pets if you can. So that is the next boss. And now we're gonna go ahead and go over some methods here in the winter wonderland. So of course you go to warp winter. And if you have winter time, you can farm here. A good method is to actually kill reindeer. Because if we go ahead and sell hand on two reindeer that I got. We made just off of two, seven million. But we also made an extra bit because I have my boosters up. What is another thing I'm also gonna mention really quick. You can go into island upgrades and upgrade your money booster. And get a lot of extra money. It's really worth it. But it costs a lot of emerald mob coins. I highly recommend killing reindeer if you see them. They're usually about a three to two tap. So they're not too difficult to kill. Another method is killing these gingerbread here. That give candy canes. I believe they sell for almost like 500,000 per one. What is pretty good. So what you could do is kill gingerbread for candy canes. And then you could also try and get reindeers if you see them. It's a really good reliable method to make money. At least for right now. Because one of the old methods I'm just gonna mention right now. Was killing these snowmen. And also killing the elves over here. They used to be good. But they're no longer that great anymore. So they're not reliable. And then another method we're gonna go over. Is the merry wood. What is from this big old tree. Well you can go ahead and go to the front of this tree. And you can go ahead and mine this wood. I highly recommend you get a axe with spore 4. From the custom enchanter menu. Slash enchanter. And also get telekinesis. And have high efficiency with haste. If you can get a droid pet. Then you can go around and mine all this. As you can see I'm already making a ton of merry wood. And if I go ahead and sell hand. Just off of mining there. I made about 25. Almost 26 million off default. With an extra 45 million from my island boosters. So this is a very reliable method. A good way to make sure you can take this back to your island. What I'm gonna mention also. Is you can take these items back to your island. And use cell lawns. But I'll show here in a moment. But you can go ahead and do AUC cell. And then put in let's say 1Q. And then you go ahead and put this all on AH. And then you can take it off at your island. And store it in chests. And sell it with a cell wand. And all sorts of other multipliers. Like a money set. And then there's also fishing over here. What I don't really recommend. It's a good method. But it's not really like the most reliable. Because you have to be really good at aiming at the fish. And the squids and the axolotls. As you can see there's a lot of fish down here. And you don't drown I believe. Even though it's showing I'm gonna drown. I don't think you do. But you can sell these items. I think the axolotl ones sell for a decent bit. Yeah we made about off of 2 kills. What is technically 4 kills. If you don't have the Santa set. What is no longer available. But the point is you would make about a million. So 500k per kill on an axolotl. What isn't too bad. But I don't think it's the best method. Anyways we're gonna go ahead. Show off the cell wand method. So we're gonna go to my island really quick. And we're gonna go over to this chest. Put all these items in. Except for the reindeer antlers. Because I kind of want to save those. But what I do is I get a cell wand. With a good multiplier. So we can make a ton of extra money. And each use is based off the chest you use it on. It'll take a usage away. But you can save usages by having repeat 3. Having that chance to save them. And you can make extra money with bulk 4. Double dip 3. And fire sale 1. You just have to get them from slash enchanter. And purchasing these orbs with XP. But you can just get XP by putting mobs on a magma block. And just standing next to them. And letting them die. And you can collect the XP doing that. So you can AFK XP pretty easily. But either way you get a cell wand. And if you do have a money set. What is from the set crate keys. You can go ahead and put a money set on. It's not guaranteed to get a money set. But you could get a money set. I have a tier 1. So if I want to go ahead and actually sell all this loot in here. Let's go ahead. Activate some boosters. What will multiply our money. Apparently it's already active. We'll do a personal. And then we'll do a money. So that gives us an extra I believe 1.25. In just money. What is really good. So we'll go ahead and sell. And as you can see. We made a ton of money there. Just off of the Merrywood and candy canes. We made 60 million. But with all the multipliers. That we had here in chat. We made like almost 300 million. I think. Or even over that. What is kind of absurd. And then the last method. I'm going to recommend. Is using spawners. Of whichever spawner you can get. I recommend getting gold block pigment. Or a gas spawner. And the way you actually upgrade these. Is by placing it on the ground. Opening the menu. By right clicking. And then going to the upgrade button. And upgrading with money. To the best type of here. What is gold block. On zombified piglin. Or emerald block. On gas spawners. And then what you do. Is set up AFK farms. As you can see. I have AFK farms. Going for my gas spawners. And then I have all the items. Flow to a specific location. With a specific pet. What is called. I believe the Karen pet. What auto sells items. If you have it active. In your inventory. So I have my alt account. Just sitting here. Selling items. For me to make money. And if I had this whole farm going. I'd be making 20 billion. Every 24 hours. What would be pretty nice. Currently I'm making half of that almost. You can do this with a lot of spawner types. But I highly recommend it with gas spawners. Because they're the easiest to get it going with. In my opinion. An alternative you can do. Instead of selling with an alt. You can actually use a cell wand. You can set up a storage system. And then use cell wands on the chest. Or take the items out. And sell them. With cell all. It really depends on your preference. But the best way is most likely the Karen pet. If you can get there. So these are the best money making methods for me. At least right now. And the current state of the map. Because most people usually do these methods. If we go ahead and do such enchants. And go to the rare section. Proficiency grants us a permanent skill boost. Depending on the level. And it stacks based on how many pieces you have it on. So we're going to be using this armor set. So I'll put away my other ones for now. And we're also going to grab out my harvester hoe. This is a maxed out harvester hoe. For enchant wise. We got green thumb 3. Airstrike 2. Tidal wave 3. Fireball 5. And bomber 7. These all will give us more XP. Towards getting to level 20. So I'll be using that. As well as the ability seller. On the harvester hoe. By shift right clicking. We can open this menu. And we're going to automatically auto invent. And then sell it. With all the loot in my inventory. Just so it's nice and clean. And then in pv3. I have a maxed out nemesis pet. Which gives a 0.75 skill experience boost. When activated. So we're going to activate that. And we'll put my other pets in my pv4 now. But one thing we are completely forgetting. Is the boosters. But we'll go ahead and activate a skill booster. Here in a moment. But we also need to go ahead. And find out where to actually farm at. So currently I believe I can farm at the beet roots. If I'm not mistaken. Or it's carrots. One of the two. So we're going to go find the location. Of the crop. That I was using last time. What I haven't farmed in quite a while. It is indeed beet root. I recognize the location. So we're going to farm beet root. Because that is our best option. For experience. Towards the skill level up. Of course you have to unlock. A certain amount of levels. To get different types of crops. So me being at. I believe 18. Almost 19. I already have beet root unlocked. But as you can see. If I mine that beet root there. It should say above my hot bar. We have a 5.7 multiplier. So we should be able to get this done. Pretty quick. But if I go ahead and activate a booster. We should have an extra 0.65. Added on to that. And one thing I do need to actually change. Is go into my skins. And we're going to quickly change this set. To a speed 2 set. Because it'll help make the process even quicker. Because speed when farming. Is very crucial. It helps you break more blocks. Which just means you can farm even better. So we're going to be focusing on using speed. If we take a look at slash skills. And go to the farming area. We are already really close to 19. And then after that. I believe we need 2.5 million experience. Once we get the extra 500,000 from farming here. Which shouldn't be too difficult. Basically the whole point of this. Is so we can actually get access. To that monthly crate. And open it up. So I'm going to go ahead. Farm until I hit level 19. And then I'll give you guys an update. Here in a bit. So I'm just about to hit level 19. And I do also want to mention. Is that we're not going for the max skill. Even though the title says that. It's just because. All the other skills are maxed out at 20. But if we go to farming. It goes up to I believe 40. Where we could get another monthly crate. But it's going to take way too long. And would not be worth it at all. Personally that's what I think. Because I could be using my time on other things. And since I'm pretty close. I might as well go for the monthly crate. On level 20. But there we go. We hit level 19 on our skill. So we got a cell wand with 100 uses. That I will keep. Because it has a 2.5 times multiplier. So now we're going to get a monthly crate. From once we hit level 20. So now I'm going to do a little bit of a time lapse here. Just farming away. So let the time lapse begin. So I'm a little under 50,000 experience away. From hitting level 20 on the farming skill. So we can get the monthly crate. We're 40,000 away. So we can do this pretty quick here. And then we'll go ahead. And open up the monthly crate. And see what we get. All right. Less than 10,000 away. Here we go. Monthly crate acquired. So what I want to do is go ahead. And open this up really quick here. Hopefully we can get something good. As the final reward. Because they do have nine slots. That give good items. And then you can get a super good item. Pretty much you want the best item. You can get from the final reward. So we're going to go ahead. Go to warp crates. And get this opened right away. So we'll do the first three. Probably not going to get anything too great. From these. What pet are we getting? We got a raptor. What's unfortunate. We got some basic upgraded spawner. Pouch. Gives two random upgraded spawners. What isn't too bad. We got a crate key. G kit pouch. What boosters are we getting? Super booster bundle. Can we get a set key? Oh we got five crimson. What is not too bad. Oh we got nebulon. And then the final reward. Here we go. Can we get goobits. Or a rank. That isn't puff. Let's see. Crate g kit pouch. What is quite unfortunate. But it is what it is. So we got to make sure you tied these. It will eventually get reverse tested. So we took this out. Of course. We got to make sure you is doing this. What we do. We got to make sure you are trying to renek Cockey. Please. We got to make sure you are going to stance on it. Okay.기 system. Can we owe to you today?
