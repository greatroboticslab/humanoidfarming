Polluted Stormwater Runoff- It All Adds Up

 Did you know the largest source of water pollution today is polluted stormwater runoff? As rain lands on our rooftops, lawns, and pavement, the water picks up whatever debris and pollutants may reside there. Pesticides, animal waste, salts, oil, and litter. This stormwater runoff flows into storm drains where it travels through underground pipes that in most communities leads directly to rivers and lakes. In our region, most of the stormwater that enters our local streams and lakes ends up in Puget Sound or the Pacific Ocean. With all the pollutants from our cities and neighborhoods, it picked up along the way. This pollution hurts us, our fish, and our wildlife, but it doesn't have to be this way. When rain and stormwater are allowed to drain into the ground, the earth is able to filter out most pollutants naturally. By the time it does reach rivers and lakes, it's not only cleaner, it's cooler, and there's less of it. And that's better for the fish, better for the invertebrates that fish eat, and better for the plants that live in and around the water. It's also better for humans and property, as we need clean water for drinking, eating, and playing. And flooding and related problems are less likely. And it costs a lot to create and maintain stormwater infrastructure, so any steps to address water pollution in our community will make better use of our public funds. The key to cleaner and healthier water, and more sustainable communities, is to capture rain where it falls by helping it drain into the ground as nature intended. We can do this through installing rain barrels or cisterns, building rain gardens or planting trees, installing porous pavement, or just by limiting the amount of dense and hard surfaces in our community. More green space, less asphalt and pavement. To learn more, visit the How You Can Help section of the Puget Sound Starts Here website. Puget Sound Starts Here.
