Alright folks, we're going to start right here. And we're going to fish here, down through here, and then who knows, we may end up way down yonder. When you throw this live bait like we throw it, you never know what you're going to catch. And today, we're just fishing. Hey we Ronnie? Yeah.

You going to eat him? I don't think so. All right. I'm going to throw up under there. Look at that bull right up in there. Uh huh. I may have fish on here. I'm not sure. There he is. Oh man. He got off. Now the way they got these turbines on right here, it makes, it's going to make a perfect drift out there here. We're going right, right through the middle of them storks sitting right there. Get him. I hope you got this. I got that one. Is it a smallmouth bass? Oh, he jumped in the boat. I'm begging. Thank you for natting him for me. Folks, get you. He just jumped in the boat. Hey. Woo. Son. That's a bubba. That's a bubba fish too. Let me get him for you Ronnie. Cool. Look at this big hog. Woo. Son. Folks. That's a, oh lord that's a begging. He barely got him hooked right there. He, just Ronnie, did you see him jump in the boat? He could. He jumped the wrong way didn't you see that? He jumped the right way for me but the wrong way for him. Goodness gracious. We're going to have to weigh that. Yeah. Let's put him in the minors tank here. Let's do it. Let's put him in here and let him terrorize these minors a minute. Yeah. Oh, God. You just. Isn't that crazy with your camera in there? Golly y'all. Did y'all see that? Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. That's fish just soaked to me. I'm going to wipe that lid. Ronnie, how many times have you had one to jump in the boat? Not very many times. It has happened but not very many times. Yeah, that never did. Especially that size. Oh lord. He's still. He's going to wet you. He's going to settle down. He's going to bite you. Yeah. Okay. Okay, folks. We've got these Bubba scales here. Now Ronnie and I, when we catch a bass. Oh. Ronnie. Hey, he's fresh. He is. You didn't wear him down. He just. He made one jump in the boat so he's. You know, he's still rowdy. You know, you didn't wear him down when you settle down. Oh. So anyway, what I was telling y'all. Now Ronnie and I on the bass. We got this thing we call Bubba fish now if you've never seen this channel before. A four pounder better is we call a Bubba fish. So. Ronnie get. Hey Ronnie. Hey Ronnie. Hey Ronnie. Look at. Now look at me. Man up and get that joker out of there. And listen. He knocked the minner out. Oh. Here we go. Good lord. Here we go. I want you to look at that beautiful special. Hey, that's a picture taker too. He's going to damage every minner we got in there. Hair rice. That's about the meanest smallmouth I've seen in a while. What do you say that fish way? I'm going to say he's going to push five pounds. I'm going to say five two. I'm going to say. I'm like. I don't know. But yeah, he's a good fish. Drop her down there. I'm going to say five two. You going to say what? Five two. Fish right there was exactly five pounds. Five pounds. I think that's what I said, wasn't it? Five pounds. It was. Exactly. Okay, let me get your picture with it. All right. All right. Five pounds, y'all. Smallmouth right there. Good one. I mean, real good one. Cut them bubbles off. Now I will tell you on these bubbles scales, you got to cut them off. Can't leave them on. They'll run your battery down. Y'all can tell how strong this current is right on this arm right there. Look. Big turn this big pretty fish loose. I don't think you want to have to rejuvenate it. No, he. He going to bite you. There we go. He gone. Huh? He turned it. He gone. Yeah. I want me one now. Man, I tell you what. That manna hit the water and never checked up. It just started coming right at the boat. Wow. Yeah. Oh, Lord. Well, okay. Ronnie, we got any lively minors in there after all that? I don't know. But, you know. I mean, I'm very good. I'm very good. I'm very good. I'm very good. I'm very good. I'm very good. I'm very good. I'm very good. I'm very good. I'm very good. I don't know. He was giving my. He thrashed them around just a little, didn't he? There you go. Right. Let's get out there and try to catch some hunting. Yeah. Good Lord. Let me show y'all folks right here now. That's the way we fish. We just got, today, this current's pretty stout. And the minors we got ain't too big. Oh, man. Look here. I just pulled this in. I got a lick right there. You can see where he grabbed it. But, just to show y'all here. We got two little split shots right there. Right above his hook right here. About 18 inches. And he done that minor end. So, I got a, lively bait's a key to this. You got to have a lively minor to catch these fish. And, uh, so, I need a good bait tank to keep them in. Which is extreme bait right here. Tank is. Okay, folks. That's a pretty good little drift right there now. Now, what we done is we just spot-locked along the way. And we done drifted on down to, well, pretty far on down. And, but I think, we think smallmouth's further up that way. So, we're going to go back up and get back on them. But we did pretty good on them. Ronnie got that one big one. We caught like four or five smallmouth. The only big one was one Ronnie caught. Of course, Ronnie always catches the big ones. And what I think it is, is them vines of sausages he eats. We're going to get a little bit farther over this time. Alright. This time, folks, we moved on over a little bit. So, we're going to try this drift. It was right over there. Make a drift. See what you catch. Then move on over just several different drifts. Until you get on the right seam of current here. And there's all kinds of boulders and rocks right under us. And there he is right up under the boat. That's a pretty good one. Oh, it's a good smallmouth here. I think it's a really nice smallmouth. Oh yeah. Good. Good? Good. Real good. Ronnie. I'll hit you. Come on, get that scoop net, son. Caught you a dollar. Here we go. Ronnie Baker eating a honey bun. Good smallmouth right here. Kyle, he's pulling too, boy. Oh, that's a good one. You see him, Ronnie? Yes, sir. Pretty one. Get him in there. Bubba. Folks, I'm telling you what, that's a good one there. Look at that little hook just right there. What are you going to say? Oh. 312. 312, Ronnie, see. Yeah, 312. I think he's probably going to be about right. 3 pounds. Ronnie, you missed it by an ounce. Oh, mate. 313. Oh, mate. Yeah, 313. Good one. Good one. Good one. Look what a pretty fish. Look at the colors in that fish right there. And look at him, looking at him, looking at you with that eyeball right there, bro. Oh, Lord. Let's just turn her loose. Yonder, she went down through yonder. Gone? Hey, Ronnie, she gone. She gone. Folks, what we doing right here, we got, like I showed you all them little split shots. We just throwing it up like this. We spotlocked right here. And them sinkers takes that minner down to the bottom where those fish are behind the rock. They're going to be down behind that rock. I got my bale open, just letting line out right here. And then when it gets right next to the boat, I'm just going to take a little bit of the fish right there. I'm just going to take a little bit of the fish right there. I'm just going to take a little bit of the fish right there. I'm just going to take a little bit of the fish right there, bro. Oh, Lord. Let's just turn her loose. Yonder, she went down through yonder. Gone? Hey, Ronnie, she gone. She gone. She gone. She gone. She gone. I got my bale open. Just letting line out right here. And then when it gets right next to the boat, I'm just going to check it and see. No, ain't nothing on it. So I'm just going to let it drift right on back through there. And I can feel it bouncing over those rocks down there. And a lot of times, the more big fish, they'll get in behind them rocks. And I think I may have a fish on. I don't know. Uh oh. Here we go. Got him. Got him. I got one too. Me and Ronnie both got him. Oh, I got a good fish, Ronnie. What you got? I got a smallmouth. Ronnie got a smallmouth. What have I got? I don't know.

And I'll tell you what, I had one too here. I'm going to throw me out. Oh, that guy's a minorator. Ronnie got a smallmouth. Okay, folks. We're going to weigh Ronnie's other big smallmouth right here.

And that right there is a small gizzard shad. Probably about four inches long. Now these gizzard shad they're a lot livelier than a threadfin shad. And sometimes these fish really key in on these gizzard shad. Now the threadfin shad is a little flashier down there. But they ain't as feisty as these gizzard shad. There he is. Man I felt that thing pop up over a rock and it come down the back side. There he was. And it is... What is that? I think it's a... I think it's a... What is that? That's a pretty good stinking fish.

And try to catch more bait. And finish out the afternoon. Now folks we get a lot of requests on the channel about where to catch bait. And what type of areas to look for. And right here is what you want to look for. See this little old cove right here. See it's right off the river channel right here. And we're on Wilson Lake right here. Boat ramps right there. And these little areas like this right here just off the river channel. That's where this bait will get in to out of the current. And so these areas right here is a really nice place to start looking for bait. If you don't know where to look and it's the first time you've been over here. But it ain't just here. It's on any lake. Any kind of arenas or anything like that. It's what you want to look for. All right folks. Some of y'all were asking what kind of salt we use in our minnow tank. I use the Morton Rock Salt Ice Cream Salt. And Rocky uses pool salt right? Yeah. Yeah. Just as long as it's salt. Right. And about a cup full. Right. In a tank at a time. Especially this time of the year. Yeah. Very important. Yeah. There they are. Feels like I got them. Oh yeah I got them. Got them. Oh yeah I got some good. Boy that heat takes it out of me. Hey folks. Looky here. We're having a mayfly hatch. See all them mayflies up there. Look at them. Sun and bluegill. Hey. A lot of these fish eat them mayflies right there. And how long did you say they live? One day. They live one day y'all. Mayfly does. One day that's it. All right. All right. Back again. Now folks. Now folks. Now folks. Now folks. We ain't got that big of manners today. I want y'all to look there. Them ain't that big. That's all we could get though. That's about all we could catch. These little old beauty manners.

We just went and got this bait fresh. Y'all hear that? If they can do something different with it. Yeah. If they can cut something else on, it's going to change the current flow. There he is. One just grabbed it. I think one just... Oh, did y'all see that? Okay, I'm going to let him run with it. I got this one, buddy. Uh-oh, it's one of them pole dragons, son. Hey, I ain't joking with you. I don't know what this one is. Hey, Ronnie. He may spool me. I ain't got too much line. See right there? I don't know what this is going to be, though. I don't know.

Folks, today I'm fishing with my Ardent Seaforce Carbon Fiber Reel. I've got Gliss Braid Line on with a 12-pound leader on this 7-foot Medium Heavy Tournament Pro Ardent Rod. And that's what I always use catching these smallmouth. I love it. And you catch a lot of them. Yeah. And big ones. Yeah. Yeah. I love it. Well, folks, we done run out of bait. And me and Ronnie, we're too tired to go catch anymore. That's pretty bad. It is. You know, when you catch so many fish. And we done filled that bait tank up three times, that extreme bait tank. And, man, I don't know how many fish we caught today. I think, Ronnie, what did you say, 28 bass? 28 bass. No telling how many striped catfish. Goodness. Oh, it was almost nonstop, folks. And we was going to go to Pickwick today. And Ronnie, I was going to meet him down there. Ronnie went down to McFarland Park. And the parking lot was just full of boats. And we got some big tournament down there. So we decided to come here on Wilton Lake below Wheeler Dam right here. And I'm sure glad we did. Because we caught a bunch of fish today and some good fish, folks. Appreciate y'all tuning in. We'll catch you next time. Thank y'all for watching. God bless each and every one of you.
