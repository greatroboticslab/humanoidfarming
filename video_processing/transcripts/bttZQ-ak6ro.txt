Howto & Style
 ДИНАМИЧНАЯ МУЗЫКА Okay, Keith, we're here, and we're going to talk about hog inclusion fences. Becquard offers several options in woven style fences that work really well for hog inclusion. We do, and most woven wire fences will keep your hogs in, but specifically when you talk about a high-density area, we want to talk about the 1348-3 SolidLock Pro. 12-1⁄2-gauge line wires, 3-inch spacing, 4-point contact knot, and that really keeps those hogs down in the fence where they need to be. Exactly, and it comes with a really good coating as well. We've got the Becquard Bezinol coating on it, and in a feedlot-type situation like this around hogs, it can be really corrosive atmosphere, so that Bezinol coating really prolongs the life of that fence. Absolutely. And a little more economical version of that would be the 1348-6. Still the SolidLock Pro, 13 wires, 48-inches tall, 6-inch spacing, and that will reduce the cost for the rancher a little bit. But, Van, there's one that we overlook a lot. We do. The 1047 Field Fence is a really good fence, a little more economical, not quite as good as the SolidLock products, but still makes a great fence for hog inclusion, especially in your lower-density areas. So when you go to contain those hogs, remember Becquard SolidLock Pro and the Gaucho Hinge Joint Field Fence. Thanks for watching, guys, and when you come to your next fencing project, remember Becquard, Made in the USA.
