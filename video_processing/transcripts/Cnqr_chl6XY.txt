 Dennis Bleski here to talk to you about the Sweeney Farms auction for Ruston Sweeney. Nice line of late model John Deere equipment including a John Deere 94-30 four-wheel drive tractor, a John Deere 9770 STS combine, plus a flex draper head, 35-foot John Deere flex draper that's only got 600 acres on it. It's got an air bar, very, very nice unit. Now that tractor and that combine have got excellent repair orders. The Sweeney's are very well known for their quality of equipment and the care that they take in it and we've posted all the recent repair orders on that tractor and combine on our website. Along with that you've got an eight row John Deere chopping corn head, you've got header trailers, a grain vac, augers, plus some GPS equipment, and a good side dresser and a pneumonia applicator. That auction opened and you can bid on it now but closes on January 21st. That's the Sweeney Farms auction, Laramore, North Dakota. We'll see you on the computer.
