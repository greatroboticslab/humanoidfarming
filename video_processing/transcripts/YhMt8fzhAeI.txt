 In this video, I'm going to show you how you can use workers within Schedule 1 so that they can pretty much automate and do everything for you. Now, the game story will introduce you to workers when you make your way to the warehouse, which is located right over here at this big building here on the harbor side. You can see it says warehouse on it behind the pawn shop here. Now, the warehouse is only accessible after 6 p.m. in the evening, so you will have to be here at nighttime and be aware of the cops. One little tip I can give you is stay to the outskirts of the town. So, for example, if you live in the bungalow like I do over here, you should run to the warehouse by sticking to the harbor as much as you can. Avoid the roads in the central city because that's where the cops always are patrolling. Once you get in the warehouse, you're quite simply going to go up the stairs at the back. There's only one way you can go up here, so just follow along. And you should be able to speak with the dude inside here, Manny, and you can hire employees here. Before you speak to him, you can actually look on the left here and see what each kind of employee does. You can get cleaners, handlers, botanists, and chemists. Now, each of these have their benefits. I highly recommend the botanists myself because they pretty much manage all the plants and the soil and all that stuff. I feel like that's the most tedious thing to do currently. And you should know that you have to pay them $200 a day so that they can actually work. So, speaking to Manny, you will be able to hire yourself an employee. You'll then get to pick where you want them to go work. I want this one to go work at the bungalow where I'm set up. This usually has a signing fee and then their employee daily wage is $300. And then, quite simply, you make your way back to your house. The first thing you need for an employee to start working is you need to have a bed on the site for them so that they can sleep on. Each employee gets assigned their own bed, and you should also have your own that you can sleep in to, you know, skip to the next day. Now, the very first time you hire a worker, you will get the clipboard, which is the number 9 at the bottom of your screen here, which allows you to interact with your workers who will be stationed outside of the, you know, the residence that they're going to be working on. You can see they're standing here waiting for me to assign them to work. So, this botanist over here, if I look at him with the clipboard in hand and I press manage, you can see here there are various options here. The first thing's first is you have to set a bed for him. So, you click over here where it says none, and then you have to assign a bed by finding a bed and clicking it. So, one that doesn't have a name on it, click it, boom. It assigns a bed to him, and you can also see it puts a bag on the bed with his picture over there. If I let go of the clipboard, you'll see I can open this briefcase, and pretty much you're going to pay him his money, his daily wage of $200 in this briefcase. If that money's not here, he won't work. So, if you don't need his services, you can quite simply just not pay him until you, like, need his services. In order to put money here, you just have to go ahead and grab your money from the green section. You will have to have physical cold, hard cash, and you can grab from here and change the amount that you want to use and just drop it in here and pay him. And he will use this money as he's working, $200 every single day. Now that he's got a bed and he's got money, we can use the manage botanist option again on him, and we can set a storage place where he can grab supplies, supplies such as soil, such as seeds, so that he can grab those relevant things that he needs. So, we're going to set a chest that he's going to use as a supply chest to grab everything he needs. So, here I have this supply source here that he's going to get soil and seeds, and he's going to manage a bunch of these different pots over here. So, click here, just like this, and you can see he will use this as his supply storage crate, and you can change it at any time. The next thing you'll need to do is manage him again, and you can see you can add pots and drying racks, right? You can add up to eight of them. In my case, I'm only having him look after six. So, you're going to click here, and quite simply, you can go ahead and select the pots. Now, you don't want to just left-click immediately. You can actually hold shift and multiple clicks. So, you can actually set a bunch of them. Instead of having to do it one at a time for all six or eight of them, in that matter, you just have to select them like this. You can see they're all highlighted, and when you're ready, you can either hit escape or enter to select that those are the ones that he's going to look out for, just like so. And now, he is essentially done. The final thing you'll need to decide is managing the pots, which you can actually hold shift and select those six again, all of the ones that you need, just like so. So, if you hold this button, you can actually see the picture of which employee is working on them. And once you have the ones selected that you want to engage with, you can go ahead and press the manage pot while looking at one of them. This will actually allow you to change the settings for all six, where you can actually choose what seed is used, if you want a specific seed used. Or if it should just be any. I just kept any. You can pick additives, like if you want them to use fertilizer, PGR, or speed grow, which obviously you'll store in the supply chest if you want them to use those. And then lastly, you will select the destination. This destination will be for the actual final end product. And you can see they're going to pretty much deliver it into this, like, storage crate over here, just like so. And you can already see in here, they actually have been storing a bunch of this already. It's actually full. So, early on in the game, you're probably only going to need one botanist instead of two. I think I have too many. And that's pretty much how the whole clipboard feature works. You can do the same thing with another employee. So, like the chemist, you can manage them. You'll assign a bed. And you'll assign the three stations they need to work from. And remember, you will still use the clipboard to interact with the stations as well, like the chemistry station. You can actually select what recipe they need to make, as well as the destination output should go. So, like, you should pick a recipe. Pick where it goes. Ideally, probably to the lab oven. I mean, from the lab oven, it goes to, I guess, like, you know, the packing station where a handler can go ahead and package it and take it to storage so that you can go ahead and take it to your dealers and, you know, sell it. I hope this video helped you understand workers. And thank you so much for watching.'s going to be a edition of the See graduatedjskno.com, so we'll be there a try to access to the technique you've got herạn and to, you know, and techniques, and grades can decrease in terms of cell design. We'll be there a review. We'll see you interview sideshow as we should do understandimenska.com. We'll maybe see you soon. See you soon. Obviously, you'll never watch out. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
