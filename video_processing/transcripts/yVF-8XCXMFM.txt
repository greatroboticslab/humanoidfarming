 Welcome to Akiwaka, Jamaican city full of white culture and history. Children play and children sing and children learn about everything. And in Akiwaka, we all reassure each other, no respect. Akiwaka, we say Akiwa, we love fun on the clock. No must, no fuss, no fight. Learning about children's rights. Learning about children's rights. Learning about children's rights. You hear a donkey? Yes, Nana. I haven't heard a donkey brain since I left country. Me is a my child. I never even heard a donkey brain in real life before. Boy, boy, boy. Easy girl, easy girl, boy. Even everybody. Evening, evening. But Masami, is where you get this donkey? Well, I have to expand the farm to keep up with the demands for good food. So I got some help from Bessie here. Wow, a real donkey. Yes, she belongs on the farm. But I bring her here so you and Lucy can meet her. Come. We can't touch her. She doesn't bite. She's very friendly. But Masami, how come you never showed us the farm yet? We can't help you. Kingston and I are good little helpers. That's true. Well, we can come tomorrow if we want. Yay! But enough to ask my parents first. Lucy can go, man. And I'm sure Gang and Lana will be alright with it. Plus, I need to go to the doctor tomorrow anyway. Is everything okay with you, Nana? Yes, me child. I'm not seeing so well out of one of my eyes, though. So I'm going to have it checked out. A must all age really reach me. Alright. I will pick you up early tomorrow morning because farmers wake up very early to take care of their crops and their animals. Whoa! I've never seen a farm before. It's so big. And look at all those fruits and vegetables. Yes, I love farm. Look at the goats, cows, chickens and all those other animals. Masami, why do you need so many crops and animals? Most of the food everybody in the city eats come from right as well. Me and my worker, them plant and grow all of it. The ackee, the chucho, and even the chicken. That means farming is an important job, man. Of course, Kingston. Without farmers, we wouldn't have such an easy time getting food. Many of us would not have anything to eat. Teacher Ann told us that the trees also keep the air clean and good for breathing. She said they take in the harmful gases and put out clean air. Yes, Lucy. Lucy, you are 100% correct. Trees filter the air. That's how even though Akiwaki is a city, we still have clean air. Breathe with me. One, two, three. Breathe in. Breathe out. Come here. Back to work. Farming is hard. But when your belly full, you will appreciate it. As a matter of fact, you two have been so helpful. I'm going to send you both home with a basket full of delicious and healthy food. Yay!
