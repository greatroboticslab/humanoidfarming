 This is how much a new 38 foot aluminum livestock trailer cost. So this right here is a Wilson Foreman and it's an eight and a half wide by 38 foot long. You got two full width belly vents up underneath. We have a row of lights on top every post, 33 inch escape door. We got the extruded post for the winter package, three 8k torsion axles on 17.5 tires and aluminum rims. On the back here we have a full swing with an outside slide rear door, extra stop turn tails on the rear header and the corner post. We upgraded the cross members on this one to the YouTube style and then we upgraded the floor to the .125 corrugated. This trailer has three cut gates, two stationary in the back here with double Peters pin and eye sockets there and then the front cut gate is a floating cut gate and then on the passenger side we do have a 50 inch side ramp. This Wilson livestock trailer is huge and pretty decked out and it's only $73,000.
