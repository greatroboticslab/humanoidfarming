 A lot has changed in me after moving to the village, but it seemed unthinkable for me to start my day at 4 am. The best thing about waking up early is that one starts his day calmly and is never hurried. When one sees the sun rising and hear the birds chirping with unbelievable energy, one realizes that he is also part of the natural rhythm. And until the time of the first full meal, one is already done with most of the day's work and is really hungry. Unlike in busy city life where we always have stuffed bellies, I have always believed that every individual is unique and there can't be a single template for everyone. But one must strive to be closely aligned with the natural tune of the universe, because, after all, we are a part of nature.
