 Here's five things that you should know before you start raising chickens. Chickens have a hierarchy or pecking order, which means one of them is always going to be on top. So it's best to keep them in odd numbers and I would recommend starting with three. Just like us, chickens want a cozy place to live. So make sure you provide each bird at least two to three square feet inside of their coop. Your hens are going to want a nice cozy place to lay. So make sure you provide at least one box for every three hens. Chickens love to roost and logs, twigs, and two by fours are perfect for when they sleep. Chickens love to roam, dig, and scratch. So if you're not having them free range, make sure you're providing them at least 10 square feet for every single bird in their chicken run. These five tips will ensure that you raise happy and healthy chickens.
