 So in 2021 and in 2023, peas significantly yielded better on wheat stubble rather than canola stubble. And in the other year, not significantly, but peas did outyield on wheat residue in that year as well. Yeah, so peas are a mycorrhizal crop, meaning that they have an association with mycorrhizae in the soil as a mechanism to increase phosphorus uptake to the plant roots. Wheat is also a host for mycorrhizae. Canola is a non-mycorrhizal crop. So the thought process with that is that peas grown on wheat stubble should outyield peas grown on canola stubble because of that association and because of that greater networking opportunity following wheat stubble.
