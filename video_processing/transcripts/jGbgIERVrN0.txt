 Hi there, my name is Cameron Ogilvie. I'm the Knowledge Mobilization Coordinator for Soils at Guelph, which is a University of Guelph initiative to better connect soil scientists with farmers or gardeners, anybody really who has an interest in soil and managing soil well. I'm at my neighborhood garden today to talk with you about some of those best practices for keeping soils healthy. And so I'm going to walk through these one by one. There's five of them. I'm not the first person to come up with these. But there's about, I think you can boil it down to five, and then we'll talk about what those practices accomplish. All right. The first one, reduce tillage. Now, this maybe goes against everything that you have thought about standard practice for gardening. Most of us, when we garden, we go out and we mix the soil in the spring, whether that's rototilling or with a shovel, we mix it up. And there's some good reasons for why we would mix the soil. It's one of the ways that we can help control weeds. It helps the soil dry out faster and so we can get planting sooner. It provides a good seed bed for all the plants that we're trying to grow. There's some sense to it. But what tillage does is it actually breaks up all of the structure that has developed in the soil over time, which contributes to good aeration, good water infiltration when you get a rainfall event. And that soil structure is really important. And it's important that we preserve it in the same way that you might think about how valuable structure is in your own life for keeping you healthy. Having good soil structure is a key part to keeping soils healthy. And so it's important that we reduce tillage. All right. That's number one. Number two is keep the soil covered. This is closely connected to reducing tillage because when you don't till, you allow things to stay on top of the soil. Sometimes you would use something like a mulch, a straw mulch, and you would put this on top of your soil. And that can help you deal with weeds instead of tilling them. But what it also does is when you get a major rainfall event, it actually protects the soil. Those raindrops come at a pretty high speed and they break apart that soil structure and can cause the soil to smear. And then that prevents rain from infiltrating into the soil or it can cause that soil to run off. So keeping the soil covered with crop residues or other plants is another key part of keeping soils healthy. Number three is keep living roots in the ground as much as possible. And the importance for this is that roots are a key architect in soil structure. I've just got some soil with some grass growing in it here. And as you break this apart, I even struggle to do so because those roots hold it together. You can see all the strings of those roots going across there. And as these roots decompose, they also release nutrients. They release some nutrients while they're growing. They release some sugars that feed the microbes that are in the soil. But these roots are a key part of building that good granular soil structure, feeding those microorganisms. And as they decompose, they contribute to organic matter that accumulates over time. And that organic matter is another key part of soil health. So keep living roots in the ground as much as possible. The fourth one is actually diversifying. In the same way that you and I like a mixed diet, it's really important that we also give the soil a mixed diet of different plants that get grown. Different plants have different root structures, and they have different supply and demand of nutrients to the soil. They also have different pests that are associated with them. And so it's really key to rotate your crops on your soil, rotate the plants that are grown. And that's a key part of keeping soil healthy as well. That's number four. And the fifth one is incorporating animal manures or composts. And the reason why this is important is this is some of the best soil food that you can provide. Sometimes we think about managing nutrients in the soil with fertilizers. But fertilizers are kind of like vitamin and mineral supplements for us. They're really important for dealing with deficiencies. But you wouldn't want to base a diet on mineral pills. Okay. So it's the same for soil. We need to be feeding soil with good manures, good composts, composts, and that they're filled with organic matter and nitrogen and phosphorus and all the micronutrients and macronutrients that the soil needs in order to grow our plants. So that's number five. Incorporate animal manures. I'm going to review those once more. So reduce tillage as much as possible. Keep the soil covered. Keep living roots in the ground as much as possible. Diversify and include animal manures and composts. All these things are key parts to keeping soil healthy.
