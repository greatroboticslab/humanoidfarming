 If you're a grain farmer, I hate to be the bearer of bad-nose if you didn't already think that yourself. Big farms are going to keep getting bigger and small farms are going to keep dying. The wheat market is garbage. Hey, welcome to our YouTube. It's June 18th. We're in about the fourth or fifth day of wheat harvest. We had harvested a couple of days and then received 10 inches of rainfall and three or four different rainfall events. And now we're back in the field again. So, hope you enjoy. Yeah, so I think two weeks ago Monday, we started and cut wheat a couple of days. The wheat crop is one of the better ones we've cut in the farm. And the quality was great. So, you don't get to see great quality out of Kentucky very often because of the amount of rainfall we get here. But we had great quality in our wheat. And great yields. And then we had all that rain. And now we're back in the wheat today. And we're just... When we started here two hours ago, the wheat moisture was back up to 17. So, we'll have to take this to the dryer. And I'm not 100% sure of the quality yet. But we were going to take a sample to the granary and see what kind of quality reduction we've had since the rainfall. I'm assuming it to be pretty significant. So, from a high quality to more than likely a low quality wheat that we're cutting now. So, just part of growing wheat. Out of the first event, we had six inches in about a 24-hour period. And then we had a two-inch rain. And then we had a bunch of small showers consecutively every couple of hours for a couple of days. They got the last couple of inches. So, I think when you combine them all total, it was around 10 inches out of about maybe a week total. Seven or eight days, something like that period. Six inches out of one and then multiple other rains to get the other half of the amount of rainfall that we got. Lots of rain. We're probably about 20% done. So, I would think that if we had a good eight or nine day run, we could knock it out. And it looks like the weather is going to hold for us. We'll get the majority of the wheat out. There's quite a bit of canola that's been cut around in our county here in the last before the rain. And even some started back today in the canola field. So, we're excited to get in our canola too. We don't have much. But we've heard some really good yield reports out of the canola. So, we hope to have at the end of this wheat harvest, we'll probably get our canola. Well, I would already consider like we're in a, you know, we like to have the wheat harvested. You know, I would like to see it harvested by the 20th of June. And any time after that, I mean, you can still make a full bean crop all the way up to about the 4th of July here. Any time you get after the 25th, you know, you start to get, you're starting to get probably in some yield reduction on your second crop. You know, up to about the 25th, you know. And most years, you'd probably be, you know, you're probably not a lot of difference between the very first week of June and the third week of June. But any time you start getting after that, a lot of times we'll start getting short rainfall in July. And the beans struggle to grow off out of the wheat field. So, the earlier you can get into June, the better. Just because our precipitation tends to, we go from lots of precipitation to, you know, to a drier pattern. And you want the beans in before that happens just because the moisture allows the beans to get growth. And then they'll go through, we'll go through a pretty significant dry period here in Kentucky. August is usually pretty dry. And then we come back into a fall pattern and we start getting rainfalls again. And that's when our double crop or our soybean crop that's after the wheat is trying to fill its pods. So, it works out pretty good. Like, they kind of sit here and just are in vegetative growth during our dry spill, during our dry season. And then when it's time to fill pods, we start getting fall rains again. So, it's nice to have the beans planted in the first, you know, 10 days and two weeks to June. And then after that, you know, it's just a, depends on the weather how good the second crop is going to be. So, to answer your question, two days from now, I'm going to be like, that sucks. But, I mean, what do you do? Because we definitely, you know, we'll be lucky to have it all cut and planted by the time. With the other unplanted acres that we have due to rainfall, we'll be lucky to have everything planted by the 4th of July this time. Have you started planting yet? The double crop, we have started planting. And the first field that we planted, I noticed, had some of the beans up this morning. It's not up to a full stand yet. So, you know, I mean, I'm starting to wonder, we'll be replanting some of our first planted double crop, I'd say possibly, with all that rainfall. It'd be hard not to have some ground out areas. That's true. That's true. Corn is tossling this week. Not widespread tossling. Our very first planting is tossling and then I'm starting to see scattered tossles in the second plantings. So I'd say middle of next week here a big portion probably over 50% of our corn crop will be tasseled or tasseling. And then the following week I'd say we'll have close to 100% of our corn crop tasseling. Pretty far along here on corn. Further than normal. Our corn is a little ahead of normal. Which is amazing. Yeah it kind of surprises me really. May was pretty cool here and we haven't had an abnormally warm June. But we have had a lot of rainfall and I guess the corn got its fertilizer on really quick after we planted it. And with the amount of rainfall we've had it's really had the corn in a rapid growth. And that's why we're tasseling so early here. Usually I would expect to see our corn crop tasseling around the 4th of July. So probably two weeks ahead of normal I would guess. And that probably means unless we turn off really dry this summer. We'll probably have corn kind of stalls around waiting for rain. We'll more than likely have an early fall harvest. I wouldn't be surprised if we're not in full swing harvest by the 3rd week of August. And normally we're just picking around a little bit in August. But this time if everything keeps progressing like it is now we'll be in wide open. And you know maybe by the 3rd week of August this time. So a little ahead of normal on corn. And it's going to be a late soybean harvest. So yeah the wheat market is garbage. I want to say that like about 540 is for soft thread is about what they're paying at the river. Even up 20 you know we're still not in a profitable level. You really would like to see at least you'd like to see 7 but you know I think a lot of guys would sell at 6. And just be satisfied with it for this season. But the way we priced inputs and everything you'd really like to see the wheat you know price at $7. And to make a lot of, to make a good profit I would think. So 540 there's going to be a lot of it going into the bins. And people just are going to wait and see what happens. And hope that sometime before fall harvest that wheat makes some type of rally. There's some type of condition that happens that you know that makes the traders get a little nervous and bid up. And if not people just wind up storing it for a couple of months and selling it at 540. That's because most people have to get rid of it before the fall harvest comes. They can't hold both crops. So we've got a little time though for the guys that don't have it, that haven't priced wheat to get it sold. You know markets overall are, they're really, they're not nervous about the weather. A lot, lots of rain in the, in the upper Midwest and, and far west both. Beneficial rains have been happening. You know too much here in the, in the south, mid south and south. But we don't really affect the market that much. And, and so where the areas that mainly make the grain have been receiving beneficial rains. And we're, you know, pretty dry during planting, which allowed them to get their crop in in a timely manner. And then they've got beneficial rains to, to get that crop going. And so in turn, the markets have been feeling heavy pressure by all that rainfall. And that's why a lot of times in June, you'll see, you know, the market getting a little nervous, feeling like, oh, there's some dry pockets around. We might have a crop problem. And you'll see markets begin to rally and it gives you some full pricing opportunities. And we haven't had that this time. And it's just because dry early spring allowed the farmers to get their crop in. And then after the crops in, beneficial rains come. And that, you know, it makes the market, makes the traders feel like they're confident in their positions. They don't have to aggressively bid to get more grain. And so that's bad for the farmer. He's just going to have to wait and, and hope for some other positive news somewhere else that, you know, forces a little life out of the market. And so we might just see a low suppressed market through this entire harvest and your marketing opportunities might not be until 2026. I say it's definitely possible. We're in a, I think the, this may be, it's a third year of a down cycle. So you'll usually see down cycles in, in two or four year periods. And it's, you know, I thought maybe, I thought there for a little while we were going to start to come out of this down cycle. And it would just be a two year down cycle. But now just watching the markets, I feel like we're probably in a four year down cycle before we start to see our cash markets come back. The weather can change that, but if we continue with our same patterns, I'm going to, I'm going to say that the rest of 25 and possibly a big part of 26 will be in suppressed commodity markets. So if you're a grain farmer, I hate to be the bearer of bad news if you didn't already think that yourself. So, you know, I think a lot of, you know, you're, you're going to see a lot of guys that are right on the edge of retirement thinking, why am I going to do this another season? And so, you know, what we don't want to see, I feel like is more consolidation. But that's probably what we're going to see is more farm consolidation happening over the next two years, less farms, you know, which I feel like for our rural communities is just horrible. The more farm consolidation you see, the more erosion in the rural economies you're going to see. Not that I think that bad farm or big farms are bad, but they, but big farms are definitely bad for our rural communities. They, you know, instead of having a local tire man, they a lot of times have their own tire guy or, you know, and, and they maybe go outside of your community shop for inputs and it just, it hurts our rural economy. So, but it's just part of progress. I don't, you know, where we've already started down that road and I don't know that we'll ever do anything to change it. So more of the same, big farms are going to keep getting bigger and small farms are going to keep dying. But I don't know. I'm not smart enough to change it. I don't think. You know, the, or just positive for the overall commodity market, you know, like President Trump has been, has been, and there's been some talk about a biofuel mandate where a lot of the, the crops that aren't so great for human consumption, like soybeans and number two yellow corn, um, can go to other uses, uh, like biofuels. And, uh, I feel like, you know, a really good biofuel mandate, um, could take some of the pressure off the farm economy. Um, just, it gives us another market to go with, uh, our access amount of commodity. And it gives us a, a market right here in the U.S. so we don't have to look to export so much of our profit. And, uh, you know, I feel like that's a, that would be a positive step. Um, I also feel like I'd like to, you know, and, and it's going to take a lot smarter person than me to figure it out. But, um, with all the maha stuff that you see, make America healthy again, and, um, the kind of, uh, move away from, uh, or the distancing of the politicians from the commodity ag. If we could see, um, some type of, uh, grants available or just, uh, some type of, um, maybe, uh, a way for the government to loan starting farmers money at a low interest rate, um, so that they can get into a, uh, direct to consumer retail business producing, um, healthy foods on small acreages. Um, for your local market. I feel like that could be, you know, I don't know, I don't know that you'll see any of that stuff come out in 2025, but I feel like that's a positive move for agriculture. We, we definitely need, um, diversity on the farms. And, uh, that allows smaller farms to get started and new producers to get started. And, um, it gives consumers, uh, an ability to choose healthy food, um, that's fresh from their area to put in their diet. So, it should make them healthier. It should help the rural community because it gives a new businessman, uh, a new avenue to make money. And, you know, it should be good for all our, uh, local tire shops and our hardware stores. And, um, you know, just your small input businessmen, uh, in America. So, a couple of things that, you know, I hope to come, see come to fruition sometime in the next couple of years. And I think you'll see some of both. You'll see some biofuel mandate or a biofuel mandate. And you'll probably see a move by the government, uh, to try to support small producers. Just because I feel like that, um, there's, there's more people than just me that want to see that. There's, uh, you're seeing a move by, um, American small businessmen and, and, uh, and government as well. To get alternative, um, you know, the markets open for smaller producers. Like, talking about double crop soybeans, uh, the ground now after all the rainfall is too wet to plant back today. So, um, we're probably gonna have to wait maybe into next week before we begin to seed our plants. We're gonna have to seed our soybean crop back into the wheat ground we're cutting today. So, um, I think you'll, you'll probably see that in all of the river counties here in Kentucky. And, and, uh, Southern Illinois is experiencing the same kind of wet conditions we are. So they're kind of in the same boat we're in. So, um, you know, I, I kinda, I expect to see, um, you know, a later than normal soybean crop based off the weather we've been experiencing here in our area. In Tah��ah and sixties, others have smalleritor Beginner Mil OS hear this sun. Um, pretty much uh. From now, on the hurricaneали, we've been planting and, uh, out on I write for $15,000, From now on I have dinosaur stories on YouTube. 對 i RIVERA gua주고 Bakura fix. isinim siro langs no cheaper Then on I have sun or steamed for $15!
