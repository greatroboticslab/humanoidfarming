 Okay folks, let's talk leasing. Back two and a half years ago, early 2015, the movement for leasing tractors just exploded. In fact, I wrote at the time 2015 was the year of the lease. By far the biggest farm machinery story that year. And understandable why it happened. We had slowing sales, particularly on large ag equipment in 2014 and 15 with the slowdown in the ag economy. And leasing was perfect. You got the warranty coverage you needed, plus it took away the risk on the back end with depreciation rates on your one, two, three row tractor. Well when leasing took off, what I wondered about would be the effect the off lease tractors would have on use values. Because I remember what happened in the late 90s, early 2000s and it wasn't pretty. There was a ton of off lease tractors back in the market, use values were hurt. Well what I would report here in late 2017 is a very positive thing. For the most part, the absorption rate of these tractors coming off lease and being sold has been a pretty good clip. Particularly on the large horse and four wheel drive tractors. What we're finding is dealers all over the country are being very aggressive buyers of off lease tractors. And then are able to turn and sell you the tractor you need locally. And the dealer can make a little money, keep these tractors flowing. Now I would say, we are starting to see a little pile up on the lower horse, the 100 to 130 horse tractors coming off lease. So really good opportunity the rest of 2017 into early 2018. Call your local dealer. If they don't have it, I'm sure they can find what you need and you can probably get a pretty good deal on that size tractor. That's a pretty good deal on that size tractor.
