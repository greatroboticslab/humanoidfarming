 hello everyone welcome to today's lecture I'm dr. Suresh Babu in this session we will be discussing about one of the fundamental pillars of agriculture science that is agronomy and its scope so first up what is agronomy so agriculture itself it is a broad and vast stream so agronomy in that agronomy is a branch of agriculture science that mainly focuses on the principles and practices of a crop production and soil management and it involves the study of how plants grow and different soil and climates and how to optimize the use of water fertilizer and other inputs to increase the crop yields efficiently and sustainably so overall this process and this condition we call as agronomy so why is agronomy important so what is the importance of agronomy so agronomy having it's a great importance in this modern agriculture due to several reasons so first of all we have some reasons like agronomy ensures a food security and also it improves the productivity and it supports sustainability so so ensures food security how agronomy ensures food security means by improving crop yields and managing resources wisely and agronomy helps to meet the growing global demand for the food so overall it ensures the agronomy ensures the food security so next we have importance that is improves productivity so through scientific techniques like crop rotation irrigation management and integrated nutrient management so it enhances both quantity and quality of agriculture produce so particularly it improves the agronomy improves the productivity and third importance that is it supports sustainability so agronomic practices promote soil health and it reduces the environmental degradation and it encourages the sustainable use of natural resources so it is helping for the future generations of thrive so these are the some of the importance of agronomy first one we have agronomy ensures a food security by improving the crop yields under managing the resources wisely and also it improves the productivity through the scientific techniques like crop rotation irrigation management and integrated nutrient management and agronomy supports the sustainability by agronomic practices which supports improves the from our promotes soil health and which reduces the environmental degradation so this is about what is agronomy why is agronomy important so next what is the definition of agronomy what is the proper definition of agronomy so agronomy is the science the science and technology of producing and using plants for food fuel fiber and land reclamation so this is the proper definition of agronomy so agronomy combines the aspects like biology chemistry chemistry ecology ecology earth science and genetics to improve agricultural practices so the word agronomy is derived from the greek words so two words first one we have agros which is the meaning of a field and next one the meaning of normos the meaning of normos is management so agronomy literally means field management so some of the key focus areas of agronomy are first we have a crop production and improvement and soil fertility and soil health and efficient use of water nutrients and other inputs and also sustainable and also sustainable and climate resilient farming systems is one of the major focus area of agronomy and next finally we have our land reclamation and conservation practices also some of the key focus areas of agronomy agronomy so next what is the proper meaning of agronomy so agronomy is a multi-disciplinary field that combines the art science and business of a crop production and soil management so art first we have a art so art means the practical skill art itself it is a practical skill so what is the relation between we are calling the agronomy is the art science and business so art itself it is a practical skill so agronomy as an art because it involves the skillful application of the knowledge to manage the soil crops and the farm environment efficiently and effectively so it includes the practices like timely showing of harvesting judging soil moisture by the field and managing weeds and diseases throughout the field and managing weeds and pests and diseases throughout experience so that art so the agronomy is the art which is a practical skill next second one agronomy is a science so the science itself it is a theoretical foundation so agronomy as a science because it is a based on the principles from the biology chemistry physics environmental science so why biology biology it tells of the plant growth genetics and physiology and next chemistry it includes agronomy includes a chemistry nutrient cycle soil chemistry fertilizers and agronomy the physics why soil structure water movement climate impact studies about all these things and agronomy includes environmental science so why sustainable farming and ecological balance so it explains about the sustainable farming and ecological balance so agronomy is a science so agronomy is a science because it's a basic of the principles from biology chemistry physics and environmental science and many other so next term we have business agronomy as a business so business it explains about the economic perspective so agronomy is also a business why it is focusing on the commercial aspects of agriculture so input output analysis for the profitability and also cost effective use of seeds fertilizers labors and missionary and maximizing the yields and quality for the market competitiveness so all these comprises that agronomy is a business so business itself it is the economic perspective so agronomy is the multidisciplinary field that combines the art science and business of crop production and soil management so agronomy equal to art that is a practical skill and plus science that is a systematic knowledge plus business economic variability so this holistic approach helps in producing food sustainability profitability profitability and efficiency so this is about the meaning of the agronomy so next we have the scope of agronomy so the scope of agronomy so the scope of agronomy is vast and covers multiple aspects of agriculture aimed at improving crop production and conserving the resources and ensuring sustainability sustainability so the promotion of the sustainability is one of the major scope of the agronomy so it involves the major scientific principles and the practical techniques and the modern technologies etc so there are some key areas in this scope of agronomy first we have crop production management so what this crop production management tells about so developing effective methods for the sowing nutrient application techniques and the pest control and the harvesting so all these aspects are included in this crop production so the selecting appropriate crops and cropping systems based on the climate and soil conditions are critical so all these will be explained in this crop production and management systems so next we have an area of soil soil fertility and the conservation so in this soil fertility and conservation so in this soil fertility and the conservation it enhances the soil health throughout the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers so it prevents this soil erosion and degradation through conservation techniques like contour blowing and cover cropping so whenever we are going for the cultivation practices so soil fertility and soil conservation is one of the soil conservation is one of the major aspect which we have to consider in terms of agriculture crop production system so soil fertility and conservation is one of the key area in this scope of agronomy next we have a weed and water management so the controlling of weeds throughout the cultural mechanical chemical and biological methods included in in this weed management and efficient irrigation practices and water conservation techniques like drip and sprinkler systems also included in this weed and water management so the weed and water management is one of the scope of this agronomy next most important one sustainable agriculture so the sustainable agriculture promoting this agriculture practices that many maintain productivity while conserving the natural resources so the conservation of natural resources for the future generation is one of the aspects of the sustainable agriculture so reducing resilience on the chemical inputs and encouraging the integrated farming systems is one of the aspects in this sustainable agriculture system approach so next we have a scope of climate resilient agriculture climate resilient agriculture so how we resilient in agriculture so the developing and adopting practices and the crop varieties that withstand drought and floods and temperature extreme that promotes climate resilience in agriculture and also this climate resilience minimizes agriculture impact on the climate change this is one of the major point which we have to know this minimization of the agriculture impact on the climate change that promotes climate resilience in agriculture by this using sustainable agriculture practices so next one we have a organic farming and precision farming this is one of the scope under the agronomy so the organic farming avoiding this is avoiding the synthetic chemicals its focus is upon a zero peoples focuses on the compost grain grain manure and natural and natural pest control thus to be called about organic farming says to be called about organic farming so next we have a precision farming species farming so essence forms and carbonot Galistics are pushed designed to combine the processing farming so the precision farming explains precision farming is the using of algorithm alarming called gpas sensors также and data analytics to apply inputs accordingly and efficiently so they do exercise this means policing farming so the organic farming means that the the precision farming so the organic farming and the precision farming also one of the scope of agronomy next agroecology and environmental protection so the studying interaction among the crops animals humans and the environment and farming system that helps helps to know about the biodiversity what's going on our field what's going on over the area that promotes a sustainable environment in our cropping system so it ensuring the biodiversity reducing our pollution and protecting ecosystems that promote the sustainable agriculture system so agroecology environmental protection also one of the scope under this agronomy so the scope of agronomy covers every stage from the preparation means the soil preparation to the post harvest with a focus of a productivity sustainability and environmental responsibility so it's please it please a central role in a meeting the global challenges of a food security and climate change so all these explains about the scope of agronomy so next agronomy and interdisciplinary science already previous we previous slide we have discussed about the agronomy as a art science and business so as well as agronomy as an interdisciplinary science so agronomy is not a standard alone subject it draws knowledge from the various agriculture and the scientific disciplines to improve crop production and farm sustainability so this interdisciplinary nature makes agronomy more effective and practical so interactions with other disciplines like science science plant breeding and genetics and plant pathology and agriculture economics and agriculture engineering and horticulture plays a good interaction between the branches of agriculture science so first we have the thing that is soil science so the soil science focuses on the soil health structure and the nutrient dynamics so the contribution of this uh soil science it helps in understanding the soil fidelity ph organic matter and the nutrient availability for the better crop growth so this aspects helps to promote agri agronomist scope better and also second one we have a plant breeding and genetics so the major focus of this particular plant breeding and genetics is is it's it's a development of a high yielding disease resistant and climate resistant varieties or climate resistant varieties or climate resistant varieties so this is one of the focus major focus of a plant breeding and genetics so the contribution provides improved crop varieties suited to the different environment and the agronomic practices so this is the major contribution of the plant breeding and genetics so next we have a discipline that is entomology the major focus of this entomology is the study of insect pests and their control so the contribution assists and this integrated pest management to reduce the crop losses and pesticide use so this is about the entomology next we have a plant pathology so major focus about the plant pathology is the plant diseases uh and their control it focuses uh and their control it focuses majorly focuses on the plant diseases and their control the contribution it guides the agronomist in identifying disease and applying preventive and curative measures in the crop production so that's nature the plant disease management nature i have for the agronomic practices and the crop growth and development and good yield generation so that is a major contribution of a plant plant pathology next subject we have a agriculture economics so the major focus of this agriculture economics is a farm planning input output analysis and profitability the contribution of this agriculture economics is it supports the decision making based on the cost benefit analysis and market trends so they according to this agriculture economics phenomenon will plan the crops accordingly for the market demand and the profitability man so this is one of the contribution one of the good aspects of our agriculture economics which we have to consider in terms of planning up agriculture crops and agronomy or whatever in agriculture field so next we have agriculture engineering the focus of this particular agriculture in engineering is about mechanization irrigation and post-harvest technology so the major contribution of agriculture engineering it promotes efficient use of farm machinery irrigation systems and resource management so this is about the agriculture engineering will use all the engineering mechanization irrigation post-harvest technology for the generation and the growth and development of a particular crops and next we have a horticulture so the focus of this particular horticulture is the cultivation of the fruits vegetables and ornamental plant ornamental crops so the contribution of this particular horticulture enhances the crop diversification income generation and nutritional security so agronomy is an interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge from multiple fields to address the complex challenges of crop production style and earning nietzsche the non-love-ssea production housing and other budget that either predicate its owners and reabs highest level Alison's farming system. So all these explains about the agronomy is an interdisciplinary science. So agronomy is not a standard alone subject. Finally it's not a standard alone subject. It's drawn in knowledge from the various agriculture and scientific disciplines to improve crop production and farm sustainability. So next we have art, science and business of crop production. Previously we have discussed about the agronomy as the art, science and business of crop production. So we'll discuss very deeply in this. So the crop production is a holistic process that involves the combination of art, science and business to achieve a sustainable and profitable farming. So when we are going for the cultivation of the crops or a farming system whichever any business or something profitability as a major aspect. So each component plays a great role. This art, science and business each and every component plays a great role for the good income generation or sustainability in agriculture. So the art of crop production. The first one we have to discuss about the art. So art of crop production. So it involves the practical skills and field experience developed over the time. So key aspects involved in this art of crop production. Includes it's judging the right time for the sowing, irrigation and harvesting and preparing the seedbed properly based on the soil and the soil and the crop needs and managing a field operation skillfully with the hands-on knowledge and responding to the unpredictable factors like weather, pest, diseases based on institution and experience. So all these are the key aspects which involved in this art of crop production. So it is the knowing how. So art of crop production is the knowing how of a farming often passed down throughout generations. So this is all about the art of crop production. Next we have a science of crop production. So what is the science of crop production? So based on the systemic research, experimentation and technology. So major key aspects involved in this science of crop production are this is application of biology, chemistry and physics to understand the crop physiology, soil chemistry and environmental impact. So the conducting field trials and experiments to determine the best practices is a major aspect in the science of crop production that leads the experimentation and the good result orientation for the betterment of the good yield generation. So the using of data driven decisions for the input management like fertilizer and irrigation scheduling. These are the data driven decisions. So according to the previous data, according to the previous movement towards the good yield generation, we will go forward for the science aspect of the field experimental driven to the best practices. So that we this we call as the science of crop production. In this science of crop production, we have a most important point that we call adopting modern techniques like remote sensing, GIS and precision farming like systems that promote the sustainability in agriculture system. So majorly this science of crop production is the knowing why. So that improves efficiency and productivity. So this art of crop production is a knowing how of farming and this science of crop production is the knowing why. So next we have a business of crop production. So the business of crop production mainly focuses on the economic and commercial aspects of farming. So the major key aspects included in this business of crop production are input management. So the input management includes seeds, fertilizers, machinery and the labor. So the output and also it's a key aspect is output planning. So the output planning includes estimation of the yields, quality and the post harvest handling and also calculating the cost returns and the profit margins also included in this business. So estimating estimation of market linkages and establishing of this linkages between this particular business interventions and promotion of the brand establishing the branding and value addition things are the business of crop production. So that's why we call agronomy is a business of crop production. So it ensures this business of crop production ensures farming is financially viable and market oriented. So the art gives experience, the science offers knowledge and the business ensures profitability. So a successful crop production system balances all three for sustainable and profitable agriculture. So this is about the agronomy is the art, science and business of crop production. So science includes research, trials, data driven decisions and the business includes inputs, outputs, profit margins and market linkages and art. And art, first we have to start about the art that is a practical field experience, timing, irrigation, seed bed preparation, time of sowing, all these things comes under the art. So the agronomy is a combination of the art, science and business of crop production. So the art stop that seems to be a little bit ...
