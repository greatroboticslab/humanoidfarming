 Morning everyone welcome back to another video. I'm in Wisconsin United States of America and we're doing a farm tour today and I'm going to introduce you guys to the farmer. This is Patty. How's it going? Good how are you doing? Pretty good and we're here also with Jeff from De La Valle and he's going to be showing us this farm too because they have a pretty cool new milking parlor here. We're in Lake Mills, Wisconsin and we mill just over 500 cows. We crop about 1100 acres of land and for cropping we raise alfalfa and corn. The corn is for corn silage, alfalfa for haylage. The farm was purchased by my in-laws down in Pat Dove in 1987 and then in 2000 Chet joined the farm and then in 2002 I joined the farm as well. We set up an LLC in 2003 and we've been growing since 2003. Awesome. Just walking into the parlor here. So what kind of a parlor we got here? So this is a double 16 P500 which is a GEGI which that means it's a gang index, gang exit. So what we have 16 cows on the side and the way that system works is that we can actually individually release gangs of four. We can index gangs of four or we can actually release the whole side at a time. That gives the farm the ability then to help unload and reload quicker with the options with the different gangs and helps if you have different sized animals with the GEGI function. You can actually index in gangs of four so if you have one big cow she won't only get the size of the index. This also is the new automation that D-Level is going to be featuring here coming up in the fall which is MA200. So it's brand new automation and if we go down to the basement we'll see the new MM100 millimetre. Sweet. Yeah so this is an IDD which is called it's a D-Level Interactive data display and really what we're showing here is some cow site data. We don't have any displays at the cow site so this is an opportunity for the cow manager to look at some basic data without having going back to the computer and seeing what's going on and maybe Patti can explain what she uses for underneath the basement. So I don't necessarily milk every cow on the farm but if there is an issue with a cow or something like that or I just want to check milk waves I can come over here check to see who the cow is and then see like what she's supposed to be milking. If you click on one you can see she's given so far she's given 24 pounds and then it tells you that she's down 17 and she's still milking but if it was if these flash yellow that means that they're low milk. You can come and see like how much milk she has given and see how low he is and if it's within reason you can let her go but if it's something more then maybe we have to sort her out and work with her. Okay we talked about MA 200 so these are the MA 200 cow site buttons so it's a real simple one touch button so the great big square in the middle is our start button stop button and then if you have a long push you'll put it in manual and there's some different color codes on the outside these color codes will help the milker understand if things are in a good position or a bad position so yellow means there'd be a caution if the cow has something going on with it. Brad might be a stop alarm like she's do not milk cow and then if you see um if you see white means everything's good she's milking normally and then right here wearing blue so that's kind of an idle state so it's just pending waiting for somebody to attach to it and then a very similar looking button is this four square here this four square here runs our gangs right so we talked about the four individual gangs so there's one of these that actually every gang and this has the opportunity then to release index and lift up our divider gates without having to do it as a group we can do it here as an individual gang okay and then there's one more button down the way a bit this one so this is uh this is exit plus so exit plus and instead of doing gangs this plus button will actually release the whole side of animals and it doesn't sequentially so it'll actually that one button will open the front ends up wait for a certain amount of time bring the front ends back down and then automatically open the entrance gate with one touch so it's provides the operation of the parlor right so the employee doesn't have to open close and then do the entrance escape one button will actually do it all for us so this p500 is day laval's newer parallel milking parlor and it's unique that the sequencing gates will come up while the cows are still standing on the deck there and then when it's released those front bars will lift up and let the cows out and then once all the cows step off of the deck those sequencing gates swoop down and push all the ladies off the deck so in the day laval champion you'll get some ladies that are staying there and you got to chase them off yourself so this parlor eliminates that by sweeping them all down and off of the deck which is pretty neat and the other thing jeff was telling us about they can open the individual gangs so there's four gangs in this parlor of four cows to make the double 16 they can release just these front four leave these ladies in the parlor release the next four and the back four whatever they want they can let the cows go as that section is done being milked the other thing that allows this parlor to do which is pretty neat is individual index this group of four cows so it's not a straight connected index for all 16 these four are separately indexed and what that means is the cows are pushed back to where the milkers are hanging those milkers cleaning those teats and performing the milking process so it's pretty cool this is definitely an upgrade to the day level champion it's a slick looking parlor hey lady there's a sweetheart here good looking cows the other cool thing about this farm their return alley is just massive so cows are never going to be standing here waiting so here here so She can't wait to be milked. The other neat thing in this parlor, they have the Ivanza Milk Claw from De La Valle. That's a newer milk claw. To change the liners, you just screw the liner out and screw the new ones back in. Pretty sweet. They've just simplified the whole interface up here for the milker. There's no screen with a million buttons. They have the one button you press it. I imagine that's to sort the cow. So that's the parlor. They have a basement then. We're going to go down right now. So this is a direct load farm you call it? Yep. So direct load, the milk goes from the receiver through a plate heat exchanger and onto the truck at 34 degrees. So what we do then, back behind you is our milk wash buffer tank. So that buffer tank will essentially proportionally slow down the milk at a very slow rate. We slowly push it through our plate heat exchanger. Half of this is water and half of this is glycol. So the water here is about 52 degrees. So we take our milk that's around 100 and we drop it down to about 55. And then we remove the rest of the temperature with the glycol side down to about. Today we're at 34. Then we go into the tank directly in the cold. This tanker here holds about 55,000 pounds of milk. So there's an alarm on the metering systems. Once that hits that certain amount of milk, the alarm will come on, hold the hose off, the tank's ready to go to the plate. That's cool. The other pretty cool thing in their fill room here is they have a Piper system. So that's like an automatic milk sampling piece of technology they have since they're loading directly onto the truck. Instead of taking samples at the milk plant, it's actively taking a sample and filling a bag while it's filling that entire load. So this is pretty neat. It also will record the weight that's going on that truck. Then the plant can just go off of that sample and that weight. So you got some new tech down here. Yeah, a couple of new things that we got on the farm. So we'll start with the milk meter. So it's an MM100 milk meter. New to diesel valve. It's a three quarter end milk meter. So it has the ability to help out with higher flow power. So better vacuum stability. This valve mirror also does connectivity and measures blocks and slips. So that's in addition to what we had before on this with the old version of the back to same meter. The other thing is that this is a part of the MA automation. So this is MA200 automation. Our pulsator actually resides in this black box. Our gray box is just for connections to be made in a dry location. And then our CCM is the brain for the BM213 or the bug module that you saw upstairs. And the other thing they have here is full response of milking. Which is actually a combination of this valve, this valve, and this vacuum monitoring device. So the system vacuum here is at 14.2 inches of vacuum, which is quite high for a low line. So what we're doing is we have two speeds. And when we start alking a cow, we have to use this lower vacuum, which is at 12.8. And once we see the cow get over 4.4 pounds of milk, we fully open this valve to give us our 14.2 inches of vacuum. So that allows us to have a shorter period of time to fully keep it coming. That's sweet. So basically two milking speeds. You wait until that cow is at peak flow. And then you apply that higher vacuum to milk her out quicker when she's in high flow. That's pretty cool. Absolutely. And then the other thing we do with the vacuum monitor here is that if that cow was in high flow, well, when she wasn't supposed to, the vacuum monitor, then we'll give an alarm to the dairy farmer saying, hey, your high flow started the wrong position. Make sure that the crimp is working well. So we have a lot of information that we're going to make back to speed. Nice. New Steps So we're in their freestyle barn now and the parlor we were just in is right down there. So I guess this is your main cow highway. Then they got a couple of groups of ladies. This barn was built in 1996 and then the barn here was built in 2000 and Chet and Don, they built this side of the barn by themselves with employees. Wow. Cleary built that side. We're in the next freestyle barn now and this is pretty cool. This is their pre-fresh pen. So these ladies are all ready to calve any minute and they're in a freestyle set up here. They're walking through here every 20 minutes, 24 hours a day looking for these cows that are calving and once they're about to calve they have a straw pack right over there and they'll separate that lady out, put her over there and she'll have the calf right there. And she was just telling me they have a routine to feed the cows some fresh feed right away and they give it some water with special electrolytes in there. And this is all really caring for that cow that just had a calf and they want to give it the best start. So they're doing all these protocols to get that cow fed and comfy again as quickly as they can after she's done calving. Pretty neat program they run here. I've never seen that the cows are waiting to calve in the freestyle barn but they're walking through constantly and moving those ladies right to the pack. So pretty neat. So this is their freestyle barn. Older milking ladies are here. They're bedding with sand. And they do not recycle their sand so they're putting it straight into the manure pit and onto the field just like we do back at home. So fun fact about these barns they are insulating the roof and that is to keep the heat from the sun out of the barn. So this roof right here insulated not to keep the barn warm in the winter time but to keep it cool in the summer time. So in this freestyle barn they have curtains on the side that can open up when it's hot. You can see the massive fans there to move air over top of these ladies. But these are the hand cranks so there's a cable that goes across the cows to the other side to that wall. And they can raise and lower those curtains right here in the feed alley. So they've got four hand cranks. Never noticed that before in a barn so that's pretty cool. The other thing they have in here too is of course the sprinklers and that's to keep the cows cool in the summer time. That pipe runs across when the ladies are up here eating. They'll get a little spritz of cool water. And then that in combination with their moving over top keeps these ladies nice and cool in those hot summer months. I can see they're feeding a bunch of corn silage. This is their feed. Oh yeah the doggy's here. This is their TMR. Looks good. Pretty wet. Just stepped out of their freestyle barn and they have some sand here. So they buy this in. It's called washed sand. And I am so jealous. This is just, this is straight up beach sand. They truck it in. Apparently sand is quite abundant out here where they're located. So they can get as much as they want for a reasonable price. So at this farm they're hauling all their own liquid manure. And this is one of their tankers. I think they said they had four. It's just a semi trailer with a tank and they open a valve at the back, dump it out, and then they'll come with a chisel plow and work all that manure into the soil. This is their feed truck. So this one was built in 2007, this half. And it was going to be dry cows and then heifers. We're starting to depopulate the outside lot there. And now it's all gone. But, so that was like the first step. But then it never held dry cows ever. It always held heifers. We always have plenty of them. This side is the breeding age. And then as they get bigger they just start rotating around this half of the barn. So a lot of them in 10, 7 are pregnant already. And then 10, 8, and 9 for the most part should be pregnant or they're on their last straw. For a lab? Yep, and then they'll go to a 10 and finish them off. How are you spotting heat? Are you just visually? Are you sinking them? No. I'll sink them. If you see orange on them, that means they were estimated yesterday. But other natural heaps, like a lot of times you can see them in heat. They're very vocal. Or they mess around, like, you know. Or they follow me and they're like, why are you following me today? And then to take the heifers out of there that are about to calve, are you just looking for those udders that are getting bigger? So it's all in Dairy Comp. We use the management software, Dairy Comp. Yep. Three weeks before calving, we take truckloads to the pre-crush or a truckload up. We can get six cows, six animals on our trailer. And so sometimes there's six to go up, sometimes there's 12, sometimes there's 18. It all depends on the week. Right on. If, sometimes we do have a dry lot too, so I can put heifers down there. So if we're running overflow, we have the dry lot too, to put the heifers in too. Awesome. Yeah. So this is their heifer barn. And they've got the young ones here. With the little feed rail. And then they go into mini headlockers. And they're just constantly shuffled down as they get older. To bigger headlockers and bigger freestalls. You can see their mini freestalls there. These are young heifers in training. He was a pretty smart guy. That's the parlor barn right there. And throughout their yard, they have calf hutches. So these are your standard calf hutch. They got a little pen out in front so the calf can walk around. It's pretty cool. They spread lime on the ground. It's a pretty thick layer. They put the calf hutch on there after it's been fully disinfected from the previous calf living in it. And then they will get rid of the calf when they're done and wean from milk. They'll go to group housing. And then once the calf has left, you know, it's spent the three months here or whatever, they'll scrape all of this material away. Put new material down. A disinfected hutch. Disinfected fence. Buckets. Everything's cleaned. That's how they're achieving a real sterile environment for these calves to start life. And it's super important you keep these calves as healthy as possible. They're just going to grow that much quicker and become milking cows sooner. be lucky. So that's the end of the tour. Thank you guys very much for your time and showing us your awesome farm. No, no worries. Awesome. Hopefully Canadians like it. I'm sure they will.
