 I'm here with Philip, one of the growers for the Jersey Royal Company, and this is probably one of the first fields you're harvesting mechanically, so how's the crop looking at the moment? It's not too bad, it's been affected from the the frost earlier in the in the season, but as you can see the potatoes are now getting a little bit larger, so we're able to, we finished all of our first early slopes and we've been able to start with the potato harvester yesterday, and it's slow progress but we're we're making headway. Yeah, I mean you say you've been affected by the frost, that's knocked the crop back two three weeks, but now we've got a bit of sun, is that helping? Yeah it's helping a lot, yeah I say this field we would expect it to have lifted about three weeks ago, but the good weather just after Easter, that helped them size up a little bit. One of the effects of the frost is you get more tuber numbers, so it takes a little bit longer for them to get to the right size, but now with the forecast in the coming week the crop's really going to come on and we'll have good volumes I think going forward. But yields will they be a little bit lower? We started at the start of the season they've been you know 25 to 30 percent lower than we would have expected, but I say if we can have this the warm weather over the next weekend the years will get back to where we want to be, so I say going forward we're going to have plenty potatoes next week.
