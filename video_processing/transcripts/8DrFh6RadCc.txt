 Music Hello I'm John Ramsey. My wife and I own Ramsey Agriculture which is a farming business which has a couple of farms in Tasmania, one at Bothwell and one at Bridport. And we are looking for a cropping manager. At Bothwell we have about 550 hectares of irrigation, a mix of pivots and linears which under that we grow around 80 hectares of potatoes this year and about 80 hectares of poppies. We've increased the productivity of Ratho a lot in the last 20 years through irrigation. We'll finish at Bothwell around about 10 or 11 thousand lambs a year under our irrigation fodder system. In the job ad we talk it's a bit of a cropping manager, cropping operations role because we can be flexible. I can sort of step into the role to help out if need be in a trainee position or if someone's fully qualified and experienced I can step out and find some other things for me to do. So currently I have Ryan in the role, good young fellow, unfortunately he's leaving to head to the mainland for greener part. There's a bit of a change. I've been at Ramsey Ag since 2014. As a young 20 year old I came here. So I've been here nearly seven years now. What I like about Ramsey agriculture is that you have the real career path you have and the progression you can do to learn and to develop as a person. Each day is different, very diverse in what we do, always looking to improve, very progressive in what we do, always looking for a different crop or a different way to do things. So I'd recommend the job to someone. It's a very good career pathway, very supportive atmosphere, always learning. What we're really looking for is someone with the right attitude. So we've got someone who's hard working, someone who's willing to learn and willing to do the best they can. The role entails a lot of planning, a lot of organisation. So we need to make sure that we've got spare points for the cultivator or the irrigators have got parts so if something breaks down we can fix it. Ideally we'd like someone with a fair bit of tractor experience. There's a fair bit of spraying involved in the role. We really need to make sure that's done well and obviously the more experience you have in that the better but we're still happy to train someone up into that over time. The role has two people that sort of report to it. So we've got two other farm hands in that role and they're both great guys and very capable. There's a nice three bedroom house involved as part of the job. Toyota Hilux Symbol Cab Ud available as part of the package currently. Some experience in crop growing would be terrific. We've got lots of irrigation and any irrigation experience with pivots and pumps and that sort of thing and linears would be very worthwhile. But probably most of all some management experience or willing to become a manager. This is a step up from just doing the work. We really want someone who can take on the management of the cropping side of the business and that's something that is integral to this part of the job. Both Hall, yeah lovely community. We love it here. Good school, great people, lots of things to see and do. I play golf. Shooting's a big thing in Both Hall. There's a lot of deer shooting. Doctor surgery, pharmacist, good pub if you like a beer. Yeah good takeaways too. So yeah plenty of things to see in Both Hall. Another good thing is we're only an hour from Hobart so if you need your fix they're the big city. But we love farming and we love what we do and we really try to foster a good team environment here at Ramsey Ag. Looking forward to finding someone else who fits in and enjoys farming as much as we do. With the head just organic toces, like most volcanoes, fish. Look 초�月, you will be around you, its materials. hundreds of other Wertschets, there will be people around doing the physical activity. His small hotel music may share everything he wants in, but we're all out as much as possible. Here's a great guy who武士 the Dullo Wheatset provide about TECH by this job with a possibility. So yeah it's great. Wow, thank you guys everyone.
