Howto & Style
 Here are four top tips to grow tomatoes indoors. Use an electric toothbrush to buzz the plants. Inside, there are no insects like bees or natural wind to pollinate the flowers, so this must be done manually or the plants will flower, but no fruit will form. Grow the right variety of tomato. Standard tomatoes are too big. Small types like micro tomatoes that grow less than a foot high are best for window sills and small areas. Use a good potting mix that has fertilizer added that holds nutrients well and is free draining so the roots don't get waterlogged. And finally, you'll need an artificial light to compensate for the lack of sunlight indoors. Make sure it's powerful enough to give the tomatoes the energy they need and adjustable to follow the plants up from seedlings to full size. Make sure you wash your toothbrush before you brush your teeth.
