 So one of our chickens died today from our Langhen flock and I want to show you all how we compost chickens. It's really simple and this is the perfect opportunity to honor this chicken that's spent in a lifeline eggs to nourish me, my family and others. And really all you need is an active compost pile. Dig a hole in the middle and you're just going to drop the chicken in the middle and bury it. Despite what you may hear on the internet, y'all, you can compost anything. The microbes will completely break her down and turn her into garden soil. That will one day give us more food. And that's the beauty of the circle of life.
