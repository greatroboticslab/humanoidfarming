Education
 Good afternoon. Thanks for coming out on a Friday afternoon. This is our first time to do a Friday afternoon event, so it's nice to know there are still people who care about nutrition and biofortification, even if it's a Friday afternoon. So it is really my honor to welcome Howdy, or how earth is his full name, but we'll call him Howdy Buis. He was awarded the 2016 World Food Prize. If you're unfamiliar with the World Food Prize, it's really known as like the Nobel Prize, like the Nobel Peace Prize for agriculture and nutrition. And it recognizes individuals who have improved the quality, the quantity, and or availability of food in the world. And in this room, actually, about a year and a half ago, we had MS Swaminathan doing a similar talk as what we're having today. He was the first World Food Prize winner back in 1987. So we've now declared this the World Food Prize winner room. And we hope in the future that we'll continue to have World Food Prize winners here to have conversations with us. So Howdy was awarded this prize last year alongside his colleagues from the International Potato Center for their pioneering work on biofortification, which just means enriching staple food crops with micronutrients. Their work on the sweet potato has improved the health of over 15 million and over 15 million people by reducing what's called hidden hunger, which I'm sure Howdy will tell us more about. Several hundred million people in the future will potentially benefit from his research. Howdy recognized early on in his career that what mattered was not just how many calories people get, but what kind of nutritional value was contained in that food. So he created this concept of biofortification back in the early 1990s, and he's devoted his life to turning that idea into really what's become a global movement that currently reaches, again, more than 15 million smallholder farmer families in low income countries. Howdy is the founding director of the Harvest Plus program. That is a joint venture created by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture and the International Food Policy Research Institute. At Harvest Plus, he led an interdisciplinary global effort to breed and disseminate micronutrient-rich staple crop foods to really reduce hidden hunger among malnourished populations. We are so honored to have you here. Howdy, and we look forward to your presentation. Okay, well, thank you all for coming on a Friday afternoon. I'm a student and I stepped down as Harvest Plus director last October and I moved to the Philippines and I'm still working part-time for Harvest Plus being based in the Philippines. But I'm here on a three-week visit and it's great that I can, we can work this out, that I can speak at CSIS. I'm going to, I'm not going to speak at length and I'm going to keep this fairly informal. And I'm going to try to tell a little bit of my story of how biofortification evolved. So, let's see, this right there, there we go, got the right one. So I, I'll very quickly go through the first, the first 20 years of the story. I joined IFPRI as a post-doc and I worked in the food consumption and nutrition division. This is back in 1982. And my job was to look at how economic factors such as household incomes and food prices affected diets and nutritional status and health outcomes. And back in 1982, the barometer for better nutrition was calories. Full stop. So how does, how does energy intake improve when income goes up? How does it, when food prices go up, how does energy intake go down? So over the next 10 years, to make a long story short, I convinced myself that calories were the wrong barometer. So we did, we did household surveys and, you know, collected data on, on, you know, diets, food intakes. We measured anthropometry. And every time I looked at a data set, all those outcomes were related not to calories but to dietary quality. And I actually found that poor people and rich people ate the same amount of food staples, which is the main source of calories in the diet. And really what differed between low income households and high income households in terms of their diets was all the non-staple food intake. Low people, low income people couldn't afford those things and high income people could. And that's what happened at the margin. And that's why people in high income groups were healthier. And I think what, what really amazed me was that when I, when I published that finding and I, I worked closely with Lawrence Haddad, who's now the executive director of GAIN, was the, was the resistance in the, in the, by economists in the literature to that idea. I thought it was, I thought, I thought it was very clear and, and the reasons were very clear from the data, but there were, there was a lot of resistance. And that, that was very disappointing to me. So that, so because I was working in this area, I was attending nutrition conferences and interacting a lot with nutritionists. And it was at that time that they discovered that the vitamin A supplements had reduced on average child mortality. among preschoolers by an average of 23%. And the, at that time, the nutrition community was quite astonished that the, that that number was 23%. They had no idea that giving children vitamin A supplements would reduce mortality by that amount. And they got very interested in, you know, then in iron deficiency and zinc deficiency and iodine deficiency. And the, and the nutrition community really, really shifted about that time. They said protein energy malnutrition isn't what it's all about. It's about mineral and vitamin deficiencies. So for example, children who suffered from iron deficiency, their cognitive abilities were compromised. It couldn't be reversed. Children who didn't get enough zinc in their diet, they had higher levels of morbidity. They were stunted because of the zinc. And I've already, I've already talked about the mortality associated with vitamin A deficiency. So at the time, the, the nutrition community, they were just getting into supplementation. They were just getting into food fortification. And they were, they were quite, they were quite optimistic that they could do a lot to reduce those deficiencies through supplementation, through fortification. But it was in 1993, we, I got a grant, we got a grant from USAID to look into what the CG system, the, the group of agricultural research centers, what we could do to help in the fight against mineral and vitamin deficiencies. I think at the time we got the grant, they were thinking that maybe the activities of the, of the World Fish Center and the, and our vegetable center in Taiwan, they would, they would be more, we would need to give them more prominence and maybe less prominence to the, to the, uh, uh, International Rice Research Institute or CIMIT in Mexico that worked on wheat and maize. And, but it struck me that, uh, when we had the green revolution, all of the, the modern varieties of rice and wheat had taken over production and consumption. And that our varieties were, were being consumed three times a day everywhere across South Asia. And I said, well, what if we can, what if we can get the plants to do the work? What if, what if we had bred more iron? What if we had bred more zinc and, and increased the content through ag, through agriculture research? Wow, wouldn't that be, wouldn't that be more efficient, uh, and very sustainable? I'm trained as an economist and I'm always, you know, I'm always looking for efficiencies. So, um, so I ran around, but I didn't know whether it was scientifically feasible. So I, in 1993 when I got the grant, so that's the, that's the first 10 years. Now we'll get into the second 10 years. Um, so I went around to our, this is a map of the different centers, uh, what they were called and where they were located back in 1995 or so. And I talked to the plant scientists and I said, can we do this? Can we breed for higher mineral and vitamin deficiency? And, and time and time again, I was told, you know, this is a really bad idea. Um, the first reason it's a bad idea, well, is that we're breeding for yield, we're breeding for pest resistance, disease resistance. We don't need the extra work of trying to also worry about the, the nutritional content of the crops. That means we need a bigger program to still achieve yield gains and, and, um, and add minerals and vitamins to the crops. Um, I knew I could get around that if I gave them money because, uh, then, then we could, they could have their bigger breeding programs and, and breed for more characteristics. But I couldn't get around the second objection and they said the, you'll probably get a trade-off in yield. You'll, you'll breed for higher nutrient content in the seed and you'll get a lower yield. Probably. That was the general opinion. So I, because every, I was getting told the same story at center after center, I said, well, I can't get around that. Cause farmers are not going to adopt lower yielding crops. So I made a final visit to the, a laboratory, USDA ARS laboratory at Cornell called the Plant Soil and Nutrition Laboratory. And they'd been commissioned in the 1930s to look at the relationship between minerals and soils and plants, animals and humans. And I thought, well, if anywhere, you know, these would be the experts that I could ask about this. And, uh, I gave a seminar and fortunately, uh, Ross Welch, who was a scientist there, a soil scientist by training, he stood up at the end and I was expecting to get the same response, but he stood up and he said, you know, our research has shown that when you load more zinc into a seed, the seed needs the zinc for its own nutrition. It's more vigorous, it's more viable and you get a higher yield. I said, you get a higher yield. So, uh, you know, I said, well, that it's a win-win. You can improve agricultural productivity. You can improve human nutrition. So that turned the whole thing around. So then I got, I got my first lesson in interdisciplinary communication. I went to our centers and I said, it's a win-win. And I'm an economist and I was telling plant scientists about plant science and they, I had no credibility whatsoever. So Ross worked closely with a colleague at the University of Adelaide, Robin Graham, and, and he and Robin had, you know, a good standing in the international community. And they went around and I had them go around. And so we, we convinced some people, some scientists that this was something that was scientifically feasible and worthwhile doing. But again, to, to make a long story short, we couldn't get funding to, to implement the idea. It took 10 years to get funding from 1993 to 2003. We got a little bit of funding from the Danish aid agency because there was one person that thought this was a good idea. And he could give us $350,000 a year without having any signature of anybody else higher up. So we could do a little bit. But you go to the agricultural donors and they said it was a time of declining funding for agriculture research. You know, they didn't want to get into new things. And when we went to nutrition donors, they said, no, we don't, we don't fund agricultural research. That's not what we do. And so we just couldn't get anything started until 2003 when we got, we got a grant from the Gates Foundation, $25 million over four years. They were just getting started. They didn't have an agricultural division. They only had a health division, but they were willing to, to take the risk. And so we got started. That was the, that was the 20 years, well, it was 10 years from the, from the initial visits to the centers that we finally got the funding. And that's how Harvest, Harvest Plus got started. So I keep. So what is, let me explain a little bit about what biofortification is. So this is a picture of an orange maize in the middle that's high in pro vitamin A. The white maize is what Africans strongly prefer. Maize is the most widely consumed food staple in Africa. The simple idea is, is that we now have these orange maizes that are in high yielding backgrounds. They're just as high yielding as the white maize. So the value proposition to the mothers in Africa is, if you'll buy and consume the orange maize for the same price, substitute it one for one for the white maize, you'll protect your family from vitamin A deficiency. So what do the mothers say when they get that information? Well, their first question is, how does it taste? And so we do the blind taste test and they always get it, you know, this is the white maize and this is the orange maize. It tastes differently. But they like, fortunately, they like the taste of the orange maize. So once they like the taste and they have this information, they switch. So it's, it's really, it's really just as simple as that. We just need to take all the white maize in Africa and switch it over to orange maize. And so of course we, I mean, it's a long story about how you go through that process. But that's, in essence, that's what the idea is. We had some, we had some orange mazes that were not in high yielding backgrounds and we crossed them with the, with the white mazes that were in high yielding backgrounds. And it took 10 years, but over time you develop, you can develop the varieties. And there's a lot of science behind it. And I, I'm not going to go into, not going to go into the science. So that's an essence what, what biofortification is. But what's the, what's the justification? Well, the justification is, is that it's very cost effective in a very sustainable way. And this, this is, this is a slide from, from UNICEF recently that they have now given in the last 20 years now, they've given out 8 billion vitamin A capsules. So, and they, and they have, it's a very good investment. They, and they've saved according to the, you know, the, the slide, they've saved 4 million lives with, by giving away the 8 billion vitamin A capsules. But you have, you have a, you have a recurrent cost. And it's about a dollar per capsule when you count the network of people that are distributing the capsules. And so you have the same cost year after year after year. You have a recurrent cost. And so over that 20 year period, 8 billion dollars has been spent on vitamin A capsules. So the, the thing about agriculture research is you do the research at a central location. You develop the varieties, the seeds, and then you make them available to country after country. They're adapted to growing conditions. They're made available to farmers. They don't cost any more for the farmers to grow than the non-bio fortified varieties. You use the same practices. So you don't have the recurrent costs. Your, your costs are up front in terms of doing the research, developing the varieties. But once they're out in the food system, you don't, you don't have these recurrent costs. So for example, what I'm going to talk about, about all the activities that Harvest Plus has undertaken from 2003 to 2016, we've spent 300 million dollars. And that's compared to, say, this figure of 8 billion dollars that's been spent on vitamin A capsules. And of course that doesn't count iron fortification and, you know, zinc supplements, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So that's, that's, in essence, that's the justification for pursuing biofortification, cost effectiveness and sustainability. So when we, so will biofortification work? Does biofort, does biofortification work? Well, when we started there, there are three fundamental questions that we had to answer. Can we breed these varieties in high yielding backgrounds and add sufficient nutrients to have a nutritional impact? Those are the, the first two questions. Well, these are the 12 main crops that we've worked on. And you can see from the slide that 150 varieties across, it's actually 14 crops now that, that we've worked on, have been released in 30 countries. And the only way they can be released is if they go through varietal, testing by varietal release committees in the countries. And to be released, you have to show that you're just as profitable, just as high yielding as, as current varieties. So we, we've answered that question really with, with a resounding yes. And you can see, you can't see the detail here, but any country colored in dark green or light green is, either a country where biofortified crops have been released or where they will be released in the next three or four years. And so now we have that number has gotten up to 60 countries around the world. So you can see that it's, it's already a global program. And you know, our challenge now is to scale up. The second question was the, was the nutrition question. If we, under controlled conditions, if we feed the biofortified crops as an intervention group and compare it with a control group, can we, can we demonstrate nutritional efficacy that the iron status or the zinc status or the vitamin A status improves when the intervention group consumes the biofortified crops? Our very first study was done in the Philippines with a high iron rice. It actually was initiated before Harvest Plus got started. And we needed, because the increment at the time, the increment in the iron was so small, we needed, we needed our intervention group to consume the high iron rice three times a day for nine months. And we needed, we needed a lot of compliance day in and day out. And so we hit upon this idea. We found that the iron deficiency levels actually of the religious sisters in the convents, there, there was a fairly high level of iron deficiency. And, and after consuming nine months and, and other religious sisters were eating the non-biofortified rice, we were able to show an improvement in their iron status. So we've done it with the vitamin A crops, with the iron crops, with the zinc crops. And we've been able to demonstrate improved functional outcomes. So the, the cognitive abilities, um, of children in India who eat high iron pearl millet are improved compared with the children who ate the regular pearl millet. Uh, women in Rwanda, their work performance improved, uh, when they ate the high iron beans. Uh, the vitamin A, uh, maize, the adaptation to darkness improved in children who, who ate the pro vitamin A maize. And now we've shown that women and children in India who ate the high zinc wheat, that their morbidity levels, such as fever, were lower, uh, as compared with eating the regular wheat. So we've, we've done the nutrition study. We've commissioned 14 efficacy trials. We've published them in the literature. And we've demonstrated, and we've convinced the nutrition community that it's an efficacious, uh, intervention. So, um, Um, I knew that, uh, talk a little bit about the orange sweet potato. I knew that, uh, when we started breeding in 2003, I knew that it was going to take 10 years before we had the first varieties released in countries. And I knew it was going to be very difficult for the donors to sustain interest if we didn't have any stories about, uh, about delivery and all the questions about delivery. So already orange sweet potatoes were available in Africa. And I got a, I got a separate grant to do a pilot study, uh, in Uganda and Mozambique. And, uh, the person who led the, the team that did that, Anna Marie Ball, is here. And, uh, the long and the short of it is, is that we, we, uh, we carefully studied. We did pilot interventions in areas where white sweet potato was grown. We had intervention villages where we introduced the orange sweet potato. We had control villages where we did nothing. We did baseline surveys. We did follow-up surveys in both countries. And the long and the short of it was that, uh, we showed an, uh, a huge improvement in vitamin A intakes. The orange sweet potato was adopted. It was eaten. And we showed an improvement in, uh, serum retinol and a reduction in diarrhea eventually. So that, that was a huge boost. Those, when those studies were published, that was a huge boost for, for the effort on biofortification. Because, uh, we showed that it would work in a, in a real life situation. And that, that was all actually published before 2013, 2014, when the pipeline of all the other biofortified crops, uh, was starting to happen. So we've been, we've been working on, uh, uh, getting the, uh, uh, getting started on, uh, scaling up the biofortified crops. That's the third, that's the third issue. Can we show a public health impact? Can we get farmers to adopt a high percentage of farmers in any given country to adopt? And can we show a public health impact? So we chose eight target countries, uh, obviously for different crops for different countries. Um, and we started scaling up. Uh, in those eight countries, now we've, um, uh, we've reached about, our, our most recent number now is 26 million people in farm households that are growing and consuming the biofortified crops. But our, our big challenge now, I've mentioned 30 countries and eventually 60 countries. So our, our big challenge is now, how do we make that happen as a, as a global phenomenon and just, not just in those eight target countries. So, um, this is, uh, a picture of, of orange maize marketing there. It's already being, uh, marketed in grocery stores in, in Lusaka and Zambia. And, and you can see the milling company, uh, is already advertising the orange bags on the side of its, uh, delivery trucks. Uh, this is all by way of saying that our challenge now is to get a number of types of institutions to mainstream use of biofortified crops in their everyday activities. Uh, so we're getting our CG centers, not just to now have side breeding programs for biofortified crops, but to mainstream biofortification in their main breeding programs. so that everything that's coming out of our centers is bio-fortified. And the managements of the centers now accept that they need to do this, they want to do this, and we're seeking funding to do that. We need to get private seed companies where we have hybrid varieties of maize and hybrid varieties of pearl millet. We're getting private seed companies to start developing their own varieties and marketing their own varieties. And we have also with the private sector, you can see that we have the milling companies and the food processing companies. We're starting to get them involved in developing their own products and marketing their own bio-fortified products. We have to get multilateral financial institutions involved in promoting bio-fortified crops. Now the World Bank and its loans to countries in Africa is including funds for the scale-up of bio-fortified crops. The World Food Program, in their Purchase for Progress, they're now, they want to purchase locally and store locally. So for example, in Rwanda, they're buying high iron beans now instead of the regular beans and storing the high iron beans in their warehouses. We have an effort in Codex to develop a definition and standards for bio-fortified crops. And finally, we're getting international NGOs to incorporate bio-fortified crops in their agricultural programs as a way to link their agricultural programs to their nutrition and health programs. And our most developed partnership is with World Vision, and now World Vision has introduced bio-fortification in its programs in 17 countries around the world. So our vision is that by 2030, a billion people will be eating and consuming bio-fortified crops. So that's where we want to go. We've identified 30 target countries, and if we can capture 20 to 25 percent of the supply in those countries, we will have reached a billion people. So thank you. Happy to answer questions. Thank you. My first question is what's going on in that picture before that picture goes away. No, I'm serious. What's happening there? So this fellow down here is Paul Ilona. He's our country manager in Nigeria, and he's full of ideas, and he decided it would be a good idea if I was made chief in one of the villages where the pro-vitamin A cassava had been introduced. And he told me, he met me at the hotel in the morning. He didn't tell me what was going to happen. So I was ready to go, and he said, here, here are your robes. Put these robes on. I'll come back in 10 minutes, and we'll go to the village. So I did, and then we went through this ceremony, and they eventually put these leaves and the whole thing. Fantastic. It was quite a day. Well, we're going to do something a little bit different. We're going to have a musical interlude. Harvest Plus, along with others, you use a variety of tools to do behavior change. And this is a video in Rwanda, actually. It's a rap video on beans, and I think it's really fun and interesting. So I want us to watch it. Sorry, we can't see it. Yeah, it looks great. I've seen it before. Yeah. I've seen it before. Yeah. I'm here without beans and Rwanda. It's just like, I'm here without food. Okay. Okay. Bumimini. Just to show, yeah, it deserves applause. I think it's a great example of how eating beans can be cooked, right? Yeah. I'm just saying if you want to go download that from the Harvest Plus website and put it in your music list. Yeah, there you go. Well, I want to start, Howdy, with some personal questions. And one is, you know, you talked about in your remarks the resistance that you had at the beginning and how people told you this was a bad idea. You also mentioned several times how long it took to get where you are today. And now, I mean, wow, 26 million people that are benefiting from your research. And the thought of reaching 1 billion by 2030, it's so impressive. So my question to you is, what kept you going? You know, research is not easy. Trying to build this global momentum is not easy. And so what sort of inspired you to keep going? Well, I think in the first instance, you know, when you work in this area, you want to have some impact. You want to do some good. You want to do some good. And so I published articles for the first 10 years. And I told myself that indirectly I was influencing people's ideas and, you know, that would influence policies. But I couldn't really, you know, see the direct connection that much. And so when I hit upon this, you know, when I saw this idea and I found out it was feasible, I said, of course, if we can make this happen, that's going to be much more important than I publish, you know, a few more papers along the line. So I think it was the power of the idea and the impact that we had. That was the first thing. But still, you know, you can, for that first 10 years when we couldn't get the funding, you get discouraged at different times. And there were a couple of times when I said, okay, nice try, nice idea, but nobody's going to fund it. So at one point I convinced myself that, you know, okay, I'm going to stop. And I went to see this movie. It was called The Dish. And it was a movie about the NASA space program. And the dish was a radio antenna that was based in Australia. And the signal went from the moon down to Australia. And then it was broadcast around the world. And so it was, you know, it was a moment where the world kind of stood still and marveled at what we'd accomplished as mankind. And it was scientists, not just from the U.S., but all around the world that worked on this effort. And it was, you know, it just showed the power of science and what scientists could do and people working together. And I knew that was what biofortification was. Scientists, different disciplines, different organizations all over the world working together. And to me that was really powerful. And I said, okay, we'll keep trying. Yeah. Well, so you've brought up funding a few times. And so, you know, it took you 10 years to get funding at some point. But right now, as I'm sure you're aware, Harvest Plus is one of eight finalists for a $100 million grant from the MacArthur Foundation. And so, you know, you won't know for some time whether you're the finalist. But my question is, if and when Harvest Plus gets the grant, what would they do with that money? And is that still enough to be able to get you to scale to where you want to be to reach $1 billion? Right. Well, what we would do with the money, the funding, the proposal and the funding would be focused on Africa. It would be devoted to the scale up of crops in Africa and all the different things that it would take to, like, for example, the orange maize. I have a vision that, say, 30 years from now, a granddaughter would say, ask her grandmother, did there used to be white maize? And the grandmother would say, yes, when I was a child, it was mostly white maize. And carrots used to be white, and we've forgotten that. And now we only think of carrots as orange. Right. So that, it's money toward that vision that the MacArthur grant. It's not the total amount of money that we need, but it would leverage so many other funds that we'd be able to get. And I think we'd really be there once we got that grant and how we could leverage that for activities even outside of Africa. Right. I think that would be really key. So you brought up orange maize. Right. I keep this in my office, of course, from your staff. And we actually, Peg, from Harvest Plus, brought one, and we're going to pass it around. So if you've never held a biofortified orange maize, you get to. You know, one question about this. It's very exciting, right? No, I think it is, actually. But one thing about this, you know, you kind of alluded to this, like, do they still want to eat it if it's a different color? So have you run into sort of some cultural roadblocks with other crops as well that people say, I don't want to eat a carrot if it's purple or eat a banana if it's orange? Well, it's all about giving people information. So if you just put it out there in the market and you don't give information, it just seems like a strange color and nothing's going to happen to it. So you have to give the mothers or whoever is purchasing the information of why it's changed in color. And all of our studies and all of our experiences have shown that once you explain the change in color, they easily accept it. Yeah. They easily. Now, the iron and the zinc, it has to be a different strategy for the iron and the zinc because it's invisible to the consumer. The levels, while they're important from a nutritional point of view, they don't affect the taste, they don't affect the color. So you don't know that it's there. So the strategy is to capture 80 to 90 percent of the total supply eventually. So whenever you go to the market, no matter what you buy, it's going to be mostly biofortified products. So my analogy is like putting fluoride in the water system. You tell people that it's out there, but they're not that conscious of it when they're in the market purchasing the varieties. Yeah. So in about a week or so, there's going to be a new World Food Prize announcement this year at USDA instead of State Department. You know, my question, additional question is, what advice would you give to the new World Food Prize winner when he or she or they are announced? Because I'm curious of, you know, since this happened, did winning the World Food Prize change much for you? Did it change your work, your research, your life? And if you had to go back and look back at the last year, any advice you'd give to future winners? Okay. Well, I think, you know, the main impact or the main importance of receiving the prize is that it gave a, for advocacy for biofortification, it just gave us, you know, more visibility, more credibility. It's one of those boosts that we need to have as you go along. It's like a rocket booster or something. It's just, it just helps things quite a bit. I, it hasn't, I don't know what advice other than just enjoy, enjoy the, you're asked to speak more often than you were before. But, you know, a lot of what I feel like I've done is just repeat myself for the last 20, 25 years. It's just the same repeating, repeating, repeating. And then, and I see people in the audience that have heard me say the same things for, you know, five, six, seven, eight, nine times. Mm-hmm. But then there's always people in the audience that just haven't heard any of this before. Maybe you're, we're curious what, what biofortification meant. Yeah. And so, yeah. Well, let's go there because I think a lot of people, obviously there's a lot of misconceptions around biotechnology overall. Yeah. So, talk to us about some of the biggest misconceptions you've seen on biotechnology. And then, of course, you know which direction I'm going to go, which is GMO. Right. You know, is your technology GMO? And if not, why not? And what do you see in terms of biotechnology for the future? Yeah. So, my, I guess the first point is, is that I personally feel that, I call them transgenics. I like the word transgenics more than GMOs. I think transgenics are perfectly safe. All the national academies of science around the world have put out statements that say the evidence shows that they're, that they're, they're just as safe as conventionally bred crops. However, I was, I've been a member of something called the Golden Rice Humanitarian Board ever since 2000. You know, you know, a few years before Harvest Plus got started. And I saw all of the roadblocks, rules, and regulations that were, that have been put in front of transgenics that have really blocked the development, slowed the development and release of golden rice. Mm-hmm. So, I, you know, I've related in my talk all of the barriers and skepticism about even conventionally bred biofortification back in the 1990s. And I said, if I have to, if I have to get past all those barriers and get past the fear of transgenics, I don't need that. It's going to be hard enough to prove that conventionally bred crops, that biofortification works with conventionally bred crops. So, I did, I made a decision that we would, we would focus on conventionally bred crops. So, all those countries in green, all those crops, 150 varieties released, our breeding pipeline is completely 100% conventional breeding. But at the same time, there are some nutrients for some crops where conventional breeding can't get us to an increment that will have a public health impact. So, for example, putting, we can't put enough more iron in rice, really, to have a significant public health impact. So, we invested in upstream research on iron, putting more iron in rice and wheat and maize. And we now have transgenic varieties where the level, for rice, for example, they've been tested in the Philippines. They've been tested in, in Colombia. Same results. The increment in iron is at the level, our target level, that would provide a public health impact. Now, we have conventionally bred high zinc rice. It's already being grown by several hundred thousand families in Bangladesh. The same transgenic variety that's high enough in iron has a much level, higher level of zinc than the conventionally bred zinc that's already released in Bangladesh. So, this is by far our best product. If we could, if we could get a high iron, high zinc transgenic rice widely eaten, we could, we could practically wipe out iron and zinc deficiency with that one crop. So, so we'll see if we can get the funding to, to bring that to farmers. We're not sure yet whether we'll be able to secure the funding for that. What's the latest and greatest in terms of any new biofortified crops on the horizons or when you look for 10 or 20 years, what do you see as kind of the next big thing in biofortification? Well, the transgenics would be the first thing because you can, you can more easily add multiple nutrients much more quickly with transgenics. I think the, the, our breeding pipelines, the way breeding works, you, you reach a certain increment level in high yielding backgrounds, but then you have a second wave and you have a third wave and fourth wave. And each wave, as it becomes available, the nutrient level is higher than the first wave. So it's just, it's something that's just going to improve over time. We're going to have higher and higher impact. We're going to be scaled up in more countries and our, our, our, the depth of our scale up is going to be deeper and deeper. And so it's, it's a relatively slow process, but it's, it has a huge impact in the end and it's very sustainable. Yeah. You know, it seems like you, when you talked about what inspired you to keep doing this and what it, you predominantly focus on the poor and the vulnerable and developing country. And as you, developing countries, and as you know, of course, the sustainable development goals is saying that we hope to eradicate hunger. And of course, biotechnology and biofortification is part of that tool. But I'm just curious, your optimism, do you think it's really possible for us to eradicate hunger? Okay. So when you say hunger, hunger, usually the, it's a terminology thing. It's there's, there's hunger and there's hidden hunger. Yeah. Yes. I mean, I think we've virtually, except for some famines now, we virtually eliminated calorie deficiencies, hunger. Sure. Um, with the, with the mineral and vitamin deficiencies, um, it's a matter of, as people's incomes improve, they'll get the diet, they'll be able to afford the diets that they need. There are other things that we can do to improve productivity of, of the vegetables and fruits and animal products. One of the, one of the ideas that I wasn't able, I didn't have time to develop, is that because of the green revolution, the productivity increases in rice, wheat, and maize, actually those prices are lower today than they were in 1970. Okay. But we haven't had productivity increases for the vegetables and the fruits and the animal products. And those prices, after controlling for inflation, those prices are two or three times as expensive today as they were in the 1970s. And so if your income hasn't gone up, it's harder and harder for you to be able to afford. But it's, the, the science is there. If we invest, if we invest in the science and we invest in, in improving agricultural productivity, even, even with climate change, we can develop climate smart crops. We can develop bio fortified climate smart crops. Right. And we can, we can, you know, we can solve the problem. Right. But it's, it's a matter of the commitment to invest the levels of funding that are required and not, and not to, you know, not have this variation where it's politically, oh, this is something we're going to invest in this year. And then five years later, the investments go away and then food prices go up and you come back with the, back with the investments. I, I liken it to education, your, your child's education. So everybody knows that they're going to, for 20 years now, you're going to invest in your child's education. You're not going to say, oh, we're going to, we're going to stop my child going to school for a couple of years and then, you know, get enthusiastic about the idea again later on. No, it's just something that you know is worthwhile. You know, it's going to have a great impact on your child's life and it's a no brainer and everybody just does it. And that's exactly what agricultural research is. It has a huge payoff. It's a no brainer. Let's turn to the audience. Raise your hand if you have a question or comment. We'll come around with microphones. You should use the microphone because we always have a large audience with our live webcast. Let's start up here right up to the front. The young woman on this side and then another, another microphone over here to Tom in the front row. Please stand up and let us know your name and where you're coming from. Sure. Hi. Thank you for being here today. My name is Kelsey Fagoni and I'm from a small nonprofit here in DC called Pixera Global. And a lot of what we do is bring tri-sector partners together. And recently we just had a conference focused on solvable problems and bringing the public, private, social sectors together to talk about those. And one of them was post-harvest loss. And it seems like you've had to bring many, many stakeholders together worldwide, centers, academics, farmers. You're trained as an economist. How on earth did you approach and get the buy-in from all of those stakeholders? I mean, clearly it took you a long time. But what was your approach? Great. Let's take Tom's question and then we'll let you answer. Go ahead, Tom. Thank you, Kimberly. I really enjoyed this presentation and although I've heard you speak many times, howdy, I always learn something new. It was a pleasure to listen to you. I'm glad you brought up the idea of trying to get all of the CGIARs to incorporate biofortification. Right now in Kenya, CIMIT is trying to scale out in seven countries or eight countries, I believe, in eastern and southern Africa. Drought resistant maize, I'm sure you're aware of it. Monsanto previously had the water-efficient maize for Africa project that's now at the African Agricultural Technology Institute in Nairobi. I was wondering if you could speak about Harvest Plus efforts to work with Monsanto and the WEMA project and CIMIT and their efforts to scale out because of climate change. Thank you. Great. You can go ahead and answer those. Okay. So the broad buy-in from stakeholders, I think the key to it is that everybody has the, they hold the same vision. Everybody knows where we want to be, what we want to achieve. And then each one of the stakeholders realizes that they have a role to play. And if they don't play their role, you know, nobody's going to achieve their vision. So that's the, that's the first thing to get people excited about the vision. And once you've shown that biofortification can work, then it's pretty easy to get people excited about the vision. And then, of course, you need, you need funding. You need, you have to, you have to have a way of people being able to spend time and resources on it. So that's, that's always a key thing. On the, on the, on the climate smart crops, and, and the public research and the private research, absolutely the whole idea of biofortification is simply to piggyback on the best varieties that are coming out. We, we have, for example, 26 million people now. It's not anywhere where we want to be in the future, but we now, they're growing biofortified crops. If we don't do anything else, those, those biofortified crops are going to disappear. Because better, higher yielding, more climate smart varieties will be introduced 10 years from now, 15 years from now. So those also have to be biofortified and replace the existing biofortified crops. And that has to happen both in the public sector and also in the private sector. If it's, if it's hybrids, I've mentioned it's the private seed companies that are going to be coming out with the, with the best, most profitable varieties. So we have to create the demand among consumers for the biofortified and also government officials. And so there's the demand. And once the demand is there, the private seed companies will, will just gravitate to developing biofortified products. Some of the crops, such as sweet potato, cassava, they're vegetatively propagated. And that's going to be public agricultural research for the foreseeable future. So we need to, we need to get our centers and the national agriculture research centers just to exclusively work on biofortified varieties and not, and not release non-biofortified varieties. That's where we need to be. Excellent. I'll take some more questions. The woman in the front here. Hi, my name is Natalie Kronobush and I'm with Dexus Consulting Group, which is a USAID contractor. And I wanted to ask whether you guys have had any challenges with micronutrient absorption. So with like an iron supplement, you might typically have vitamin C added in there to prompt more absorption. I wonder if you have any issues with that, with these biofortified products. Great question. Dan? Yeah. Hi. Hi, my name is Dan Silverstein. I'm a private sector strategic advisor. And from the quick look on the map slide that you had, it looked like most of the countries, you said there were 60 countries, it looked to me like most of them were south countries. Is there some reason why we don't see China, Russia, Mongolia, Central Asia, which are clearly have the need and the capacity for the production? Great. Go ahead, Andy. Okay. On the absorption, there was huge skepticism in the 1990s among the nutrition community. What would be the percent absorbed? And some experts, for example, for iron, some experts would say it would only be two or three percent absorption. And other experts would say it would be much higher. And I guess the long and the short of it is, was that it was much higher, that the experts that hypothesized that it would be higher, they were the ones that were correct. So, for example, with the, I put up a picture of the, of the religious sisters, the nuns in the Philippines. So iron is regulated. And if your iron status is very low, you absorb a higher percentage. And if your iron status is high, you absorb a lower percentage. And that, that came out very clearly in the, in that study for high iron. And it's basically, we're getting the same result for the other nutrients as well. We conduct the studies with meal patterns that are the regular meal patterns that the poor eat in the countries. And we've been able to show time after time that we're able to improve the, the mineral or the vitamin status with, through our efficacy trials. And, on, I don't know, the, we, we actually do have a Harvest Plus China program. I don't know, maybe that was a light green color. It should have been a, in that map it should have shown that China was definitely a country that's involved with, with Harvest Plus, with biofortification. We, we contacted them in 2004 and we've been having meetings. And now, finally, the Chinese government is investing in its own biofortification program. And we also made the effort in Brazil and the effort in India for those three countries. They have very large agricultural research establishments. And all three countries now have independently funded biofortification programs. That was, that was part of our, part of our strategy. Um, eventually, yeah, we, you know, we hope that all, all countries, um, you know, will adopt biofortified crops. Even, even developed countries. I, I would like to see orange maize widely adopted, uh, in the U.S. I think, uh, orange grits, uh, not orange because you're using cheese, but just because it's orange maize. I think that would be much more attractive. And we would, we would be able to get royalties for, for that private sector business in the U.S. And then those royalties could be used to, to invest in spreading biofortified crops in, in the South. Great. Additional questions? You have a microphone. Go ahead and stand up. Thanks. Hi, my name is Kevin Lee from Mobilize Construction. We are focusing on rural infrastructure. Uh, my question is on food waste and, uh, post-harvest loss. I was wondering if there's any research that you've come across in, you know, the biofortification to decrease that. Or even, uh, you know, once crops are harvested, is there a deterioration or degradation of the nutrients in the crops? Thanks. Great. Go ahead. I'm Kelsey. I'm an intern for the U.S. Senate Ag Committee. And I'm also a student at Texas A&M studying international ag development. Um, I grow corn and soybeans here in the U.S. And then I lived in Sub-Saharan Africa in a rural community helping others to grow corn and soybeans as well. So I've seen firsthand how government infrastructure and transgenic crops, uh, make a big difference. And I was just wondering, what do you think, um, it will take or what could we do better to get transgenic crops in developing countries? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. On, uh, on the first question about, first of all, on degradation, um, it depends a lot on, on the vitamin and mineral. There's a, with, uh, with the pro-vitamin A in the maize or, or any of the pro-vitamin A crops, once the, once the crop is harvested, it's processed, stored, cooked, there's actually a fairly substantial amount of the pro-vitamin A is lost. Uh, up to 75% of it can be lost after storage after three or four months. But when we set our target levels, we, we had target levels. If this is the level in a non-bio-fortified crop, our target level is up here, where we, where we would have a, uh, substantial public health impact. And that takes account of the loss. So, after it's lost and we did the calculations and this much is left, this increment is still enough to provide, say, 40% of the estimated average requirement on any given day. So we, we've taken that into account. Um, but in general, um, you know, I, I think, uh, work on, on reducing post-harvest losses. I think it's important work. But there's so many, so many things that need to be done. Bio-fortification is just one of the things. So we're not, we're not taking that on, that issue on directly. Um, there are a lot of issues that Harvest Plus doesn't take on directly. Um, I was invited to give, uh, the ethics department at Purdue University invited me to give a speech. And I, I didn't know why they invited me. I thought they wanted me to talk about transgenics and the ethics involved in transgenics. And when I arrived, they said, no, we like, we, we think it's very ethical what you're doing, because you're not changing behavior. You're not asking for a huge behavior change. You're just saying, if you grow and eat rice, grow and eat a bio-fortified rice instead of a non-bio-fortified rice. You're not, you're not putting in a new irrigation system. You're not, in some sense, disrupting the, the culture in a major way. So it's that, it's that kind of philosophy that don't change your production patterns. Don't, you know, don't, don't change anything you do. Just plant a bio-fortified seed instead of a non-bio-fortified seed. So that's the idea. Um, so transgenics, what does it, what does it take? Um, you know, that's the, that's the million dollar question. And I, and I think we're actually losing ground. Um, with that, you know, things being labeled, uh, non-GMO. Uh, we didn't see that labeling five years ago, and now everything's being labeled non-GMO. I, it could be, it could be that, um, another kind of vision or dream that I would have would be that this high iron, high zinc rice could be introduced in a particular country and have a huge impact. And then people would see the benefit and, and, and then other countries would want it. And then once, once the dam broke in some sense, then, then people would forget about all this fear. This is what I consider unfounded fear. Mm-hmm. More questions? Well, Lori right here in the front, and then over here, the glass. Thank you. Hi, I'm Lori Rowley with the Luger Center. Thanks for being here and for all of, um, your great comments. On the issue of acceptance, um, you just made it sound like it was so easy, especially with the women. I mean, they're just so smart. And the minute you showed them that there was no change in taste and this was really good for their kids, they were good to go. But, I, I've programmed here actually at CSAS a couple of years ago with some university folks working in Sub-Saharan Africa. Um, the researchers told us, we really are having trouble cracking the men. And they just don't like the color. And they won't let their women cook these new, um, sweet potatoes or whatever. And so, they don't really care that it didn't change the taste that much. And, you know, that's okay that it helped the kids. But, I like my color. And so, can you talk about acceptance on the side with the men and how challenging that's been? Good question, Lori. Hi, I'm a student at Georgetown University. I'm studying international development. I'm really interested in global food security. As you mentioned that the widespread of biofortified food, you know, you're trying to replace some of the low nutrient traditional crop at the same time. Seed banks, you know, all over the world are trying to preserve a lot of different species. So, I was wondering what's your opinion on this? Do you think that biofortified food is somehow degrading plant diversity? Okay, plant diversity. Okay. So, the first question on the demand, I'm going to let Anna Marie, she has all the experience with the orange sweet potato in Uganda. I would, she's the expert. Can you bring a microphone up and we'll go, is that okay, Anna Marie? Okay. Maybe stand up and introduce yourself again. Good afternoon, my name is Anna Marie Ball. I'm, um, have been working with Harvest Plus since 2006 when Howdy convinced me to go to Uganda and Mozambique and, and address this issue of color change of a sweet potato because, you know, Africans were never going to accept it. You got part of the story right there that, um, that women actually were easier to convince. And that is because they were feeding their children the orange sweet potato and after a fairly consistent time and not a long time, mothers said to us, you know what, my child is better. And I'm, I'm a natural born skeptic and I thought, no, this just, they're just telling me because I want to know this or they think I want to know this. But I realized after a while that actually I was hearing mothers from a lot of different places telling me the same thing. And I was actually quite humbled because I realized in fact mothers do know their children and they're watching them. The issue of the men, they're not really that worried about the color. They're more interested in having a dry, mealy sweet potato. And there is a little bit of a trade off that you do have with dryness when you breed in the vitamin A or the beta-keratin. Having said that, we have also seen lots and lots of men who see what's happening to their families and they eat it and they like it. And we've also learned over time that it also depends on how you cook it. And for those of you that have worked in the field, you'll know that cooking time is a really big issue when you're introducing a new food. If something takes longer to cook, a woman is not going to like that. But at the same time, if it doesn't take as long to cook, you also have to tell them that and say, you don't need to cook it for 20 minutes. You can cook it for 15 minutes. And that's one of the tricks that we've been able to do with the sweet potatoes to say, don't cook it for so long or steam it instead of boil it. And you'll get a dry, mealy sweet potato, which is the preference for Africa. Thank you very much. So the question about diversity. So the development of the conventionally bred crops very much depends on the existing diversity that's been collected into the germplasm banks. So we had to go to the germplasm banks and find high zinc rices, high zinc wheats that we could cross with the high yielding varieties. Same thing with the high iron pearl millet, the high iron beans, etc. Once the new varieties are bred, then they're also available in addition to the non-biofortified varieties that are already available in the cropping systems. So there's actually more choice and more diversity in the system now as the biofortified crops are being introduced. Great. Other questions? Let's go in the back here and Tom can go again. Hi, my name is Olivia Chapman. I'm an intern here at CSIS and I'm also a graduate student at the University of Cambridge in International Development. And the bulk of my research that I've looked at has been focusing on soy and soy monocropping. And I noticed that soy is something that's absent from the crops that you've rolled out. My assumption would be because the bulk of soy produced goes into animal feed that that's one of the reasons that it's missing from there. But I wondered if you could talk a little bit about transgenics in soy and if you'd ever look towards soy in your efforts. Well, that was a good segue because my question is about animal feed. A lot of farmers in Africa and other places use stover, maize stalks, the vines from sweet potatoes, rice stalks, millet, sorghum, as the basis of the animal feed to feed their cows, goats, sheep. And I'm wondering if Harvest Plus has encouraged or suggested that ILRI perhaps look at the impact of using biofortified stover as the basis for animal feed. Thank you. Yeah, great. Okay, on the question on soy. So what the, what biofortification, its impact depends on the fact that people are eating already high amounts of rice in certain countries, high amounts of wheat in other countries, high amounts of maize in other countries. That's where, that's what we start with. And soy just is not, it's not a basic food staple for the most part. So that's why we're not, that's why we're not working on it. So that, you know, that's, that's what I can say about soy. On the, on the animal feed angle, when I first, when I first made my visits in 1993, I had exactly that idea. I went to, I went to ILRI and I said, what about mineral and, mineral and vitamin deficiencies in animals? And I got no traction whatsoever. They just said, no, it's all about getting them enough to eat. Basically energy, maybe some protein and, and mineral and vitamin deficiencies is just not an issue with livestock production in Africa. And that's probably not the case, but I'm an, I'm not an animal scientist. I'm an economist. I think, I think it bears investigation, but you're always short of funding. You're always, there's so many things you want to do. And so that's just been something we've never, we've never gotten into. But I, I'm hoping that, you know, the, the success of biofortification and what, what Harvest Plus is focusing on will stimulate other institutions and other programs. And hopefully people will look into that. And maybe, maybe somebody will get interested in, in biofortified soy for animal feed. And, and it just in general, when I, I made my first visit to the International Rice Research Institute in 1993, and I had an appointment with the head breeder who, who later won the world food prize. And, you know, a really nice gentleman, Gurdev Kuj, and he said, he said, he looked at me, he said, you know, nobody ever asked me before how much iron is in rice. I don't know. That's not, we hadn't thought about it. We hadn't thought about it. And, and when you look at the, when you look at the, when you look at, um, uh, rice, when you look at zinc consumption, say in Bangladesh, two thirds of zinc intake, two thirds of total zinc intake in diets of Bangladeshis come from rice. And nobody, nobody studied, uh, how zinc content in rice changed from, from traditional varieties to, to modern varieties. Because it was always yield. It was always, uh, what consumers wanted. Certain grain size, translucence, chalkiness. Nothing, nothing about, no focus at all on the nutrient content of the varieties that they were producing. And that was a, that was a fundamental error. And so now, now we need to change that. And, and every aspect of what we do in agriculture research, we, we need to look at that in addition to all the other things that people are already looking at. Hmm. Let's have one final question right here. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. My name is Jeanette Tramiel with the Organization of American States. I'm here in my own personal capacity this afternoon. I really enjoyed your presentation. And when you said that as an economist, you had difficulty, uh, or challenges in talking with plant breeders, I'm speaking as a lawyer to you and saying, in, in, in, as an economist and, in working in the, in the plant breeding area. Um, do you have any suggestions of how law can help, how policy tools can be used now in terms of scaling? Or any examples of where you've seen, um, legal barriers or policy barriers in terms of trying to move forward? Yeah. Yeah. So we'll just take that one. Okay. Um, well I think, um, in terms of standards for crops, um, we're afraid that, uh, and we're working on this with the, with the codex. Uh, people could start, uh, once they become popular, people could start marketing something as biofortified that's not really biofortified. So you need some type of enforcement, uh, of, of particular standards. And that's, that's part of the legal system. Um, and, and there are also, I think there are, there are legal issues with the, uh, with the release of transgenics. Um, in the, in the Philippines, there was, there was something about, um, the, the, the, the biosafety committee, they had a transgenic eggplant that was released in, um, by the biosafety committee in the Philippines. And the anti, uh, transgenic, uh, political forces brought it to this, brought the issue to the Supreme Court. And the, um, the scientists didn't have a good legal team. And the, uh, and the anti-transgenic had a good legal team. And they, they convinced the Supreme Court to ban all transgenics in the Philippines. Because, uh, you know, they just, they, they just argued it better from a legal perspective. Um, and so there, you know, there are, there are issues. They finally reversed it. They finally figured out that the Supreme Court shouldn't, they, they reversed their decision. But they didn't have, they didn't have good information. They got, they got all the, the bad information from one side and the other side wasn't prepared for the argument. So I think there are issues there. Thank you so much, Howdy. It's such a pleasure to have you here and to help educate our audience here as well as watching our webcast. And it's amazing to think about what happened in your mind and what all the work from the 1990s to today. I was fascinated when I was looking at your website. One thing I learned was that the bio-fortified orange sweet potato was one of the top innovations named in Time magazines last year. Next to like a drone or like, you know, wireless headphones or all these other things, these gadgets. There's the orange flesh sweet potato, which is more mainstream now for it to be in that. And I just think it's really impressive. And we're just so grateful in the community for the work that you've done over the decades. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
