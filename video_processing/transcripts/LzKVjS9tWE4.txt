Howto & Style
 In America right now, right now, the average turnaround cycle for buying a homestead in America is roughly five years. We've seen it around our area, and I'm talking about places that are, you know, five to 15 acres. So people come out of the city, they buy their little place, and in five years they sell it. Why? First two years is honeymoon. Third year, oh man, I'm not sure I can take care of all this. Fourth and fifth years, it's for sale. And we've watched some properties actually sell six times in 15 years here near us that are these small properties. So that's why you want to be thinking strategically about renting rather than buying, and then thinking about where you want to be with pond sites. You want some trees. You want to fight the weather anomalies. Those kinds of things.
