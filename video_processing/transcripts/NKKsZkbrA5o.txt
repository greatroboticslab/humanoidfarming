 Let's build a cattle panel trellis for vertical gardening. You'll need one 50 inch by 16 foot cattle panel and four six foot T-post. Set your first T-post and drive it into the ground with a hammer or T-post driver. Space the next one 40 inches over and place two directly across from them about four to five feet over. Once your T-posts are set you can carefully bend your cattle panel and place it between them. Take the clips that come with the T-post and assemble two to three per post. They make a special tool for this but we just use pliers and it worked out fine. After that you'll have a strong trellis for all your favorite vining crops. Make sure to follow along to see what we plant to grow on these this summer.
