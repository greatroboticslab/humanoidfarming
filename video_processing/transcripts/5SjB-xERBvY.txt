Howto & Style
 Since we are at the beginning of the Every Bit Counts Challenge, I thought I would show you guys five things that I will always have on my pantry shelf. The very first thing I will always can is broth. I love to can chicken broth, beef broth, turkey broth, and veggie broth. The second thing I will always, always have is just a plain tomato sauce. With this, you can make anything. You can do like a pasta sauce, enchilada sauce, or even a ketchup. The third thing I will always can is beans. I love having these as a quick and easy meal. The fourth thing I will always have canned is potatoes. I love having these as a quick side option. All you have to do is just take them out and rinse them and do whatever you want with them. And the last thing is jams. I love having a different variety of jams available. These make a delicious sweetbread or just the standard peanut butter and jam sandwich. And as an added bonus, simple syrup is something I will always can. These are excellent to make when you have leftover peach skins or strawberry tops.
