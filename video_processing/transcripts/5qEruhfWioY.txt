 Did you know that black women played a pivotal role in the early American agricultural cooperative movement? After emancipation, women like Fannie Lou Hamer and others organized co-ops to help black farmers pool resources, share profits, and resist exploitation. These leaders not only provided food security, but also empowered their communities through education and activism. Their work laid the foundation for economic justice, demonstrating how collective action and visionary leadership can transform lives and challenge systemic barriers.
