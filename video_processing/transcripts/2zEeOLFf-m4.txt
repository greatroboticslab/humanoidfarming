 Why is equipment rental called plant hire in other countries? The term plant hire comes from the verb to plant, which means to fix in place or to drive into the ground. In construction, manufacturing, or agriculture, people plant heavy machinery on the ground, much like a plant. The term plant is derived from the Latin word plantar, which means to drive into the ground. In the UK, we typically use hire when temporarily using move-up items like plant machinery, cars, bicycles, or drones. On the other hand, rent is the term we usually use when securing temporary use of immovable properties like houses, rooms, or buildings.
