Howto & Style
 So why is this push-pull hoe here so much better than this regular garden hoe? We're going to find out. So we've got this area here between our sunflowers that's grown up pretty bad with pigweed. This pigweed, this stuff right here, pretty prevalent in the south. It'll grow just about anywhere in any kind of condition. It's gotten about 8 to 12 inches tall in here, so it's pretty thick. And we're going to see which one of these hoes does the better job of cleaning this area here. So with this traditional hoe, we have to lift the hoe and we basically have to hack at the ground like this. And while, yes, this does displace the weeds, it also displaces a large amount of dirt, which is going to cover those weeds and then we're going to have to come back here and level this area out. With the push-pull hoe, the blade stays almost level with the soil and we just slide it back and forth. So we're going to have a smoother, efficient motion than picking the hoe up and stabbing at the ground. So with the push-pull hoe, we can just come through here. I like it. Let's see. Right now. We're going to have this suspense here. All right. If we have some tobacco keys, we can pollrate the reconcile when we hear in our view. Take off just somefrage<|en|> and stopping into the dough. The lead is pinch to it. We have another geometry here, and a lot of it. If we require Landesregierung here, we do not bring the camouflage to the ground up. So if we take our garden rake and clean this up here, you can see that push pullow did a pretty good job taking out all those weeds in there. It's much more efficient than your standard garden hoe, a lot quicker and a lot easier to use. Thank you.
