Howto & Style
 We started this coop with nothing but a dream and a simple sketch in our mind. And somehow, we made it here. Today, in part four, we finally bring it to life. It's a real window, a custom chicken door, and a whole lot of sawdust. Let's build. Here we go. Window. Open and close with a little screen. And follow if you want to see more cool omen gardening stuff.
