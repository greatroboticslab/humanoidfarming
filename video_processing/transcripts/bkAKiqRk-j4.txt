 hi guys welcome to this presentation by the discovery school team in this video i'll be speaking about smart irrigation system for sustainable agriculture so in kenya the agricultural sector has been facing a lot of challenges those challenges include over reliance on rent-fed agriculture and limited high potential agricultural land these problems have been hampering agricultural sustainability food have been bringing about problems like food insecurity and restricting economic development in affected regions so this problem matters because it significantly affects farmers agricultural communities and regions dependent on rent-fed agriculture or facing limited high potential agricultural land moving forward the group of people affected include big people such as those in bongoma county i can see that the post as in this problem has caused a threat to food security bringing about 42 percent of the population which are faced by food poverty so according to this analysis it shows that 98 percent of the cation population are practicing farming with only 76 percent of the farmers depending on the in-fed agriculture and 24 percent depending on irrigation so here is a graph showing the rainfall variability in kenya along the years this other graph shows the peak and off-peak seasons for rainfall so we chose this solution because it will lead to increase crop yield and quality by delivering water and a more precise efficient efficient sorry by delivering water in a more precise and efficient manner smart irrigation system will help to optimize soil moisture levels for crops this will promote healthier plant growth etc so you can see here our wire frames the pain points our user is frustrated by the limited and unreliable rainfall leading to poor crop yield production our user is also frustrated by the dependence on rain fed agriculture for crop production which in turn leads to food insecurity uh here our recommendation we recommend that before installing our irrigation system it is essential to conduct a site assessment to understand the user's farm or field characteristics if given funding of course we're going to create the application for commercial scale we are going to synchronize the vast available data with the application and finally purchase the various system which will be put on the farm physically there are other activities that we're going to do but we have only listed those as of now the smart irrigation system optimizes water usage by delivering water precisely when and where it is needed so it is meant to create irrigation schedules your duration based on soil moisture levels and environmental condition this position will enhance crop health and productivity hopefully additional info with the existing irrigation companies such as aqua hub kenya we could work in collaboration with them to create smart irrigation through application the extensive network will make sure that virtually most farmers in the country get to benefit through the application thank you so much and feel free to ask any questions
