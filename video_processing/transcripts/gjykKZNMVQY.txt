 Hey Machinery Pete here folks. I am making my way back from just north of Indianapolis. Today I was speaking at a very fun farm show, the Indiana Farm Equipment and Technology Expo. I had a great time out here. Always fun to visit our friends in Indiana and on my way back to Minnesota. But I did want to let you know there is a fantastic online farm retirement auction this evening, December 14th by our good friends at Froggitt Real Estate and Auction Company. Jacob Froggitt and the team there do an awesome job actually from back near my hometown of Benson, Minnesota there. And tonight's auction begins closing at 6 p.m. Central and it's our online retirement auction. It's for Rick and Kim Olson in Milan, Minnesota. Great little farming community there in Milan. And tell you what, they got some nice equipment. One tractor in particular you need to take a look at. It's a 2011 John Deere 9530T, which you know you don't see a ton of those around. 36 inch tracks, only 1762 hours on it. Of course pre-def 2011 model. And it has the updated engine cooling fan drive, just made that update. Now the website to check out folks, it's froggittauctions.com. And that's spelled F-R-A-G-O-D-T, froggittauctions.com. So froggittauctions.com, the online retirement auction for Rick and Kim Olson. Begins closing tonight, 6 p.m. Central. Again, that 2011 John Deere 9530T track tractor. And that is beautiful. It looks like there's already been some intense bidding, but can't find them this nice. Also on the sale of very sharp 2003 John Deere 8220 tractor and a 2004 John Deere 1770 NT 16 row 30 inch planner with some updates to the units. Of course, you know, it's been hard to find good use planners and a very nice 16 row 30 inch here. Again, so check out froggittauctions.com and get yourself that equipment. Again, online bidding starts to close tonight at 6 p.m. Central. Your next piece of equipment is on machinerypete.com.
