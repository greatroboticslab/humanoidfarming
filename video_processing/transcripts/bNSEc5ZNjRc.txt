 Welcome to quick learning. In this video we will be discussing SAP PM module also known as plant maintenance module. This is one of the most important SAP utilizations in different manufacturing plants where you are regularizing, integrating and keeping track of plant equipment and machinery maintenance. So in this video we will be discussing some key features, further asked questions and practical tips regarding SAP plant maintenance module. So let's start with the initial overview what is SAP PM module. So going forward what is SAP PM module? SAP PM module in SAP ERP is being used for multiple sorts of planning, scheduling and executing maintenance activities. So basically there are three main purposes of this SAP plant maintenance module. One is the planning, other is scheduling and the third is execution of those maintenance activities. And another one is the closing or close out of these activities after the due maintenance. So what is what it is how it is being integrated? It integrates with MM materials management, PP production planning and FI financials and controlling module. So this module is being connected and it is already connected and integrated with other SAP modules like material planning and plant production and finance control, etc. So in this way this is coordinating, this module is coordinating with other modules as well. So moving forward what are the core functions of this particular module? So there are few of the core functions that I have mentioned here. Number one is the preventive maintenance. The next one is corrective maintenance. Then breakdown maintenance. Then refurbishment, calibration and work clearance. So these are major six core functions of this module. Preventive maintenance is that maintenance that is being planned and executed preventively prior to any breakdown or issue. It includes the time based maintenance of the equipment like maintenance at 750 running hours, 1500 running hours, 3000 running hours, 6000 running hours as per OEM instructions. So this is the preventive module maintenance. The next is corrective maintenance. That type of maintenance. If there are some issue is being faced, then to correct that issue or problem on the equipment on process, then this type of maintenance is being performed. Next is breakdown maintenance. If there is any breakdown on any machine that it is unable to run, then this type of maintenance is being performed through SAP PM module. Then refurbishment of any equipment, calibration of any digital or electronic equipment. And last one is the work clearance of the machinery that are available in our areas. So there is some key master data points of this module. So let's discuss one by one. The number one is the functional location. That is the main, you know, the center point of any area. For example, you can see in easy example, it is like a street number or a block number of any residential area that is called the functional location on which certain types of equipment are installed. The next one is the equipment, the specific equipment that are installed on that functional location. It can be fillers, labelers or shrink packers, homogenizers, separators, UHT plants, etc. So these are the equipments. The next one is bill of materials. All the bombs or the materials that are being used in the maintenance of that particular equipment. Then we have task list. Task list is basically the list of activities that are being performed during a particular maintenance. For example, at 1500 running hours or 6000 running hours, there are specific 8 to 10 points that OEM has recommended regarding cleaning, inspection, lubrication, replacement. So those points are mentioned in task list. Then we have maintenance plans. Maintenance plans are basically the time durations on which that maintenance is planned. Earlier I was mentioning like the maintenance is planned after 6000 hours or once in a year or twice in a year like 3000 running hours or 1500 running hours. So maintenance plans of each equipment are available in the system according to its running hours. And when once that time is reached, the system itself shows and displays that now we have to perform the maintenance of this particular equipment. Then we have measuring points and counters that calculate how much running hours have passed and what is the cost, what is the performance of equipment, etc. So these are also the key master data points. So moving forward, let's discuss some frequently asked questions first. Then we will be moving forward to get an insight on some key features of this module. What is functional location? It's a hierarchical place where a maintenance task is performed. What is the difference between functional location and equipment? The location is fixed like I mentioned about a street or a block. While the equipment is movable, it can be dismantled from a particular function location and can be moved to another function location. What is notification? The notification is a formal request for maintenance or to report a failure in the equipment. What is maintenance order? It is a document used to plan and track the maintenance work on any particular equipment. What is the purpose of task list? It has predefined operations for repetitive tasks like the inspection or cleaning or lubrication or replacement or tightening of the particular parts of a specific equipment. What is maintenance plan? It is the scheduling maintenance by time or usage like on the basis of running hours or on the basis of yearly or bi-yearly, fortnightly. So the maintenance plans are designed accordingly. So let's discuss some important T codes that are being used in the PM plant maintenance module. The first one is IW31. It is to create maintenance orders. The number second is IW32. To change the maintenance order that is already being created, IW28 or IW29, is to display the list of maintenance modifications that have been created. Either it is open or closed, all will be displayed depending upon the check that you select at start. IL01 is to create a specific functional location. Then IE01 is to create equipment on a specific functional location. IP41 is to create the maintenance strategy. And at the last but not the least, IP10 is to schedule the maintenance plans of some specific equipment. Some common issues and their solutions. Some common issues include order is not scheduled. For that we have to check the strategy and the cycle settings of the particular equipment. If that settings of cycle are not correct, then its order for the planned maintenance will not be scheduled. Duplicate equipment. Sometimes an equipment is being shown multiple times or at different locations. For that we have to use the number range or naming convention so that it will avoid the duplication of equipment or the functional locations. Cost not updated. For that we have to verify the cost elements. Then order settlement rules have to be checked. If the order settlement rules are not correct, then the cost of those maintenance activities will not be updated. So there are some tips and best practices. Use task list for repetitive maintenance. Always use task list because it will help you to keep a track on activities that you have performed. Keep on auditing master data regularly so that you can check if there are some additions or subtractions from the master data list. Use measuring points to trigger maintenance that there are certain specific points. On the basis of their result, we can say that the maintenance of that equipment is required. Integrate PM with MM and FI module to keep a track on material management and the financial aspect of maintenance. Close and to go old orders timely. This is extremely important that we have to technically complete and close all the orders timely. This will help us to track that when order was opened, when it was completed and closed. This enables us to have a good check on the system. In real life case, this is the typical flow. It starts from notification. Then it goes to maintenance order. Next step is execution. Then the confirmation. And the last step is the technical completion. So we have to close this loop of technical completion. We should not stop by executing the activity. Normally, the maintenance staff just relies on the execution of the activity, but its confirmation and its technical completion is extremely important in the system. So we all of us must follow this one thing. In conclusion, there are three main points that I want to highlight here. SAP PM module reduces downtimes and it surely improves the asset reliability. This is tried and tested, checked in multiple organizations that the performance of equipment is improved through SAP PM module. The next one is master data accuracy and proactive planning is the key for effective execution of maintenance activities. If we are not planning proactively and our master data is not accurate, the task list and the maintenance plans, etc. The functional location and equipment are not correct. Then the maintenance that we are performing will not be that much reliable. Integration of other modules ensures streamlined operations. If we integrate these modules with other modules like material management or MRP runs to arrange spare parts timely and with financial module to track the cost, then we will be better able to analyze the impact of maintenance. So that's it from my side regarding the PM module. In next video, I will try to make similar analysis for the MM module material management. or production planning or financial module to have a better idea for the SAP users that how to use these modules effectively. Availability of your SAP in your company is not the main thing. How we utilize it and how we effectively make it reliable is the key to success.
