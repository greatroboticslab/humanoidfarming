What is Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)?

 That's one of our favorite things, community supported agriculture. CSA is essentially a relationship between the farm and the members that sign up to partner with the farm as consumers. And in exchange they get a portion of the weekly harvest of what the farm is producing throughout the year. You're buying a share of a farm's produce for the season. It's like a season ticket. You're getting whatever is harvested that week in your share for the season. We have organic produce that you all can pick up once a week from any number of locations including farmers markets. So people who like to eat seasonally would sign up, decide the size that they wanted, small, regular and abundant sizes. At the beginning of the season it's going to be a compilation of items that are ready that time of year. So green onions, radishes, salad lettuce. But then as we move into the summer months, vegetables and items in the share change. So it moves into tomatoes, potatoes, green beans, cucumbers, squash, eggplant. And then when we get into the fall season we'll move more into kale greens and sweet potatoes. I like cooking so I've learned all sorts of different kinds of dishes that I normally wouldn't even think about. Yeah, it's a learning experience. That's what I like the most about it. We like it because we get a lot of the favorites, a lot of the things that we use a lot. And then we get to also try new things. They provide recipes for the things that we may not use as often. That's really, really helpful. It helps me as a mom provide some new things to my kids that they may have never tried otherwise. To me CSA is just a great way for a customer to get the freshest, cleanest food possible from a farmer in their community. One of the other big benefits for me is supporting my community, supporting my neighbors and local farmers, and the environmental aspects of having a short food chain and lowering your carbon footprint when you're shopping close to home. The CSA is just an easy intersection of building strong local economies but then also making it convenient for them to tap into a fresh supply of local farm products. I think people are always surprised by how fresh everything is, how long their vegetables last, and I think a lot of people are surprised how good fresh vegetables taste. Store-bought people will be shocked. I'll get texts that say, I didn't like carrots. Why do the carrots taste like this? And I'm like, oh yes, right. The carrots do taste different than from the store. CSA helps us mitigate risk. So under the best of conditions, we grow the best of food. We know at the beginning of the year how many consumers, how many CSA members we have the opportunity to feed that year. And so we're able to crop plan based on that. Because people make that commitment to the farm at the beginning of the season, that's really helpful for a farmer to not kind of be just out on a limb with our production. The food itself is something that you can really trust where it's coming from. You can trust the food safety and the practices that are used to grow it. I mean, it's definitely fresher. I get a different variety of things than what I would probably buy in the grocery store. I think that awareness is good to have to think about things that grow locally. Well, besides all the good food, I think you get the feeling of being part of something that with a bunch of like-minded people, that you get to share ideas and share recipes. It just kind of connects you to your area a little bit more. It's great to have that connection to come out to the farm because people really do need to know where their food comes from. A connection with the local farm really does give you that understanding of all the people that are involved to feed people every day. The biggest thing that it comes down to for us is connection. And that's connection with the member, the people that we raise food for. For us to have that direct connection with people who are eating our wonderful produce and meat. CSAs are a way that customers who are new to Eating Local get a lot of support for how to use local produce. CSAs can be a little bit of a gateway with lots of support and farm events for you as a customer to really get involved in the local food system. And it's also about connection to the land and raising food in a healthy way. And for members to have a direct connection with us. Choose CSA to support local farms and get great tasting local food.
