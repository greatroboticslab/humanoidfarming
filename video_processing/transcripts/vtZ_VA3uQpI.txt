 Here you go, you guys wanted to see it. Not my butt, but how to grow herbs. This is the most basic way to get started. Buy a small plant from Home Depot and put it into a bigger pot with holes in the bottom and water it. And congrats, you're 90% there. Seriously though, when you're starting out, don't worry about organic soils, nutrients, or directly sowing seeds. That's intermediate and expert level stuff, which you could go without learning and you'd still have magnum plants. One of each herb will be plenty, unless you're growing.
