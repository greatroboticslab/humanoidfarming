 Today I'm going to demonstrate a simple way to attach a lay flat header pipe to a regular garden hose. Begin by using a clamp to attach a gray barbed connector to a lay flat header. If it is hard to get on, use some food grade lubricant like vegetable oil. Tighten the clamp. Wrap Teflon tape around the threads on a 2 inch male PVC coupler. Keeping in mind, the tape must go on clockwise so that it doesn't bunch up when you screw it into the gray barbed connector. Use pipe wrenches to make sure it is tight. Then apply PVC glue to the outside of the 3 quarter inch female reduced threaded piece and the inside of the 2 inch male PVC coupler. Now we will wrap the threads of a 3 quarter inch female connector with Teflon tape and screw it into the reducer. Next, apply more PVC glue which will attach to a short 2 to 3 piece of PVC 3 quarter inch pipe. Apply more PVC glue to attach the valve to the PVC. The valve has to flow in the right direction, so double check the direction, the arrow points. Use more PVC glue to attach another short piece of PVC pipe and then a 3 quarter inch female connector. Then make sure the water hose or faucet is clean and add Teflon tape to the threads. If you choose to add fertigation to the irrigation system, it should be attached in the center of the pipe.
