Howto & Style
 When you cut into a watermelon, you see these seeds? Don't you see them? Instead, pick one of them out. Grab a pot with soil and plant the seed about one inch deep. Lightly water it and in just three weeks it'll sprout. Then grow and grow faster with each day. It grows at least six inches long. Transplant it into a bigger pot and go outside in your garden and grow some watermelon.
