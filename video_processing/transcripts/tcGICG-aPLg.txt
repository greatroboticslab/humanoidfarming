 Cash flow is important for any business, but you already know that, right? Leasing equipment from your Bobcat dealer just got a whole lot easier. You can get the best compact equipment on the market and lower your monthly payment to keep your cash flow strong. It's simple, flexible, and affordable. There are many advantages to leasing. First, there is no down payment, which drastically reduces your upfront cost. Second, leasing Bobcat equipment gets you into the world's leading compact equipment for less money every month, so you can enjoy the newest features and the most innovative technologies on the newest generation of Bobcat equipment. And with predictable cost, it's easier to plan your expenses every month. That means you can grow your business faster. Once the lease is up, there are no trade-in hassles. Just bring in the machine to the dealership and you can buy it for its remaining value or set up another lease on a new model. You'll have fewer risks during your lease period because many repairable costs are covered by your standard machine warranty. For the most peace of mind, pair your lease with the Protection Plus plan and a plan maintenance contract. For a small fixed fee, Protection Plus extended warranty provides even more protection that adds security and enhances your peace of mind. The policy pays for the full cost of any warrantable work, including parts and labor with no deductible required. Simply choose the warranty coverage that's best for you. Ask your Bobcat dealer about our leasing program to find out just how easy it is. The Toughest Equipment brand is now the easiest to acquire.
