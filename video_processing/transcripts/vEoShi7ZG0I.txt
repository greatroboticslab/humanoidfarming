Howto & Style
 Hi everyone, I'm Susan Mulvihill. I'm not out in the vegetable garden today because I have something really new and cool to show you. This is my new elevated cedar planter from gardeners supply and it falls into the category of best laid plans. I had initially wanted to get it back in the spring and it was going to coincide with one of my columns about growing herbs. Well of course then COVID-19 happened and it was just impossible to get gardening supplies from anywhere. So I just got it the other day and I'm really impressed with it and wanted to show you what it's like. As I mentioned this is made out of cedar which I really like for outdoor projects and they used a food grade sealer on it to make it waterproof and help it to weather well and that's really great since I want to use this to grow edible crops in. It is four feet long, two feet deep and 29 inches high. Now the standard version of this elevated planter comes with wooden slats in the bottom and that's great but I decided to opt for the add-on which is the self-watering insert and that's because I love the idea of not having to worry about watering it every day and being able to go out of town and not worrying about it. Of course going out of town this year is not exactly an option but this is what you're looking at. This is a reservoir, one on each side and it has a little filling tube and what my husband is going to do is he's going to connect a drip line to it so that every time the sprinkler on our blueberry bed runs this will get refilled. So this is going to work really really well. I love how sturdy it is, it's very well designed, we didn't have any problems putting it together and I think it's going to be awesome. Now this planter holds seven cubic feet of potting soil and you definitely want to use potting soil. You don't want to use garden soil because it can contain pathogens, it's very heavy and also it compacts a lot so it can be hard to keep it evenly moist. So I've opted for a raised bed mix. It is organic and I chose that especially because I'm going to be growing some edible crops in here. So in it goes. Now as I fill up the planter with potting soil it's really important that I push the soil down into those depressions in this self-watering insert and that's because what's going to happen, you'll recall there's a water reservoir underneath. The water will wick up from the reservoir into the potting soil. So that's one step that's really important to do. Now I mentioned earlier how my original plan had been to have the planting of this elevated planter coincide with my springtime column on growing culinary herbs. Why is that? Well I was thinking that it would be really great to suggest the idea of growing an herb garden right outside your kitchen door and ours is right there. And I thought you know I would be much better about using herbs if I didn't have to go out to the vegetable garden but instead just walked a few steps out the door and could select what I wanted to add into whatever I was cooking. So that was the game plan. Well of course then again COVID-19 happened so my poor little herb selections got stuck in this pot. I've been babying them along, I've been using them off and on and so today's their big day they get to go into this planter. The other thing that I like about the elevated planter which is probably obvious is that it's elevated. So as we all get older it's a nice idea to have something that's higher and easier to tend. So I really had two thoughts in mind. Having something that is great for adaptive gardening where maybe you can't bend over or kneel or do anything like that anymore or it's just plain more difficult. And to have an herb garden right outside your kitchen door. Well that looks a little better doesn't it? I felt so badly for those plants because they were really wedged into the old pot but it was the only place I had to store them for the time being. But once I got them in I think I heard them all do a collective, ah we can spread out our roots. So let me show you what I've planted. This is winter savory. It's hardy down to zone 5 and that's our zone so it should be just fine. This is tarragon also hardy for this area. This is rosemary. It does not like cold winters at all. So what I'm going to do when the temperatures start dropping is I'm going to take cuttings from the plants. You would not believe how easy it is to root them in a glass of water. Just take about a 6 inch cutting, strip off the lower half of leaves and you'll be amazed at how quickly it will root. Once they have a nice root system I'll put them into pots, grow them indoors and then plant them outside in the spring. This is common sage. It does really well in our region. Here is Greek oregano and I have found oregano and marjoram to be very aggressive in the garden. It spreads everywhere so having it in a container is a perfect solution. This is Italian or flat leaf parsley. I really like having that on hand. This is a biennial so that means it puts on a good root system and leaves the first year and in the second year it sends up a flower stock. So this will probably not make it for next year but that's okay. I'll just get a new one. And then this is a thyme called HiHo Silver. It's got sort of gray green leaves with little white edges and I think it'll be fun to grow and also to use in cooking. So the next step is to water everything in well to fill up the reservoir through this fill tube and then watch them grow and use them in cooking. I hope you enjoyed this video. I am really excited about this planter and I'll keep you posted on how it's doing. I also promised to put a link to my herb garden story from this spring in the description underneath this video on my youtube channel. So if you'd like to read it you'll find it there. In the meantime thanks so much for watching everybody. Have a great day and I'll see you next week. Happy gardening!
