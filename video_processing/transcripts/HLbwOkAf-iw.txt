Howto & Style
 Here are five easy ways to make compost for your garden. Throw kitchen scraps, garden waste in these tumblers, and you'll be rolling in compost in no time. A compost bin, cheap and easy. Chuck it all in and let it do its thing. A three bay system made from recycled pallets. Put it all in bay one, then turn it into bay two with the completed product in bay three. Chicken ring. Let the hens pick through your food scraps and what they don't eat will turn into compost and fertilizer for your garden. And if you live in an apartment, you could use a machine like this that effectively grinds down your kitchen scraps that you can use in potted plants, containers, or maybe at your local community garden.
