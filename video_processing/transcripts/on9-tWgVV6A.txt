 This creamy corn on the cob was so delicious and y'all I just learned that corn does not digest but guess what I'm gonna still eat it though because it's good. Anyways here's how I made it. First I started by boiling my corn for about 15 minutes. For my sauce I used half a stick of butter, minced garlic. I used a little heavy cream and I gave that a nice stir. Then added some shredded parmesan cheese. Once it was fully melted I added in parsley, salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning. Once my corn was fully cooked I tossed it in the sauce until it was fully coated. Y'all see how saucy and good that looks? Oh my gosh. I topped it with more parmesan cheese, more parsley, and more Cajun seasoning. Let me know in the comments if you will be giving this recipe a try.
