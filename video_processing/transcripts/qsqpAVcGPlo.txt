 Les abricots is a beautiful and luxuriant region located at the far end of Haiti. There the local economy relies on agriculture and notably on the cultivation of breadfruit. But this highly nutritious fruit rots extremely rapidly and therefore cannot be stored or shipped. Paradis des Indiens Foundation, supported by the WISE Haiti Task Force, has developed a drying system in partnership with the University of St. Thomas, Minnesota. This dryer allows to transform the breadfruit into flour or flakes which can be preserved longer. An innovation which involves the training of local women to master new techniques. You need to have a timer, a adjustment of the time to start at the same time. You need to put such a quantity, not to exceed the quantity. You need to turn the product from a certain hour. So all that takes a learning. Thanks to this training, the mothers of abricots have become producers of a new commodity that can be sold throughout the country, providing them with a new source of income, a sustainable development for this rural economy. We make our dishes with flour, we sell flour, we eat flour, we eat flour, we pay our meals, we pay our meals, we pay our meals, we pay our meals, we pay our meals. What we're trying to do is to put some discipline, some desire in those ladies to work together. And I believe that if they work together, they have interest to work together mentally, financially, and also they will work happier. You don't separate work from life, you don't separate learning for life, learning for culture, learning for work. We learn at school, we learn at the workplace, and we learn in the community, we learn through the media. We use technology to help us learn better. In Haiti, lifelong learning is also the key to addressing the environmental issues of the island, while optimizing agricultural production. This approach is at the heart of the work done by the people from Gros Morne Association, supported by the WISE Haiti Task Force. The association trains the local population to use sustainable techniques, like organic farming and composting. The best and more products are a reason to help us out of the situation and the problem of food we have. The time is modernized, so we have to have a training for new techniques. We learn how to grow up with mango, so we can learn how to grow up with mango, and then we learn how to plant tomatoes. The Train is a Haitian agronomy students who work for free during their holidays. While the farmers learn how to manage their crops, the students get the field experience they need to complete their degree. As such, it's a win-win situation. In the beginning, the families are already accustomed to the teaching, and they're going to grow up with mango. It's not just what's going on when the children are growing up, it's just that you're growing up with mango. They are really happy and they say they are learning a lot from the students, and the students as well. They say that it's a really good opportunity for them to come to places like this, to put their knowledge into practice and learn from the population as well. as well. And you know what is important is that we are creating a bridge between the student body and the working market. It looks like a utopian idea, it looks very generous, but in fact it is very simple, it's just a matter of realizing that the way we have structured our education system so far is in itself defeating and presenting the idea of lifelong learning as something coming at the end of the process. Thank you.
