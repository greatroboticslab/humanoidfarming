What happens when you switch farmland from livestock to crops?

 Well on the surface here we've got a lovely layer of moss and blue-green algae. My work's focusing on soil as a living system and the role that microbes and organic carbon play in nutrient turnover and nutrient use efficiency for agriculture. There's a lot of concern about the gaseous emissions from livestock and a lot of concern of people's sort of natural instincts that we shouldn't be eating quite as much meat or perhaps any meat. And we need to think about the consequences of that for farmers here in the southwest where traditionally they've made a living from growing livestock. If they're forced to look for other sources of income then of course wheat would be one of the natural ones and we need to understand the consequences of them making those decisions, both for their income and also for the environment. So I've been working extensively on some of the long-term experiments at Harpenden and we've used them to effectively create a new theory of how we think soil works. And from that we've just started to extend those experiments to now look down here in Devon at the consequences of taking long-term pasture into arable production to potentially replace livestock agriculture in the southwest. So based on our experiments at Harpenden what we've found is that long-term arable, and we're talking about 170 years worth of arable production, has caused a loss of organic carbon in soils from about 80 tonnes per hectare, which is what the soils naturally hold at Harpenden, down to about 30 tonnes per hectare. So over that 170 years there's been a loss of more than half of the organic carbon in those soils as a consequence of that management. In the treatments that have had farmyard manure over that time, the organic carbon has maintained at about 80 tonnes per hectare. So we know that having livestock manures is critically important to sustaining soil fertility and soil health. Here at Northwick we're at the very beginning of following that transition, and although we're only about six years in we can already see that the tilled arable systems like this one behind me are already starting to lose carbon relative to the pastures around them. So in Harpenden we're looking at the end point after 170 years, here we're looking at the very early stages and looking at the rates at which those changes occur. So understanding how first of all soil functions with carbon at its heart allows us to understand how we can manage that resource and how we can use it most effectively. And we know that if we can use it effectively we can reduce farming's requirement for water, and that's going to be a critical issue as the country has longer hotter summers. And we also know that it can reduce the amount of inorganic fertiliser that's applied to soil, and they have their own big carbon footprint associated with them. So understanding how we manage carbon in soil can address a lot of different aspects of farming's contribution to climate change. right now wo Headnew� so this is just about expanding the farm into a recreational environment. The parts of 직질 fans and access to climate change a fun comparison, and I'm just companies pursuing this presentation which are the sandändi here. It's really cool to know that its sich dot com is getting deep Congratulations. So many different voices we know... and especially sequences come together much from Sierra Leone. What is it supposed to be that call a solid type of field? We'll see people here at S Spider Leone.
