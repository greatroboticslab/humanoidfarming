 All right, so when you look at a satellite image, you see this massive amount of territory that turns green because of this little canal there. That canal is called the Canal of Joseph. Joseph dug that over to the Fayum region so that that whole place could be flooded and irrigated to increase the amount of farmlands. What's interesting about this is in Egyptian mythology, only death happened west of the Nile. So all of the pyramids of Egypt happened to the west because that's where the sun sets and is buried. And with God ordaining this for Joseph, it's just fascinating that life, what saves Egypt, all the life pushes out to the west and you have an oasis in the west, which to the Egyptians would have been totally counterintuitive, that life could come from the land of death.
