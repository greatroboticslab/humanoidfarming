 Hi, I just want to show you some of the different things we have. We have a 19, I think, 25 Chevy truck. We have an old water tank here. You can see the old rivets on it. It's actually for use for steam engines. We have a plow. We have an old log wagon here. And over back behind here we have an old cedar. So come on down and see all this.
