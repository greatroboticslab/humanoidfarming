 Music My name is Dr. Simon Ngulu. I am lucky to have been born in Dryland. I've lived in Dryland for more than half a century. And I have experienced a lot of the problems that are here. And if they are blessings, I reap them. I was also lucky to train in agriculture. I have a PhD in agriculture. I did studies here in Kenya and also overseas. I've also been an extension worker communicating to people, to farmers. And I have done this for over seven years, talking to farmers. Music I also went to research after working with farmers. And I wondered to know what can we do to sort out these problems that I experienced and I also saw on farms. And I went to work with the KARI, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute. Now it is KARI. It is Kenya Agricultural Livestock Research Organization. And I was there for over 20 years doing research. And I've always asked myself, can we do something to dry land? Because I've lived here and I've seen even my parents farming. You do 10 seasons and you can get a crop in three seasons. But my parents did not have much options. They could not move to areas where there is a lot of water. They just stick. And so it meant that we need to look for solutions for them. What we call improved. The technologies that will improve food production, we have to test them on a farm. And luckily, they bought this idea. In fact, it's in Katumani Center, where we started what we call farmers approach. All farm approach. Where we start with a farmer and end up with a farmer. That means after we develop technologies, we go and test them on a farm. I did that for many years. And my experience is that you cannot be very convinced. And even convince farmers. If you are not doing it on your farm. And the best testimony is to do it and you talk to the farmers come and they see. You talk to them and they see it on your farm. There are many things that you learn when you are doing. It's called experiential learning. Learning through experience. There are many things farmers don't tell you. And you learn them when you do them. And that's the reason why I have come myself to test myself the technologies on a farm. So that I can see those things, those ones that work. And to say this, I say, I have done this in terms of theory. I published 42 papers in peer reviewed journals. I have written some books for extension and some for reading. And so what I talk about here, I am convinced that this is it. If people take this, we will change our food situation in Kenya. moon Came back as well and about on top.
