 The majority of broiler chickens and turkeys today are raised by independent farmers under contract to poultry companies. However, concerns often arise around the economic effects and fairness of ag production contracts. Roger McOwen with the Washburn School of Law joins us now with a closer look. Roger, good to have you with us. What are some of the common factors of these types of contracts? Good to be with you, Tammy. I mean, this is a big issue in agriculture and has been in both poultry and hog industries for quite some time. But some of the common factors would be that the farmer supplies the facilities and the labor and the integrator supplies the livestock or the birds, as well as the seeds and the feed and other supplies. And the integrator, and this is an important point, retains title to those inputs. And the farmer gets paid a contract specified amount for their labor services that are typically, that amount is going to be based on the quantity and quality of the final product that is produced. Often the farmer is going to have to borrow money to build a facility to the specifications of the integrator. And that's a key aspect of this arrangement. And I understand that these contracts can raise concerns about one-sidedness and unconscionable terms. Why is that? Well, that's because the contracts are often not negotiable. It's a disparity of bargaining power between the parties. They're often proposed on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. And that's because there are few options that the farmer has because the industry is highly concentrated. For example, in poultry, the top four firms control 54 percent of the national market. And regionally, that concentration can be a lot higher, upwards of 80, 85 percent in certain parts of the country. So there just aren't options for farmers. And that's why you get what can be a pretty one-sided contract. Do you have any specific examples you can share with us? Well, there have been a number of court cases over the past 20, 25 years involving ag production contracts. For example, the Eighth Circuit said in 2001 that the only remedy a farmer may have in these situations might be based on state law. And that was a case that allowed the integrator to terminate the contract at any time without cause. And it caused quite an uproar in southwestern Minnesota and northwestern Iowa when a number of producers had their contracts just terminated with no notice. And there have been cases where the courts have said that arbitration clauses in these contracts are valid. Those have been upheld. So you can't go to court directly. You have to go through arbitration. And most courts hold that the farmer is an independent contractor with no protections under various laws designed to apply to employees. And that's a point that Congress is currently looking into at the present time. Some interesting dynamics there. We appreciate that update. That's Roger McOwen with the Washburn School of Law.
