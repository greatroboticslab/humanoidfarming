Science & Technology
 This is how you can grow aeroponic crops without the use of soil. Put your seeds in a soilless grow media such as rockwool or coco coir. Water the seedlings for three weeks, then assemble your tower garden by first adding the central rods and then connect a submersible pump to the base. Afterwards, stack the growing sections to your desired height. Fill up the reservoir with water mixed with a soluble ionic mineral nutrient solution with a 1 to 300 ratio. Set the irrigation pump to 3 minutes on and 12 minutes off continuously. Add your three week old seedlings to the growing cavities by using the growing clips to fit it in place. And that's it! You'll be able to harvest most leafy greens within 30 days.
