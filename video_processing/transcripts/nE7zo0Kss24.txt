 I'm here in Coffey County at a large-scale commercial farm where farming practices are constantly evolving and it's leading to healthier soils. I'm here with Adam Daugherty who's from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Services. So what would you say are the principles of no-till farming? Okay, well you know no-till farming is not really a system. It's just a tool that we use to be able to plant a crop with limited disturbance which is one of the four principles of soil health is you know eliminate disturbance, keep something growing all the time, a lot of diversity and keep the soil covered or armored and the no-till planter is just one of the tools that allows us to be able to do that. The magic and what we're doing out here lies between our ears when we finally got an understanding of how nature's designed to work, how our soils are designed to function and then it's our job as humans to start to learn how to manage in this which it is it has been a transformation for us. Planting in what you see right here is a totally different game than planting in stand-alone no-till ground that's pretty clean and a big difference in planting in conventional ground so it takes a high level management a high level understanding. Well Phillip what we got here is we've got a field of diverse cover crop species mix that we've yet to terminate this field's not been planted this field was planted back this past fall with several different species. This is one of our Austrian winter peas that we pulled up in here this is a legume nitrogen fixing legume real early to put on nodulation so we get a lot of nitrogen production out of this and we'll plant these in a mix like this and a rate of you know around four pounds per acre in the mix and it's we really like it winter survives does a good job easy to plant into. Uh-huh and this kind of purple flowery one right here. This is another one of our legumes that we're planting a lot of this is hairy vetch big time nitrogen producer you know you can look at you know a lot of different diversity in plant structure and composition which this one leads to when we're rolling and terminating these covers this vetch almost acts kind of like a velcro. It looks like the main one out here is this is it oats or? This here is cereal rye this is a bruise cereal rye it gets pretty tall you know one thing that's a lot different this is one of our cereal grains we put these in here because these legumes that I've just showed you once we've terminated this and got our crash crop planted they'll be recycled real quick our lower carbon nitrogen ratio residue that we have whereas our cereal grains the cereal rye will be a lot higher so once we get this down it won't be cycled through the soil as quick our goal is to rejuvenate modern agriculture as we know it yeah you know we're not organic yet but we're not tilling sure I don't know when we'll get there we're seeing a tremendous reduction in inputs the only inputs that are used on the farm is not nutrients with nitrogen phosphorus potassium we have a lot of sprays we've had any time that we have to fire up and provide labor to this field that's an input that that costs producers money and you know there's going to be some happy medium someday where I don't really think we'll get totally organic I think I think we'll still be using some commercial inputs on these large-scale operations but when we start looking at pesticide reductions herbicide reductions less passes you know and then get these soils where they're more resilient then it's just going to be a win-win where we're going to have a happy balance you know healthier soils lead to healthier foods and I have to say also as an onlooker this is a lot more nice to look at than an empty dirt field it does it has you know not only will it have a lot of static values for folks that are passing by but when they go put their kayaks in the streams right they're not being clear water when they go catch fish it's going to be in clean water when they turn on the faucet at the house all in turn it is not cost a taxpayer less money to treat that water than if we're sending turbid water into our municipal water supply so it starts up here at the head of the watersheds and it goes all the way you know to the Gulf Gulf of Mexico the hypoxia the dead layer if we had the landscape covered in this as it was designed to function yeah we wouldn't have a hypoxia you know but this is you know one county one state's going to change the nation we've got to shift agriculture to this both from monetarily reasons you know for producers to be more more productive and also from environmental standpoint you know when we are when we're doing this on our fields this addresses all resource concerns what we're doing here is we're just mimicking nature if you if you look at these fence rows these woodlots the plateau in the background it's always got something growing on it it's got a lot of diversity it's always capturing sunlight and there's no disturbance we're not running plows we're not we're not spraying chemicals up there on in these natural ecosystems so that's all we're doing once we started implementing the cover crops is we're just starting to mimic nature in the way we're growing our cash crops now we understand that we're always going to be trying to go against nature because these fields were never designed to have a monoculture grown grown on them four or five six months out of the year but we're working with nature as opposed to how we used to work against her with the heavy tillage with a lot of chemicals now we're starting to work in tune with her a little bit more and she's really paying off for us yeah yeah that's good but what we're really concentrating on is the below ground the the biomat the living critters that are underneath our feet right now and you know in a teaspoonful of healthy soil we have over a billion microbes which they're all microscopic we can't see them but that's really what's doing the work for us the bacteria the nematodes protozoa the fungi relationships that we're getting that's what we're trying to promote and the main thing is is when we're capturing sunlight all they want is liquid sugar the carbon so we're pumping a lot to it right now so therefore we're getting a big flux in our in our microbial populations and keeping keeping a plant life on top of that and not tilling you're protecting them correct we are I mean several things we're not destroying the house through tillage but we're also feeding them so we got new carbon coming in we've got old carbon in our organic matter so it's you know think of it is like if you go to a buffet if all you got at the buffet is just lettuce you know you're gonna survive but you're not gonna be real happy right we've got lettuce mashed taters peach pie we've got it all going on here so not only do we have a lot of eaters we're keeping them all happy right that's a really good example of that you'll see the ease at which that shovel goes in the ground uh-huh don't have any compaction and then as we look at this ground here you know we see we already see some big biology with the earthworms right but you see the aggregation in this see how that soil is crumbly right there oh yeah okay we like for our soil to start looking like black cottage cheese when we start getting to look like black cottage cheese then then we got a lot of aggregation a lot of pore space you'll see all the root channels coming down you'll even see some mycorrhizal fungi interactions going on see all the little soil aggregates forming around the roots that's why it's so important to keep a living plant growing these soil aggregates they're not formed one time and last forever they're like our skin they're constantly reproducing so about every 22 to 27 days it's the life of a soil aggregate they can only form around living roots one of the first things that we'll start seeing when we enter start integrating these systems is returning the water cycle to our soils and when you get a soil with this type of structure this porosity this soil here will infiltrate water at 20 inches in excess of 20 inches per hour so when we get a rain it's going into the ground instead of running off yeah and uh what's a typical farm uh our long-term no-till fields that we've seen in the county will average somewhere two inches to a little less than two inches per hour infiltration rate after two years of cover most of our fields are in excess of seven of eight and then as we keep doing this it keeps getting better and better our natural wood lots where these fields started from infiltrate excess of 60 inches per hour wow so that's where we're working but we're trending in the right direction and what's the summer crop that we're growing here uh the summer will come in with soybeans this year okay this we had had corn on it last year we'll come back into soybeans and this field here has predominantly had a corn soybean rotation since it was brought back into crop production probably seven eight years ago it had been just in a pasture setting and when we brought it back into cropland from the start went from no-till straight into no-till and cover crops and it's been doing that for you know six seven years now yeah and uh what we've seen in this field in uh 2014 which was a real good growing season we had here this field here won the state dryland no-till corn growing competition they have a competition across the state and then it placed nationally nationally in like six seventh place nationally with over very high yield this thing had over 315 bushel per acre dryland corn wow even more impressive than that was last year this area here was in a d4 drought and this thing had over 250 bushel dryland corn growing on it in a d4 drought situation and what that just shows is the more the healthier we get this soil the more microbial action we get it just leads to natural resilience sure we've spent years and years degrading this resource and it's going to take us a while to be able to rejuvenate it but we're on the right track and we finally learned how to manage in nature's image and and and ultimately rejuvenate our resource yeah that's awesome you're doing some really good work here thank you for inspiring garden tours growing tips and garden projects visit our website at volunteergardener.org or
