Travel & Events
 We are very interactive with our guests so we really do consider ourselves a farmstay. You're not just coming to, it's not heads and beds, you're not just coming to stay in our lodging, you're coming to interact with us and we like to show you what we do. Our guests really want that experiential vacation. The educational side is really important to me too. This is a farmer in general but also as an extension professional just sort of seeing the light bulb moment go off for people and if we can do that in a way where it's not always going to be an overt education but it's also going to be just being surrounded by the education that's a really nice fit. With sites like Yonder and Hip Camp it's people looking for more of the hands-on experience. They're looking to be outdoors, they're looking to be involved. Authenticity means for us to not actually to offer the guests what they are expecting but what it is true and so the truthness for us is that things, everything is truly made by our own hands and the result is that guests really feel a part of it, the part of our living and working life in nature. Because it really is about connecting people in all different kinds of ways to celebrate food, to celebrate their families, our family and the farm itself too.
