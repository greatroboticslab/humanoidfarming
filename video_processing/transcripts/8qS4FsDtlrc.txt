 Messicks, a helping hand with your land. Mule from Messicks here. Outside today in our equipment rental yard to talk to you a little bit about buying a piece of equipment out of a dealer's rental fleet and what some of the pros and cons of that can be. Buying a piece of equipment out of a dealer rental yard can be a great way to save a little bit of money on your purchase. But there's certainly a fairly long list of both pros and cons that you can talk through in making a purchase in that way. The first thing we'll talk through is the cons. What are some of the obvious concerns that you can have about buying a piece of rental equipment? The very first thing that obviously comes to mind is what has been done with it, right? What were the operators like? What kind of life has that thing had up until that point? That's a very legitimate concern is something you definitely want to put eyes on. Oftentimes, you can evaluate that by taking a look at the machine itself and looking for some of the physical signs of abuse, right? Go around and look for dented up sheet metal, scratched up paint, torn up tracks or tires, bent up loader buckets and those kinds of things. That can tell you what the operators of that unit may have been like. A lot of times, you really only have those signs to go off of. A machine's hour meter and how long it's been run aren't necessarily a good indicator of how it was treated, right? You could have a machine with 200 hours on it, but if it was out at a long-term rental to a kind operator, it can come away looking really, really good. Conversely, a machine with really low hours on it could have gone out seven, eight times to a whole host of different people and really beat up. Hours, we tend to not get too concerned about when we're looking at that rental piece, but physical condition is something you definitely want to put eyes on. Outside of the usage of the machine, there's some definite cons that you can come up with in terms of that machine and a secondary buyer, right? Because that machine is now not brand new, if it's owned by an independent rental yard or a major rental chain, things like manufacturer financing and warranties likely aren't going to be available anymore. Those things would have been started when they were purchased by that organization and went into their inventory for rental use. There are, however, those some major differences when you're possibly buying a machine out of a dealer's rental fleet. Dealer rental fleets are actually treated a lot differently than what those independent rental yards are. When we have a machine, a dealer rental fleet, we have them in one of two different categories. A dealership can usually buy a piece of equipment for rental using exactly the same programs as what those independent rental chains can. Independent rental is kind of a classification of use that gets some preferred pricing and preferred programs, much like nonprofits or government entities and those kinds of things. Do they get discounts that aren't necessarily always available to everybody? If you've taken all of those programs, you started that rental process, that start to your warranty, that start to your financing that's just simply not available anymore. However, dealer rental fleets can also have another category of machines where they're still treated as brand new inventory. Just like a complete fresh unit sitting on your lot, a rental machine in a dealer rental fleet can often be sold with exactly the same fresh manufacturer's warranty and the same fresh subsidized manufacturer financing that's available on a brand new machine. You always want to clarify if you're buying a machine from a dealer rental fleet, which bucket does it fall into? You often might be able to pick that up on your own by looking at the pricing of that unit. That process of starting the warranty and starting the financing usually results in a significant discount. Those machines are usually a lot less expensive than a more expensive machine that's going to have them available to you. Looking at the pricing of the unit there, if you see a $10,000 discount, it's very likely those things aren't available anymore. If you see a $3,000, $4,000 discount on a machine with a handful of hours, there's a very good chance that they are. We've got some definite cons to buying that rental unit. You can be concerned about what happened to it or what kind of financing and warranty things may be available, but there's some obvious pros as well. The first and foremost being the price. More often than not, when you're buying a piece of rental equipment, you're buying late model, taking care of equipment. You can make a good assumption that a dealership or an independent rental yard probably has mechanics that are taking care of that piece of equipment because the health of that machine is important to them. One of the major things that you can remember about that is that that 50-hour service. A lot of people aren't really prepared for the fact that when you buy a brand new piece of equipment, there's a really early service interval almost every machine. That's there because you're changing that break in interval. When a machine is brand new, you might get initial wear and that kind of stuff that happens very, very quickly on those brand new components. The first service interval comes surprisingly quickly. It's also surprisingly involved. Most 50-hour services are going to ask for you to drop all the fluids out of the machine, the hydraulics, the engine oil, replace all the filters, and you can get into several hundred dollars in order to do that. It can be a surprisingly expensive service. Buying a rental fleet that was maintained by a rental yard or a dealer rental yard probably means not only are you realizing some lower cost from the depreciation and the profits that were realized in the rent of that machine, but that first service that can be an additional expense to you more than likely has already been performed. Personally, I see a lot of really good deals come out of our rental fleet. A lot of times we're using these programs where we can offer subsidized 0% financing, manufacture warranties, and offer customers really nice sub-200-hour equipment that can save them a good chunk of money. It's definitely a place worth looking for a deal. There are, however, though, a couple of pieces of equipment that I would tell you to be cautious when buying out of a rental situation. A lot of times those are mostly some kind of ground-engaging or working implements because you can really pick up some things that might have a lot of wear and tear on them. Rototillers is probably one of the very first things that I would go to. I question sometimes why we even rent these things because it seems the people that do rent them really seem to do a number on them pretty frequently. If you're looking to buy a rental rototiller, for instance, I'd be really careful. Brooms are another thing that we rent a lot of that you're probably okay buying on the secondary market, but I would be a little careful in what you're exactly buying. For us, we are often renting brooms for snow rental. When they go out for snow rental, they're being used to sweep sidewalks and roads and that kind of thing, usually around hospitals or retirement communities and those kinds of things where they have to get every bit of snow possible off of those surfaces because they got vulnerable people walking on them. Good things to consider because while they're only out for a short period of time, but an inexperienced operator running a broom can wear the brushes out really quickly. If somebody takes that thing, buries it into the ground and runs it really trying to get everything off of that sidewalk, they can wear the bristles down very quickly and replacing one of those brushes can be really expensive. Do put eyes if you're looking at a rental broom. I've got four out here I'd sell you. Make sure the brushes are in good condition and measure those bristles versus the length of a brand new one and make sure you've got good health and good life left there. Another place that you want to be careful would be on auger bits. We don't tend to turn these very often. Sometimes it's the off sizes that we do, but this is one of those things again, because it's ground engaging can take some wear and tear. If you look down here on the teeth, you'll see that our 18-incher here has been used quite a bit, and these teeth are really worn off. It may not be a big deal. You only got a couple of holes to drill and you want to save some money on a bit. Hey man, I'd sell you the one out of rental, but you want to figure into the cost of that maybe going across and replacing some of these teeth so that they're good and sharp and the thing bites when you want it to dig. If we keep going across here, hammers are definitely another maintenance and wear item. It's something that people that are inexperienced can do some significant damage to as well. Really good rental piece for us. They go out a lot because it's an expensive item that it's hard to justify ownership of for small operators. Definitely, you want to talk through your service department and have them pull the records on these hammers. If they're dry-fired, damage can be done to them, and they're hard pieces in order to service and maintain. It takes a lot of expense in order to keep them up. You definitely want to put eyes and make sure the work was put into taking care of the piece before you buy it. That's a little bit about the pieces that we have out here in our rental yard. If you're looking for a deal, it is always worth asking. Like I said, with about 80 major pieces of rental equipment, plus a lot of attachments and those kinds of things, we often have deals to offer. If you need a piece of equipment and you're thinking you'd like it for a couple of months out, by all means drop a bug in our ear and we'll keep an eye out there for something. Maybe we can tell you something that we know is going to become available here after a couple of rents or so. If you're going through that buying process and you could use a piece of equipment, give us a call at Messick's. We're available at 800-222-3373 or online at messicks.com. We'll see you next time.
