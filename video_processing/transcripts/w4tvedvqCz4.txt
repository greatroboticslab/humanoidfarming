 Currently there are over 800 million people who are deprived of the necessary supply of food to maintain a healthy lifestyle. That's about 1 in 9 people who go to sleep each night hungry. And with our ever growing population, agricultural output will need to increase 70% by 2050 in order to feed the public. Because of this, we desperately need to increase the production of staple cereal crops. This is where my idea comes in. I created an aqueous solution using rhizobia bacteria from the roots of common legumes that can immensely increase the growth and germination rates of cereal crops. Rhizobia bacteria are a nitrogen-fixing certain of diazotrophic bacteria that can sense flavonoids accreted by the roots of the host legume plants. These flavonoids trigger no olfactors which can lead to hair deformation through which the rhizobia enter and cellular responses within the host plant. Consequently, cell division occurs in the cortex of the root and the nodule eventually appears. Infections rather than grow into the nodule, transporting rhizobia bacteria into the cells causing them to become bacterioids, which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into plant-useful ammonium using the soil enzyme nitrogenase. I hypothesized that rhizobia could be introduced to the seeds of cereal crops in order to increase their growth and production rates by increasing the potency of their nitrogen cycle. To test this prediction, I designed an experiment in which I harvested over 400 grams of rhizobia nodules from the roots of over 5 pounds of trifolium subterranean species of clover using a sterilized fine-tooth comb. Then I soaked the rhizobia in a distilled water potassium solution at ratios of 4 grams of rhizobia to 20 grams of water and 4 grams of rhizobia to 40 grams of water. I tested 195 total corn seeds, 65 of each being soaked in each solution in distilled water, and over 5,500 rice seeds as well. My experiment proved that the germination time significantly decreased when either seed was exposed to the 4-20 rhizobia solution. After further monitoring, I weighed each dehydrated plant and discovered that the weight of the rhizobia exposed was 58% greater than that of the control groups. My project can considerably increase the production rates of cereal crop farmers globally, which decreases the hunger crises and assists in bettering poverty-stricken countries' lifestyles. My name is Kareena Anderson, and thank you for considering my project. For a long term in fishing your fish, I have a great space. For more spoils, we are another naked study. They are one that of these garden potatoes, or squares and even its ashes. Here, I am a leader of each owner. I will visit you today.
