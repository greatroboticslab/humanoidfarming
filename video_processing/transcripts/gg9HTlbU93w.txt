 Hi, my name is Connor Massimo and I'm a physiotherapist and fellow of CAMPT. Today I've organized a group of my friends and fellow CAMPT colleagues to do some manual therapy myth busting. Myth number one, physiotherapists use hands-on manual therapy to realign the spine. The truth is, variations in spinal alignment are very common and in fact we don't have a lot of evidence to show that these variations cause pain or dysfunction. Even if we could prove that there's a link between alignment and pain, we simply don't have the evidence to support that we can realign someone's spine with our hands. Myth two, manual therapy techniques can be used to break up adhesions and stretch fascia. The truth is that fascia is very very strong and resistant to lengthening. For example, it takes more than 2,000 pounds of force to lengthen the IT band by 1%. No matter how strong your physiotherapist is, they can't apply that kind of force. Myth number three, that pop or crack that you hear with the spinal manipulation is actually the joint being put back into place. That pop you hear is actually called a cavitation, a collapse of an air bubble within the joint space and creating a cracking noise, similar to when you crack your knuckles. Although that crack may be satisfying to both the therapist and the patient, there is evidence to suggest spinal manipulations can be effective with or without the pop. So you may be wondering, if my physiotherapist can't realign my spine, break up adhesions in my tissues, or put my joints back in place, why bother using hands-on manual physiotherapy at all? Here's our why. We use manual therapy in our practice because we understand the power and healing benefits of human touch. We know that manual therapy helps the short-term pain relief and mobility, which we also help increase the patient's confidence in getting back to doing the things they love. We understand the complexities of the people that we treat and know that there are many options to treat their pain. We use manual therapy to teach people about how their bodies move so they can feel confident moving more on their own. We use manual therapy as a part of a multimodal approach that includes client education, relationship building, and movement to get people back to the activities they love.
