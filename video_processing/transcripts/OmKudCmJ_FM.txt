 Here's how we dealt with our aggressive rooster. This is Chick Jagger, formerly known as Chickie Minaj, and he was starting to act madder than a cat walking through a dog's fart. It's not uncommon for roosters to be territorial and try to protect the flock, but my wife and I couldn't have him spurring us every time we walked into the coop. Now let me first say that I am by no means an expert, and I've learned most of what I know about chickens through Experience, YouTube, and Google. What I ended up doing was mixing 1 third cup of white vinegar and 3 quarters cup of water in a spray bottle. Anytime Chickie decided he wanted to buck up or actually spur me, I went ahead and sprayed him in the face. The vinegar doesn't harm the chicken, but it does sting him a little bit, making him regret the decision to wake up and choose violence. For a period of time I would walk away and come back, and if he decided he wanted to fight, he would get that liquid encouragement to not do so. It's not an immediate solution, and it takes some training over time to get the aggression to go down. Chickens are very intelligent creatures, and you'll find that with some time and dedication you can train a lot of unwanted behaviors out of your flock. Mark that Joe Would Not
