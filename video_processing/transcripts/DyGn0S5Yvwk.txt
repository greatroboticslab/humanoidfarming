 Hey guys, in this video I'm going to show you how to do the new sprinkler method in Grow a Garden. This method is super helpful if you want to boost your crop growth and get some insane results. Without further ado, let's dive right in. To do this, you're going to need a basic sprinkler, advanced, godly sprinkler, and the most important one, master sprinkler. You'll also want to get the honey sprinkler if you can. It's optional, but it makes the results even better. Here's the thing about the honey sprinkler. It's sold at the honey shop, but it's not always in stock, so you've got to check back every hour or so. But don't stress it if you can't get it right away. The method still works without it. Just make sure you have the main four sprinklers, because those are essential to make this method work. Once you've got your sprinklers ready, go ahead and set up your best crops. I recommend do this to moon melons, cacaos, or candy blossoms. Make sure they're fresh and there are no crops already grown on the spot. Now place your sprinklers. Start with the basic, then advanced, godly, and finally the master sprinkler. If you've got the honey sprinkler, go ahead and place that too. And if you see me placing more than one of each type, don't worry about that. One of each works just fine. You don't need to place extras unless you just want to. After that, all you've got to do is leave the game. Yup, just exit and come back in like two to three hours. When you return, you're going to see something crazy. Your crops will turn huge. Some will have gold mutations. And you might even see rainbow variants growing. That's how you know the method is working. And when you finally get your hands on the honey sprinkler, just go ahead and add it to your setup for even better results. So yeah, that's how to do the new sprinkler method in Grow a Garden. It's super easy and super worth it. If this helped you out, make sure to drop a like and maybe hit that subscribe button for more tips. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one.
