It's another important workhorse on some farms. That's forage equipment and machinery. Pete is scouring farm country in search of deals. I tell you what folks, the last few weeks I've seen some very strong prices on good condition used hand forage equipment. Now for examples, let's start off last Tuesday on a farm auction up in northeast Wisconsin where this like-new H&S RR420 rotary rake sold for $8,500. Now that's the highest auction price I've ever seen on an RR420 rotary rake. Now a week before that, same area out in northeast Wisconsin, April 6th, this really sharp Case IH FXH 300 Forge Chopper with a pair of heads on it. You can see how nice condition it was. It sold for $39,000. Very, very strong price there. Now if we keep walking back in time, let's go to April 3rd out in an auction, farm auction in north central New Jersey where this super sharp New Holland BC 5070 square baler sold for $20,000. Now that's the record high auction price I've seen on any BC 5070. Now let's walk back a couple weeks before that. We'll stay with a baler, but let's go round baler. March 17th, consignment auction, north central Iowa, this very sharp 2015 Vermeer 605N with just under 2,400 bales through it. Sold for $39,000. Now here again, very strong price considering that round baler is six years old. And folks, I'll leave you with one more example. We'll go out to north central Ohio February 13th where this trusty old New Holland 479 Haybine sold for $5,000. Highest auction price I've ever seen on a 479 Haybine.
