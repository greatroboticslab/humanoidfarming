 I have to admit growing up with a mom that didn't really restrict me when it came to my outfits, hair, and makeup within reason was so refreshing because I feel like I never felt the need to rebel or like go to the extreme. Seriously, I'd walk downstairs in a crop top and she'd be like, it looks amazing.
