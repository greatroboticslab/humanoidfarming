 Production, or what most of us refer to as farming, is actually a very small part of agribusiness. Think of it like this. Agribusiness entails all of those things that the farmer needs, the inputs to get that product out on the market. So whether it's equipment, chemical, fertilizer, seed, we need people who are out there in the field getting this product to the grow. The agribusiness technology degree at Boca County Community College is designed to give students the training they need to enter managerial jobs in the agribusiness workforce in Eastern North Carolina. It's also for the students who want to stay on their own family farm. There's a lot of money that has to pass through their hands, and we need managers to take care of that money. And so we prepare students to go back home as well. If students choose, they can transfer to other agricultural colleges or universities in North Carolina to get their four-year degree without losing any credits. Agriculture is North Carolina's number one industry, and in Northeastern North Carolina, there just simply wasn't any program available to train students for managerial positions. Boca County Community College was a pioneer five years ago in establishing this program. You know, agriculture has changed so much in the last 50 years. Now we have precision agriculture, GPS, drones, doing jobs that people frankly used to do. We now have to train a workforce for an entirely different face in agriculture. Most students aren't aware of the employment opportunities that are available in agribusiness. We receive calls on a continual basis, companies that are looking for students graduating with that associate's degree. They're looking for those students that are prepared to take those management level positions. They should a天's degree by choosing a thing to please. You got a whole trained instructor in education linked toAyum вход. So there is another mentor. We usually try to celebrate the economic priority. It's very strong unique and easy.
