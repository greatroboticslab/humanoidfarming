Oh, that's a fucking slag. Oh, that's a fucking slag. fucking slag she's going, she's going yes oh no I didn't, I didn't touch it it was definitely running on diesel then a lot of air in there yeah is that alright? it's leaking a lot of fuel leaking a lot of fuel oil from what? just hold that i'm going to try and see if it was a little bit nhi your your your So yeah right is out of gear I'll get more fat out gone what a babe so we got trouble with the transmission but we knew that it will work in range five in reverse one all the other gears are slipping I've not gone up to eight because I've out wheelied when I went in five so it's going to need the back end taken to pieces the steering doesn't work common thing apparently on these power shifts I don't want to be to rev it up I'll try backwards again I'll try forwards here we go there's two three four get ready for a wheelie all right we're away we're away it's a little bit scary to drive like this you've got no steering at all we don't really want to run everything over so you can stop on the well yes well it did went well it went very well it's been parked in Jurassic Park it backs up fine reverse gears you've only got fifth forwards I didn't dare go any higher because it wanted to do the big wheelie it's not too bad it is um it must be drawing air still because as soon as you move and jiggle it well when the transmission's in do you notice it kills it a bit that engine sounds sweet as fuck doesn't it that with a good service take the fuel tank off good clean I reckon the engine will be the tits let's put that snorkel on because it's going to fill it up with water so the gearbox is obviously quite poorly and we've got many things on the go at the minute stuff that we can't even talk about yet because I've got to have a phone call with someone about something before I can even mention that but that'll be coming soon we have thanks to Adam got a man called Big Dave who is this John Deere specialist and he's going to have a go at splitting the gearbox because apparently there's a five there's three sets of clutch plates packs in it but obviously power shift transmission most of the packs have burnt out the brake packs are probably also dodgy but we think it's worth worth restoring so we're going to send it out to Big Dave see if he can mend the gearbox and maybe we'll have it ready for bailing next year for Dad can we add anything else to that? we don't need to stop it do you need to add anything else? you're a j****** but they already knew that yeah so um obviously the fuel tank's full of water the fuel filters are full of shit and water that's broken the AC radiator's been stolen the oil cooler's been stolen the binnacle above the where are all your heater controls that's been stolen the badge has been stolen the badge has been stolen so if anyone's got John Deere bits like that we're going to need a well and we also don't have a key because we had to borrow Joe's key and we had to give Joe his key back we had to give Joe his key back we had to give Joe his key back we had to give Joe his key back thank you all for watching see you again little angry pics oh tasty oh hey oh hey
