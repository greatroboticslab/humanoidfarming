 Chemical Pesticides. New Nine on Your Side is Taja Davis, spoke with the University of Arizona research team, trying to find a safer alternative to the chemical pesticides widely used in the United States. To keep plants from dying of plant-based diseases, they're sprayed with pesticides. Now, chemical pesticides are widely available, but there aren't many options that are ideal for environmental safety and cost. In trying to make a safer environment for everyone and reduce chances of diseases, scientists for many years now, they have been focusing on alternatives to chemical pesticides. By studying a specific type of nematode, entomology professor Dr. Patricia Stock and her team discovered new compounds from a bacterial strain native to Arizona. They're hoping those compounds can potentially replace chemical pesticides. We have identified four compounds, and that we are testing these compounds for their nematicidal activity. The work is being done in the lab right now, but we want to move into greenhouse, implant assays, and potentially in the future field applications. PhD candidate Ayako Kusakabe and undergrad researcher Luis Ruiz are students that have crucial roles in this research. Kusakabe isolates and identifies specific compounds, while Ruiz takes those compounds and tests them against parasitic fungi. Unfortunately, many pesticides are carcinogenic, you know, have hampered the health of wildlife and other animals. So it's better if we live in an environment free of chemical pesticides. In the future, these discovered compounds could be developed by a manufacturer into a more natural alternative pesticide. Taja Davis, Kega9, on your side. And turning now to...
