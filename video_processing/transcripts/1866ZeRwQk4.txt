 If you don't like boring meals but still want to eat healthy, then you need variety, just like farms do. Planting different crops isn't just for looks. It keeps soil healthy, stops pests from taking over, and helps farmers grow more food, year after year. Imagine only eating pizza every day, your body would miss out on important stuff. Farms are the same. Crop diversity means less chemicals, more food, and a happier planet. So next time you see a colorful farm, remember, it's farming done right.
