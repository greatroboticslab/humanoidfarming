 What the heck is an agronomist and how does it relate to equipment rental? An agronomist has education and experience dealing with soil management to optimize the growth of the plant. We rent a lot of specialized equipment that have to do with land restoration. We can offer you the knowledge behind the materials that you're applying to the land. We can do soil samples on your site in order to tailor a fertilizer blend and help you develop a seed blend that meets the environment that you're in where you're trying to plant. Want to use them?
