 These will be the three people I am presenting to. Okay, so to start things off, hi my name is Jada Graves and I am here to inform you about the different methods to breed cattle as well as their advantages and disadvantages and help determine which method would be best for your theoretical operation. So in order to fully understand breeding in cattle, we must first gain an understanding of the different breeding methods, these methods being bull bred or AI, which means artificial insemination, then understand the disadvantages and advantages, and finally we have to determine what would be the best method for your theoretical operation and this can also relate to the time of year, which will be discussed later on. So breeding cattle is a fascinating journey that is all about enhancing the herd's genetics for a prosperous future. So imagine a world where the steak on your plate is a result of careful and scientific selection. That's all that breeding cattle is. I am a sixth generation rancher on my family's beef ranch in Wyoming where we have experience in utilizing both methods in breeding cattle and I want to ranch later on in my future and I have a passion just and a love for animals. So I'm pretty educated in this field. I have first hand experience in selecting a bull and artificially in disseminating heifers as well. So my main points would be deciphering between, you know, bull bred and AI, the disadvantages and advantages, and then just determining what would be best for the operation. So to start things off, bull breeding and artificial insemination is all about improving livestock genetics. Bull breeding is when a bull is introduced to the cows in the pasture and allowed to let nature run its course. Whereas artificial insemination is where the semen of a selected bull is inserted into the cow by hand. AI bulls might not be as genetically superior to the natural service bulls for fertility traits, but further research needs to be done in order to determine other performance measures and how they differ between AI and natural service sired bulls or offspring. So bull breeding is the traditional way where a bull and a cow or a heifer will mate naturally, as was mentioned before. And AI is a more recent discovery and has also many benefits along those same lines. So going on to the next topic would be the advantages and disadvantages of bull breeding or artificial insemination. So the advantages of the bull would be that they are less labor intensive, less risky, and cheaper and more realistic for most operations. However, the disadvantages would be they typically have a longer calving season because the bull, there's only one, only one bull can do so many cows at a time. And then it takes longer to introduce new genetics if you're stuck with that same bull. And they can also lead to less uniformity in the herd because each bull that is like, or each cow that is bred by a bull has a different egg and therefore will calve a different cow. depending on the bull that is used. And if you have a bigger herd, then there has to be more bulls. So that can also lead to less uniformity. Moving on to the advantages of artificial insemination, bulls with a high genetic merit are available to everyone. And that's what everyone really likes about this is they could take a bull from across the country and have their semen and bring it back to their cows without having to pay the price to get the bull. There is a possibility of increased calf performance, but that could go both ways for bull bread and artificial insemination. And the option to sell calves and value added market is also there as an advantage as well. The disadvantages is that it is more labor intensive as you are required to have more help. And it takes, it's a longer like process if it's one cow done by hand. Um, so it, and with it being done by hand, there is a whole process, a whole cleansing process and defrosting of the semen. And then before it's even inserted in the cow in the first place, um, there is more risk involved as you have to have perfect timing. And if you don't have perfect timing, um, then the, like when the cow is the most receptive of this sperm, then it's just going to completely throw off the whole thing. And you may have wasted money for it won't work. And it tends to be more expensive because of all the packaging and all of the methods that they use to get the semen out of the bull. So determining which method to utilize relies on the advantages and disadvantages on that and what the two have to offer. Um, it's very important to analyze these in order to determine what would be your best option for your theoretical, um, breeding or calving season. Uh, but moving on, uh, into determining that would be the, which method would have the higher reproductive performance of fertility. Uh, and it's a huge argument that the time of year will, um, really determine whether it like upgrades or downgrades those, uh, stats. However, that is a lie. The time of year is, um, really important to what the operator has time for. And can sacrifice the most time to fully aid the cows, um, nurture the calves, calve the calves, um, and just keep an eye on their livestock as well as vaccinating and tagging and branding and identifying all those other, uh, ways for just overall identifying their herd. Um, however, the components that would cause a difference in results, whether between the two methods would include the age of the heifer or the cow, the weight and body condition, the genetics for they will all vary. Um, cause every cow and bull is different. Um, however, so in closing, uh, there is no right answer to which method would be best. Um, many productions go about calving in many ways. Whatever suits their business best is what they will rely on. On a personal note, as an example, my family's ranch will utilize both methods, uh, in the fall in order to calve in the spring because we have more time to, like, keep track of our herd and it's easier weather to manage as well. Uh, the major components would be the cost efficiency. Uh, the time of year was brought up as a common argument in the industry, so research was needed in order to settle the debate and it really doesn't matter all that much. Um, all in all, both methods are very capable of getting the job done and the point of the speech was mainly to inform the audience on the different ways that cattle are produced in order to educate them. Um, the sites that were used for this, uh, essay would be the University of Wyoming Reproductive Services, um, AI versus Bull, which is Successful Farming by Johnston G. Uh, then the article titled Using Artificial Insemination in a Commercial Breeding Herd, which is a Penn State Extension. And finally, uh, Marilla MA and, uh, YRR with, um, Bradford HL with an article titled Comparison of Reproductive Performance of AI and Natural Service Sired Beef Females Under Commercial Management. And that is all. Thank you so much.
