 Hi I'm Becky Sunshine. I'm going to talk about the three best backyard chickens. These chickens I'm going to tell you about are heritage breeds and what heritage breeds are they're old-fashioned chickens and just so you can kind of understand what they are there's heirloom garden seeds that are like unchanged they're old-fashioned they come from decades and decades ago and this is also what heritage chickens are they're kind of like heirloom chickens just so you know number one is the Buff Orpington oh my goodness everybody loves a big poofy gold chicken in the coop they're so so beautiful one thing I really really love about the Buff Orpington breed is they're kind of a broody breed and if you want to raise little chicks in your coop with you know a rooster and a hen and hatch them out yourself a Buff Orpington is a must-have they're way more broody than other breeds of chickens and they lay brown eggs number two is the barred Plymouth Rock and a lot of people just call it a barred rock it's a great chicken breed they're kind of black and white and speckly they're very nice to look at they are very cold tolerant breed so if you live in a cold area that is a great chicken to add to your coop or to start your coop with and they are a great multi-purpose breed so if you want to have meat birds and egg birds and you don't want to have a bunch of breeds you can just use the barred rocks for that and also they lay brown eggs number three is the black astral or they are such a sweet sweet breed I have a soft spot for the black astral or you're so cute this is a wonderful chicken breed it's very very gentle and docile it is a black chicken and when you see it in the sunlight it has like little greenish purple iridescent color on its feathers and they're just so sweet and gentle if you have little children or you yourself just need a very meek and mild chicken breed this is definitely the one to get I have one and she's so gentle and sweet I call her sweetie sweetie just follows me around the yard she's so cute she's right here like a little kid right by my side I just love that chicken they lay a light colored brown egg kind of a creamy whitish brown egg you will not be disappointed with these three breeds they are all wonderful chickens they'll be nice in the coop they all will get along very good and you will just have so much fun raising your chickens thanks for watching I'm Becky sunshine
