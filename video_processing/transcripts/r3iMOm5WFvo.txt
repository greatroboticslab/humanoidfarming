 What's up, everybody? Welcome to a special edition of Health Theory. Thinking about everything that's happened with coronavirus, I wanted to share everything I've learned about protecting and boosting your immune health. So lean in, wash your hands, and get ready to become immune. Hint, it's all in your gut. What exactly should we be eating for immune health? Well, you know, all food is information, not just calories. It's all information. It's instructions. It's literally like code that programs your biology with every bite. At like an epigenetic level? At every level. So every bite of food you take can change your gene expression across a whole range of genes. So you drink green tea or eat broccoli, you upregulate the gene called glutathioneus transferase that helps you detoxify heavy metals, environmental chemicals, metabolic toxins. So it regulates your genes. It regulates your hormones. So if you lose starch and sugar, it increases insulin, lowers testosterone, increases estrogen, for example. It affects your brain chemistry and what your hunger hormones are, your craving levels are, and what foods you're attracted to. It affects your immune system. It regulates inflammation or it's anti-inflammatory. It regulates your microbiome with every bite. So every single system of your body is regulated by the quality of the food you eat. And when you realize you shouldn't just focus on calories, you should focus on quality. And the information you're eating changes everything. So that's really what I have people focus on. And I think when people do that, then you have a different relationship to your food. You go, well, I'm eating, am I going to eat toxic information or am I going to eat healing information? So if you had to just put together an all-weather eating strategy, what would the ideal, in air quotes, that... I wrote about it. I wrote a whole book about it. It's called Food, What the Heck Should I Eat? And it's about these principles. I call them the Pegan Principles. And it's really focused on quality first, right? Nobody thinks we should be adding additives and hormones and amiodics and pesticides and glyphosate to our food. Like, it's in it, but nobody's like, yeah, it's important. How do we avoid it at the grocery store? You know, if you look at the label of something, if it has something you can't recognize, pronounce, then you shouldn't have it. Or if you don't have it in your cupboard at home, like butylated hydroxy toluene, which is in almost every processed food, is BHT. It's illegal in Europe. You wouldn't sprinkle it on your salad, would you? No. No. So that's a good rule. The second principle is, you know, we should be eating a plant-rich diet. And across the spectrum from fruits and vegetables to... Do you treat fruits and vegetables as sort of one and the same? No, it should be vegetables and fruit, right? So it's like, you don't want to be consuming only fruit because that's full of sugar. And if you're diabetic or you're overweight or have issues, you might want to come back on the sugary fruits or eat berries, which are less glycemic. Lots of nuts and seeds. Everybody agrees with you eating lots of nuts and seeds. You want to soak them, reduce the lectins, that's fine. And if you're going to eat beans and grains, pick low-starch ones, right? And also... Give us a few examples. So like black rice, which is like the blueberries of rice. Quinoa. What does that mean? Well, the black rice is called the emperor's rice or forbidden rice. And it's full of these dark... It's black. So anytime you see color in nature, there are polyphenols and phytochemicals in there. So it's got more antioxidants per serving than blueberries. And then you want to make sure if you're eating grains. The gluten grains are interesting. So most of the gluten we eat is wheat. It's 133 pounds per person per year. That's a pharmacologic dose. It is worse for your blood sugar than table sugar. Really? Yes. What? Yes. When you look at the glycemic index, which is how much the fixed amount of the food will raise your blood sugar, table sugar is 80. Bread is 100. Whoa. I had no idea why. Because it's so processed and so quickly absorbed. And if you want to eat like... If you're not gluten sensitive, you want to have farro or einkorn wheat or, you know, spelt, you might tolerate those because those aren't highly altered genetically. But the wheat we eat is super starchy, has a lot more glycogen proteins, create more gluten sensitivity, is sprayed with glyphosate at harvest to defoliate the plants. And it also has a preservative called calcium propionate, which causes autism in animal models and is shown to cause behavioral problems in kids. So ADD, all that stuff, could be olive flour. So I'm not a big flour person. Plus, it's just like sugar. So if you want to have other grains, if you're not gluten sensitive, like rye or barley, that's fine. So... And then beans, again, you know, lime beans, kidney beans. If you're... Look, 75% of Americans are overweight. So most people should be eating a lot of starch. And, you know, you have to eat three cups of beans to get the equivalent of like four, six ounces of protein. So I have this lentils and things like that, which are lower starch beans, the zuki beans, other kinds of beans I talk about in my book. And then if you're eating animal products, you want animal products that are not going to hurt the animals, not going to hurt you, and not going to hurt the environment, right? So for beef, it should be regeneratively raised, ideally, which is hard to find. But you can actually get more and more of that around. And there's ways to do it by looking online to get it. Thrive Market is a great resource for regeneratively raised beef. And again, chicken should be pasture raised. Pork and all that should be raised in ways that are more organic or sustainable. Fish, you want to eat fish that's sustainably harvested or, you know, sustainably organically aquacultured. Because we over-harvest the fish. And then we don't eat big fish. It's like full of mercury and tuna and swordfish. Just because they've lived longer? Well, what happens is the coal and all the fossil fuels go in the ocean, go in the algae, get stored in the algae. The little fish eat the algae. Then the bigger fish eat the little fish. And it goes on up the food chain. And when you've got a swordfish or a tuna, these are monster fish. And they bio-accumulated all this. And so you want to, you know, eat the right animal products. You want to eat the right grains, the right beans, the right vegetables, the right fruits, the right nuts. Give me the right vegetables. Are we just looking for color spectrum? So non-starchy vegetables. If you want to cut out nightshades and get rid of the lectins, that's fine. You know, I don't care. But I love tomatoes. And it'll make me feel bad. Thank you.
