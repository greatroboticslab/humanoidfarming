 Five survival foods every gardener should grow. The first is garlic. Sure, it takes nine months to grow, but it's low maintenance, pest resistant, and once you start growing it, you'll never have to buy it again. Second are potatoes. Potatoes are a famine food for a reason. They're easy to grow, calorie dense, and high producing. Plus, they're a joy to dig up and they store for up to six months under the right conditions. Third are sweet corn, or really any type of corn. You can eat it as is, or use it to make sweeteners, chips, grits, flour, and everything in between. Fourth are carrots. My favorite is the shinkuroda variety because they're so chunky and fun to grow. You just kind of let it do its own thing, and four months later, you'll get a vibrant harvest. And finally, the fifth crop is pumpkins. I grew mine in cardboard boxes as an experiment, and as you can see, the pumpkins loved it. Like this video and follow me for more tips.
