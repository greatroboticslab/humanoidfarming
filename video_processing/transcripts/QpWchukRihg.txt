 Believe it or not, these weave balers are actually pretty easy to run. The biggest thing to note is we really have to have it on a newer tractor because in order to get the automation to work, we need to have electric SUVs and we have to have our newer ISO bus display in order to run the automation. As far as the weave goes, it's actually pretty simple to set up and run. When you get into the diagnostics, we need to tell it how wide the windrow is, how aggressive we want it to try and weave back and forth, and what hydraulics that it's hooked up to. Once that's done, we can simply hit enable in that menu, or we can get out of that and go to our main run page and enable it while we're moving. Keep in mind, you have to have those pieces in order to run this thing in automation mode. If for some reason you've got a tractor like this that fails for some reason, you can put it on an older tractor like a 4440 and still run the baler. You're just not going to get the automation pieces out of it. Plus, these balers are all coming with G5E monitors in them now. Instead of a bale track monitor, so real easy to add into an older tractor if you need it.
