 I'm talking, I'm talking sometimes Cause when I call, I hope you pick up your phone I'd like to talk to you I hope you answer I hope you answer I hope you answer I hope you answer Cause when I call, I hope you pick up your phone I'd like to talk to you I hope you answer Hey dad, it's me, um Oh, I'm Tyler, I think I'd be your son Sorry, I called you the wrong name See, my brain's split and dad isn't your name See, that gets a little more fitting Mom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to spare you Nigerian fuck Now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case of stairs So you not being there, fucking fire started my damn career But fuck it, I got Clancy He gave me the chance to see a world I wasn't supposed to I'm stoked that I didn't know you but sucks you ain't give a fuck and considered a sperm donor now Fuck is in no coma Fuck is in no coma I'm changing my shit to Haley and I just ain't being passive nigga You a fucking faggot nigga Got a show on Monday, guess he ain't getting no passes nigga But if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga And call him I hope he answered I hope he answered I hope he answered I hope he answered I hope he answered I hope he answered I hope he answered Cause when I cross, when I call baby I'm gonna pick a little phone Please pick a little I'm not gonna talk to you Suck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts Ace hate your guts, I'm a selfish fuck And I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blood Drink is out the closet Hodge is an alcoholic It might be bipolar but fuck it, I couldn't call it Supposed to be gone till November but quickly came back in August I left you once through September to clearly remember all this I would like to tell my grandma but she just nostalgic I'll call it Number But she won't answer I hope you answer I hope you answer I hope you answer I hope you answer I hope you answer Yeah, yeah I hope you answer Cause when I call When I call baby I hope you pick a little phone I can talk to you I can talk to you I hope you can't ask you You claim to hate my fucking guts But say I'm on an island in Thailand And I was wild and head If I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts And hope that I can live off saltwater and fucking coconuts Phone ain't got no services, 3G is fucking worthless Days getting dark like the area's turning urban You'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a church's But I'ma get in contact regardless I hope you answer The last verses about this girl
