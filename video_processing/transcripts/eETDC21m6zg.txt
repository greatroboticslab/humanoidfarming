This helps to aerate the pile and speed up the decomposition process. Remember, composting is a process of trial and error. Don't be discouraged if things don't go perfectly the first time. Mistakes are all part of the learning process. With patience and a little effort, you will soon have nutrient-rich compost ready for your garden.
