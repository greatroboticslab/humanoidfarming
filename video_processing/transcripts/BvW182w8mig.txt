Science & Technology
 Unbelievable! The inventor of the corn harvester is truly a genius. During harvesting, the front-mounted auger accurately aligns with the cornfield, quickly guiding the stalks into the cutting platform. High-speed rotating blades cut the corn stalks, which are then conveyed into the machine via chains. Inside, a pair of rollers continuously rotate inward, pushing the stalks downward while crushing them, ultimately separating the corn ears from the stalks. The corn ears are then transported via a screw and undergo peeling before being loaded onto trucks.
