Howto & Style
 let's get right into the harvesting we have so many things to grab and the amount of diversity back here it's just unreal take a quick scope of everything the tomatoes are growing incredible so many different kinds of food it's just uh i mean it's hard to even keep up coming here first let's grab some of these green beans right here well actually they're the red swan beans look at the color of these beans look how beautiful they are look at the level of production it's insane i love these fresh beans so we're going to grab a bunch of these so that they keep flowering look at these and they're they haven't not only do they look really cool they have an amazing flavor to them i'll just try one real quick so good see if tuck wants one i want a boy he loves his beans yeah this is the just to let you guys know that this is good stuff this is tuck approved just let him have that one so there's a lot to grab in here we're just gonna take a few for that right there for now tomatoes behind me insane amount we're gonna grab those in a minute but before that let's get a couple eggplant we've got an eggplant right down here just hiding underneath the beans let's grab this one this is the rosita eggplant such a beautiful eggplant one of my favorite all-time varieties heirloom just excellent and another one i tried for the first time this year which is in a fantastic eggplant right here this is the listada de gandia and uh check out how beautiful another heirloom look at that picture-esque this is the stuff i mean so beautiful just take a quick look at how nice that is and look at the dragon tongue beans right below me here these ones are just starting to flower but i have another spot where the dragon tongue beads are further along looks like looks like we got the bean thief here this guy's stealing all the beans right out of the right out of the uh the bowl he wants the fresh ones though this guy tuck one this one boy he's got to get the best parts of them yeah he can be a little greedy sometimes but he earns it let's keep moving though there's a lot of stuff to grab before we do that just swing around real quick check out the grapes they're starting to set up starting to finish we're gonna have some nice sets of grapes this year look at that look at the color i'm gonna try a couple i'm just gonna eat them fresh we get in front of you nothing like fresh grapes right from the backyard tomatoes are so ripe they're just falling off the vine crazy let's try the grape though it's already got that amazing sweetness the amount ready is incredible look at some of those sets down there look at those they're getting a nice shine on them that's a good sign so i'm not gonna grab too many of them just right now we'll grab a little bit later because we got it even more stuff we got to start grabbing let's head into these two beds here kind of where we started so much stuff and let's check out some of these peppers right next to us the zulu pepper right here nice production nice dark like color on it almost like the color of an eggplant and really good producer has a nice pepper flavor to it a sweet pepper overall just a fantastic pepper really good stuff and then let's check out some of these beets down here so they're probably getting close swing in here yeah look at that some of those beets try this one doesn't look too bad we double sew our beets you can see they're all double sewed there so there's a lot of beets in here get this one nice size this is the uh the golden beet when you bite into this thing it's got a really nice color to it grab those and then actually i think i have some shallots still back here the monique shallot i forgot to grab see how those look oh yeah i mean the the diversity of food in here is it's like unbelievable you can get like a whole meal all different kinds of things just from one little spot i've even got basil back here too and then let's check out what we've got in the front here still check out the white scalp squash this one came up on its own and i've got a lot of white scalp squash to harvest today but this one just came up on its own look at all the squash in there look at the size of it look at that this is a old native american variety fantastic flavor to it it's just it grows so prolifically next year i'm only going to plant one or two plants because i mean they just produce non-stop let's grab some of these cherry bomb tomatoes really nice sets on them fantastic producer and take a look at this the stem here look we're lowering and leaning look how the stem is all bent it's all bent like that this way it makes it much easier to reach the higher ones as you go up so this is how we lower and lean and then look right behind is the sunrise bumblebee let's grab some of those such a beautiful color on these i'll show you them as i come around too look at that look at the color on those nice flavor too really cool tomato so yeah when we're lowering and leaning you'll notice at the top what we do is we just use these tomato rollers we just let it go and it drops the plant down this makes it so all the fruit is at easy manageable height just makes the whole growing process more enjoyable and allows us to get more out of this space that we have super important check out the super sweet 100s really nice sets a little splitting here and there but overall you cannot complain with this level of production and i mean you go up there's even more and more and more it's crazy they come over here hartman's yellow a lot of nice tomatoes on here in the back might be hard to see look them down here might be hard to see but uh because there's so many tomatoes growing here but look how densely we have these tomatoes planted 10 of them per twer 10 of them in 10 square feet we did that twice so 20 tomato varieties in 20 square feet growing fantastic and one thing that i did this year that made a major difference is i hit him with a top dressing of fertilizer i use my own fertilizer the jp secret stuff you could check it out at jamesprigioni.com while you're there grab a shirt too here's the summer grocer grab a shirt at jamesprigioni.com but hitting them with that top dressing of fertilizer as they started to go into production made a major difference look how we don't have any any really tomatoes that are lacking nutrition good health very little disease problems just uh i can't be happier with how the tomatoes are grown here then check out the black cherry tomato here nice color on those really good tomato delicious flavor and then we've got even more tomatoes back there look at the sweet treats look how crazy those sets get it's got a few on the bottom that are that are passed but look at these i love that and then look it up a little more out of control production but let's go behind us because we've got some tomatoes growing up stakes like the lemon boy plus over here look at this production i mean start low down there grab a set of these look at that and then just as you go up crazy just so many tomatoes so it's got to harvest all of them but we're gonna harvest all of them as we move like i'll show you guys the harvest at the end of the video too because we're just gonna grab a little bit here and there and then check out some of the tomatoes in this spot like the sun gold my favorite all-time variety right here look at this look at the color of those i mean it's such a striking tomato but it's the hands down i would say the best flavored tomato there is and then more of the cherry bomb next to us over here you got to have this one in this one is good disease resistance against late blight so it'll perform well late into the season for you come this way we got some stuff in here i want to show you grab an apple in the back we've got more beans here this is a purple bean these are really starting to fill in nicely i really like to see that and then over here we've got some apples i haven't had this apple yet this year it's done relatively well i did a good job of thinning it not having too many apples so what i'm going to do is pop this apple off and get the first taste it seems like it's getting close to finish it came off really easy so uh let's see what happens i don't think it's going to have that nice of a shine but we'll just shine it off a little bit not too beautiful but i guess it's really about the flavor so let's uh let's see how it tastes see how it tastes like it doesn't have that pop yet um a little green but still good flavor it's going to be a sweet one i can tell let me just drop it here for now and then we'll swing over this way i'll go behind you but look at those pears those will be getting ready soon look at the amount of production on those pears crazy and then i'm going to grab some a bunch of squash heading in the back cucumbers all different stuff so let's just keep moving you go ahead i'm going to grab my my harvesting bowl which i know i always need a bigger bowl but it's tough to carry it around check out the size of this swiss chard right here look at the size of this look even how thick those look at that how thick the leaves the stalk is how big the leaves are how healthy it is i mean uh it's crazy looking and then we still have all those tomatoes behind us too we're going to skip those for now but i mean there's a lot to grab the blue cream berry sweet trees i showed you the gardener sweetheart with a really cute shape to them and then uh some of the i forget if that's that's the pink bumblebee we already did the sunrise but that's the pink bumblebee right there and then in here we've got this bonbon this is a butternut squash and i've never had any of these but i want to try to harvest one before i do that though look at the unbelievable sets on this thing this is crazy look how productive that is i just got to take some of these whole rows oh looks like this one was starting to go bad i've got so many tomatoes that are ready it's hard for me to keep up so look at that really nice and look at the sets as we move up there too so many tomatoes but even more impressive than that in my opinion is the mushroom basket look at that tomato over there look at that variety tell me those aren't some of the most striking beautiful tomatoes you've ever seen the shape the crazy oh this one's going bad too man i gotta get out here and harvest more when you just got too much sometimes it gets tough but the beautiful accordion shape here's a nice one look at that accordion shape look at the it's got this incredible pink blush and it almost has like these little silver sparkles in the inside of it too so such a great tomato produces a bit late than some of the other tomatoes but definitely worth the wait it's one of my all-time favorite tomatoes i would have to say an heirloom variety too and let's get that bonbon squash i was talking about notice in here look how many we have one two three four there's about 20 of them so i'm going to take one early because it looks like there's it's a winter squash so it needs to finish in the vine but it looks like it's starting to kind of die off the vine a bit so what i want to do is harvest one of these cut into it bake it and then see how it actually tastes so let's just grab one for now typically you'd wait for this whole thing to die down a little more but i just can't wait any longer because i want to try one of them it looks like it's about finished though if you ask me more tomatoes up next to me here and then let's check check out those dragon tongue beans i was telling you about you can see this bed needs a little bit of water it's really hot out today super muggy so uh things are struggling a bit but look at all the dragon tongue beans in here this is hands down the greatest green bean you can grow in my opinion not only does it look incredible it's probably the best tasting so there's some plants and vegetables that you grow that look really nice but they don't taste that good especially when it comes to tomatoes but this right here looks incredible tastes amazing probably one of the best beans good indication of that is we didn't see the little homie at all and then all of a sudden once we start pulling out the dragon tongues this guy shows up let me see come here boy come over here boy he's kind of fighting his way through come over here and we'll grab it to him like this hey let's see if he likes it yeah it's one of his favorite beans oh i want a little more i didn't want that piece now i think he's all beamed out but i'll have this one maybe he likes the red swan more but dragon tongues are my absolute favorite such a good snap such a natural like beanie flavor but really sweet too can't beat it more things in here but we're going to skip all that for now and let's move over to the squash but before i even do that i just got to give you a quick peek at the sunflowers look how epic these are me standing next to it if i put it straight up look at the size of that this thing is just the lighthouse for all the birds and all the pollinators and all the beneficial insects letting them know stop in here you'll grab some delicious food some nice pollen all different flowers hang out by the other sunflower sunflower and just have an absolute blast that's why we try to make it this backyard this garden a paradise for all living things and uh so many benefits that come from that you got to check out this squash though probably my new favorite summer squash this thing tastes amazing this is the gelber english custard squash crazy shape beautiful color and fantastic flavor probably my favorite flavored squash i used to like the castado romanesco as my favorite tasting summer squash a zucchini but this is now my favorite look how productive it is too one here it's got another one down here another little one forming there and then look at this more hanging this way oh that would fell on me look at it look how beautiful they look too and i while i was up here i noticed we've even got a zucchini that snuck back there so let's pop up and grab a zucchini this isn't the castado romanesco this is a different variety i think but uh we have a castado that's ready i know that look at that summer's time still time for summer squash and then directly behind me this is more of the white scallop squash this thing is so crazy productive i can't even keep up look at this one hanging here there's another one on the other side that i never got look at this look how beautiful that is and then just take a peek this way follow me over here look at the white white scallop squash down there another one and then back there another one and then right over here this is like dj coward another one and actually while we're over here might as well just grab this zucchini i'll let you swing around still pumping out zucchini look at that let's get this one this is the castado romanesco this is the best hands down and then just for fun let's take a peek behind us and check out the cucumbers hanging i know i got some ready back here surely oh here's some here another one here and then hey why not just grab the cabbage right below us look at this the dead on savoy hiding underneath it just uh so much food might as well just grab it because i want to eat it take this out just like that not to mention all the grapes behind me truly a food forest paradise definitely some ants in here but we'll be fine they won't go after the cabbage but uh endless food this is only half of the garden one thing i wanted to mention is so many people ask how big is the backyard how much area space are you growing in so the whole property that i'm on is one-third of an acre and i essentially garden on about one-third of the property so i would say my planting space is about one-ninth of an acre so it may look like it's actually bigger than it is because a lot of the fruit trees and stuff make it seem larger than it is but this isn't the as big of an area as you might actually assume it is we just stack things we grow in so many different layers so uh it allows us to get more out of the space and it's so much fun to grow like this and you can see the incredible level of diversity let's swing into the other garden when we have so many more things to grab and all different kind of stuff let's continue the harvesting check out how many tomatoes are on this plant this right here is the joleen this is a determinate variety but just look at the production on this thing so many tomatoes and they look beautiful really uniform nice colors just look at all of them it's fantastic it's even making tuck a little excited what do you think tuck i gotta harvest all these because there's just uh they're just ripe i can't let them get over ripened but i just super impressed with this plant really happy with it you guys got to try this one out if you want to grow a determinate variety tomato and what i didn't notice was i've got some massive cucumbers that are hanging right off the plant in the back i didn't even see it look at the size of this thing that's past ripe unfortunately but uh tell me you haven't seen i mean have you seen a cucumber bigger than this this is insane so thick too look behind me even more big cucumbers this one is more at a good eating size even though it's big itself and then even the carinto cucumber in the back there's a bunch of them ready back here so we're still getting a lot of cucumbers it's hard to keep keep up on all the harvesting let's swing around though we got some other stuff we want to grab hank go over this way and look at the apples right here this is the liberty apple doing real nicely that's later a little i mean ready a little later in the season so they're definitely not ready yet and then let's check out some of the zucchini rampicante over here i'm just going to point at some of the stuff because this can get really long if i go through and harvest every little thing but here's some of the zucchini rampicante this can be harvested as a summer or winter squash i think it's also called the italian squash a really good one swing over here sweet potatoes in containers the mountain magic tomato after that really good producer eggplants to my left look at those white eggplants beautiful eggplants in there more nice eggplants orange eggplants purple eggplants so so many different things then a lot of nice tomatoes to my right next to me over here more super sweet 100s berries crazy chair you gotta plant that one if you haven't over here so much production tomatoes back there look at the butternut squash these are almost ready too look at the color and then look at there's another squash right over there underneath there and then we have more bonbon we kind of let the if you notice back here we let the squash kind of trellis all along the ground and then the tomatoes are growing up through that as well as the trees so we're just doing our best to get the most out of the space and then these potatoes need to be harvested we're gonna do a video on that but i have potatoes in a different location we're gonna go harvest before i show you that come this way check out the cabbages in here three beautiful cabbages ready to be harvested and we're replacing a lot of the stuff in this bed so we'll be grabbing those cabbages soon swing over here let's actually grab some potatoes from here so a lot of potatoes are starting to get ready in here we're just gonna you're supposed to dig a potato up but i'm just gonna pull it out like this and see what we find oh yeah it looks like some nice potatoes in there look at the size baby let's see what we got look at this look at this oh i mean i can't imagine how many potatoes are actually in that in this bed let me see if there's any more left in here oh yeah still more that was only one plant and we're getting all these check it out so we're gonna have some massive potato harvest this year from this bed i'm just grabbing them kind of day by day whenever i feel like eating them so i can stack on them that other bed i'll get them all at once we'll stack off them out and just see how many we actually got from it let's keep moving though let's head over here i want to show you some peppers in the beds over here and i want to grab a chijuro pear because they're starting to get ready and then maybe take a stop see how the boss is doing what do you think little homie getting pretty warm out here huh this guy never quits make sure you spam some hearts down low for the little boss the young king this guy never quits you can see he's panting because it's pretty hot out here so we're gonna try to make sure we don't keep this video too long let's uh go check out the peppers after we just get a couple pets on this guy we just have a few more things to grab before i let you guys go check out all these peppers i'm growing in pots here a bunch of different kinds the health on the peppers is amazing they're really starting to produce heavy come over here some of the banana peppers look really nice take one of these even though it's probably a bit early really nice looking peppers more over here here's the habanada pepper this is a sweet habanero they're going to turn orange but it's a habanero pepper it just doesn't have the heat which is pretty cool but we are growing a bunch of hot peppers too like the i think it's a paper lantern pepper this is a hot one here and we're growing the hot peppers in pots so tuck can't get to them we don't want them eating any hot peppers and we've got some nice peppers over here that are just about ready some nice sweet ones too i'm gonna snack on these but one thing i want to show you over here is the chijuro pear this thing's starting to get ready i made the mistake possibly of living leaving a little bit too much fruit on it even though i thinned it out it's just uh still has a good amount of fruit so what i'm going to do is look for some of the big ones that are kind of ripe and just snack on them to kind of thin it and also get a harvest at the same time let's see this one looks pretty good has a decent color to it when they're really ripe it'll be like bright orange so this one's still not perfectly right but i know it's gonna still be good so let's taste this real quick still really sweet nice pop to it and then over here is a different variety of pear these ones are ready because this is a multi-grafted pear this is a 20th century pear they these ones are relatively small but really good flavor and just overall delicious let me get a taste of this soft incredibly sweet the asian pear so it's almost kind of like an apple but a really good pear flavor still fantastic we're going to go around and harvest all the stuff that we kind of passed by there's some stuff that i still didn't show but i don't want to make this video too long so that's today's video growers thanks for watching we hope you enjoyed it we hope you got something out of it me and tuck had an absolute blast out here do not forget to spam the hearts to show the love for this guy i
