 Rainwater harvesting is the collection and storage of rainwater rather than allowing it to run off. There are two methods by which rainwater harvesting can be done. The first method is direct collection and storage of rainwater from rooftops and reservoirs. The direct collection of rainwater from rooftops requires gutters, a filter, a tank placed above or under the ground, in addition to pipes. When rainwater falls on the rooftop, it gets collected in gutters that channel the water into pipes and then into the storage tanks. Whenever needed, the stored water can be pumped into water outlet pipes ready to be used. Rainwater can also be directly collected using dams, which are built across streams, rivers, or canals to stop or restrict the flow of water. Thus, forming reservoirs. The second method of rainwater harvesting is the artificial recharge of rainwater to the underground to improve the storage of groundwater. To store water using this method, pits and wells are dug deep into the ground, and rainwater is recharged and injected into underground aquifers through pits and wells. There are several benefits to rainwater harvesting, such as raising the groundwater level, controlling rainwater flow, thus reducing floods and soil erosion, and preventing rainwater pollution. However, the most important benefit is probably meeting water demands in dry seasons.
