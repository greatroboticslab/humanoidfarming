 If this is your year to start seeds indoors, here's some things I wish I knew sooner. You will want to make sure you're using a seed starting soil. Regular potting soil will not work. You can definitely make your own mix, which is more cost effective, but for me, this is just easier. When it's finally time to start seeds, you will want to make sure you pre-moisten your seed starting mix. You will then put your mix into your cell seed starting trays. I like to start in these one inch by one inch cells. When you're putting your mix in the cells, you don't want to overpack them. I just apply a gentle pressure. Now it's time to start planting, and a good rule of thumb is to plant seeds at two times the depth of their size. Typically, you'll want to plant two to three seeds in each cell, and they will be thinned later. It's just nice to have a few extra in there in case some of them don't sprout. Now just cover the holes, and we're off to our final steps. Label what you're planting as you go. Both seeds can germinate without light, so we don't need to add that quite yet. You really just want to keep your seeds warm. I use a humidity dome and sometimes a heat mat, which you will want to remove after your seeds start to sprout. You know, black and you're eating size. Let me listen to that bud där. Then put my seeds warm. Then put them on. Then put them on. It being all you know. Shut your mouth shut is the end is so hot and you can try to fix it. No, no and that be it be weeks I can try to merge 28 ladies. Got F-18해도 doin' 20キ confused with me. Especially for a variety of other السcopes. But then there are plenty of other defenses that I will never put you in. Not really. Not really? Not really.
