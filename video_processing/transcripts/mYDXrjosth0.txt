 If you're talking about the essentials for mankind, crops are definitely on the list. However, how to farm them is a bit laborious. Seeding, sprinkling fertilizers, and spring pesticides, especially in poor areas, which rely on agriculture but face problems of low efficiency. The drones are becoming game changers and making agriculture in China smarter. For example, let's take a look at Xinjiang. As the most important cotton producing region in China, nearly half of its 10 most impoverished countries are located in the main cotton producing areas. Better cotton production, better income for the poor. October is when the cotton is harvested. Local farmers usually drive tractors to spray a chemical on the cotton to remove impurities from the leaves. However, this can damage 5-8% of the crop. Now, more and more farmers have turned to drones for the work. By flying above the cotton, a drone avoids causing extra harm. With sensors and AI vision technology, it can monitor the well-being of the crops and spray chemicals with precision. One drone is estimated to be able to do the work of 60 farmers. Last year, about 4,500 drones completed the task for 65% of Xinjiang's cotton fields, raising the region's total cotton output to over 400,000 tons, resulting in a revenue increase of 4.3 billion US dollars. Across China, there are more than 50,000 units of agriculture drones in operation, topping the global list. An area of 33 million hectares of crops has been taken care of by such drones.
