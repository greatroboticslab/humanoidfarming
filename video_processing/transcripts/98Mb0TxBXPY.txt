Education
 My name is Masaki. I'm studying the Bachelor of Agricultural Science at the University of Queensland. The Bachelor of Agricultural Science is all about life, food, animals, everything around us. I've just started but I thought I was just going to focus on animals but I learned the importance of plants as well. You can become open-minded I guess. All my lecturers and all of the courses I've been taking are very friendly and lovely and they are always willing to explain things to you in a very interesting manner. I really enjoy studying my programme because people around me, my classmates are very enthusiastic about animals and they have background from horses, pigs, cattle and they teach you stuff. Not just the tutors but your friends can also teach you. I really recommend UQ if you want to study Agricultural Science because you get to learn a variety of handling skills in the various packs we have. At the wildlife facility we saw very big pythons and sugar gliders as well as native lizards in Australia. Three types and they were like this big. Garton I think is a very good place to study, a regional area in Australia to study because it's less than an hour to the city and at the same time you get to be in the nature. So you don't have to like go out and find a place to relax. You can relax all the time and if you want some busyness you just go to the city and just into campus bus. So it's perfect.
