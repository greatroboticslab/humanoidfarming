 Music When temperatures drop and snow covers the Wyoming rangelands like you see here today, livestock producers feed harvested forage to their animals. This forage helps cattle, sheep and other domesticated livestock maintain body condition and health. Winter can be a stressful time for animals and humans alike. This is why livestock producers monitor their animals energy requirements. The lowest temperatures that livestock can tolerate before needing a boost in fed energy is 20 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit. These temperatures are for dry livestock and do not include windchill. If livestock are wet and or it's windy, increase fed energy by 1 to 2 percent for every degree the windchill temperature falls below that 20 to 32 degrees. Energy is most easily provided through additional hay. During summer and fall, alfalfa, oats and grass are harvested and stored in bales for producers to feed their livestock, a needed boost in nutrients. Other than windchills and low temperatures, deep snow conditions may require livestock producers to feed hay to their animals. Supplementing rangeland grasses with fed forages is a common practice in Wyoming.
