Howto & Style
 There are many ways to tie up your tomatoes, but one of the cheapest and most efficient and recyclable is to put T-posts up and wrap twine back and forth around it. Gently put all of the leaves of the plants up through the lattice work that you make with the twine. It's very future-proof. You can see here that later on in the season I've already used the twine that I pre-prepared going all the way up. I can now put all of the leaves and branches up through those strings to keep them out of the walkway off the ground and also so I can prune and allow all the tomatoes and the blossoms to be open air and open to the sun. The twine is a great way to also hold up the clusters of tomatoes keeping them off the ground.
