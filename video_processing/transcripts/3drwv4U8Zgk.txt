Howto & Style
 Three things you should never do when you're growing these forbidden fruits. Apple trees are thirsty. No, not like that. And inconsistent watering will make your apple trees moody and too stressed to bear fruit. Premature harvesting will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. But harvest too late and you'll be stuck with overripe mealy fruit. Neglecting pruning will turn your apple tree into a crowded mess and make it the perfect heart rate for pests and diseases. And if you don't want weak fruit production, always prune during the dormant season.
