 This video is brought to you by Osmocote, the planters, plant food. Hey, I'm Jinx Farmer. I'm a horticulturalist in South Carolina. Today we're planting a bunch of drought-tolerant perennials in a garden that has absolutely no irrigation. One of the things that I do to make those perennials adapt quickly to dry soil so that they'll thrive with no irrigation is take the plant, the bucket, soak it until it has all the air going out of the roots, and then plant it wet. Hi, my name is Randall Tilley. I work with the North Against the Rockin' Turf in Belvedere, South Carolina. Basically showing y'all how to best water your plants when you go to first plant them. We're just doing what Jinx had just explained to y'all. Basically, you just take the plant and put it in the water and you see all the air bubbles. When the plant stops bubbling, you know that you've got the plant fully wet. The plant that we put in are cordgrass, sand cordgrass, Salvia Henry-Doulberg. Henry-Doulberg is a Texas selection of this blue sage. It smells like honeysuckle and it flowers for a long time. And then we're putting in a bunch of other perennials that you can't really see through here, but they're all selected to tolerate drought. You see we're getting them watered in so that they're well established and they'll tolerate the drought of the summer. Thank you. Paul Newman-Doulixon ClJI CM Thank you.
