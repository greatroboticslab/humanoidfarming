Howto & Style
 I can't dig any more potatoes on my own. Mech Max Potato Harvester. Weighs 322 pounds, model PH19, and it's fully adjustable. Today we got it out. We got it going. There they are. I think the first potato wasn't deep enough before I supplant. There they are. Popping out of the ground. There's the harvest of one row of Yukon Gold. We will not shorten. We are going to come home with potatoes. And if we don't, I'm going to go get to expand the operation.
