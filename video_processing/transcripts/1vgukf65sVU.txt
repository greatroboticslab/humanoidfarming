 Are you growing garlic this year? Here's how and when to harvest. When the lower three to four leaves brown, stop watering. Dig up a bulb and check on size. If the cloves are well formed, about a week later, harvest the garlic, trim off the roots, and trim the stems when the necks are completely tight and dry. Save the largest bulbs for planting out next season.
