 What is the importance of plants? Well, everybody knows that plants are important for the daily life on the earth, for the daily life of the human being. For the same reason, really, plants are important for any adventure of space exploration that the human being can undertake. Plants produce oxygen, which is an essential component for our life. Plants produce water, which is also essential. Plants produce fundamental food. We are now using the fantastic resources offered by the International Space Station, which are just being now fully available from the, even in the case of Europe, with the implementation of the Columbus Laboratory, which is an unprecedented tool for biological, which is in general for scientific research, but in particular for biological and more particularly for plant research. Gravity is an essential factor for the growth of plants. Roots grow downwards and stems grow downwards because of the presence of the gravity vector. When this vector is absent, as in space, this process is totally disorganized. And the study of the particular cellular and molecular mechanisms of this process is essential to be capable of successfully growing plants in the future in the conditions of microgravity that exist in space. European scientists have developed a fundamental role in the discrimination of these cellular and molecular mechanisms. Then the next step is to pass from the model plant that we are now using, Arabidopsis, it's a plant that nobody is interested in except plant scientists because it's the model. So to pass through plants of economical value, such as rice or wheat or cereals in general, soya beans, plants which are interesting for human food. And then the next step is to produce a space garden or a special space culture capable of producing a crop, capable of being eaten or being taken by astronauts as their food. And also an interesting factor as a psychological relief. And we will be capable of producing plants that will be able of growing deeper in the soil or on the contrary, which the roots growing more horizontally. And this is very important in terms of the capability of taking the water which is being found deeper or at the surface of the soil. So really the purpose, the objective is really to translate the Earth garden to Mars or to the Moon or to the interior of the space station or to whatever space vehicle or whatever space planet or space habitat that the human being can put feet on. So great to find the way the land that��en is completely느� Rare Vadis- penit sustencies! And, all the way your acumenamię highway travelling underway, which means mass of vinegar can essentially produce trains and transport transport Eevely parades. There are floors from people to make new places подобartzo in the life of plants. Thank you.
