Education
 At Kellogg Community College we have the Agricultural Operations major. This dual program is designed for students to be a student at Kellogg Community College and Michigan State University. They take these classes together in order to earn an associate's degree in general studies from Kellogg Community College and the Ag Operations certificate from Michigan State University. I chose to be a part of the MSU and KCC program due to its location, being close to home. I wanted to stay at home while farm with my family and still be able to go to school at the same time. Ever since I was a child I've always dreamed of studying at Michigan State and I just think that staying home but also having the opportunity to be at a big campus is really nice because I can stay local and also get a taste of big campus life. A lot of times going into a bachelor's program or something like that you take a lot of courses that you may need down the road at some point in a management position or something but really there's great opportunities for those with just the two-year Ag Tech program where you learn the hands-on things of the agronomic practices, the basic Ag business principles, anything like that really gives people the one-up for getting, being the right candidate for that career. Internships to me are probably the most important part of this whole program because you know it really when it comes down to business it's not what you know but it's who you know and so these kids you know we get them out into internships not only are they learning the industry or the different science behind it but they're also creating relationships with businesses that are local and you know creating those relationships is what's going to help them to get a job you know as they get out of the program. I mean anybody can do book work but when you have hands-on that's when people learn tend to learn the most I know I did as well so I think it's imperative that students and they start at the bottom up so they know what it takes to plant a plant how to care for it how to get it up to the steps to where you're producing fruit and harvesting packaging shipping there's a lot that comes into play in that so having the skill set and the technology behind them when they come into the work field is very important. The professors here are awesome because they are farmers they're in the ag field and so they bring so much more to the classes because they actually have been through it all so it helps us a lot having that experience in the classroom. Agriculture careers are growing by leaps and bounds there are it's more than just the farmer in the fields there's the sales representatives there's the engineers going through and making the equipment the scientists figuring out the crops to plant the how to treat the bugs so there's such a vast array of jobs. Students interested in the ag operations program should really consider it because they're instead of 300 students there's a class of 20 it's hands-on experience and state-of-the-art technology. If you're sitting on the fence it's because you don't love what you're doing so you obviously need to change so if you're already considering this then you're already ready to step into it.
