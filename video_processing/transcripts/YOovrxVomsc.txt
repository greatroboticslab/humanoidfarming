 My name is Jeff Miller with the Cass County Soul Conservation District. Today I'm going to show you how to hand plant a conservation grade tree. Today we're using a Colorado Blue Spruce, one of our more common conservation grade trees. The first thing you want to do is make sure your tree stays damp and moist prior to planting. I've got it wrapped in a wet burlap sack to keep the roots moist. You want to make sure that you select the proper soil to the proper tree. In this case, we've got some heavy wet soil that's going to go good with this Colorado Blue Spruce. So the first thing you want to do is open the ground up. I'm using a tree spade here. Remove the tree from its protective moist wrapper. You want to look at your roots and make sure that some of the roots aren't too long. This one has been trimmed pretty well. As you can see right here, this is called the root collar. We do not want to plant the tree any lower than this root collar. So put it down on the ground. Loosely pack the soil around it. We don't want to compress the soil too badly. Make sure it's straight. The roots are straight. Then I'll come over. I'll get a pail of water. We want to slowly give it a drink of water. Let that water soak in. And we have successfully planted this tree. Fifty years from now, it will be much, much taller than it is now. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call at the Cass County Soil Conservation District.
