 Hey guys, so this morning we woke up at 5am because we're headed to the Maquokada small animal and bird swap. I'm really excited to go there and see what we can find. I am bringing some money and we're bringing our animal carrying transporting box, I don't know what to call it. So there is a possibility that we will be buying something. There's actually something in particular that I'm looking for today and that is a new buck or buckling for my goats. But if I do get one it has to check off quite a few boxes but most importantly it needs to be ADGA registered like the rest of my herd. So first we're going to go to a local bakery to get some donuts and then let's go see what we can find at the animal swap. I wanted nine. That's nine. Nine is a lot. It is a lot. Can you eat nine? Yeah. Okay. Lauren, do they look so yummy? Yeah. Okay, we just pulled up. Let's go see what we can find. So this swap is actually indoors and I've never been to an indoor swap before so this should be interesting. I'm excited to see what they have in here. We had to pay a few dollars to get in and then it was time to look at the animals. Right away I saw some boar goats and some Katahdin hair sheep. They're really cool. We actually had some a couple years ago. And then I saw the cutest little baby goats. Oh my goodness, they're so adorable. But the sign said they weren't for sale so I'm guessing that they sold already. And then this little La Mancha baby was so cute and really friendly. I'm guessing it's a bottle baby. And these sheep are also adorable. Someone was selling some snakes which is really interesting. Now whenever I go to these swaps I get a lot of comments saying it's so sad how they're all in such tiny cages. And I promise you this is not normal for these animals. This is just for a few hours during the swap. Animals are not kept in cages like this all the time. So then I saw some cute little Nigerian dwarf goats but unfortunately they were all weathers which are fixed males. And I already have two weathers so I don't need any more. But their colors were actually super pretty. And then we saw some little chicks. These are the first chicks I've seen this year. And they were very cute. There were a lot of silkies in there. You need some silkies Isaac? I'm good. And then we saw some little mini Aussies and they were actually super cute. I love the coloring on them. It's really pretty. And then there were three Nigerian dwarf does here but they didn't look to be in the best condition. We saw some turkeys and then this little bunny was so cute. It was adorable and it came right up to me. It's making me want a bunny. I've always wanted one but we've just never gotten any. But I do think bunnies are the cutest thing ever. Then we saw some peacocks and they're so pretty. Oh my goodness the tail feathers. But they were actually pretty expensive. They were $150 each. Which I know peacocks are expensive but that's still a lot of money. This bunny over here had some really weird red eyes and my siblings kept pointing it out to me. These little mini pigs were absolutely adorable. So cute. I think piglets are really cute. And then we saw these huge rabbits. And guys the video isn't doing justice. They were huge. It was really cool to see because I've never seen any this big before. And then my little brother got to pet whatever these are. I don't I don't remember what they were. And then we saw these. My little brother Oren has been wanting a hamster for a long time. I don't know why. He found what he was looking for. And I actually think these were guinea pigs but Oren got so excited when he saw these and he really wanted to buy one. Oren's gonna want one. Yeah I want to buy one. And they were actually pretty cute but my parents ended up saying no. The animal that they had the most of here by far was bunnies. There were so many of them. Even more than chickens. It was actually crazy. There were so many here. I did see some more goats over here but I'm pretty sure that they were pygmy goats. I could be wrong but I think they were. And they also did have horns and I don't like to buy goats with horns. It's just a personal preference. And our friends were actually here selling some barn cats so we talked to them for a little bit and then continued to look around. This place actually wasn't very full. There were a bunch of empty tables which I think is a little surprising for this time of year. This guy was selling mice and it was actually so gross. They were like burrowing into the bedding. I personally did not think they were very cute. Hello. Hi guys. Aww. We have newspaper for our band. Something about this bunny really caught my eye. I don't know. I just think it has really pretty and unique coloring. Super cute. Then we saw another really big bunny. This one costed $100. There's that bunny with the weird eye again. We saw some more chicks and then we saw some boar bottle babies. And I literally just cannot wait for my goats to give birth. They're so cute. Like, I mean, look at these guys. They're so adorable. These are the ones that we saw in the beginning that aren't for sale. And I actually figured out that they're pygmy goats so they're not even Nigerian dwarves. But I can't. They're so cute. This corgi was so pretty because it had one blue eye and I've never seen that before. I think it's so cute. So, you okay. so okay so we didn't find anything in there that we can't live without there wasn't even really anything that caught my eye there weren't very many animals there anyways either but i think there's another one coming up in about a month or two so maybe we'll find something there
