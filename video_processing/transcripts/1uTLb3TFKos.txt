 Let's see what we can harvest from my garden today. These little bears haven't quite matured yet, and these are almost there, but this guy is ready to go. Oh, the Sour Patch is blooming nicely. We have a great varietal here of Sour Patch Kids, and I also grew the watermelons for my first time. My gummy tree is in full bloom, and these look ripe enough to enjoy right off the vine. Mmm. I was gifted some Japanese import candy seeds, and my Pocky is sprouting, which means... Oh yeah, it is ready for harvesting. We have some rice candy, and then... Ugh, this gummy sushi is fully matured. I found that if you propagate a chocolate plant with a peanut butter plant, you get Reese's. I think I'll harvest a few minis as well, and I'll leave the pieces to keep growing. Ugh, and I almost missed my Terry's chocolate orange. Looks perfectly ripe. Can't wait to enjoy this bountiful harvest. Can't wait to enjoy this bountiful harvest.
