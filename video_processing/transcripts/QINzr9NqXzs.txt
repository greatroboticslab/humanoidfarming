 Combines may be the prized piece of equipment at harvest, but Machinery Pete has big four-wheel-drive tractors on his mind this week. Here's Pete. Boy, I tell you what folks, I saw four immaculate four-wheel-drive tractors sold at auction last week. So, here's a picture from an auction in West Central New York last week, a 2012 John Deere 9410R. This thing had 957 hours on it, no def, and it sold for $200,000. Now, that is the highest auction price in just under three years. And for perspective, the current average auction price on a 9410R this year is $150,895. On that same auction last Thursday in Western New York, the slightly older 2008 Deere 9330 was up for sale, just a beauty. 1,961 hours on it, and it went for $176,000. Exact same story here, folks. It's the highest auction price on a 9330 in just under three years. And again, for perspective, current average auction price is $108,807. Now a week ago Friday, an immaculate farm auction in Southern Ontario had this four-wheel-drive. Look at this thing. Case IH $4994. Don't see many of those. And making this even more rare, it had a factory Cummins A55 engine. Only 10 of those made. Had just over $77,000 on it and sold in U.S. dollars for $52,577. Again, U.S. dollars. Record price by a mile. Now the same sale had this gorgeous Case 4890, 4917 hours on it. Went for $19,904 U.S. Again, record price.
