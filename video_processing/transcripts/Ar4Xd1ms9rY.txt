 In Thailand, farmers without fields have found a clever way to grow both chickens and vegetables. They raise chickens on the lower level and grow vegetables above. They feed the chickens through an opening, and the chicken droppings are collected and used as fertilizer for the vegetables. This innovative method allows them to double their output and profits right at home. Smart, right?
