 Here's a quick health tip. If your garden beds are full of germinating weed seeds, don't get the spray out, get the hoe out. This is a three-prong cultivator and a vigorous turning over the topsoil will bury the weeds under the soil, turning them into fertiliser for plant roots. And it's going to stop them competing with your favourite plants and causing you back-breaking work later on. Now, if you haven't got time to get out and weed the garden but you've got time to have a gym membership, you might want to know this. You know, an hour of vigorous hoeing out in the garden is going to burn well over a thousand calories. This is a terrific way to up your aerobic activity and keep yourself fit. If you want the garden to look great and reduce weeding later on, remember, getting outdoors and grabbing a hoe has never been so much fun. Now you know it's good for you, get out and do it.
