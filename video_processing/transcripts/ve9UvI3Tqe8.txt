Travel & Events
 Have you ever stopped by a farm market to pick up homegrown sweet corn, tomatoes, or fresh peaches? Well, join me today and let's go visit a farm market and see what they have to offer. Because that's folks what we call agritourism. Agritourism is about shopping, and I know we all like to shop. If you're wanting to find unique and quality products in a very friendly environment, why don't you come out and visit a farm market where you can buy a gift for yourself, buy plenty of homegrown produce, and special products that usually you just don't see in big malls. Wouldn't you like to smell the aroma of freshly baked bread coming right out of the oven, just like you did at Grandma's Kitchen? Well many agritourism operators now have on-farm bakeries making homemade goodies featuring their fresh fruits. Agritourism is about wineries. Did you know that most every state and every province of Canada now grows grapes and produces wine? Whatever your wine palette, visit the wineries in your area and support your local farmers. Who wouldn't love to sit down and have a home-cooked meal with your entire family? On many farms today, you're able to get food picked and served at the peak of ripeness. With a variety of activities that you've just viewed, agritourism provides something that everyone can enjoy. If you have not begun to experience the bounty of North America to its fullest, now would be a great time to start.
