 Did you know you can easily grow your own ginger at home? Buy one organic ginger at your local market. Take a small plate, add some water and place your ginger in there. Spray some water every day to keep it humid. After a few weeks it will start creating these sprouting eyes. Take a small pot of 4 liters, add some clay balls for drainage and add some soil. Make some space in the middle to plant your ginger eyes home. Cover back without compressing and leave one or two sprouting eyes out of the soil. And water. Keep it inside like an indoor plant and plant out in a bigger pot outside when there is no frost anymore. It will develop lots of new stems. Just one ginger eyes home can produce 10 new ones or even more. Enjoy growing and harvesting your fresh ginger. Green love to you!
