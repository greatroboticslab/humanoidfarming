 Hey folks, Machine Repeat here. We have our next monthly Machine Repeat online auction coming up Tuesday, June 21st. And I tell you what, if you have one piece of equipment for sale for your whole line, I've never seen a better time to be a seller. So 32 plus years I've been compiling auction prices, folks. Like I said, I've never seen a better time to be a seller of good used equipment. Here's a look at our Machine Repeat quarterly use values index report. You can see here going back 21 years to the year 2001. This is again used farm equipment values, 1 to 10 rating scale on the left. You can see first quarter of 2022, we got up to an all-time record high rating of 9.7 used values. We're even rising before commodity prices shot up fall of 2020. You can see late 19, early 20 starting to go up. And then just again through the roof here throughout 2021 and higher into 2022. And actually use values during the normally softer period of April and early May here have been very, very strong. So if you're on your cell phone, folks, go to machinerypeat.com and click on the media and blog link. And then right at the top, it'll say discussed used farm equipment with machinerypeat community. Click on that link. And here you can see what I'm talking about blog I've been writing for years. You can just scroll back through. Just saw a record price on a John Deere 4440 this weekend. You probably saw, but I'm telling you these strong prices are everywhere, every direction, good condition used equipment, not just the low-houred stuff. You can see two of the three highest auction prices ever last six months on Magnum 290s, five of the 10 highest John Deere 7810s. Highest price on a Case H45 utility, highest price in 10 years on a John Deere 9300 four-wheel drive. Skid steers have been hot. Older combines John Deere 9600. This is what I'm talking about. This is just a litany of rising values on good condition used equipment, all types. And again, not just the crazy low-houred stuff, but higher-houred stuff in good condition too. And this is why I've been saying I've never seen a better time to be a seller. Folks, we've been seeing some really strong pricing on our recent Machine Repeat monthly online auctions. Here's a look at our April sale. And check out that price on that 2013 John Deere 6150M with a loader, 2916 hours. 103,250 bucks. That's the all-time highest auction price ever on a 6150M with over 2,500 hours. Look at this John Deere 7830, the 06 model, over 4,600 hours. That's the third highest auction price ever on a 7830 with over 4,500 hours. The John Deere 7630, 08, almost 5,000 hours. That's the highest auction price ever on a 7630 with over 4,600 hours. Look at that 2013 McCormick MTX 145, 72 and a quarter. We had 173 bids on that thing. And if we zoom down here out west from Idaho came this 08 New Holland TV 145 with 2,288 hours on it. That sold for 65,750 bucks. Second highest auction price ever on a 2,000 plus hour TV 145 in the US. And again, this was just from the month of April.
