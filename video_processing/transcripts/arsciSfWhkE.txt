Howto & Style
 Nothing beats a farm fresh egg, but a lot of homesteaders always stumble on this question to wash or not to wash to which I say hogwash. I'm just going to show you how my grandparents taught me how to clean our eggs and my family's done for years and it's great because it leaves the bloom on the egg so you don't have to refrigerate it and you can just put it on the counter. All you need is a sanding block and your egg. There's a high grit one probably 320 or so so all you're going to do is just take it see the little dirt slightly brush it on your egg back and forth just go around cover the surface of the egg wherever there is any debris or doo doo or whatever on the egg once you just clean that nice and light give a nice little blow there you go farm fresh clean egg ready for the countertop or ready for your frying pan.
