 Good day friends, Lance here and just wanted to show you a little bit of an update. Picking up some nice forage here and my neighbors baling it up. Beautiful sunset. And we got a lot of, quite a bit of understory here of clovers, but we got plans here. You can see where the rye is drilled. And, yeah, we're gonna, this is I think what would be step four or five. This has been covers three years now, different mixes. And we are cut it for feed and actually gonna come back and the plan is to whack it again in about a week to kill the regrowth. And we're gonna roll out a bunch of bales. They're probably hard to see, but I got about 30 bales we're gonna roll out. And people might ask what's this for, right? Well, this is a pollinator, prairie pollinator strip. Lots of diversity. Look at, look at the clovers in here. Just awesome. And, um, yeah. So we're, we're gonna save this here for our friends of pollinators. And, uh, you know, we've got chicory. Look at, we got little spittle bugs. Uh, we got, a lot of people call this a weed. Well, it's indicating anaerobic. Um, we got a side hill, kind of a seepy spot right in here. I've done some videos. And so we are going to, I'm actually gonna roll out some bales right down the gut here. Um, because our soils need, need various things. First and foremost, it wants us to think outside the box. Um, so we're gonna do something very different. And I'm sure the neighbors are gonna talk. Um, but this here is, I wish you could smell it. It's one of my most favorite smells of the world. Curing hay. It represents farming. Feeding the world, feeding my community. Represents hard work. Represents caring and stewarding this piece of land. Sharing. How are we gonna share on this farm? We share with a flower farm. We host people in our Airbnbs. We're building a multi-purpose classroom, if you will. Not just the land. Here's Rainbow. Hey Rainbow. That's Rainbow. Hey Rainbow. Oh Rainbow. But really, we're building this very unique little building because we wanna share. We're trying to share our farm. Quote unquote, our farm with all of you. Some of you that are watching. And, yeah. So, getting back to the experiment at hand here. This is gonna be taken for feed. David's about done baling. And, um... Plan is to come back, whack it really tight. So, let it grow up a little bit. Whack it again. And then, you can see all these bales over here. We'll walk over there. But, take them, roll them out with a friend of mine, Jones. Uh... Greg Judy Balen Roller. And... We're gonna roll her thick. There's, uh... Just under an acre here. And we're gonna no-till in a mix. We're gonna do some variety of things. I'm really excited about that. Getting some seed from a good friend, Tom Cotter. Shout out to him. Um... Austin, Minnesota. He's a leader. He's a pioneer. Um... But here you can see the tool of choice. And then I just bought a bunch of bales in. Oat bales. Rye bales from last year. Um... That's the ticket. Getting carbon on the ground. I'm not even allowing the cows to eat that. I'd like them to stomp it in. Put some manure on it. But they're on a different farm. So... That's what we're gonna do. And then we're gonna, again, share our farm with others. So... Beautiful night. I'm not gonna lie. It's just wonderful to soak it in. We've got Norman, our little calf, nursing. Farm camp starts next week, you know. We're gonna utilize this. This building. And... Oh, look at here. We gotta stop and smell the roses. I mean, sweet clover. Haha. Oh, this is a beautiful plant. Interestingly, I didn't plant any of this in this mixture. Baiting seed banks at work, friends. So anyway, beautiful night. Um... Again, pollinators in here. We're doing stuff different, friends. But, again, it's part of the journey. And I'm really thankful for men and neighbors like David. People that can help me build this. Because I can't build this by myself. I can't do everything. I'm thankful for the little critters that inhabit this. This is milkweed. The kids found the first Monarch caterpillar last night. When we were out looking for Norman. So, here's your first hand look at it if you catch a vision. Catch our vision. So, that's kind of what it's gonna look like. Here's a first hand look at this. And, uh, with that, the sun is about ready to set. Little David's done. Thanks for watchin', friends.
