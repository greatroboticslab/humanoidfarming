 Picture this. You wake up at 4 a.m. because today is the last day you can harvest corn before the rains come. 400 acres are waiting for you. If you don't make it in time, you'll lose a $200,000 crop. You walk to your tractor, turn the ignition, and see a red message on the screen. System error. Engine locked. Contact dealer. The tractor won't start. It doesn't stall. It simply refuses to start. And you know everything under the hood is fine. The computer just decided you don't have the right to use your own machine. The dealer can come in a week. Clouds are already gathering on the horizon. Sound like a nightmare? No, friends. This is the daily reality of thousands of American farmers. Over the next 45 minutes, you'll hear 12 real stories of farmers from all corners of America. Stories that will tell you the truth about how the world's biggest corporations have turned your farming neighbors into helpless hostages of their own equipment. But before we begin, write in the comments where you're watching this video from. Texas? Iowa? California? Or maybe you're not from America at all? I'm curious to know how widespread this problem has become. Here's a number that knocks you off your feet. New John Deere 8R Series tractors cost between $330,000 to $435,000. Do you know how much an average house in America costs in Tutti 25? $403,000 to $418,000. Yes, a tractor costs almost as much as a house. But here's what's truly insane. When you buy a house for $400,000, you can do whatever you want with it. Repaint the walls. Change the wiring. Install new windows. It's your house. But when you buy a tractor for $400,000, you can't fix it. You can't buy parts anywhere you want. You can't even look inside without violating your agreement with the manufacturer. Friends, I'm not telling you this for no reason. I spent the last six months talking to farmers across the country, and what I learned kept me awake at night. This is a story about how American corporations are destroying what makes America great, independence, self-reliance, and property rights. This is a story about how technological progress has become a tool of control and profit. Jim Robertson from Stone County, Iowa, has been farming for 35 years. His grandfather and father were farmers, too. In his garage still stands an old International Harvester 1066 from 1973, a tractor his grandfather bought new that year. This old beauty worked without problems for 50 years, says Jim, patting the worn hood. When something broke, I grabbed a wrench and fixed it. At most, I needed to drive to town for a part. But in 2019, Jim decided to modernize. He bought a new John Deere 8245R for $425,000. The dealer convinced me it was an investment in the future, he recalls. GPS navigation, autopilot, crop monitoring system, everything state-of-the-art. The problem started after just three months. In the middle of corn harvest, an error message appeared on the tractor screen. The engine died. Jim tried everything he knew. Checked oil, coolant, filters. Everything was fine, but the tractor refused to start. I called the dealer, Jim recounts. They said they couldn't tell me what was wrong over the phone. They needed a special diagnostic computer. The nearest authorized service was 150 miles away. A technician could only come in four days. Cost of the visit, $500 plus $150 per hour of work. I lost four days of harvest, says Jim bitterly, all because a computer decided something was wrong with the tractor. When actually, the problem was a sensor that cost $15. But the worst was yet to come. To understand how we got here, we need to go back in time. In the 1960s, 70s, American farmers were true masters of their equipment. International harvester John Deere, Case. All these companies competed not only in sales, but in how easy their machines were to service. Bob Henderson, from Kansas, remembers those times. My father bought a Farmall M in 1968. The tractor came with complete engine, transmission, and hydraulic schematics. Everything was marked and numbered. If something broke, you took the diagram and fixed it. In the 1980s, things were still mostly normal. Computers were just starting to appear in tractors, and they were simple. Basic sensors, simple diagnostic codes that could be read without special equipment. I remember my first computerized tractor, recalls Mike Thompson from Illinois. Case IH-7140 Magnum, 1992. When an error appeared, the display showed a code. You looked in the manual to see what the code meant and fixed the problem. Everything was honest. But then came the 90s, and everything changed. At first, the changes seemed positive. Tractors became more powerful, more fuel-efficient, more precise. GPS navigation promised a revolution in precision agriculture. Automatic steering was supposed to reduce farmer fatigue. We were all excited. Remember Steve Miller from Minnesota. Finally, technology came to the farm. We thought it would make our lives easier. But gradually, manufacturers began closing access to technical information. At first, this only affected the most complex systems. For safety, they said, to prevent damage. Kevin Kenney from Nebraska experienced firsthand what this safety meant. In 2003, Kevin bought a new Case IH-STX440. The tractor cost $285,000. Huge money for an average farm. But Kevin decided on this purchase because he needed a powerful tractor to work his 2,400 acres. The first two years were wonderful, Kevin recounts. The tractor worked like clockwork. I even recommended it to neighbors. But in the third year, something went wrong. In spring, when Kevin was preparing for planting, the tractor started malfunctioning. Power dropped. The engine ran unevenly. Kevin, as an experienced mechanic, tried to diagnose the problem himself. I removed the engine cover, checked the intake system. Filters, he recalls. Everything looked normal, but the tractor kept acting sick. Kevin went to the Case IH dealer in Omaha. There, he was told that diagnosis required a special computer. The new Holland electronic service tool. It cost $12,000 and was sold only to authorized dealers. I asked if I could buy this tool, Kevin recounts. I was told no. Only dealers can have access to diagnostics. The diagnosis revealed a problem in the fuel injection system. One injector was working incorrectly. Repair cost, $8,000. Plus $500 for diagnostics. I knew the injector cost at most $1,000, says Kevin. But I was told I couldn't buy it myself. Only through an authorized dealer. And only they could install it. This was the first warning bell. But Kevin didn't yet understand this was just the beginning. Friends, what happened to Kevin next shows the true face of the problem. But before I tell you the continuation of his story, I want to remind you, don't forget to write in the comments where you're watching this video from. And hit like if you think these stories need to be heard by more people. Because what's happening to American farmers affects all of us. So what happened to Kevin Kenney next? Remember, his Case IH STX-40 needed an $8,000 repair for one injector? Kevin didn't give up. Like a true American farmer, he decided to find a way out. After all, an injector is a simple mechanical part that's existed for 100 years. What could be complicated? I went to an independent mechanic in the neighboring town, Kevin recounts. Old Joe Weimer had been repairing diesel engines for 40 years. He said the injector was indeed simple, and he could repair it for $300. But when Joe tried to install the repaired injector, the tractor refused to start. A message appeared on the display. Wait, wait. The tractor knew the injector wasn't original? How is this possible? It turns out every Case IH part has a unique electronic code. When the tractor's central computer doesn't recognize this code, it blocks engine operation, even if the part works perfectly. It was like a punch to the gut, Kevin remembers. I realized my $285,000 tractor didn't actually obey me. It only obeyed Case IH's computer. But do you know what's worst? Kevin didn't yet know his problems were just beginning. What will happen when he learns about the remote shutdown system? More on that shortly. Let's break down how this control system works step by step. Step 1. Software locks. Every modern tractor is essentially a computer on wheels. A John Deere 8R has 15 different computer units connected by a CAN bus network. These units constantly exchange information and check each other. Step 2. Component authorization. Every part has an electronic DNA. A unique code showing it was manufactured by an authorized supplier and installed by an authorized dealer. Step 3. Constant monitoring. The tractor records everything. When you start it, how long you work, what parts you change, even where you drive thanks to GPS. Step 4. Remote control. Through satellite communication, the manufacturer can lock your tractor remotely. Officially to fight theft. Unofficially to control you. But can you imagine what will happen if this system is used against farmers? The Anderson family story will show you how terrible this can be. Before I tell you the Anderson story, look at these numbers. John Deere hydraulic hose replacement. $450. The same hose at an auto parts store. $23. Engine error diagnostics. $150 per hour. Diagnostic time. Minimum 2 hours. Technician call out. $500 plus. $2 per mile. New control unit programming. $800 for a procedure that takes 10 minutes. David Smith from Texas keeps detailed records of all repairs. Over the past five years, he spent $47,000 on servicing one John Deere 8320ER tractor. The funniest thing is that half of these repairs are software problems. Okay, says David. The tractor is physically fine, but the computer decides something's wrong. Example. Last month, David couldn't start his tractor because the system decided the AdBlue level, emission reduction fluid, was too low. Actually, the tank was full, but the sensor was giving false readings. Repair cost, $200. New sensor cost, $45. The rest, system programming and calibration. I asked the technician if I could replace the sensor myself, David recounts. He laughed and said, even if you replace the sensor, the system won't accept it without authorization, and only we can provide authorization. But what if I told you this money is pennies compared to what happened to the Anderson family, ready to learn how one broken tractor can destroy a farm that existed for 80 years? The Anderson family has been farming in North Dakota since 1943. Grandfather Charles Anderson bought his first plot with money earned in the war. Father Robert Anderson expanded the farm to end on 800 acres. And son Michael Anderson was supposed to pass the business to his children. Was supposed to, but couldn't. In 2018, Michael bought two new John Deere 8345R tractors. Total cost, $950,000. These were the most expensive tractors in their farm's history, but Michael believed they would pay for themselves through increased productivity. The dealer convinced me it was a 20-year investment, Michael recounts. They promised minimal maintenance costs thanks to smart systems. Problems started in the first spring. In the middle of planting, one tractor started stalling. Michael called the dealer. The earliest date for a technician visit in a week. Planting can't wait. I asked if I could look at the problem myself, says Michael. I was told any intervention on my part would void the warranty. Michael decided to risk it. He removed the engine cover and saw that one cable had come loose. A simple problem that could be fixed in a minute. But when Michael reconnected the cable and tried to start the tractor, a message appeared on screen. Unauthorized intervention detected. Tractor locked. Contact dealer. Friends, imagine this feeling. You own a $475,000 tractor. You see a problem that can be fixed in a minute. But your own tractor refuses to obey you. This isn't science fiction. This is the reality of American farming in 2025. But are you ready to learn what happened to Michael next? Spoiler. The story gets worse. Because it turns out John Deere can not only lock your tractor, they can do much worse things. When the John Deere technician finally came to Michael, they didn't just unlock the tractor. They also presented a bill for unauthorized intervention diagnostics. $20,300. They said I damaged system integrity, Michael recalls, for reconnecting one cable that came loose by itself. But this was just the beginning. A month later, the second tractor broke down. The problem was in the hydraulic system. An original pump cost $300. $200. Michael found a similar pump from a known manufacturer for $800. I thought, well, what could happen? It's just a pump, says Michael. But when the local mechanic installed the new pump, the tractor locked up again. The system detected an unauthorized component and refused to work. To unlock the tractor, Michael had to pay $500 for technician call-out, buy the original pump for $300. Pay $800 for installation. Pay $400 for system reinitialization. Total cost? $4,900 instead of $800. It was like highway robbery, says Michael, but I couldn't do anything. Without tractors, I couldn't harvest the crop. But the worst was yet to come. In fall 2019, Michael received a letter from John Deere. The company announced that software support for his tractors was ending. To continue working, he needed to update the software for $15,000 per tractor. They said, without the update, the tractors would gradually stop working, Michael recounts. First auxiliary functions would disconnect, then GPS, then autopilot. Eventually, the tractor wouldn't start at all. But what if I tell you even this isn't the worst example of corporate tyranny? What if farmers started uniting and fighting? And what if this fight takes forms that shock even experienced lawyers? Dr. Susan Clark from the University of Iowa studies the impact of technological stress on farmers' psyche. Her conclusions are stunning. We're seeing a new form of depression that can be called technological helplessness, says Dr. Clark. Farmers feel like strangers on their own land with their own equipment. Statistics confirm her words. 23% of farmers report constant stress due to equipment problems. 31% consider selling their farm due to technological issues. 18% seek psychological help. James Wilson from Montana recounts, I don't sleep at night thinking about my tractors, not about crops, not about weather, but about whether they'll start tomorrow morning. This isn't what I expected from farming. But the saddest are stories of old farmers who can't adapt to new realities. Frank Johnson, 68, has been farming in Oklahoma for 45 years. Last year, he was forced to sell his farm after being unable to fix his Case IH tractor. I've repaired thousands of machines in my life, says Frank with tears in his eyes. But this tractor defeated me. I don't understand why I can't fix what I paid for. Frank sold his farm to an agribusiness corporation. Now he works there as a hired hand on land that once belonged to his family. The most painful thing is that my son won't be able to inherit the farm, says Frank. Eighty years of family business ended, because of one tractor. But what if I tell you some farmers didn't give up? That they found ways to bypass corporate control? And that these methods are so creative that even Silicon Valley hackers envy them? Before telling you about farmer revolutionaries, let's look at where the current trend is leading us. In Tutsiore, John Deere announced a new service. Farming as a Service. Instead of buying a tractor, farmers will rent access to agricultural operations. You pay for each field pass for each ton of harvested crop. This is the future of farming, declared John Deere CEO John May. Farmers will be able to focus on what they do best, growing food, and will take care of the technology. Sounds good? Let's look at the details. Under the FAST system, the farmer does not own the equipment. He cannot choose when and how to use it. If he doesn't pay for the service, the equipment automatically locks. Additionally, all information about crops, soils, and growing methods becomes John Deere's property. The company can sell this data, use it for price forecasting, even pass it to competitors. This is the end of independent farming, warns attorney Nathan Probst, who represents farmers' interests in lawsuits against equipment manufacturers. Farmers will become hired hands-on their own land. But the scariest thing is the possibility of remote control. Imagine, in the middle of harvest, all tractors in a region simultaneously stop. The reason, changed contract terms or non-payment for services. This isn't paranoia, says Probst. This is a business model being actively developed. But are farmers ready to accept such a future? Or will they fight? And if so, what does this fight look like? Friends, what you'll hear next may shock you. Because it turns out some American farmers have already started their own war against corporate control. And the methods they use remind you of hacker movies. Ready to learn how a 65-year-old farmer from Kansas became a cyber pirate? How underground workshops repair unrepairable equipment? And why the FBI monitors forums discussing tractor repair? All this. In the next part. Don't switch channels. Donald Doc Harrison, 65 Kansas. At first glance, an ordinary farmer. Jeans, checkered shirt, calloused hands. Fizzage, Tia Itoat. But in his garage stands equipment that would make any Silicon Valley hacker jealous. Never thought I'd become a cyber pirate at 65. Doc laughs, showing his laboratory. On the table, laptops, oscilloscopes, chip programmers, and dozens of cables. But when you're pushed to the edge, you do what you have to. Doc's story began three years ago when his John Deere 8370R locked up due to an emissions control system error. The dealer demanded $12,000 for repair. Doc decided to figure it out himself. I was taking apart radios when I was 10, he says. A tractor is the same electronics, just bigger. But Doc quickly realized it wasn't just about technical knowledge. He needed to crack protection that John Deere's best engineers had been developing for years. And you know what? He succeeded. Using software from Ukrainian forums and Chinese diagnostic tools, Doc cracked his tractor's protection system. He not only fixed the breakdown, but also disabled all restrictions on using non-original parts. Now my tractor obeys me. Not John Deere, says Doc proudly. But does he understand how dangerous what he's doing might be? And what will happen when corporations learn about people like him? Friends, before I continue, I want to say, if you support farmers' right to repair their own equipment, like this video, show that we're not alone in this fight. And definitely share this video with friends. Every American should know this truth. Doc's story isn't unique. Across the country, farmers are creating an underground network that helps each other bypass corporate restrictions. Louie Rossman, owner of an electronics repair shop in New York, became an unexpected hero of the right-to-repair movement. Though he's never lived on a farm, millions of farmers watch his YouTube videos. The principle is the same, Rossman explains. Whether it's an iPhone or a tractor, you have the right to fix what you bought with your money. Rossman teaches farmers electronics and programming basics for free. His channel became a university for thousands of American farmers. But most interesting is the network of tractor hackers operating across the country. Jake Wheeler from Illinois created a closed online community where farmers exchange schematics, software, and methods to bypass protection. The group already has over 15,000 members. We're not thieves, says Jake. We're owners who want to use our property. This network has its own rules. No commerce, only mutual aid. No hacking others' equipment. Only your own. No harmful actions. Only restoring functionality. Tim Brown from Ohio tells how this network saved his farm. My case IH locked up in the middle of corn harvest. The dealer could only come in a week. I wrote to the group and got instructions on bypassing the lock in two hours. The crop was saved. But do you know that even the FBI monitors these forums? And that some farmers have already received court summons for unauthorized access to computer systems? While some farmers fight electronics, others chose a simpler path, returning to old equipment. The used tractor market is experiencing a real boom. Tractors from the 1980s, 90s, which used to sell for pennies, now cost tens of thousands of dollars. Bob McKenzie from Wisconsin has been selling old tractors for 20 years. Never seen demand like this, he says. Farmers are ready to pay $30,000 for a 1976 International 1086. A new tractor with the same characteristics costs $200,000. Why are farmers ready to pay so much for ancient equipment? It's simple, explained Sam Davis from Indiana, who last year sold his new John Deere and bought three old International harvesters. I can fix old tractors myself. New ones? No. But most interesting are the stories of old equipment modernization. Mike Johnson from Texas created a real masterpiece. He took a 1973 Massey Ferguson chassis and installed a modern Caterpillar engine, GPS system, and Case IH hydraulics. The result? A tractor with modern machine power, but with self-repair capability. This monster cost me $45,000, including modernization, says Mike. A new tractor with these characteristics would cost $350,000, and I couldn't fix it. But most importantly, Mike can do whatever he wants with this tractor, install any parts, change settings, even sell it without restrictions. But what will happen when corporations try to ban old equipment sales, or when parts for it become unavailable? Are farmers ready for such developments? Let's look at specific numbers showing the economic benefit of abandoning new equipment. Cost comparison over five years. 1,000-acre farm. New John Deere 8345R 2023 model. Purchase $485,000. Maintenance $67,000. Parts $23,000. Diagnostics $8,500. $8,500. Software Updates $12,000. Total $595,500. Rebuilt International. 1486 1981 model. Purchase and restoration $35,000. Maintenance $8,000. Parts $12,000. Modernization $15,000. Total $70,000. Savings $525,500. Over five years. I invested this money in land, says Dave Martin from Minnesota, who switched to old tractors two years ago, bought an additional 200 acres instead of one new tractor. Steve Foster from North Dakota calculated even more detail. For the money of one new tractor, I bought three old ones, rebuilt them, and still had money left for a new grain dryer. But the most interesting statistic is productivity. University of Nebraska research showed the efficiency difference between old and new tractors is only 7 to 12 percent. And considering downtime due to breakdowns and waiting for repairs, old tractors often outperform new ones. My international works 320 days a year, says Fred Wilson from Ohio. My neighbor's John Deere sits in repair 45 days a year. Who's more productive? But won't this trend lead to technological degradation of American farming? Can old tractors compete with autopilot and precision agriculture? Friends, I see in the comments many questions about where to find old tractors and how to rebuild them. Write in the comments if you want a separate video on this topic. If we get 1,000 likes, I'll make a detailed guide on buying and restoring classic tractors. Farmers aren't just returning to old equipment, they're modernizing it, creating hybrids of past and future. The Jackson brothers from Iowa created their own company, Heritage Tech, specializing in classic tractor modernization. They install GPS systems, autopilot, and precision dispensers on 1970s, 80s tractors. The secret is open standards, explains Tom Jackson. We use GPS from Trimble, autopilot from Ag Leader, dispensers from Raven. It all works together and doesn't depend on one manufacturer. The result is impressive. A modernized 1979 Alice Chalmers 7080 with GPS and autopilot costs $85,000. A new tractor with similar functions costs $450,000. Plus, I can change any system for the better, adds Tom. If new GPS technology appears, I just install it. With a new John Deere tractor, you're tied to their systems forever. Another interesting trend is electrification of old tractors. Old Iron Electric Company from California installs Tesla Motors on classic tractor chassis. An electric tractor has incredible torque, says company founder Richard Stone, plus no emissions, minimal maintenance, and complete independence from oil companies. But are big corporations ready to quietly watch this revolution? Won't they try to stop the farmers' independence movement? John Deere and other manufacturers aren't sitting idle. They're developing new control methods to stop the farmer revolution. First method, legal pressure. Companies sue farmers for software copyright violation. There are already several cases where farmers received fines up to $50,000 for self-repair. Second method, parts control. John Deere buys independent parts manufacturers and shuts them down. Over the past two years, five major non-original parts suppliers have disappeared. Third method, technological blockade. New models have even more protection systems that even experienced hackers can't bypass. But the scariest method is lobbying at the state level. Companies try to pass laws banning unauthorized agricultural equipment repair. They say it's for safety, warns attorney James McBride. But actually, it's an attempt to monopolize the repair market. Texas is already considering a bill that would make using non-original parts on farms larger than 500 acres illegal. Fine. Up to $100,000. If this law passes, small farmers will be destroyed, says Mike Rodriguez from the Texas Farmers Association. But does this mean farmers defeat, or will they find new ways to fight, and what will happen when politicians and courts join this war? Interestingly, the right-to-repair problem exists not only in America, and some countries have already won. France passed the Farmers' Digital Independence Act in 2023. Now manufacturers must provide complete technical documentation, sell parts to anyone who wants them, ensure compatibility with other manufacturers' systems. Result? French farmers save an average of 40% on equipment maintenance. Australia created a state program for independent workshop certification. Any mechanic can take courses and get the right to work on any equipment without voiding warranty. Competition in repair reduced prices by 60%, says Australia's Minister of Agriculture. Even Ukraine, despite the war, farmers have more repair rights than Americans. Ukrainian mechanics freely work with John Deere, adapt parts, and even manufacture analogs. How did it happen that in the land of freedom, farmers have fewer rights than in other countries? But what will happen when American farmers unite for political struggle? What will happen when cities join the movement? And can consumers force corporations to change their policies? If you're watching this video from outside America, write in the comments how things are with repair rights in your country. It's interesting to compare the situation in different parts of the world. And don't forget to subscribe to the channel. More shocking facts ahead. Our tractors are the most environmentally friendly in history, declares John Deere advertising. 90% reduction in emissions, 40% increase in fuel efficiency. Sounds wonderful, right? But what if I tell you this environmental friendliness is actually destroying the planet? Dr. Melissa Chen from the University of California studies the impact of modern agriculture on the environment. Her conclusions are shocking. A new tractor indeed consumes less fuel during operation, explains Dr. Chen. But producing one such tractor generates as much CO2 as an old tractor produces in 15 years of operation. The numbers are staggering. Production of one John Deere 8R, 450 tons of CO2. Annual emissions of old international harvester, 28 tons of CO2. Environmental payback time for new tractor, 16 years. But that's not the worst, continues Dr. Chen. New tractors become unusable after 8, 10 years due to software restrictions. Old ones work 30, 40 years. Mark Davison from Oregon experienced this environmental friendliness firsthand. His farm specializes in organic products and ecology for him isn't just words. I bought a new Case IH, believing the environmental advertising, Mark recounts. But after three years, I realized my grandfather with his 1956 Farmall caused less environmental damage. Why? It's not just about production. New tractors require special fluids, filters, and additives that can't be recycled. AdBlue, Nox Emission Reduction Fluid, is a prime example. One tractor consumes 2,000 liters of AdBlue per year. This fluid is produced from natural gas with huge CO2 emissions, plus plastic packaging, transportation, specialized disposal. An old tractor burns diesel, and that's it, says Mark. A new one burns diesel, plus AdBlue, plus consumes electricity for computers, plus needs air conditioning during storage. But worst is disposal. An old tractor is 95% metal, easily recyclable. A new one contains hundreds of kilograms of electronics, plastic, and composite materials. But what will happen when millions of smart tractors become electronic waste? Is the planet ready for such an environmental catastrophe? But ecology is only part of the problem. The real tragedy unfolds at the social level. High costs of modern equipment destroy small farms and concentrate land in agribusiness hands. The statistics are merciless. In 1950, the U.S. had 5.6 million farms. In 2000, 2.2 million. In 2025, 1.9 million. Forecast for 2030, 1.5 million. Every day, America loses 100 family farms, says sociologist Dr. Robert Kimball from the University of Iowa. And the main reason is inability to buy and maintain modern equipment. The Wilson family story from Michigan is a typical example of this tragedy. Five generations of Wilsons farmed 800 acres near Detroit. Grandfather George bought the land in 1923. Father William expanded the farm in the 1960s. Son Robert successfully ran the business until 2020. Everything changed when our old John Deere 4020 broke down, Robert recounts. The dealer said repair wasn't worthwhile. We needed to buy new. A new tractor cost $385,000. Robert took a loan secured by the farm. But a year later, it turned out income wasn't enough even to service the debt. The bank gave me a choice, says Robert bitterly. Either I sell the farm to an agribusiness corporation or they take it for debts. Robert sold. Now where five family farms once stood is one huge Tyson Foods complex. Instead of 25 families living off the land, eight hired workers are employed. Most painful is that my son won't be a farmer, says Robert. A hundred years of family tradition ended because of one tractor. But do corporations understand that by destroying small farms, they're undermining the foundation of American society? Or is this actually to their advantage? Dr. Sarah Thompson works as a psychologist in rural Kansas. Over the past five years, she's noticed a disturbing trend, a sharp rise in depression among farmers. Previously, farmers came because of financial problems or family conflicts, Dr. Thompson recounts. Now, half my patients complain about stress from equipment. This new type of stress even has a special name, technological helplessness. Farmers feel like strangers in their own operations. Jim Anderson, not the one who lost his farm, from South Dakota, describes his condition. I wake up at night in cold sweat, thinking about my tractor. Will it start tomorrow? Will some error appear? Will the system lock up? Statistics confirm the scale of the problem. Thirty-four percent of farmers take sedatives. Twenty-eight percent consider changing professions. Fifteen percent have suicidal thoughts. Farming has always been a stressful profession, explains Dr. Thompson. But before, stress came from nature. Drought, floods, plant diseases. You can fight that. Now stress comes from equipment you can't control. It's especially hard for the older generation. Sixty-seven-year-old Frank Miller from Nebraska has been farming for 45 years. His story is a cry from the soul of an entire generation. I've repaired thousands of machines in my life, says Frank with tears. Combines, tractors, plows, everything that can break, but this new John Deere defeated me. Last year, Frank's tractor locked up due to an emissions control system error. The dealer said repair would take a week and cost $8,000. I sat in the cab and cried, Frank recalls. For the first time in 45 years of farming, I felt helpless. Frank tried to figure out the problem himself, but faced computer codes he didn't understand. The tractor manual was 2,000 pages of technical documentation. Before, I could fix a tractor with a hammer and wrench, says Frank. Now I need a computer engineer. Psychological pressure is especially strong during intensive agricultural seasons. When every day of delay costs thousands of dollars, dependence on dealer service becomes unbearable. But what will happen when an entire generation of farmers can't adapt to new realities? Who will feed America? To understand where we're going, let's look at corporations' plans for the next 20 years. John Deere is investing $2 billion in developing fully autonomous tractors. By 2030, the company plans to release the first unmanned machines for commercial use. The future is farms without farmers, declared John Deere Technical Director John Stone. Artificial intelligence will make all decisions from planting to harvesting. Sounds like science fiction? Prototypes already exist. On John Deere Research Farms in Illinois, tractors work that process field all season without human intervention. But there's one nuance corporations don't like to talk about. These smart farms will belong not to farmers, but to agribusiness corporations. The model is simple. A landowner signs a contract with John Deere or another corporation. The company provides the full growing cycle from plowing to harvesting. The landowner receives a fixed percentage of the crop. This is the end of independent farming, warns economist Dr. Michael Robinson from Cornell University. Farmers will become tenants of their own land. Already in California, several such unmanned farms operate. Results are impressive. Yield increased 23%. Fertilizer use decreased 31%. Labor costs 87%. But there is a dark side. On a 2,000 acre farm where 45 people once worked, now three operator technicians work. What happened to the other 42 jobs? They disappeared forever, says Dr. Robinson. And this is just the beginning. According to Deloitte forecasts, by 2040, 60% of American farms will be fully automated. This means the disappearance of 1.2 million agricultural jobs. But scariest is control over food. If all food is grown by a few corporations using their equipment, what happens to America's food security? And what if these corporations decide to raise prices? Or if hackers attack their systems and paralyze food production across the country? Cybersecurity in agriculture is a problem few talk about. But experts are sounding the alarm. In 2023, hackers attacked the wholesome farms management system in Ohio. For a week, they controlled irrigation systems, livestock feeding, and greenhouse climate control. They could destroy the entire crop with one mouse click, recounts farm owner Tom Wilson. We paid ransom in Bitcoin to regain control. But imagine what will happen when millions of smart tractors are connected to the Internet, when the entire food production system becomes dependent on software. Lieutenant General Michael Smith, former director of the U.S. Cyber Security Agency, warns of an apocalyptic scenario. If an adversary attacks our agricultural infrastructure during harvest, they could deprive America of 40% of its food in one day. And this isn't paranoia. In 2022, Russian hackers already tried to attack John Deere systems in Ukraine. They managed to lock several tractors during planting. Agriculture is becoming a battlefield of future wars, says General Smith. And we're making ourselves vulnerable by giving control to corporations. But there's another risk almost no one thinks about. What if John Deere or another corporation goes bankrupt? Or if it decides to stop supporting old models? In 2024, Microsoft ended Windows 10 support. Millions of computers worldwide became vulnerable. Now imagine the same happening with tractors. And what will happen to American farming if China Noodles or another foreign company buys John Deere? Can America trust food production to equipment controlled from Beijing? Maybe you think, so what? These are farmers' problems, not mine. But you're wrong. Every American pays for corporate tyranny in agriculture. Economist Dr. Lisa Johnson from Harvard calculated the true cost of equipment repair monopoly. The numbers are shocking. Inflated equipment maintenance costs add to product prices. Corn plus Dillard 23 per bushel. Soybeans plus Dillard 67 per bushel. Wheat plus Dillard 31 per bushel. Milk plus Dillard 12 per gallon. Meat plus Dillard 89 per pound. The average American family pays an additional 847 per year due to equipment repair monopoly, says Dr. Johnson. But these are only direct costs. There are also indirect ones. When small farms go bankrupt, competition decreases. Agribusiness corporations can dictate prices. Over the past five years, prices for basic products rose 34 percent, significantly more than official inflation. We're creating an oligarchy in food production, warns Dr. Johnson. And consumers will pay more and more for it. Additionally, when farmers can't afford modern equipment, product quality suffers. Old equipment is less precise, uses more pesticides, and fertilizers. The irony is that by trying to make farming more efficient, corporations make it more expensive and lower quality, says Dr. Johnson. And what will happen when the monopoly becomes complete? When three or four corporations control all food production in America, will they be able to dictate not only prices, but what to grow? Imagine a future where John Deere decides how much corn will be grown in Iowa. where artificial intelligence algorithms determine American families' menus. This isn't fiction. It's the logical continuation of current trends. But what if Americans don't accept such a future? What if farmers, consumers, and politicians unite to fight? Can we still stop the corporate machine grinding up independent farming? The answer to these questions in the final part of our investigation. Don't switch channels. But there's good news, too. A real revolution is unfolding across America, state by state, passing right-to-repair laws. And farmers are winning the first important battles. Minnesota became the first state to pass a comprehensive law on farmers' right to repair equipment. On May 15, 2024, Governor Tim Walz signed the historic document. Farmers have the right to fix what they bought with their money, declared the governor. This is the foundation of American freedom. Minnesota's law requires manufacturers to provide complete technical documentation, sell parts to anyone, provide access to diagnostic equipment, not block equipment for using non-original parts. Results didn't take long. In the first six months after the law's passage, farmers' repair costs decreased by 43%. Number of independent workshops increased by 67%. Repair waiting time decreased from 8 to 2 days. This gave me back the feeling of control over my own equipment, says Tom Anderson from Minnesota, who previously lost his farm due to tractor problems. But Minnesota isn't alone. Oregon, California, New York, and 12 more states are preparing similar laws. In Oregon, Bill H.R. 2057, Farmers Digital Independence Act, passed first reading with 47 votes for against 13 against. Support is huge, says Bill author Congressman Pete DeFazio. Even Republicans understand this is a freedom issue, not a party issue. Most interesting, the laws are supported not only by farmers, consumers, environmentalists, and even some tech companies joined the coalition. Apple unexpectedly supported the right to repair, stating, We believe people have the right to fix their devices. This became a signal for other tech companies. Microsoft, Google, and even Tesla officially supported right to repair bills. Their argument is simple. John Deere's repair monopoly could spread to other industries. Today they control tractors, tomorrow, cars, the day after, our phones, warns Tesla CEO Elon Musk. But corporations don't surrender. John Deere spent $23 million lobbying against right to repair laws. They fund research that proves the danger of self-repair. And what will happen when the fight reaches the federal level? Are Washington politicians ready to challenge powerful corporations? While political struggle continues, farmers can't just wait. They need practical solutions right now. Here's what experts advise. Tip number one. Buy old tractors. Look for 1980s, 90s machines, advises equipment expert Bob Henderson. It's the golden era, modern enough to be efficient, but simple enough to repair. Best models to buy. International Harvester, 1086, 1976, 1981. John Deere, 4440, 1982, 1987. Case IH, 7140, 1988, T95. Massey Ferguson, 3680, 1993, 1998. These tractors can be found for $15,000, $40,000 and rebuilt to perfect condition for $10,000 to $15,000. Tip number two. Learn electronics. Even old tractors have basic electronics. Farmers create training courses for their colleagues. Jake Miller from Kansas organized Farm Electronics Academy. In two years, he taught over 500 farmers diagnostics and repair basics. You don't need to be an engineer, says Jake. Understanding basic principles is enough. Tip number three. Create cooperatives. Farmers unite to jointly buy diagnostic equipment and hire qualified technicians. The Midwest Repair Alliance Cooperative in Iowa unites 147 farms. Together, they bought a $45,000 diagnostic complex and employ two technicians. Each farm pays $300 per year, explains Cooperative Manager Mike Johnson. For this money, we get full service without corporate markup. Tip number four. Document everything. Keep detailed records of all breakdowns and repairs, advises attorney Nathan Probst. This can become evidence in court against manufacturers. Especially important to document refusals to sell parts, unjustified equipment blocking, inflated diagnostic prices, forced software, updates. Tip number five. Support independent manufacturers. Buy parts from companies fighting monopoly, some of them aftermarket A.G. universal parts. Farm tech solutions. Electronic components. Heritage parts. Restored parts. Every dollar spent with an independent manufacturer is a vote for freedom, says activist Tom Phillips. But what should farmers who already bought new equipment and can't abandon it do? Are there ways to protect against corporate tyranny? Good news. New manufacturers appear on the market, building their business on openness principles and right to repair. Monarch Tractor from California produces electric tractors with completely open architecture. Every buyer gets complete schematics, software code, and modification rights. We believe farmers should be masters of their equipment, says company CEO Praveen Penmetza. Our tractors can be repaired in any workshop. Monarch MKV costs $58,000. significantly less than comparable John Deere. At the same time, it has GPS, autopilot, and precision agriculture system. Selectrac produces compact electric tractors for small and medium farms. Their motto, Your tractor, Your rules. Selectrac features complete technical documentation in open access, self-repair capability without voiding warranty, modular construction, easy to change and update components, price 40% lower than traditional analogs. Kubota, Japanese company that always supported farmers' rights. They don't block equipment and sell parts to everyone. We understand trust is more important than short-term profits, says Kubota USA President Todd Mitsuoka. Companies even appear that modernize old tractors with new technologies. AgTech Innovations installs GPS and autopilot on classic machines. Modernization cost $15,000-$25,000 versus $200,000-plus for a new tractor. Electric Conversion Co. converts diesel tractors to electric. Result Environmentally clean machine with full repair rights. But most interesting are startups developing fundamentally new approaches to agricultural equipment. Farmwise creates autonomous weeding robots. Instead of one big tractor, a farmer can buy several small robots. If one breaks, others continue working. Bear Flag Robotics, bought by John Deere but still maintains independence, makes kits for converting regular tractors to autonomous. The future belongs to modularity and openness, says analyst Sarah Mendez from McKinsey. John Deere's monolithic systems are yesterday. And what will happen when these new companies capture a significant market share? Will this force giants to change their policies? Maybe you think, this is all very interesting, but I'm not a farmer. What can I do? Actually, every American can help in this fight. For consumers, buy products from independent farms. Look at farmers markets, cooperatives, online. Every dollar spent with an independent farmer is an investment in the future. Support brands that support right to repair. Apple, Microsoft, Patagonia officially support this movement, show that this matters to consumers. Spread information. Many people simply don't know about this problem. Share this video. Tell friends and family. For voters, write to your congressman. A simple letter can have huge impact. Tell politicians that right to repair is important to you. Vote. In local elections, state elections, federal elections, support candidates who advocate for consumer rights, join organizations, Repair.org, Farm Action, Food, and Water Watch. These organizations fight for your rights. For investors, invest in alternatives. Buy shares of Kubota, SelectTrack, other companies that respect property rights. Pressure John Deere. If you have company shares, vote against management at shareholder meetings. Demand policy changes. For technical specialists, develop open solutions. Create programs that help farmers bypass restrictions. Teach farmers. Your knowledge can save someone's farm. And now I ask you to take concrete actions.

Share this video with everyone who might be interested, especially with farmers, politicians, activists. Write in the comments what you think about this problem. Have you encountered similar in your field? Are you ready to support the fight? The fight for right to repair isn't only an American problem, and other countries show that victory is possible. The European Union passed the world's strictest right to repair rules. Since 2024, all equipment manufacturers must provide parts for 10 years after sale, ensure access to documentation, not block equipment for non-original parts, penalties for violations up to 4% of global company revenue. For John Deere, this could mean a fine up to $1.5 billion. India went even further. They passed a technological sovereignty law banning any software blocking of agricultural equipment. Our food cannot depend on foreign corporations, declared India's Minister of Agriculture. Australia created a state program supporting independent workshops. The government subsidizes mechanic training and diagnostic equipment purchases. Canada is considering a bill that would make software blocking of equipment a criminal offense. If you bought something, you have the right to fix it, says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Even in China, despite the authoritarian regime, farmers have more equipment repair rights than in America. Chinese companies don't block equipment and freely sell parts. And what does this mean for American companies? If the whole world moves toward repair freedom, can John Deere maintain its monopoly only in the U.S.? Let's look at what will happen if farmers win this fight. University of California research shows potential economic benefits from right to repair. For farmers, 35 to 50% reduction in repair costs. 60% reduction in downtime. 23% increase in profitability. For consumers, 8-15% reduction in food prices. Quality improvement, fewer pesticides through more precise equipment. Greater choice, restored competition between farms. For the economy, creation of 85,000 new jobs in repair sector, $12 billion GDP growth, 34% reduction in food imports. For the environment, 45% reduction in electronic waste. 28% reduction in CO2 emissions. Preservation of 150,000 acres of land. Fewer large agri-complexes. Right to repair isn't just justice, it's economic necessity, says economist Dr. Michael Porter from Harvard. But most important is restoration of American values, independence, self-reliance, property rights. And are corporations ready to surrender without a fight? What will be their response to growing pressure? John Deere and other corporations aren't going to surrender. They're developing a new strategy that could nullify all farmers' achievements. Tactic number one, safety first. Companies fund research that proves the danger of self-repair. They talk about operator risks and environmental threats. Unqualified repair can lead to explosion, fire, death, declares a John Deere representative. Actually, in 50 years of self-tractor repair, there hasn't been a single serious incident due to unqualified repair. Tactic number two, technological race. New tractors have even more smart systems that can't be bypassed. Every part has a unique digital signature verified by satellite. Future tractors will be so integrated that individual parts simply won't work without authorization, warns engineer Tom Anderson. Tactic number three, legal pressure. Companies sue farmers, mechanics, even YouTubers who show how to fix equipment. Louis Rossman received a summons from John Deere for a video about hydraulic system repair. The company demands $2 million compensation for trade secret violation. Tactic number four, buying competitors. John Deere actively buys alternative manufacturers. In the past year, they bought Bear Flag Robotics and tried to buy Monarch Tractor. They're destroying competition at the root, says antitrust expert Lena Kahn. But will this strategy work? Can corporations stop a popular movement gaining strength across the country? Friends, we've reached the end of our investigation. Over these 50 minutes, you've heard 12 real farmer stories, learned shocking facts about corporate greed, and seen that the fight is just beginning. This isn't just a dispute about tractors. This is a battle for America's soul. On one side, corporations wanting to turn independent farmers into tenants of their own land. Who dream of a future where all food is controlled by a few giants? On the other side, American farmers fighting for the right to repair their own equipment, for the right to be masters on their own land, for the right to pass to their children not just land, but freedom. Remember Frank Johnson's story? Who lost his farm because of one broken tractor? The Anderson family story, whose 80-year tradition ended because of corporate greed? But also, remember Doc Harrison's story, who at 65 became a hacker for freedom? Minnesota's story, which first said no to corporate tyranny. This is your choice. You can support corporations with your silence, or you can join the fight for American values. You can watch independent farms disappear one by one, or you can act, like if you're on the farmer's side. Share this video if you believe truth must prevail. Subscribe to the channel if you want to continue learning the truth about what's happening in America. And remember, every great change begins with one person saying, Enough. Maybe that person will be you. America has always been a country where a person could fix anything they bought with their money, from Model T Ford to Apple II computers. This is part of our DNA. Let's not allow corporations to take this right away from us. The fight continues, and we will win.
