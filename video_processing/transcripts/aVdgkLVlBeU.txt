 My high yielders cows. Yeah, yeah. What you are seeing here? Yeah, first start with the comfort. Start with the comfort. You can see how comfortable my cow is living. You can see. I'm using very simple mattress. The cheapest of all mattresses you can ever have, which is sawdust, even sun. I saw it in Europe, they are even using the sun. You can see. Yeah, very, very tocile cows because of the comfort I'm giving them. And the features I'm giving them. They don't have any problem. They like me and I like them. This one is a new way to answer if you can't go five years down the line. To go now, we have a church. To answer to breed, to linda, to chunga hawa, to go now and make them grow up. We have a child in the middle of this level. We have a child in the middle of this level, so I have a child in the middle of this level. I have a child in the middle of this level. When we started this work here around five years to six years down the line, we have a child in the middle of this level. Our cows were what we call push cows. We are just ordinary cows like any other person, so any other mkulima cows in the south, but we impact on thorough breeding. Using good semen, good from good bulls, particularly from imported. That is how we have managed to produce very nice havers, very nice cows. We are now producing good milk. We were very lucky. You know, most of the time, out of these 19 animals, we used what you call genomics. Those sires, which produces almost over 80% havers. So that's how we arrived at this. So every year, out of the 19 cows, they would double. They went to 38, second year, they doubled up. They went to almost 70 something. And then just like that, so that's why we have been able to build this number within a very short time. So we are using genomics and sex semen mostly. So that most of the time we are getting havers. And this is how we, this heart has built up up to that level now. This one is three years old. She has carved once and she's giving me, she has been giving me 26 liters a day. So I'm expecting her to rise, to increase the production when she goes to the second cavern. She is also bred from very good bulls, imported bulls. All these are from AI. So, and I always communicate with them. You can see, I've got the conactera. They always tell me their problem. And I attend them. Only two breeds have got a Frisian, which is black and white. I've got the Asher, which is red and white. So those are my two main breeds I have. But it's obvious that Frisians produce a lot of milk when you feed them properly. Also followed by Asher, they also produce quite substantial amount of milk. And they are very, very hard during tri-season. During tri-season, you find Frisians produce a little bit less. And Asher produce a little bit more. Or they are equal. So we prefer the same. And they are good animals to handle. Sizeable to handle animals to handle. And they are good eaters. So whatever we produce, we think is enables us to sustain those animals there. We have so much specialized ourselves. We don't feed our animals simply because we want to feed the stomach. That's not our case. Our case is that we feed our animals according to what those animals give us. So for the young stock, we consider feeds which makes our young stock grow. For those who are mature but dry, we also feed them feeds which enables them to maintain their bodies well. For the dry cow, for the milking cows, we also feed them according to their production. So we give feeds which we know in turn will give us milk. So we don't just feed just for the stock of feeding. We feed for both production and maintenance. Yes. And also in terms of economics. So we also consider the economics of producing milk. Okay. Okay. Maybe we can give them that. Okay. Maybe we can give them a second. Okay. Maybe we can do that. Okay. Okay. Maybe we can do that later. Yeah. Okay.
