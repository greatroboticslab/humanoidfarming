 When you drive by a field, you wonder what makes the crops grow so well. Is it the genetics of the plants that grow in those fields? Or the ground beneath? This is what agronomists think about too. An agronomist has an eye on the future and wants to tackle big issues, like innovative ways to create renewable energy, or to help feed our growing global population. Or how to grow the best possible crops while keeping sustainability in mind. If this sounds like you, consider exploring the possibilities in Purdue agronomy. Here, you'll learn from the researchers who are developing plant-based proteins, breeding disease-resistant and drought-tolerant plants, and discovering new ways to improve soil health. You'll analyze multiple data streams to maximize crop yields for feeding a growing population. You'll work in state-of-the-art facilities, from a phenotyping center, to an innovation lab, to a research farm right outside campus. And the hands-on, in-field experience you'll get translates into real-world experience. If you want an internship, we'll help you find it too. Ready to help feed the world? See?
