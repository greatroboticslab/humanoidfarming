 Today we're going to be checking out the brand new driving apparel. Today we have Build-A-Truck event. Pickup trucks have arrived. Four new pickup trucks. Performance customization fixes. Limited resale. 2025 Zenvo Aurora Tour. But before we check this out, make sure to subscribe and drop a like on this video. But without further ado, let's get right into it. Okay, so the first thing I noticed in this update, they have the limited Zenvo back. So, available now. 2025 is Zenvo Aurora Tour. Limited car. 9,549 units left. On sale for six days. Okay, so how much would they charge you? I don't know. I can't see. Let's check in the dealership how much they're charging you for that. And I also want to see, ooh, new trucks. Okay, let's see if I got my predictions right. Whoa, event exclusive. Okay, we're going to have to see how that event works too. I'll give you all the locations if it's one of those events where there's locations involved. But let's go new vehicles. Whoa, okay, wait, wait, wait. We want to see limited first. Limited. This costs you 15 million. Oh, that's expensive. So, if you want to buy that, that's a lot of money. Oh, my goodness. 15 million. Quite a price. First car, though, in this update, the 2022 Nissan Frontier D41. 60,000. We're going to purchase it. We have next up the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado. What did I just say? Shelby? No, this is a Chevy. Chevy Silverado 1500 ZR2. Okay, pretty cool. We're going to check out how to get that in a minute. The 2017 Nissan Titan Warrior Concept. This is kind of tough. I like it, yo. Hold up. This is pretty cool. I like how they got the truck bed opening. I think it's pretty nice looking. 110,000. I like this truck. This one's my favorite so far. And the Ford F-150 Raptor R. Oh, this is aggressive. I want it in red. This is pretty cool looking. I can't lie. How does green look? Blue. I'm going with red. 150 grand. Let's purchase the Raptor R. There we go. And now we have to figure out. Open the event. Let's see how we unlock this thing. Okay, so here's the event. Build a truck. Build a 2024 Shelby Silverado 1500 ZR2. Seven days to get this thing, man. We have to find the grill. Find the bumper. Find the wheels. We have to find the mirrors. We have to find the tailgate. We have to find almost everything. And I'm going to skip the ones. So these are the ones that you can't find. The hood. You can't find that. I'm sorry, man. You got to skip that. So we're just going to skip that. You have to like. You can easily either drive 150 miles or just skip it. Which is what I'll do. So we can quickly showcase it. Two multiplayer drawbridge sprint races or skip. I'll just be skipping this one. But you can easily do two drawbridge races for those. Okay. Finding the rest. The doors. Okay. Complete one multiplayer cross country. I could do that. It's pretty easy for you guys to do. I'm just skipping so I can quickly showcase. We have find the tailgate. Find the mirrors. Find the grill. Find the bumper. Complete 10 races of any race. So this one's a bit of a challenge. You guys can do that easily though. So that's four there. So four can be unlocked without finding them. The rest. Other six. We have to go find them all. So I guess we'll just hop into these new trucks. I'm going to kind of mess around with the trucks as we go. I want to try them out. Okay. So the first part. We leave the dealership. And I'm going to go searching right now. Let's see. Any parts. Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. What is that green glowy thing? That might mean it's a part. Hold up. We're looking for the green glowy things potentially. I think. Is that a part? Yo, we just found a part. Okay. Hold up. The mirrors right here. Boom. We got one out of the two of the mirrors. Okay. Where are we going next? So we're looking for green glowy things. Oh, I spot one. I spot one. I spy a green glowy thing with my eye over here. Hold up. We're going to drive this way next. And over here, we take a right. Okay. And down this street should be your next green glowy thingy with one of the parts. Oh, yeah. Right here. It looks like we found mirror number two. Okay. Amazing. So right there, we got another part down. Perfect. Okay. We can claim them. Amazing. Let's go find. I don't know what we're finding next, but we're going to go find something next. Okay. I've left the other area and we're currently searching through Chinatown real quick. Any glowy things? Oh, glowy thing. Let's go. We found the wheels. One of the four wheels. Okay. And we're going to leave Chinatown now. I think I searched all of it and I want to go down. Maybe we can search the hotel next. Let me see if there's anything there. All right. I've swapped trucks. We're now in this Nissan thing and it's a pretty cool truck. Not going to lie. I think I might like this more than the Ford Raptor. It's kind of more cool looking. Now, I didn't see anything down there, but there could be a part on the roof. So let's drive up the top. Hold up. Is that a green glowy thing? I think I see one out of the corner of my eye. Okay. We're going to have to nicely maneuver through here. There we go. Come on. Oh my goodness. Did we just seriously get stuck? Okay. Here we go. I promise you all green glowy thing up here. Okay, man. I'm not going to lie. These trucks kind of suck at getting me around. So what if we just hop in a better car real quick? What cars should I take around? I'm feeling Koenigsegg today. Koenigsegg. Every day is a great day to drive a Koenigsegg. So why not? Let's hop on in. This is much better of an experience while going to look for my parts. There we go. We got another wheel. Amazing. Let's hop down. I'm going to follow the trail here. Maybe if I go down and that way we'll find more glowy things. Okay. I didn't see any that way, but out of the corner of my eye, I did spot another glowy thing. Okay. Hold up. Right here. Um, where is it? What? I thought it was up here. Okay. I guess the glowy thing is below the pier. Oh yeah. Here we go. We got a door. We got our first door. Absolutely amazing. One of the four doors. Let's go now and see where the next part's going to be. Okay. I kind of checked most of the city area and I don't know if there's anything else, but I want to check this highway zone. Anything over here? Oh, well, how convenient is that? Okay. I was about to go check the edges of the highways, but instead we found a door right here. Our second door. Okay. Very convenient. The helicopter or UFO method. If you've got a UFO or a helicopter, maybe try using that to search or like go around and collect these. It's way faster. I'm going to keep using it to search. No way. I just flew up from where we were and I spotted another one back over here on this land. I guess I didn't check over here. Um, we kind of avoided this area. We like went down the road over there and went over to the pier area, but I found another wheel right here. Amazing. Okay. I'm using the helicopter UFO thing to fly around and I've just found another part here. So spawn is down there, right? Okay. Spawn is over where my mouse is right now. You can see the building. You go up the mountain here and then right over here on the top near this. Um, I don't know what this contraption is, but near it, we found, um, a grill. Okay. Amazing. We got our grill. Let's claim it. And I'm going to keep flying around with this thing. It seems to be the method and I'm finding stuff pretty good with it. Okay. Now I'm leaving that area. You can see our trail where we came from. I'm flying out over the circuit race right now. I don't know if there will be any out here on the circuit race, but it's worth checking. And maybe we could check the lighthouse over here. There should be a lighthouse area and there could be a part at it. Let's see. And is there a part? Um, I feel like will we see the glowy thing yet? Oh, there it is. I see a glowy thing. Okay. There actually is a part here. They always hide something here. I feel like in all these events. So there we go. We got the third door. Okay. Okay. I'm flying this way now because I realized when we were flying over to the highway and I said I was going to check it, we found the part back there by the drag race, but I never actually fully checked the highway. So we're going to go through quickly. Check it. Good thing I did this, bro. Look at this. We found one part here. Okay. Now, usually they like to hide parts. Sometimes I like the ends of the highways. I'm not flying all the way to the other end unless I really can't find apart. It'll probably be there, but I'll fly to this end just in case and we'll check. All right. I'm at this end of the highway. I didn't see anything. So I'm turning around. Wait a minute. What was that out of the corner of my eye? Yup. I felt like there would be something here. What do we get? We got a tailgate. Okay. We have two things to claim here. We got the doors now done. Tailgate now done. We just need the bumper and the final wheel. Let's go find them. Okay. I realized that we didn't actually check this half of the city. We only checked like the half over there. So I think we're going to fly around just to be safe. Um, is there anything over here? I don't know. I don't see anything along the edge. Um, I did though. I think I caught something. Yup. Yup. Here we go. I saw that on the corner of my screen. We got a wheel there. Um, I don't know though. Is there anything else in the city? We might want to check for that last part. Okay. We got the wheels. There we go. And now where is that bumper at, man? We got to go find it. Maybe the bumper's like on this area of land over here. We're going to go check onto this area of land. Um, I don't know. It could also be at the NASCAR race, which is back that way, but I never checked over here. So while we're in the area, I think I'm going to check here real quick. Let's see any parts. Um, maybe like in this weird, oh my goodness. I was about to say in this weird windy area. Yup. Found it. This should be our final part here. The bumper. And just like that, I have got you all the built car. There we go. We got it. 10 out of 10. We got our truck. Ooh, let's see the grand reveal. Oh, that's a good shot. That looks, that looks real. Oh my goodness. Wow. This is stunning, yo. Check this Chevy out. I like it, man. I like the color. I like the blue. We probably will keep it or maybe make it a little bit of a different shade of blue. I'm not sure, but I do like blue. Um, this is a pretty cool truck, man. But I do think that's going to be everything for today's video. I truly hope you guys enjoyed. If you did, make sure to drop a like. I would truly appreciate it.
