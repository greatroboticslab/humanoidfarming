 Hello, I'm Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Steve Senske, and I want to personally invite you to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 95th 2019 Agriculture Outlook Forum. This is the largest USDA gathering. Our theme this year is growing locally and selling globally. Here at USDA, we want to help U.S. agriculture and rural America thrive. The Forum is a unique opportunity to get folks together to talk about key issues and recent developments in agriculture. We'll have lots of sessions covering markets and trade, commodity outlook, agriculture policy, rural development, conservation, and advances in technology. The Forum offers us a chance to get together with you, the farmers, ranchers, and foresters, and also processors, policymakers, and customers, so we can discuss issues important to you. There'll be a keynote speaker, a distinguished plenary panel, and 30 sessions with more than 80 speakers and a host of agriculture exhibits. So please join me at the Crystal Gateway Marriott Hotel in Arlington, Virginia on Thursday and Friday, February 21st and 22nd of 2019. We hope to see you there.
