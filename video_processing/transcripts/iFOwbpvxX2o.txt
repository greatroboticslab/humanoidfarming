Howto & Style
 Limited use of mechanization is the root cause of low yield and high cost of production in the agricultural sector in Africa. So if you're investing in agriculture in Africa like myself, I would recommend purchasing small farming equipment to be able to improve productivity and increase your profit margins. So a little background as to why I decided to purchase our farm equipment from China. When I was disappointed by the local hatcheries either because they would take our money and not supply us or they would take our money and supply us bad day old chicks, I decided to set up my own hatchery at the farm. We shop around from resellers from local resellers that actually purchased in China and sell back home in Cameroon. We searched around to be able to find a look an incubator. The best deal that we came across was a 3,000 capacity incubator that they were selling for $12,000. That was about 6 million francs CFA local currency. That was $12,000 for a 3,000 capacity incubator. And that was just the setter, not even the hatcher. When I saw that, I was like, no way, there's no way I am paying $12,000 for a 3,000 capacity incubator. I thought to myself and I said, there have to be a better alternative. And I want to tell you that better alternative today, it's Alibaba. And just a quick disclaimer, I don't work for Alibaba, neither do I get paid, but in any shape or form by Alibaba. So this video is literally based out of our experience purchasing small farm equipment and how easy it was for us to purchase these equipment using Alibaba. This is one of those videos that was requested by our subscribers. In this video, I'm going to show you how to purchase your own farm equipment from China using Alibaba. Alibaba.com. See you on the other side. This incubator will cost you at least $12,000 in the local market in Cameroon, but we bought it for $3,000 including shipping from China. This generator will cost you at least $20,000 in the local market in Cameroon. But we bought it from China, including shipping for $5,000. So how did we do it? Let me show you. Before I actually jump on Alibaba and show you everything, I want us to talk a little bit about the resellers. If you're building a business, you're investing in agriculture in Africa, where you want to be able to expand, I would say skip the resellers. The reason why, they buy at cheap rates in China, and they sell at exorbitant prices back home in Africa. So I would say skip the resellers and buy directly if you want to expand. But if you do not have the resources to be able to buy from China, then you can buy locally. But it's going to cost you more in the long run buying from resellers. I'm able to give you all this advice because I don't just buy all these equipment just for us to use, but I'm also a reseller. We have stores all over. We have stores in Douala and we have a store in Boya. So we buy these equipments like drinkers, feeders, gas heaters, solar pumps, all those items that we buy at an extremely cheap rate in China. And then we sell them at, again, as a reseller, the minimum we get is a 100% margin. If you are interested in some of those price lists, I can always send them to you. Our price list, if you go to our website, otafarms.com, you'll be able to see most of those items. We sell them at a 100. Again, I'm saying the cheapest margin that we have is a 100%. And because we are sending these items from China as an agricultural container, the government, the Cameroon government, since their agricultural product, waives 75% of the cost of custom, the custom cost in Cameroon. So there are two ways you can actually purchase your agricultural equipment. You can either request an RFP or you can contact the reseller directly. The first thing you want to do is jump on alibaba.com and then set up your account. If you don't already have an account, I recommend setting up your own account. As you can see, I already have an account set up for myself. Once you set up an account, you're going to see the, in my case, I have a profile on my picture uploaded, but if you don't, you probably see a user icon at the top right. So just hover over that particular user icon to be able to generate the RFP. So we're going to start with the RFP and then we're going to start with contacting the, requesting the quote directly from suppliers. So I'm going to click on RFP, which will now open the page for me to generate, to post a new RFP. From the RFP page, as you can see, I already have a couple of quotes from other suppliers that have entered in the system. I entered a quote a couple of months ago for a 200 capacity egg incubator. I entered one for the drinkers and feeders for an aquarium for a four by four all wheel drive diesel pickup truck. I've entered several quotes. Some of them have approved, some of them I haven't, I haven't approved them. But if you want to post your own quote, this page is probably going to be empty. If you're new to Alibaba, this page is going to be empty. And then you just click post an RFP. So what is an RFP in the first place? Let me explain that. RFP generally stands for request for proposal. It's a business term. It's a commonly used business term for request for proposal where you can actually detail what you want. And then Alibaba will help you disseminate that information to several other suppliers because Alibaba has thousands, thousands of suppliers on their platform. And they will send all that to their suppliers and say, okay, go ahead and send your quote. So, Kelvin is looking for this particular item, send your quote. And this is a quantity that Kelvin wants to request. So for you to generate yours, all you need to do is search for the product name, enter the quantity. So in this case, we are looking for a 1000 capacity incubator and we need five of them and use the AI tool. Alibaba comes with this particular AI tool that will actually help you automatically generate the description for you. As you can see already within seconds, it's generated a really good detailed description and you can go ahead and edit and just apply the description, add additional information, contact your technician. Again, it's very, very important before you place a request for proposal or before you purchase anything at all on Alibaba or you want to buy any equipment from China, make sure you contact the technician, your local technician, let them give you a specification, especially when it comes to the power. That is extremely important. You want to go ahead. Like for example, if you are dealing with a feed meal, you don't want to order a three-phase generator and then order a single-phase feed meal system. Okay. If you do that, yes, it's going to work, but it's going to cost you more money to be able to buy additional equipment locally to make that feed meal to work. So in order to remove any of those extra costs, contact, talk to your local suppliers, talk to the local technicians, let them give you more information pertaining to that particular equipment. They will know better than you because if you're somebody like myself, that is just an investor. I'm a software engineer by career. Yes, I've taken some courses in agronomy, but it doesn't make me an expert. There are people who agronomy is literally their field. So you want to talk to the expert, let them be able to give you as much information as possible. In Cameroon, it's very difficult if you go to some of these resellers and you want to get any information. Oh, they're not going to give you because they want you to buy from them. So what I do is I grease their pockets a little bit, give them 10, $20 and they will give me any information that I want. Talk to them. They will give you the information and then you can use that information, come here and create your own RFP. And once you generate your RFP, you can add additional information like pictures. It would be really nice if you can go Google some similar pictures of the items that you're looking for, add it to your RFP and then click on invite suppliers to quote. Once you generate your RFP, you're going to see all the RFPs inside your my RFPs. Quotations and proposals, they have some semantics and differences, but they are basically almost the same thing. So Alibaba actually presents the quote in a good like manner that will help you easily compare the different quotes. So in this particular case, I created an RFP for a 200 capacity incubator and I got several quotes from several suppliers. One Zhengzhu, Zheng... Okay, I'm not going to try to pronounce the name, so excuse me, I don't speak Mandarin. So you see, like there are quotes from several other suppliers in the system that they sent to me. And from there, I was able to contact them directly. And once you contact them directly, you guys finalize. I want to say this, this is probably the most important part of this video. Never pay off Alibaba. Alibaba. Pay all your items using Alibaba system. I promise you, do not send any payment directly. It doesn't mean that you're not going to get the product, but if you do not pay through Alibaba, even if you get the product, it will probably take a longer period of time for you to get it. Or in some cases, you will never even probably even get it. I'm telling you the truth. Never pay pay off site. Always use Alibaba.com to pay. Alibaba has what they call trade assurance. Trade assurance means that if you go ahead and pay your money, in the case, I don't know if it works everywhere else, but in the US, if I pay for an item using Alibaba, we have what they call trade assurance, which means if I don't get my product, I can report back Alibaba and they will give me back my money. I know it works everywhere else. I know for a fact it's going to probably works in in Europe or in Africa. I'm pretty sure it works because it's a trade assurance system that they built into their system and you will be able to get a refund for your money if you pay through Alibaba and your product was never delivered. So always use the trade assurance and pay directly from Alibaba. That is very important. As I said before, you can also search for your product and contact your suppliers directly. So basically you go to alibaba.com from the homepage, you search for your product. I'm going to search 1000 capacity incubator. And then it's going to show me this set of all the incubators that I have in the system, right? That they have in the system. You search, you browse and again, talk to you there, your technician, talk to the technician, talk to local suppliers, even give them something, let them give you information on the type of requirements that will work in your country. Because again, it's going to be different from one country to another. Talk to the local technician, talk to the suppliers, talk to the resellers, let them give you as much information. Then you can use that information to come and search. You want to spend a lot of time searching for the right product. I will never recommend you just starting an order and going and paying for it. No, I will never recommend you starting with your order. Contact the supplier first, talk to them, send them information, ask as much information as possible. I did that. I'm going to probably show you some messages that I did for the fish farm. Because we are actually starting a Balflock fish farming system. And we are talking to a couple of suppliers and we have actually narrowed down to a specific supplier that is going to supply us all the items for our fish farm. Give them as much information, let them give you the, let them share the details and let them also capture that. And you want to make sure that every single thing is captured because again, if anything comes and it's not as recommended, you can always go back and report that supplier to Alibaba. And Alibaba will refund you your money using the trade assurance. So once you've searched for your product and you've narrowed it down and you've narrowed it down to the correct supplier and everything is good, what the supplier will do is they will actually send you a quote for you to pay. And once you go ahead and pay for that quote, now the supplier will start or let's say the vendor, right, they will now start manufacturing your product because most of the time all this item, this is what is amazing about this supply vendors in China. They literally do not have this sitting in the warehouse somewhere. When you place your order, that is when they go and assemble it because they already have the parts. All you do is they assemble it for you based on your specification. So you have to understand how it works. Once you give them the information, they will tell you it's going to take two weeks or three weeks or a month for you to be able to get your product forwarded to your forwarder. We're going to talk about shipping shortly. But once you place your order, they will tell you, okay, it's going to take this amount of time for them to actually send it because they have to go now and assemble it based on those specifications that you've actually talked to your technician and they have given you the specification. And then you've used that specification to either create an RFP or either request a quote directly or contacted a supplier or a vendor directly using Alibaba. Now I'm going to show you some of the items that I've actually already placed in the system. So some of the items for our fish farm, again, we are expanding we're expanding to new fish farm. I have already narrowed down to this particular supplier called Shandong Wallis Biotechnology Corporation in China and they now sent me a quote for me to go ahead and pay. I am actually purchasing five fish tanks and these are the specifications for each fish tank. And one of them is going to cost me $334 US dollars each of those tanks. It's going to cost me $334 US dollars. And the total $1670. Once I pay this, I pay this, this particular amount, they're now going to send it to my forwarder. Now my forwarder will be able to fold it to me in Cameroon. However, in my own case, I am sending it to another supplier. That's because I'm sending a whole 40 food container that does not only include this, but it also include other items for the layer poultry farm. I've used them before. They've shipped different containers to me. As you can see, I've actually been able to send multiple containers to Africa using this particular supplier. So this supplier, they're going to feel they're going to occupy about 28 qubit meters space inside my container and four extra will be used for my fish farm. Which is these items that will be coming in from a different state in China. Now let's talk about shipping. If you look at my account, I have several orders in the system. Some of them are waiting for me to make payment and some of them have already completed the orders. Like this one is for our new fish farm and this one is for the store. These are basically just equipments for our store like drinkers, feeders and stuff like that. I think this is a total of about $1,700, which are just items for the store. And again, we make it, we make at least the very least 100% margin on all these things that we sell at our store. So we have this particular fish tank. It's a display fish tank that will put the fish and the customers will be able to pick their fish for grilling. And then we have another order for body cages and all of that. We are still working on all that once it got confirmed. This one is the one that I talked about before. And in Cameroon, it costs $12,000 for a 3000 capacity incubator. I bought a 10,000 capacity incubator for $1,900. You can see the difference in pricing for $1,900. The folder charged me $4,160 for, for the shipping. But if I did not, if I wanted to put this in my own container, it would have been a lot more cheaper, which is a lot more cheaper, which is what I did in the next incubators, because I have two additional. So I have a total of 30,000 capacity hatchery because I have, I purchased two additional incubators and put it in my own container and ship from China. Now let's talk about shipping. I think I've touched a little bit on it, but there are two ways. There are basically two ways that you can ship items through Alibaba. You can either use your own folder. And again, if you do not know a folder, you don't, you don't have any information about a local folder. I know a folder that ships almost every single port in Africa. I guarantee you, if I send you this information and you find out, you say you are in South Africa, you are in Kenya, you're in Nigeria, you are, I guarantee you, he ships to any of those countries. He ships to almost every single port in Africa. So if you want his information, just comment in this particular video and I'll ping you and send you his information. So there are two ways that you can actually handle shipping. You can send a 20 foot container, which is what I strongly, strongly recommend. If you have the money to be able to send a 20 foot or a 40 foot container, go with that option. The reason I'm saying, and 40 foot even better, because you, it's going to be like almost double the space at almost the same price, literally. So if you have the money to send a container, go that route. But if you do not, just drop us a comment and I'll send you the link or the WhatsApp information for that particular folder. And I guarantee you this folder actually send information. It's a folder that we've used. They charge between 500 to 600 us dollars to be able to send for each particular cubic meter. Again, a 20 foot container is 32.6 cubic meters. So which means if you go ahead and send it using your own container, do you know how much you'll be saving to send a 24 container from China? It costs me $2,100. But if you use a folder, it's $20,000, $20,000. The difference is $2,100 or $20,000 to be able to send a 20 foot container using a folder. But if you just have just a small item that you just want to go ahead and send, go ahead and use the folder. So if the item is small and doesn't weigh that much, use air fry. But if the item is large and weigh a lot, use sea fry. So sea fry is generally recommended and it will take about an average of about 60 days for you to get the item using sea fry. So I will generally recommend using your own folder or if you have the money, use, send your own container. I was able, I've been able to send containers from China to Cameroon without me even going to Cameroon, without me going to China or to Cameroon. Just from my computer, go ahead, enter the information, pay for it online and everything gets ships directly to Cameroon. And the advantage about shipping to Cameroon, and I'm pretty sure other African countries have the same advantages because if you are shipping agricultural product, the custom duty is 75% off in Cameroon. They will take off 75%. You just need to go to the ministry. If you are in Cameroon and you own an agricultural company, and again, and if you've been paying your taxes, because if you do not pay your taxes, you go to the ministry, they have what they call non-indebtedness. You need to present that to the ministry. So when you have the non-indebtedness or in French, you're calling non-delevance, you take that particular document and go to the ministry and they will be able to give you a document that you can go to the poor and clear your goods at 75% off the original. So if 20 foot container that normally will cost about five, six million, we clear for about 1.5 to 2 million in Cameroon. If you look at how much it cost me to send the container, which is 2,100 and to clear it, which is approximately $3,000. That's $5,100 as opposed to $20,000. If I had to use a forwarder to send the same quantity of goods from China. So do not listen to all those folks that will tell you, do not place your order on Alibaba, Alibaba is a scam. No, I will tell you that every, don't be afraid. Every single thing on Alibaba, not every single thing, of course, they have scammers in Alibaba. Don't get me wrong. That's why you want to spend a lot of time. Don't just see something, okay, for example, they will go put a truck. You see somebody will put a 2020 Toyota truck on Alibaba that is $500. Of course, you know, in 2020, it will not cost you $500. So do not fall into none of those. Alibaba does have some of those scams. And those scams will never want you to pay on Alibaba. They will always want you to take you to an off site where you can go pay and Alibaba will never be able to track your money. So make your payment on Alibaba. It's absolutely safe for you to make your purchases on Alibaba. Take your time. Make sure that it's a legitimate, it's, this is very important. Make sure that it's a legitimate supplier. The other supplier has been on Alibaba for at least five years. Look at the duration of time of doing trading on Alibaba. Make sure that they have been there for at least five years. Read some of their reviews on Alibaba because all of these suppliers, they all have reviews. If somebody has purchased from them and had a very bad experience, they will go right on Alibaba and you can, those reviews will absolutely help you. I'm not saying that just focus on your decision based on those reviews because, you know, we all know that online reviews can sometimes be misleading. Some, somebody can take, you can buy a perfume and because the perfume is very, very strong and the person go right, this is the worst perfume they've ever seen. But that particular, just the fact that that particular perfume is very strong is the reason why some other person might be interested in it. So do not base all your attention on just the online reviews. I will tell you, it's absolutely safe for you to actually purchase equipment. I am, I have a second container that is leaving Alibaba for the, for the layer poultry farm, for my bow flock fish farm that is going to Cameroon and every single thing is done online. This is going to be the second container from, uh, from, from China, specifically from Hebei, China, Dali to Cameroon. And I'm not going to even step in China and I'm not even going to step foot in Cameroon. If you have any questions, just leave them in the comments below. And we always respond to all the comments on this channel. We always respond to all your comments and we'll make sure that if you have a question, we'll definitely go ahead and respond to your, uh, to your comments. If you, again, you're interested in the forwarder, the, any forwarder information that, that will forward the goods that I'll lead to you, ping us in the comments and we'll send the information. We'll send the WhatsApp information and you ping them and just go on Alibaba, search for it. And the forwarder will give you the address. You take that address, send it to your supplier. Your supplier will ship the goods to your folder and then your folder will forward it to you in your home country. And the advantage of using the folder is you don't have to worry about custom duty because they will go clear the goods and then come and deliver to you in front of your door. That's what we did for our very first incubator. We never paid, we paid the whole shipping fee, included custom duty. They cleared the good and delivered the good directly to us. That is the advantage of using the folder. If you don't want to go through all the, the, the, the, the headache of clearing goods and services, especially in Cameroon, Cameroon is very, it's really, really tough for you to actually clear your goods and services in Cameroon because everything is just manual. They've tried as much as possible to actually, um, automate the system, but it's almost every single thing is there, there is manual. The people themselves don't even want it automated because they know how they make their money when it's, when it's a manual process. So if you don't want to go through the headache of actually clearing the goods from the custom by yourself, you can just use a default order. Ping us in the comments. I will, I will send you the folder information.
