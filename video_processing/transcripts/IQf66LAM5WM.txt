 What do people in rural areas of Africa do day in day out since they are not employed in a formal office where they have to go to every day? Today come along with me as I take you through my typical day in a living so that at the end of this episode you will be able to either answer that question for yourself like what do people in rural areas do all day? We'll be able to get into the discussion the larger discussion on for example if people in rural areas don't work hard but if they work hard especially on productive activities then why do we still see in development records that most of the poor people in the world are found in rural areas and especially in rural areas of Africa so come along with me as I take you through my typical day in a village. Normally when I was in the village my day could start between 5 30 and 6 a.m in the morning not because I set an alarm to wake myself up at that time but because once people within the house started their morning activities then sometimes that would wake me up if they were preparing for the person who knew the cows because that used to be the first activity and with that of course you you might hear and wake up and if I did not wake up before six o'clock then there was the cock crow the usual cock crow at 6 a.m I could not um I had to wake up because you hear not only our cock crowing but um other cocks from the rest of the village and if you pay some attention to that you would be like oh did they call one another because one will just finish another one will be like where with that I ended up getting up at that time prepare myself and start my day breakfast was served this early so that people can start their day after they've eaten and mom is on a menu which has specific times when she's supposed to eat we prepared two sets of breakfasts that's breakfast for mom and then breakfast for the rest of the house and after breakfast the program started we needed to do cleaning which involves sweeping the house mopping the house cleaning the breakfast dishes sweeping the front yard and also the other person in charge of livestock will be releasing them to go and start now their day of feeding and also to feed them like if it's the cows then the person needed to go and get and harvest mopeia grass or brachalia grass and bring to them and this mostly happens during the dry season otherwise if it's during the rainy season it means there'll be enough grass for the livestock to be released to go and feed need to open for the chickens feed the chicks if they're there feed the rabbits and also if there's a goat release them also to go out for feeding and also open for the dog to be outside for a bit before it's locked back into its place and fed then clothes need to be washed and also spreading out food items to dry it's like almost on a daily basis if the weather is good then there will be something being taken out for example if we need to take maize to the grinding mill then the maize needs to be aired dried outside like for three or four days before we can make flour out of it if it's millet then we need to spread out the different ingredients the millet itself small millet sorghum cassava before they are mixed and prepared into flour so these items are spread out to dry and on days when we'll be eating something like a pumpkin as part of the meal then it needs to be chopped up in the morning and put outside to dry these activities would be would change or would be implemented in a different way depending on the season for example if it's a planting season then people might not put as much effort on household tasks because they will need to focus on on gardening as well so for example if we were in the month of january that's a during the land preparation time january and part of february which means that at this time people within the household don't have much to do out in the garden because higher the hired labor would go and do the work and they don't need a lot of supervision when they are digging and preparing the land but then towards the end of february all the way to april because the long range start in march during the planting season we don't just give the seeds to the workers and ask them to go and plant no somebody from the household has to go with them i did a lot of that because you need to go and show them what will be planted where and also even demonstrate to some of them how they are doing it for example if you're intercropping maize with beans because people do that in different ways so if you tell them to just go and plant maize and beans they are those who might grow like one maize seed and one bean seed in the same hole that's one way of doing it they are those who might do one hole they drop maize the next hole they drop beans that's another way of doing it and they are those who might do one line they drop maize seeds and then the next line or row they will drop and they will plant bean seeds so it really depends on your household how you prefer to do it so you have to be there to show them and to guide them on which system that you use and the same applies when it comes to planting vegetables are you planning to just plant them traditionally where people scatter the seed or do you plan to plant them on lines or on beds the way i did it i had to go and show them how i preferred the beds or vegetables to be prepared and which vegetable needed to be planted near which one because i did a lot of intercropping companion cropping as one way of managing pests so that would be a typical day during the planting season and the same applies during a weeding season in that sometimes somebody from the household needs to go and see how the workers are doing it and also guide them on where to start because there are crops which need weeding immediately when the weeds are clear and there are food crops that can endure for some time especially if you don't have enough labor to do that another critical season is the harvesting season yes because we need a lot of labor we need a lot of people especially if it's harvesting vegetables because sometimes some of the vegetables if you leave them to stay on the farm for too long then they kind of mature and people don't like to eat that or even harvesting a simple crop like maize that's a corn because like in my rural home we are in the kenyan highlands and if you don't harvest at the right time then the next rain will come and if it rains on a maize which is already dry it means that you're going to need the labor now to be drying the maize more outside and you cannot even dry it outside because it's the rainy season the other reason that harvesting season is a busy time is that as you harvest for example like us we were not growing crops for sale it's just for household consumption but the definition of our household is not just the people who are within the home it's a our relatives in town our relatives in faraway cities so we have to think about them during the harvesting season it's a critical time when you now evoke a lot of social relations because you remember them you harvest you are calling them hey do you need this we've harvested a maize or green maize is ready do you need how much do you need and then we have to harvest we have to find a way to ship it to them this is one practice which i noticed in the village and i kept on asking myself like is this why or how rural areas become poor in that we put in a lot of energy in the production but then once we harvest we harvest we are like calling everybody to come and participate in the celebration actually at some stage i asked that question and somebody answered it by telling me oh and those guys are not giving us the food for free because and when they have uh financial needs like a medical issue they need school fees they are going to call us and we are going to send the money so with that i started learning about interdependencies between rural and urban areas the other activity that we did during the harvesting season was to prepare seeds for the next planting season we are learning to be independent again when it comes to sourcing seeds so during the harvesting season that's when somebody has to be keen and this this somebody means a family member go out to the field as they are harvesting or once they bring the harvested crop to the homestead if it's mace you have to go there and pick the best and put it aside so that you can prepare it and sow it for the next planting season not really the immediate next because seed has to be stored for at least one year before you can replant it if it's seeds from vegetables then during the harvesting season you need to guide the workers on which area they should not harvest so that that particular vegetable goes into seed because if you keep on harvesting for example leaves from vegetables then that vegetable will continue producing more leaves but if you stop harvesting the leaves then it will move on to produce seeds so i had to be in the garden every time somebody went to harvest and tell them like leave this section because we would like it to grow into seed and also when it comes to seed preparation like from tomatoes i had to harvest the best looking tomatoes and take them home and take them through the actual seed preparation like cutting them up washing them drying them and once they are dry store and label them and also i forgot to mention about the weeding season because that's the time when crops uh that's when we find a lot of pests within the the garden but since our whole garden the whole family farm is an organic garden so we don't use any synthetic fertilizer which means that we needed to prepare natural pest management solutions i had to teach the workers and guide them on how to use a tithonia and other plants within the homestead to prepare liquid which then we went and spray sprayed on the on the vegetables of course while participating in the farming activities depending on how many people were left within the homestead remember they saw lunch to be prepared so there will be these impromptu visitors to be attended to because in the village when people arrive they need to be fed they need to be given food if they go away without eating anything or drinking something a nice sugary drink then they all they might go away and be like oh we were not welcomed when we went there so receiving visitors the food is part of work which needs to be done within the compound and who unto you even a death occurs in the village it means like all the work on the farm starts because that's a cultural practice you cannot go out if you are a blood relative and you live nearby then you cannot go to the to the farm be it planting season be it weeding season be it harvesting season and again nowadays it takes like between two to three or four weeks for somebody to be buried which means that all that time you will not tend to your crops and it happened to us at least twice during the planting season and during the weeding season so and this disruption also calls for your labor in that if visitors are coming to the compound you have to be available to entertain them i just mentioned the issue of preparing meals but they are very important important component within a rural setup because um if people are going to the farm to work like all day then they need to eat and they need to eat well which means that you have to schedule meal preparations into your daily activities but for us after at some point we realized that we were having so many workers within so what we decided to do was um give the workers lunch money because there are people near the shopping center who prepare meals for anybody who would like to buy affordable meals without going into a restaurant so we decided to take that option which saved us time from preparing lunch but once in a while after they harvest again it's another practice within many communities that and after people have harvested or after they planted you prepare a meal for them and also even people within the home of course we normally need to take a break take a snack at four o'clock and depending on the season this snack can mean lighting a charcoal stove to roast to the maize or lighting a three-stone fire to boil to cook sweet potatoes or to cook green maize or to boil groundnuts or just sitting picking fruits harvesting fruits from the farm and sitting there relaxing a bit to to eat so food is an important aspect It means that's intriguing to toompner that to thank the drink to drink three-pot Gleignam as such as tea wives and entertained for a식ữa school its as a dog and lights being utilized for three meals for Indian hunting Chef jarので helping each other three family player to eat so items they have to eat so many tastes will be useful in the scolding of envisรies so that I also noticed me and getting a lot and in general of course you haveASE K habita the poor soul yet's big jeff I found good so that when you have to leave a choice on C sal且�ati where I started at four o'clock you have to learn but I think to go ahead and certain people like responsibilities And 결국on some things firstH- where itsînや 17 H Picasso I'meil remember to be a lot of your life quick interest u-cat her works because she likes going to the farm to check on the work that was being done or had been done the previous day or during that day and that's when you get to learn a lot because she'll point out something like oh tomorrow when they come ask them to work in this area this way or she would tell you something like oh today they went to weed for sweet potatoes tomorrow ask them to weed for the maize because the maize has a stage where it needs to be weeded for before it can you know progress to the next stage like of flowering she'll explain to you that for sweet potatoes they can stand some weeds for a few weeks so they are not in a hurry to be weeded for or she might tell you that the grounders have dropped their flowers so now you can weed for them so it's a it's a learning process when you participate in some of these same activities and also for example during the weeding season mom liked to come to the farm to the vegetable garden and show us or show the workers how to weed how not only to weed by removing the weeds but also it's a time when you prune the vegetables not earlier than that so she would come in show us how to prune show us how to harvest the left leafy green vegetables so that that way they get more energy to put in more new leaves so during the different gardening activity it's a very important session for anybody who would like to learn i also saw this as i worked with the young men on the farm yes i mostly worked with the young men we decided as a family that um there were too many unemployed young men in the surrounding areas and we were like how do we make them more productive because some of them had finished on four that's their high school some had not finished and they were like oh we don't have school fees and some were waiting to join college so we were like okay we'll be engaging mostly these young people so that they can have a source of income and they can be productive while they are while they are waiting to move on to their next stage in life and during this time what i realized it is that i learned quite a lot from some of them and i got to teach the group quite a lot because i like going to the garden to stay with them again just to hear their stories you know when you are out in the farm working you get to know the families where they come from so when you stay when i stayed with these young people i got to learn quite a lot and others were like i did not perform quite well in school as i wanted so i'm looking for money to go and repeat others would be like i'm looking for money so i can take myself back to college and for others when i showed them how to prepare garden beds for vegetables some of them were like i've never seen this i've never done this we got to exchange a lot of knowledge a lot of information by just being out in the farm with with the workers and of course for the very very quick ones some of them surprised me you know sometimes when you're in the village you might think about um people not keen these people they don't come from our village they were coming from far away places but um i was surprised because they would ask me something like oh and how is um canada and you take me to canada and that time i get surprised like how did they even know where i sometimes live that i do in canada and there was one who came and asked for my books they were like i would like to go and read your books i almost fell down because i was like how do they even know i write books i think because nowadays young people are online so once they know your name those quick ones i think they go and google to know more about you and that's when i was like oh my goodness they've gone these guys i've been working with trying to behave like one of them if assuming they would imagine that maybe i've come from nairobi which is the capital city they know so much about me okay so that's part of um staying staying in the village and another thing that i was so glad that i i got to work with these young people and got to teach them about is um composting that's when i realized that um most people in the villages are not um composting even though they keep on complaining that synthetic fertilizer is very expensive or some of them say it burns their the soil in their gardens but i was surprised that not many of them know about composting so i got to teach the young men that i was working with so our days were days of learning learning for myself and also for the others to to learn but we did not spend all our time out in the farm there was um you know shopping meeting to be done if it was a market day because the local farmers market takes place every tuesday and every friday so that means that uh part of uh the people work within the household one of us needed to go to the market to go and buy what we don't have on the farm the other task that we did we did within the homestead was to germinate the different types of beans before we prepare them so we did a lot of germination watching them rinsing and once they germinated for the ones that we needed to grind into flour then we again took it through the process of drying it out in the sun but not directly in the sun so that also takes time and also the grinding of the the different um foods that we used to add when we are cooking and of course there were other tasks which include as i mentioned at the beginning feeding livestock but also livestock and also their sleeping area cleaned like you know for the cows every morning the cow dung has to be swept out taken to the pit because that's what we added as part of the manure when we are preparing compost so my typical day in the village and various or varied depending on what season of the year it was it was the land preparation planting weeding harvesting preparing the harvest for storage they come to the end of this episode but this is just the beginning of more episodes to come where i'll be sharing more detailed information about the different aspects of village life which i have mentioned especially when it comes to gardening in future episodes i'll be focusing on each of the items for example i mentioned that we prepared compost we used the natural pesticides we prepared garden beds so in future episodes i'll be focusing on each of those items as a separate activity and for you to stay informed to know every time when i post an episode it's by subscribing so subscribe below like this video so that that way the system learns to show you similar videos so it's a goodbye from me until next time bye bye
