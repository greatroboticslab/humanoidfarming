 I read an article a long time ago about that, about a ranch that switched from cow-calf to yearlings just because it was a little bit more versatile. Right. Like, if it was dry, you could just sell out and not have anything. If it was a good year, you could buy more and kind of get in and out. I mean, I've gotten stuck with cows and had to feed, and it quit raining. I mean, we've tried the cow-calf deal. It just, it's tough. Yeah. Unless you've got the ground, unless you've got the pastures to move them to if it does get dry. Mm-hmm. So. Do you, I mean, it sounds like from what you explained a while ago, you're running your ranching operation as a business. I think a lot of us get too emotional about that side of it and don't run it as a business.
