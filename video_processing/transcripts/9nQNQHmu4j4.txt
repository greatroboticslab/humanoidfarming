 Hi friends. Welcome to Music City Kids. My name is Tamara with Love in a Big World and I'm so glad you're here. Today we're celebrating harvest. Yep, that's right. It's fall. We've got changing leaves, cooler weather, shorter days, longer nights, pumpkins, scarecrows, all the fun things. And it's time to celebrate. So we've got lots of fun things and ideas for you to do with us on the show as well as with your families at home. So get ready for lots of fun. Hey y'all, it's me Skylar. I'm so excited to be back with you guys at Music City Kids. So Halloween is just around the corner and it's one of my favorite holidays. So can you guess what we're doing today? If you guessed pumpkin carving, you're correct. Let's have some fun. With your grown-ups help to help you get started, they're going to cut around the area where the stem is to get you started. Then you lift it up. Whoa, look at all those seeds. And then you take your scooper, you get out all the seeds and pumpkin stuff. Okay, now that you got all your pumpkins cleaned up, it's time for the fun part. Carving them! So I'm going to start with this little baby pumpkin. And how I'm going to carve this one is I'm just going to poke little holes around the top. So I'm going to take the top off, put it on the side so I can put little holes around it. And you'll see the finished product at the end. So you're going to take your hammer. Make sure you have adult supervision just in case. Oops! Sometimes the pumpkin can get away from it. Here's another fun and easy way to carve a pumpkin. You're going to take these little Halloween sticks and you're just going to stick them in little holes. We've already made our pumpkin. And voila, we have a cute little Halloween pumpkin. Now we're on to the last, but certainly not least, the biggest pumpkin we have today. So, first thing you're going to want to do is sketch out your design. You can use any pencil, permanent marker, pen, anything you can see your design with. Do you know why they carve pumpkins? Well, in the olden days, they would carve pumpkins to help ward off the evil spirits. And we've carried that tradition all the way on to today. Carving is one of my favorite traditions during Halloween, besides sugar trading, of course. So, I'm going to try to make a little more fun. Okay everyone, this is the finished product out of all the pumpkins. Which one's your favorite? Oh, I love that one. This one's my favorite. I just think it's so cool and fun. Have a great Halloween everyone. Stay safe and don't get too scared. I'm just kidding. Bye everyone! Welcome to Janet's Planet, where we're traveling at the speed of thought. And soon, it is going to be Halloween, where we will experience a blue moon. No, it won't actually be blue. All that means that it is the second full moon in a single month. And in honor of this great occasion, how about we make some galactic candied apples? Yes, indeed. All you gotta do is grab a bag of Jolly Ranchers. And in honor of the blue moon, it's like we're going to make blue candied apples. And you might see a few sprigs of green in there. We might add it to make it a little bit alien and spooky. And the other thing that you're going to want to do is we found these little sparkles and stuff. So we may even try to star up and make our little galactic candied apples even more galactic. Now, I've already preheated my oven. So I'm going to put this in here, set it on bake 450 degrees. I'm going to slide that in there. And then we'll wait about five minutes and then we will dip our apples. Now, one of the things that you want to make sure and do is prepare your apples. So all you want to do is be sure and de-stem them. Just twist that out. You can take popsicle sticks just like this. And voila, we are ready to dip and make a galactic candied apple. Now, I also highly advise getting some parchment paper and putting it inside your pan just like so. Now, that will keep those candied apples from actually sticking to our pan. And we want them to be beautiful and galactic, I mean. So let's see what happens when we take this out of the oven and dip our apples. It's really bubbling. So make sure that you and your grown-up use oven mitts. You take a lot of caution. Turn the oven back off when you are not using it. So we're just going to, oh yeah. Now, we're going to see if we can make it super galactic. Do a little sprinkle action in there. All right. Now, all you're going to do is take your apple and begin. Oh, look there. Oh, I'm loving how this is looking. Oh, indeed. Super galactic fun. I'm just going to drizzle a little bit of this so we get all the way up to that popsicle stick that we put there. Oh, yeah. All right, guys. I mean, that's kind of like lovely enough as it is with all of the, oh, I think I see constellations in this galactic apple. So super great. Let your mind revolve around this thought. Celebrate the blue moon this Halloween with galactic candied apples. And that's the view from Janet's Planet. Welcome to Janet's Planet, where we're traveling at the speed of thought. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. Let's just run off those things. Some days you got it. But hey, oh, oh, oh, wait.

Shine on Shine on Everybody shine Shine on Shine on Everybody shine So one of the most favorite things that my kids and I like to do during the fall Besides decorating pumpkins Was reading special stories So here are some of our fall favorites Pumpkins Barn dance And waltz the scarecrows And you know one of the most special things about these kinds of stories Is that we can look forward to reading them together year after year after year And sharing them with other members of our family So go to the library Or check out online And read these books And then let me know what you think Hey Music City kids It's good to see you again I've got another really fun craft for us today Now today we are doing all things pumpkin And so that's another thing that you'll notice During the fall season You'll start seeing a lot of pumpkins And I don't know if you have But I hope you get to visit A pumpkin patch this year Even with the pandemic going on I think if you wear your mask And take all the safety precautions You can still go to the pumpkin patch And have a really good time And so maybe check with mom and dad And see if that's something that they'd like to do I think you guys would really enjoy it So today's art project Is going to be Pumpkin patch I know a lot of times My art projects have A little more structure and steps Because we're going for A certain kind of look But with this one I really want you to have fun And be expressive And make it your own Okay So let's get into it Okay Let's start off with A clean sheet of paper Or canvas Several different brushes A little cup of water there And your paints If you have watercolor paints That's perfect And any type of brush you have Will work Starting with our thumb We're going to load it With the orange paint And There's our first pumpkin Alright Just add as many pumpkins As you would like I'm doing several orange pumpkins And then I'm going to Try some different technique I'm adding some yellow paint And a little brown A little reddish brown color And If you've ever seen these pumpkins They're called gourds I guess a little different type of pumpkin But They tend to be like Yellows and browns Or sometimes green and browns So I thought I'd try to Throw a few of those in there Don't know if they Really grow in the pumpkin patch But we're putting them in mine I want you to be expressive Try some different things out Okay Make it your own I did a little yellow and green together So it looked like I have a little green stem On the top of this yellow gourd And did you know pumpkins And did you know pumpkins are connected They grow with a vine attached to it And they're connected by this vine So I'm going to add in the vine See there And connect them Now I want my Background to be a beautiful Fall colored sky So I'm going to start with some orange I watered it down really good To give me a thinner effect And I'm adding yellows and orange For a beautiful sunset And you know how the sunset Gradually takes over the sky And there's like a little bit of blue left I think I'm going to go back in And add some blue Kind of to give that effect Of like the blue sky Daytime sky is fading out And the sunset is setting in And then I just went in And filled in some different Other little vines And bushes or things in my garden In my pumpkin patch And there you have it Back to you Tamara Hey Tamara and friends Well today I decided to come out To Shelby Farms And out in particular I decided to come to the sunflower patch To take a look at the sunflowers And I'm surrounded by acres And acres of sunflowers And each of them are beautiful As they stand tall in the sun And when you pass by them on the road You might assume that all of the sunflowers Are exactly alike But when you get out of your car And you actually get up close And personal with the sunflowers You notice that no two sunflowers Are exactly alike That in fact each of the sunflowers Is uniquely its own sunflower And you know in fact That kind of reminds me a lot of us as well That no two of us are exactly alike That each one of us is unique And special in our own way And because we're unique And special in our own way That's worth celebrating See these sunflowers They don't try to compete with each other They are simply the sunflower That they were made to be And so they stand tall in the sun Whether they're standing shorter Or taller than another sunflower Or they happen to be larger Or smaller than another sunflower It doesn't matter Because each one of them Is beautiful in their own right And the same is true for us Each one of us is beautiful In our own right So we don't have to compete with anybody We can be uniquely who we are So the next time You hold a sunflower in your hand Remember that that sunflower is unique That there is no sunflower like it In all of the world And the same is true for you That there is nobody like you In the whole world And because there is no one like you In the whole world That's a wonderful thing So you can stand tall and proud Just like these sunflowers And be exactly who you are And when you do that You're helping to spread love In a big world And so until next time Stand tall like the sunflowers And be exactly who you are Take care Well, we've had a lot of fun with you today Celebrating the harvest Pumpkins, sunflowers, scarecrows And so much more Tune in next time for Music City Kids We'll see you later We are called Music . . . .
