Howto & Style
 When you want to learn to garden, the very best place to start is with your own herb garden. I'm going to show you how to make one. You're going to need a medium-sized pot with holes in it so that the water can drain. You'll need herbs that are already partially in growth, like this cilantro or rosemary. I also have basil. Don't get mint just yet. I'll tell you why in the next video. But also, we're going to need some garden soil and fertilizer from the store. And lastly, we'll need some kind of anti-weed paper or burlap or something to put at the bottom of the pot so that the soil doesn't come out when you water it. So, join me in the next video. I'm going to show you how to get started.
