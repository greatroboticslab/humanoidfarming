 Hey this is Billy the Permaculture Pimp Daddy from Permapastures Farm. Today we're going to go back to the basics. I've been getting a lot of requests from friends of mine who are looking to get into this exactly where to start and how it all works together because nothing I think explains permaculture better than showing you through video close-up personal examples of how this stuff all works together. Now if you could look behind me you'll see those bee boxes and you'll also see a tremendous amount of weed growth around them. Well this is the consummate definition of how permaculture is used. Today we're going to take this net which has those little sheepies in there and we're going to extend it. They've been working their way down the hill and today we're going to extend that net to where it goes around the bee boxes and then we're just going to go from there. We're going to show you what these sheep do which takes work out of our hands puts it in their hands but I'll explain in the end how it all comes together how it's like the fingers of a hand what makes permaculture so much more special than anything else out there. So with that said it's time to get hopping and popping. So Okay phase one is done and it was easy it just took a minute maybe so we got this sheep tractor as close as we can get and we make sure that we also do it very very early in the morning too before these guys get up and go to work. Remember bees act a lot like union workers so they got their little nine to five schedule. So now that this fence is up here we're going to get the sheepies all out we're going to let them do their thing and they're going to eat everything down. That's phase one in the care and maintenance of the bees and the bees and the chickens and all that stuff we'll explain it. It'll all come together in this video how it all works. For those of you out there that might be concerned well what do you do about the sheep if the bees attack them well they don't mess with them. It's like somehow they know that they're not me so they will largely leave them alone so that's not a concern. All right it's the next day the sheep have done their share they they didn't get everything and you don't want them to just absolutely clear cut anything. Remember they they eat a third they stop a third and we leave a third but in this case I'm going to go back just like I have in previous videos and knock it down with a weed eater. So these guys are all set the next grazing cell we're going to take their little house push it that way set the net up and then we're going to set the chickens over here and then they are going to do their fair share. So chickens get in here you know and the cool thing is is that the grass was so high chickens don't really like really high grass well the sheep have already knocked that down for the most part. So now the chickens are going to come through they I mean these days honestly we really don't even need to feed them. We put a little bit of feed out there they barely touch it because they're going they're finding more than what they need right here on the ground. But the cool thing about this and we'll probably leave those chickens in there maybe a day maybe two depending on how active they are. They're going to help these bees out by taking care of all the they're going to work on the beetles. They're going to um they're going to beat back the mites which are a byproduct of the beetles as I understand it and they're going to take care of any parasitic stuff that are around there. And the cool thing is is that the chickens unlike everything else they eat they will not eat these bees. Um we can in fact we've done experiments as to see if they would. So it's not a problem at all to get your chickens in there let them go to work. This is permaculture folks that's exactly how it works. Instead of you going out there doing all this work you work as a team just like I've explained before in the previous video like the fingers of your hand. Everything has its role. Now it's time for the chickens to get in there and fulfill theirs. So next this is she has a question. but she's Hahahaaa aKEe said hero so Thank you. Okay, in a nutshell, folks, this is the consummate definition of permaculture. Let's just kind of recap. Sheep went through, they did their thing. Now the chickens are going to go through, and we're probably going to leave them here instead of one day rotation. We'll probably leave them here two days, maybe even three, depending on their activity. And you can tell a lot by what they're going after and what they're doing. Folks, I keep getting questions from people I know who really want to get engaged in this, but they go up and look at a nebulous definition for permaculture, and nobody has one. That's one of the failings of permaculture is a definition that isn't simple and concise. This, to us, is the best way to explain to you exactly what it is. It's not you going out there doing everything. It's working in a partnership, a symbiosis, if you will, with all of the animals and the things around you. You're working with the topography. You're working with the animals that graze. You're working with the chickens. You're working with the bees. The bees are doing their role. The chickens are doing their role. And the sheep, there's nothing in a vacuum. Nothing is in and of itself. That is the beauty of it. I wouldn't even be involved in farming at all, folks, if it weren't this. If it meant me sitting on a tractor all day or just going out there, putting cows in the field and leaving it, there is no interest in that for me. What I find interesting is that I can go out here, have all these animals work with me, me working with them, get a harvest, and then improve the land all at the same time. I cannot think of a better, more beautiful system. And that's what permaculture offers. Now, this is just a small snapshot. But I'm hoping that for some of you out there that have been asking me questions about this, I hope this goes at least to further your understanding as to what permaculture is. It's not anything by itself. It's not anything in a vacuum. That is the beauty of it. So with that said, before these bees decide to light me up because they have a particular fondness for me, anyway, apparently these bees haven't gotten a memo on Black Lives Matter. So until next time, this is Billy, the Permaculture Pimp Daddy, where Pimp stands for Permaculture is my passion because it is. We'll see you next time.
