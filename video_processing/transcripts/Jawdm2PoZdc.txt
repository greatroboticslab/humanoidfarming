 In this video, we're going to cover 4 practice problems for the water distribution operator certification exam. Note that this video is for anyone pursuing the first two certification levels. At what depths is shoring required in a trench if it's excavated in soil? The correct answer is C, 5 feet or deeper. So what's shoring? It's the safety equipment that's shown in the photo with the yellow sheetings and the blue struts. Shoring is used to prevent soil movement in cavings and protect the employees in the trench. Whenever a trench is at least 5 feet deep and excavated in soil, a protective system such as shoring is required. Note that there are other protective systems that you can use besides shoring such as benching or sloping the soil or installing something called shielding which is used to protect employees in the trench. So to recap, shoring or another form of protective system is required if the trench is 5 feet or deeper. But note that this rule applies to trenching in soil. If a trench is excavated in stable rock, then shoring or another form of protective system is not required. But in most situations, you'll most likely trench in soil so you will need shoring or another form of protective system if the trench is at least 5 feet deep. On the operator's certification exam, if you encounter a question on shoring, most of the time they won't clarify if the trenching is in soil or stable rock. In those cases, assume that trenching is in soil. They're testing you on the 5 foot rule for trenching in soil. And the same applies for practice problems. If you're working on practice problems to study for the operator's certification exam, most of the time, the practice questions on shoring will not clarify if trenching is in soil or stable rock. Again, in these cases, assume that trenching is in soil because they're testing you on the 5 foot rule for trenching in soil. While we're on the topic of trench safety, let's go over a few more facts. If a trench is at least 4 feet deep, safe access and egress such as ladders, steps or ramps must be provided. So in this example, we have a ladder to meet that requirement. And every ladder in the trench must extend at least 3 feet above the top of the trench. An additional requirement is that safe egress such as a ladder must be located within 25 feet of all employees working inside the trench. So if this trench were 4 feet deep, then we would need some sort of safe access and egress. Such as a ladder. And the ladder must extend at least 3 feet from the top of the trench. And every employee inside the trench must be within 25 feet of a safe egress such as a ladder. Note that we don't have shoring in the trench because it's 4 feet deep. Remember, shoring or another form of protective system is only required if the trench is at least 5 feet deep and excavated in soil. So if this trench were at least 5 feet deep, then in addition to the ladder, which is located no more than 25 feet from the employee, we would need shoring or another form of protective system as long as it's excavated in soil. To learn more about trench safety, go to the textbook, Water Distribution System, Operation and Maintenance, and on pages 91 to 97, they cover it in more detail. Which is the following is a positive displacement meter? Correct answer is C. Nutating Disc Meter which is commonly used for residential services to monitor water usage. So how does a nutating disc meter work? When water fills the chamber, it causes the disc to nutate, which means to wobble. Every nutation corresponds to a fixed volume of water. So the total amount of water that passes through the meter can be determined by knowing the total number of nutations. Now let's look at a real nutating disc meter in action. Every time water enters the chamber, it causes the disc to nutate. That causes the spindle at the top of the sphere that's connected to the disc to also nutate. By correlating this movement to the volume of water, the meter is able to register the total amount of water that passes through the meter. To learn more about water meters, go to the textbook, Water Distribution System, Operation and Maintenance on pages 119 to 126, they cover it in more detail. What does the C factor for a pipe represent? The correct answer is D. Roughness of the pipe interior. I'll explain this in more detail. The photo on the left is a picture of a new PVC pipe which is a very smooth interior. A very smooth pipe interior corresponds to a high C factor such as 140 or even higher. In contrast, look at the photo on the right. It shows the inside of an older metallic pipe with tuberculation, which are the small mounds of corrosion products that you see inside the pipe. The hydrogen means rusting of metallic surfaces. This kind of pipe interior corresponds to a low C factor. So what's considered a low C factor? Generally a C factor of about 100 or less. So remember, the higher the C factor, the smoother the pipe. And the C factor tells you how rough or smooth the pipe interior is. To learn more about C factors, go to the textbook, Water Distribution System, Operation and Maintenance on page 68, they cover it in more detail. What is used to locate a chlorine gas leak? The correct answer is B. Ammonia solution. If you tie a rag on a stick and dip the rag in ammonia solution and place it near a suspected leak or spray ammonia solution vapor using a squeeze bottle near the suspected leak, the chlorine gas in the atmosphere will react with the ammonia solution vapor and create a white cloud. This will allow you to trace the location of the chlorine gas leak. Another fact about chlorine gas that you should know is that if a chlorine gas cylinder is leaking, rotate it so that the leak is facing upwards. This will minimize the rate of the leak. Also remember that chlorine gas is 2.5 times heavier than air. It's heavier than air. Chlorine gas is 2.5 times heavier than air. To learn more about disinfectants including chlorine gas, go to the textbook, Water Distribution System, Operation Maintenance on pages 282 to 331. They cover it in more detail. of water.
