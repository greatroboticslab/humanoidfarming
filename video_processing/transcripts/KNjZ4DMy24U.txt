 Have you ever wondered why almonds are so expensive? This is an almond tree. They just had me pick a bunch of the almonds because I'm almost six feet tall. How cool! This makes sense. You have to reach up, get the almonds, crack them open, and they don't just come straight from the grocery store, it turns out. So thanks for being here.
