Science & Technology
 Back in the day, farmers milked cows by hand into buckets while sitting or kneeling next to the cow. This age-old practice of harvesting milk was inefficient and labor-intensive. As the dairy industry grew, so did the size of dairy herds, making it difficult for farmers to keep up with demand. Various pressure and vacuum milking machines were invented in the mid-1800s, but most of them were unreliable, unsanitary, or even unsafe for the cows. In 1879, New Jersey dairy farmer Anna Baldwin patented an innovative hand-pumped machine called the Hygienic Glove Milker. A decade later, Maryland inventor William Mering created a foot-powered machine that could milk two cows at once. But the biggest breakthrough came in 1895 with the thistle-pulsating vacuum milker. Instead of constant suction, it pulsed in rhythm, reducing pressure on the udder. Soon, all milkers would use this feature. In 1922, Herbert McCornack invented the Surge Bucket Milker. It proved to be a safe, efficient machine used by thousands of farmers until pipeline systems began replacing it in the 1960s, carrying milk from multiple cows directly to a storage tank. After two centuries of innovation, milking machines continue to evolve. With the rise of robotic milkers, farmers can save time and labor while also collecting important data on the health of their cows. And it sure beats milking by hand. oil selon.政 viable It's going on to work. More questions! Does that take time for us as a migrant doctor oraggio into the assembly room? Nightingale
