Education
 Since the number of farms is decreasing and arable fields are becoming ever larger, the small structured landscape with its ecologically valuable marginal structures is being lost. To counteract this trend, Oliver Schmidt has developed the Moving Meadows system. As part of the EIP Agri-Project, he is currently testing the system on his parents' farm in southern Germany and developing it further. A special feature of the Moving Meadows system is that the biennial clovergrass is no longer cultivated as one big plot in the crop rotation area, but is integrated into the arable land as perennial meadow strips. As part of the i2Connect summer school, students learn about this innovation at first hand. In dialogue with Oliver Schmidt, they will gain concrete insights into the challenges and successes of developing and implementing innovative projects. The meadow strips are 18 meters wide. The rotation between arable meadow strips is 2 to 1. Only one grub is then grown on the arable strips. The meadow strips remain in the place for four years and then they are shifted. A navigation system on the tractor helps to precisely maintain the boundaries of the strips. The meadow strips are laid out across slopes as far as possible. This makes it easier to collect the water or eroded soil in the event of heavy rainfall. The meadow strips are sewn with a double row spacing of 25 centimeters. Oliver Schmidt also carries out a mowing transfer. To do this, he mows a neighboring, species-rich area of permanent grassland in summer and transfers its herbs and grass seeds to the already sown meadow strips. Due to the extreme spring drought in 2023, the meadow strips developed very slowly. However, with two cleaning cuts, a good plant cover was achieved by autumn. The meadow strips can be harvested as hay or silage. Strip cultivation also makes it possible to transfer the mown plants from the meadow strips to the adjacent arable strips at low cost. Different spreading techniques are currently being tested with the forage harvester. For example, the forage harvester can spread the chopped plant material directly onto the neighboring arable strips. Alternatively, the plant material is transferred to another machine, which then distributes it. Either a mug spreader or a litter spreader with a fan is used here. The moving meadow system is still in its early stages. For the students of the i2Connect summer school, this visit was extremely valuable. They were able to apply theories about innovation in agriculture in a very practical way. Thus, quite rare and expansive, and rarely do some other projects.
