 Right, morning everybody, welcome back. It's Saturday morning, it's grey, it's dismal and Bob's not here. He's conspicuous by his absence, he's actually on holiday. Myself, Rowley and the Duke were off to a farm sale today, so the goal is not to try and buy a bent gate that costs more than the price of a new one and buy other stuff like sheep netting and stuff that we don't really need that costs more than the new. So that's the goal, not to get auction fever and basically we're just going for a look around, see what's there. Big sale, about 10 mile away from here, so we're just setting off now, starts in about an hour. See you when we get there. Right, we're off. Duke's in front, Rowley's in the middle, arm of the bike, and there we've got Big Steve behind us as well. So we're all off to the farm sale today, see what we can find. There's a project here for somebody. Oh God, this is in the sale. Will it run again? Will it run again? All the bits here on a pallet for it. There we go in one of the big sheds, stuff everywhere, you've got to sift through it for a bargain. Pressure washers, buckets of oil and grease. The Duke's found two cabinet drawers with nails in. Fancy a cannonball. You're fancying a cannonball? Oh yeah. Which cannon did it come out from? How about a new saw? You've been looking at that, have you? Some spray guns. Some ladders. Lovely little ramshackle workshop here. How it's holding up, I do not know. Go and have a look up here in the garden. The garden of the house. More lots this way it says. This is where the lawnmowers are. Couple of ride-ons. Kitchen table. Mareeva here. Looks like one of her old things Morris' covered in cobwebs. When were the last time this ran? But it's in the sale. Somebody will buy it. What's this? What's this? A tureen for cooking in? It is, that's a chimney. Chimineer. Chimineer. With chimney. That's a hostess. Troughs. Freezer. Oh, what's he saying? What are you saying? Not them for gate posts. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're drain stones aren't they? Yeah. They're very lovely. Some old drain stones at it. Dairy look. Coping stones. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what they brought back off the cruise. Cushionlessly on. Cushionlessly on. Cushionlessly on. Cushionlessly on. Hey, how are you doing? Hey, how are you doing? Hey, how are you? Hey, how are you doing? Hey, are you alright? Yeah. That's it. I thought these were a fire pit. Yeah. Yeah. That's what they brought back off the cruise. Cushionlessly on. Cushionlessly on. Cushionlessly on. Hey you, how are you? Hey you, you alright? Hey you. Hey you. Hey you. Hey you. Hey you. Hey you. I thought this were a fire pit but it's a pig trough. His and hers. Clocks. They're urns. Not plant pots. Not birdbaths. They're urns. A pallet of wheel weights. Not quite sure what they fit but there's a full set there. For a six wheel tractor. What have we got under here? Some milk churns. Ram. Some stone troughs. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. New front door for you there look. There's a few bent gates here look in the hedge bottom. You never know. You never know. It's looking at that horse racing. So we're out in the er in the field now looking at all the lots. There's one sheet in it that is it? Far from us. Some hemboard is it? Some hemboard is it? Look at this here look at the deer. What is it an old horse rake? Yeah. It's a big bumper isn't it? So an horse would pull this would it? Yeah. Well they converted it to a tractor. And they converted it to a tractor. I can remember when we had a new one of these delivered. Brand new. Bloody hell. A new one? Yeah. Brand new one of these. Yeah. Just after the first world war? Yeah. It was quite a stitch quake. Five years after you scrapped it didn't it? No we scrapped it last year. Oh we did. Oh we just scrapped it. Oh we did. Oh we just scrapped it. Yeah I took a holly at the top and you got it into it. It looks like a machine of death doesn't it? Yeah you had hand jikes what you lifted you took with and you took that wheel off and put it on it and you took that wheel off and put it on the bike. For transporting it? Yeah then pulled it from the edge. Yeah, that's your excellent middle to track. That folds up onto the top. I remember doing it a thousand times. Yeah, you make it up into big rows because then they swept it up with the thing in the front of the tractor. They dropped it by the stationary bale and they formed it into the stationary bale. It was energetic work. Oh God. What year is this on? What year was it? When we were little lads, we used to be doing it. When you were little lads. We used to jump on it in today when we got it and sit on it and then they used to throw back. That one we scrapped all the time. Every single time we're in line. We're sitting in bed and in it. Would it still work then? Bitter oil this. No, no, I mean the one we scrapped. Oh right. We used to be a problem now. Yeah. Would it have been stood on the floor or in the bottom?
