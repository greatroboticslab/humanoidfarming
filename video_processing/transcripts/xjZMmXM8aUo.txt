 In sustainable agriculture, we also call it diversified integrated farming system because one of the main pillars of sustainable agriculture is increasing diversity, crop diversity. Over period of time, we have made only few varieties and monocropping the order of the day. But as a result, the problem of fertility and problem of pest happens. And also the yield slowly grows down because the soil fertility is affected. So small farmers, also middle farmers, but small farmers especially, should try to go back to traditional system but improve that according to scientific principles. When we apply the principle of diversity to home garden to make it nutritionally more rich, to make it sure that we get all the nutrients necessary for human body, healthy life. We look at the diversity principle in applied way. The diversity is partly by improving the crop mixing and if it is shown in line rather than mixing all seeds, it is called intercropping, line intercropping. Sometime it is called also companion cropping, meaning what kind of crop grows well with each other. The second principle is trying to look at crop rotation, which crop follows which crop follows which crop. And sometimes we try to reduce, we try to not plough and make the soil lose the residual moisture. But when one crop is almost 80% finished, that is the time we introduce the second crop. So that it can continue and sometime use the support of the previous crop to grow. So these three principles of intercropping, mixed intercropping, crop rotation and crop relay, they lead to crop diversity. For example, in a small home garden, if we apply the principle of the mixing or intercropping. Suppose I have a five feet wide bed here, I will in the first line put about three tomatoes or brinjal, and in the second two in the middle and then again three, again two. In this way we plant some of the larger plants like brinjal or eggplant or tomato or chili, but it is an erect plant. So in between the areas, in between where there is three and there is two, so here there will be two beans and there there will be three beans. So each line will have five plants and that will complete the whole bed like that. So we mix a bean crop, maybe French bean and because it grows in the winter. So and we grow a rubby crop like post-monsoon crop like brinjal or tomato. And to cover up the soil, I plant maybe dhania, coriander. So it means coriander also will cover the soil and grow in the shade. And also it has a strong smell which deter many of the pests of the main crop. So by doing like this, we get more yield from the same field and also we do companion crop. So this is one example. As far as rotation is involved, the principle is that wherever we possible, we follow a leafy vegetable or a fruit vegetable, which demands more nutrient from the soil. We follow that with a bean. So for example, in a dry area like this, in summer if I grow amaranth, leaf amaranth because many kind of amaranth is available and it tolerates drought. So with some irrigation, I will grow amaranth. And in the rainy season, I will follow that for example with cluster wheat, goarth. And in the winter season, I can grow some spice like methi. Methi is a spice but also a legume. So it will help to maintain the year round produce something and maintain the soil fertility. This is the basic idea of rotation. If we take the example of relay and apply that principle to home garden. So for example, we grow in the summer, we are growing some erect crop, maybe lettuce finger. When lettuce finger is almost finished, around that time as a relay crop in between the lettuce finger, we put seeds of pole beans. So the pole bean is climbing on the lettuce finger plant. And when both of these are finished, most of the crop residue is harvested and fed to the animals. And same time, we grow maybe again tomato or chili in the field. So it is already we are leaving some of the things, mulch. And so in between, we just create space and plant the seedling. And we don't have to bother about the rest of the space. So these are examples of how we apply the principle of intercropping, of rotation and of propeless. So, if we go to a semi-irrigated small farm for market, which is different from home garden, because home garden, we choose the plant mainly according to nutritional quality rather than market price. So, if we go to a semi-irrigation, we choose the plant, which is different from home garden, which is different from home garden. But suppose I was, I had a 200 square meter or some land and with some irrigation possible, I am growing some vegetables for selling the market. So, either, so in summer season there may not be enough water to grow anything or we will see. So, in the rainy season, for example, we can grow Makkah, the maize or corn. And in post-monsoon season, we can, in the time itself, we can interprop the maize with some kind of bushweed. And later on, in the winter season, we can use any kind of climbing bin or we can use a small bitter gourd climbing to use the maize as a maize plant as a support. If it was a vegetable system that I was growing only vegetables for selling in the market. So, I can grow Kau Pi during summer, which is followed because Kau Pi tolerates the heat and little bit dryness. And then I followed it with a lady's finger. During the summer and late summer and rainy season, the lady's finger can remain in the field. And then in the winter season, post-monsoon season, I can grow brinjal or chili or tomato along with the kind of companion crop of coriander, as we were saying. So, in this way, year round, we can do. So, these are two ecosystems where we apply the principle of diversification. Third kind of ecosystem can be non-irrigated dry land ecosystem. So, where is it is only rain fed. So, in rain fed agriculture, it is not possible to plough after one crop is finished. There is not enough moisture and if we try to plough again in the early winter, we can lose much moisture. So, the mixed cropping, inter-cropping system that we follow is, for example, if we have one biga or whatever, three, four hundred square meter land, we plough it one time before the rain starts. And then itself, we grow four five lines of any grain, for example, sorghum, for example, maize, for example, pearl millet. So, we grow some tall plants, five lines, and then we take some legume, which is preferably little shorter than the tall plant. For example, we are using PGNP or can be gohar also. Then, so, three lines of gohar, and then we grow for three lines of any oilseed, for example, sesame or niger. So, these are oilseeds, which tolerate dry situation. So, we grow them. So, we have, according to height, we have big, then little small, then little small. So, we slowly come down, and then we have diagram or cow pea or some other kind of crop. And then we go opposite way. We have, again, the oilseed. So, we have grains. We have legume. We have oilseed. We have, again, some vegetable or legume. And then, again, we are growing up. So, one time we plant, we do the mirror image, opposite in the... And we try to see that the shade of the plant, tall plant, is not falling on the shorter plant. And this can be done by planting these crops along the east-west axis, sunrise-sunset axis. So, with these kind of systems, we try to mix crops, which have different root depth and different maturity period. So, we have plants like pigeon pea, which matures in six, seven months. We have grains, which mature in three, four months. We have cow pea, which mature in two, three months. So, same time, we plant only one time, but we harvest four or five times. This is the principle, which is followed in ranch-fed agriculture. In the low-line rice system, naturally, there is lot of diversity. Lot of weeds, which grow with rice, originally, traditionally. They are edible. So, there are more than 25, 30 kinds of weeds. We can choose among them, which one we want to keep and which one we... So, these are... because rice system, low-line paddy system, is a waterlogged system. One of the crops, which we can grow on the months, but spread in the rice, is kolmishak. That we call the kolmishak, or Hindi karamoha, or botanical name is ipomia aquatica. So, we can grow that, and in between the rice, it can spread on the water, from the buns. On the buns, depending on the situation, we can plant some other crop, like pigeon pea, or sometime other kind of grams, which we can grow on the buns, depending on how much is the risk of total inundation. So, we can do re-recropping with rice, that when rice is finished, we...one month before harvest, normally we allow the water to go out. So, around that time, the...when we drain the rice field, and allow it to ripen, allow the grains to ripen, one week after letting the water out, we can spread seeds of... For example, linseed, you see, some kind of dal, like kulti, some kind of oilseed, like mustard. We can spread those seeds without ploughing, and we allow them to grow. And later on, when we harvest, some of the plants we get trampled on, but it...it does not die, it helps them actually to grow. So, we don't plough again. We...this is possible in a rice field, where the...soil is good, and holds moisture, and with the...we call it often in technical language, residual moisture crop. So, whatever moisture is remaining on the field, if we can have deep-rooted plants growing on the rice field, they can use those moisture. So, in summer, usually, we grow only...just before rice, we grow a green manure crop, like maybe crotalaria, or like maybe saspernia aculata, or something like that. That grows only for one month, six weeks, and then we incorporate that in the soil to increase the organic matter content. And then we plant the rice, and on the bund, as we said, we can plant pigeon pea or some other kind of gram. And in between, we allow the karambah to grow. And the...after rice, as a red-ay crop, we grow some oil seeds and legumes. This is the...this is the...this was the traditional system, and this can be even done today, with a little bit proper spacing. Also, if there is a rice field on the perimeter, along the perimeter where we make buns, just in between buns and rice, we can create a fifty centimeter wide drain all along. And we can grow some kind of talos, which like that muddy kind of situation, which some varieties of talos can grow in dry land, and some other varieties of talos, which can grow in wet land. And the leaves, as well as sometimes the roots, they are edible. So, that also increase income and diversity in rice field. So, these are different examples of using the principle of diversity, crop diversity, by intercropping, by crop mixing, by crop rotation, and by crop relay.
