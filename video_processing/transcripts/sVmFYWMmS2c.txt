Science & Technology
 Look, in terms of farming, the Chinese are very dangerous because now they are earning thousands of dollars through ginger farming. First, they create these ditches, plant ginger pieces in them this way, and then cover them with soil using these tools. Afterwards, they water the field with the pipes mounted above it. When the ginger is ready for harvest, they unearth it and store it in brick-built underground caves. Then, when the price of ginger increases in the market, then these people sell it after pulling it out and earn a lot of money.
