 Farmers who grow crops make their living off the soil in their fields. It makes sense they'd want to eliminate or at least greatly reduce soil loss due to wind or rainfall. Modern equipment and management practices have made a significant difference. For example, the reduction in soil tillage has been beneficial. This is made possible with advancements in weed control techniques, as well as the development of heavier equipment to get the seed in the ground accurately while planting into last year's crop residue. Subsurface drainage tile has been used in western civilizations for more than 200 years. Using GPS signals to guide the latest machines has made tiling faster, more accurate, and more effective controlling the water table, leading to significant reductions in soil erosion. Add to that cover crops, terraces, and grass waterways and it's easy to see why soil erosion has been greatly reduced with modern farming practices.
