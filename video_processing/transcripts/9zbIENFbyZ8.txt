 It's time to join Montana's very own and your voice for agriculture, Talkin' Ag Lane Nordland for today's LaneCast. What is the outlook for the cattle market, herd retention, and of course beef demand? Those are some of the talking points at this year's Montana Stock Bird Association mid-year meeting. And talking about that is Mr. Matt McQuake. He's joining us here today, an analyst at Cattle Facts. And Matt, welcome to Butte America. We don't call it Butte, Montana. It's Butte, America. What are you feeling about the richest hill on earth here, the old copper town here? Oh, this is my first time here, so I'm excited to kind of look around a little bit and maybe sit in on that morning talk tomorrow and learn a little bit. Well, yeah, a lot of mining history, but a lot of beef consumed here back in the day, too, when it was a roaring mining town. But thanks for joining us here today. And obviously, cattle producers are very interested in what is that Magic 8-Ball moment? How long are these calf prices going to hold up? But, of course, demand is a big part of that, too. And as you spoke with attendees at this year's mid-year meeting, I want to start with demand. Sometimes we focus on the size of the cattle herd first. But I think the key thing in today's market has demand has stayed strong for consumers enjoying beef still. Absolutely. That's one of the things that we really need to emphasize or recognize, just the difference compared to previous years, previous cycles, is just how strong, how outstanding that consumer demand is or has been for beef. Obviously, the protein content, the quality, the high levels of upper choice and prime product that we're able to put out there has really been or turned into strong consumer demand for beef. They've rewarded the cattle producers with more dollars in the system. Last month, all fresh retail prices, so beef in the grocery store, came in at $8.50 per pound on the U.S. average. Record high levels. And these dollars at that grocery store then create margin in the system that is further divided up amongst beef producers. And so we really have a lot to be thankful for just in terms or from that consumer standpoint and how we're able to sustain these high prices. You know, we've received criticism from some of our viewers when we're talking about these outstanding prices, especially for calves going through the ring. And it's exciting to talk about higher prices when you're getting $2,100 for a fall delivery calf already contracted here in 2025. And people say, well, you're going to drive consumers away from that. But as you evaluate this data, is there a bubble? Is there a potential bubble where consumers may say this is too much? Or what are those indicators? And how do you track that? How do you evaluate that and make an educated guess? So we look at a lot of things. First off, it's just those levels of beef we're able to put on the plate for consumers and how much they're able to pay for this beef, even at these high levels or strong levels that we're able to produce. And then we compare that to chicken or pork and poultry. While we've seen sustained year-over-year growth in terms of beef prices, chicken's been relatively flat the last few years. Pork has seen a little bit of an increase, but much lower, smaller year-over-year inflation rates compared to beef. And so that's one way in which we can track that demand at the consumer level. Yeah. But again, consumers are still turning to it, so there's really no indicator at this point that they're going to put another protein in the bag. Yeah. We have seen larger demand for the ground beef product, and so that is reflective of some consumers being forced to maybe transition down within the beef complex, but they're much more willing to do that as opposed to switching down to some of the competing proteins. And so that's a very positive sign for the beef producer. Now, everyone always is paying attention to these cattle on feed reports and looking at placements, looking at the marketings, and looking at heifers. Yes. And what is the read right now? We just stepped out of a weather forecast that things are going to get dry here, especially in the northern plains. But what has been the trend leading up to pretty much June 2025, and how could maybe this more dry weather impact maybe some of that herd rebuilding or heifer retention we've seen in pockets of the U.S.? It's going to keep the rebuild slow, a much slower rebuild compared to the last cycle. We have finally started to see a little bit pockets of heifer retention across the United States, but nothing widespread, nothing aggressive. We're starting to see that at the cattle on feed level that you alluded to. We look at heifers as a percentage of farm feed numbers. They're starting to drop down a little bit in the most recent report, and so that's one of our first or preliminary indicators. We're also seeing a little bit of a contraction between that steer heifer spread at the calf level. So that's another sign we look for. And then we finally also kind of track the percentage of heifers that make up calf sales. We are still seeing pretty elevated levels there, down a little bit from the past two years, but still strong levels, indicating that heifers are moving around some still. That being said, we have seen some heifers that maybe this time last year were destined to go into the terminal supply, but then early this spring were pulled back to the farmer ranch with the intention of being bred. And, of course, if drought is a little, you know, if we have to, you know, make that big decision, whether we're having a good productive cow in the countryside or the unknown of a heifer, that's going to be interesting to look at maybe this fall, depending on how the drought goes. It'll be very important to confirm some of the things we've been seeing and looking for. This has been a very prolonged drought, and so we have had to cull drastically. But on the flip side, most of the producers across the country have realized kind of what that base stocking level they can get away with is. And they've been able to adapt a little bit more, maybe keep a few more heifers, take advantage of some of these lower-priced feedstuffs or commodities to supplement that range. But for the most part, producers across the country have kind of realized what that lowest level they can maintain at is. And even if it's still dry this year, we have the potential to kind of be a little aggressive in certain areas. Now, I'm going to say the naughty word, black swan. I don't want to say we've had a black swan event this week in terms of screwworm. We had more of like a black duck, you know, a happy duck event. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like a daffy duck event here because a false report coming out of an online publication in Missouri that, you know, false news about screwworm in the U.S. I mean, we watched those markets just come down and market participants. So I don't know if they were being defensive or they just took the opportunity to bring them down. But what was your take as an analyst watching that this week? Or maybe what were some of your teammates' reaction to that market dive due to truly false news? Yeah. So that was, it was very concerning there for about a half hour before we started to get confirmation that it was indeed an unconfirmed reporting. And we have to recognize that first with where we're at in terms of the markets. We've stretched these cattle prices to record levels. And from a momentum standpoint, cash, cattle prices, and then futures markets, we've stretched those momentum indicators. So we're overbought. The market's due for a correction. It was almost looking for an excuse. And it saw that false screwworm news and latched onto that. And we thought we were about to test the new limit lows down the very first day. Yeah. So it wound up being false flag. Markets rebounded some, but we're still lower on the day. But that does also, it gives us a bit of an insight into what will happen in the event that screwworm does cross into the United States here in the future. We will have to recognize that there will be a market reaction, probably lower in the short term following such an event occurring. The longer term, it's perhaps a little bit more bullish to the market as it increases that demand for those animals. And so there will be a lot of dynamics there. And we did get a little bit of insight into what could occur if and when we see that actually do occur in the United States. And it's just screwworm. I mean, I can't imagine FMD. And I don't want to either. Yeah, we do have to. Yeah, exactly. We have to recognize that there is not a human consumption concern associated with that. It's strictly on the management, health, transportation of those animals. And, you know, as we look at that, too, obviously the border is closed to live cattle imports and other livestock categories as well. We saw that in 2024 as well. And into 2025, then that was lifted. Now President Trump's USDA has put into effect that halt of cattle imports coming to the U.S. How has that impacted? Obviously, supplies coming into our feedlots. But also, how has that impacted the price, too, that folks are receiving here? Because, you know, there's a lot of folks watching this that say we shouldn't be bringing in cattle at all. There's other folks that say we need to keep the pipeline fed. What do the numbers tell when it comes to that conversation? Yeah, so we have to view it from both a price standpoint and then an overall system dynamics issue, starting with the price or just overall supply. Year to date, we've brought in 225,000 head of Mexican feeders. Traditionally, a large portion of those would go onto grass a little bit before entering into the feed yards. But because of the backlog and the delays, most of those crossing in earlier this year went straight into the feed yards at a heavier weight than what traditionally occurs. But that is a vital source for particularly the Texas feedlots or southern feedlots. And so, as we think about how that impacts place against supplies or that available slaughter mix later this year, it's going to really draw down on that in that November-December time period and then again into the next year. And so, that does create a concern as these feedlots have seen a few years of dwindling supplies. It's really forcing them to kind of look ahead a little bit to their potential to be able to maintain capacities and what that looks like. We do have to recognize that that does create risks if feedlots have to make the decision to shutter their or close their bunks. That does create a concern to the industry. From a price standpoint, though, that border closure has been very favorable to feeder and calf supplies. I mean, already supplies have been very tight. Stocker operators have been forcing to compete for limited supply of calves. Likewise, feedlot operators are having to pay more on a reduced supply. And what that's done is it's really enabled these prices to continue higher than what we might have originally predicted at the start of the year. And it's also impacted that seasonality of those prices a little bit, too, particularly on the calf side. Typically, calves run up through the first part of the year. And then it's usually kind of an April high or so before dropping down a little bit, leveling out through the summer. And this year, prices have continued up until last week or continued higher up until the last two weeks. And so that's a very clear indicator of that reduced supply and then fears around future demand or future inventories. From a feeder standpoint, it keeps us in a more range-bound market where we're currently at. Reduces potential for drop-off later in the year. And then as we think about how that impacts the overall cycle, that's going to enable us to maintain these higher prices perhaps a little bit longer than we might have originally expected. obviously that border issue is being evaluated on a month-by-month basis but we have no idea of nailing how long it remains closed and so we're going to have to continue to adjust our numbers on what that overall fed slaughter mix looks like late this year and all through next year. Now a lot of folks are thinking of that last cattle cycle and we saw those those prices come up in 2014 and then just how quickly producers could rebuild the US cattle herd because the conditions were right to do it and so it's folks are always I think a little bullish really bullish during times like this record low numbers in the countryside but as we compare that last cattle cycle to now and to look to 26 to 27 28 29 what what is the read on that right now as we compare the historical averages but also consider the weather factors and just this the state of the cattle herd right now too. So starting with the previous cycle that cycle low was in 2014 from a beef cow herd number but the few years before that 2011, 12, 13 we'd already been seeing increased retained heifer supplies or increased for retained heifer inventories to where when we hit that high price we were able to take off and run and regrow that herd very rapidly. We have yet to see a year-over-year increase in replacement heifer inventories in this cycle this go around and that's based on that January 1 cattle inventory report and so that's a big difference is that the supplies just aren't there the heifers just aren't there to have a fast-acting rebuild. A lot of that's just been due to the high prices and sharp memory of the last cattle cycle a lot of producers are just taking that money it's it's hard to say why would you want to keep a few more females when these calves are worth so much it's it's easy to make that decision well I'll just keep a few more next year this year I'm just gonna go ahead and take that cash and run but yeah it's going to be a much slower rebuild this time around and that's actually it's there'll be a challenge for the overall industry to navigate how we manage such smaller supplies but it's also very supportive to maintaining higher prices through a longer period of time. When we're looking at that time frame too that's everyone's asked how long is this gonna hold what are the current projections from cattle facts on where these prices can stay 19 to $2,100 for these fall calves excuse me fall calves if I can learn to talk here Matt. So we'll start with fed cattle just from that price standpoint like when we think about how that cattle cycle occurs and that shifts three out of the last four cattle cycles the high-end fed cattle prices occurred the same year as that low in beef cow numbers and then one time it was actually a year delayed and so we expect to see that again this year right now we're currently targeting 2025 as being the beef cow herd low in terms of beef cow inventory numbers and we think that fed prices will maintain a high level perhaps or quite possibly and likely higher into the next year into 2026 and so what that means is that feeders and calves have a longer tail and so they don't see their high until another year or two following that and so that's very supportive to maintaining these higher prices at least for another couple years as we have yet to see again very few heifers retained meaning that their their subsequent calf crop that's five low is going to be in 2026 or 2027 and so that's again very supportive to maintaining a longer tail at higher levels and even after that point again with the slower rebuild it means that we won't have as sharp of a roll or drop-off when we do finally reach that cycle high it's gonna be fun for the guy that has quite a few heifers on hand that he could maybe sell to the neighbors or run through the ring because he'll probably see the highest pricing's ever got for a bred heifer ever yeah when when the rebuilding does take place absolutely and with our current projections even at these high bred heifer prices it's still a pretty decent buy compared to the long-term average and so this year and next year it's is the best opportunity to take advantage of that before again we start to see a little bit less or reduced return on investment for those females well it is an exciting time but it's also a cautious time as we look at all these market fundamentals drought and of course just the size of that hurt in the countryside but I know you got a busy day there's folks for you to meet here at the mid-year meeting of the Montana stock growers well what's a message you have for the cattle producers that are listening or watching to this conversation about your role and what excites you in your role what makes your job fulfilling in serving cattle producers the best reward is talking to the getting to interact with the producers and help them make decisions that ensure the longevity of their operation for some it's helping create risk management strategies I mean you just mentioned these record high prices are fantastic but high prices also mean increased cash risk particularly in a volatile environment where we've got a lot of outside factors to pay attention to now more so than we've ever had to watch and so being able to kind of help producers manage that navigate that environment and implement strategies that again can help their operation continue not just this year but into the future it's really the most exciting part yeah being able to get on the phone with the producers in my region that I cover and helping them answer questions is the most fun part yeah well again I thank you for taking a few moments with us just to talk about this cattle market it is fun to watch and again there is so many unknowns right now too and there's a lot of risk out there as well there is but well again thank you so much Matt for joining us and for every everyone for joining us today and of course for more information on all the resources that cattle facts provides they can be in your inbox every single Friday with their recaps or if you like snail mail you can get those recaps in the mail as well and of course a great time to learn more about cattle facts projections is during the NCBA and cattle industry summer business meeting and of course the big announcements that take place during cattle con that's gonna be in Nashville in 2026 where the big cattle facts announcements always occur and again Matt join us here today and thanks for joining us for more of these conversations and I thank you for joining us here on line cast ag podcast humbly Nordland we'll catch you next time thank you for tuning into the lane cast with talking ag Lane Nordland for more online check out his Facebook page Lane Nordland ag broadcaster and northern communications calm
