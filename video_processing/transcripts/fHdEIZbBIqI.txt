 We're growing a lot of food in a very tight space and it's getting harder to walk around. A quick solution is pruning, especially when it comes to zucchinis. With limited space they are best grown vertically and by pruning the lower leaves you're not only saving space but you can also prevent disease like powdery mildew. Bush beans are great for container growing but sometimes the leaves and stems can overhang taking up a lot of room. By using stakes at the edge of the containers you can grow them upright clearing the pathway. If you have limited space and you want to grow all types of squash including binding squash one way to grow them is vertically. You can cut the lower leaves and this won't affect the plants at all. By cutting the bottom leaves you're improving airflow and allow the plants to focus its energy on producing more fruits. If you have a lot of space to work with you don't need to do this and just allow the plant to grow as is. But for us we have a limited amount of space to work with so pruning and growing vertically allows us to grow more food and less space. In the past we rarely practiced pruning but ever since we started doing it more often we've reduced the amount of disease and pest problems in our garden.
