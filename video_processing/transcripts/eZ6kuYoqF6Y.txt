 Clearly, we know there's a lot of evolving information around the tariffs and what's happening in the world. David, I would love it if you can kind of outline for us how these changes will impact all aspects of a farming operation. Dory, thank you and glad to help you with that question. So we work primarily with all encompassing aspects of a farm, be it a smaller operating farm up to large industrial sized farms. In terms of the impacts that we are starting to see and expect to see, we absolutely anticipate that the tariffs will impact the top line. Revenues are absolutely going to be impacted, particularly for farms that have significant amounts of exports. We don't know exactly what those metrics are yet, but given the percentages, we do anticipate that over the course of 25 and certainly probably into 26, the top line is going to be adjusted and likely there's going to be downward pressure on that. The other aspect that's absolutely going to be impacted is the expense lines. As an example, if a farmer has a bunch of industrial machinery that is part of a production line and they need to get parts or something related to that and they have to import that, there's going to be timing impacts, cost impacts, and we do expect that the expenses will go up. So this is a very fundamental basic one-on-one answer, but income is probably going to be impacted down and expenses are going to be impacted up, which creates sort of a crunch on your earnings, your margins, your working capital. I think my takeaway for your question or my primary answer to your question in the realm that we deal is we feel like the working capital aspect and lenders that are lending money into businesses as lines of credit are going to be challenged. Borrowers are going to have issues with needing to draw on those lines of working capital. Lenders perhaps may have will be extending out to the fullest amounts of those lines of credit, which is going to create strain. How fast that happens, I could not tell you, but we are already seeing some impact and do anticipate that this is not going to be easy sledding, if you will. You know, based on everything that you just shared with us, David, you know, Sue, does the US become a more domestically based business then in agriculture, if that's the case? I believe that in some arenas that will be the case. But overall, when you think about the US and its position in world agricultural products, the world simply cannot function without US ag products. For example, think of corn. We are the world's largest producer and exporter of corn around the world. And it is by a huge margin that we are the largest. There are a couple other regions that produce a fair amount. However, those regions are very limited. And what if one of those has some difficulties? It could be political, it could be economical, it could be logistics, it could be weather related, the world would have to come back to the US in order to get that supply. This year, we saw that happen in corn. We saw that there were issues in South America, using all of those examples I just gave, that limited their ability to export. And the US stepped in and picked those up. We normally in the US do not export a great deal of corn first quarter. Yet we had phenomenal exports of corn first quarter this year, in spite of the fact that it was more expensive to come to the US because other parts of the world couldn't fill those needs. Bottom line, tariffs will not stop them from coming to the US. If necessary, the world needs to eat. Andrea, what happens to supply and demand then in a tariff environment? And is there a strategy that companies can be employing to to use and get by in this time? Yeah, I think especially when you're talking about agriculture as an industry, tariffs are absolutely a huge impact. However, one of the things about agriculture that Sue referred to, tariffs are not the only thing that impacts supply and demand with ag products. Weather and climate, input costs for things like water, labor, disease and pest control, consumer preferences like what people want to eat and what's available. And then also policies, regulatory policies beyond tariffs, global conflicts, like when there's geopolitical events that happen, all of these things impact the supply that's available from any country globally that could be producing different agricultural products. And because of that, using the corn example is a great one, that it may mean that the only opportunity is to buy from a country that is experiencing very high tariffs. And the thing to remember when we're looking at tariffs, it is retaliatory, right? Each country is placing and deciding on what these tariffs are going to be, you know, to the United States is the same way outside. So it becomes a math exercise, right? What's available, when it's available, and at what price take it's available. One of the strategies that I like to talk about is tariff engineering and understanding what's available and doing that modeling exercise around how much you're going to spend if you get it from where. Some of the other things that need to be taken into account though is logistics. How fast can you get it? And quality is a huge part to consider here as well. If you're buying from other parts of the world, how quickly can you get it? Can the food last? How will it be shipped? How will it be stored? So in the end, understanding the entire value chain of agricultural products from raw material, seeds, fertilizer, etc. all the way through to end product, you know, whether it's a frozen strawberry or a pureed strawberry, those all have different tax and tariff import rates and export rates. So it's important to understand that entire value chain. And of course, we can help you to do that if you need to. Well, thank you all for your insights here. And we have a lot of other thought leadership around what's happening with the tariffs, both generally speaking, industry specific at jsheld.com slash insights. And of course, we will be following further developments. Ashland air will beothüpларбуco- rich air is definitely a bit of almamitir. So,
