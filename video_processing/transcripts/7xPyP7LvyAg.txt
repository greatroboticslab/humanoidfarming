 Hey guys welcome back to Stanton Farms. Hey I got a little thing I want to show you today. I got a piece of equipment it's actually my dad's but it's been around on the farm for many many years and it's a lot older than what it has been on this farm. But I want to take a look at it I want to show you what it is tell you a little bit about it what I know about it and what it's made for and what we used it for and then I want to go show you something I grew this year. It's been a long time since I grew any. Hadn't ever grew any myself. I helped dad grow it for years but I want to we want to look at it real quick. So here's what we got. This is a international I believe and it's a corn binder and I'm sure there's plenty of y'all out there that know what this is and this one is is old. It's not as old as some of them. It does have the rubber tires and it is PTO driven and he had one before this him and his brother had that had the steel wheels and was ground driven and used it for a long time and then we bought this one. Some of y'all tell me what you think. I don't know. If I had to guess I would say this machine's probably from late 40s early 50s is what I'm thinking. It could be newer than that I'm not sure but it's it's got some age on it for sure and it works. We hadn't used it in probably 10 years but it works. I'm sure I could get it working in time in just a few minutes but it's got a time mechanism and I hope it's light enough. Y'all can see because it's getting late in the evening but this right here is the time mechanism on it and yeah it it would bring the corn stalks up through here bring them into this spot right here and it would hold them in this area until it got uh enough weight against this that it pushed back and it tripped it actually this right here until it pushed back and it tripped it and then it would swing around this part would swing uh coming around uh it would tie tying mechanism right here just like a knotter on it just like a baler a little bit different but same uh principle and it would kick it out the back. It's supposed to have a conveyor here on the back of it when it would kick it out it would lay it down on this conveyor uh you could put so many bundles or shocks on this baler on this conveyor and then it's got a handle that runs up front that you would pull and tree up right here that would kick that conveyor in gear and it would shoot it out on the ground in the field and I have that conveyor uh but it's uh it needs the wood replaced on it it's it's in bad shape the wood is but it's a pretty cool old machine and it works and maybe sometime I'll get it out and cut a little corn with it uh to show y'all exactly how this works if you haven't never seen one but it's really interesting old technology and uh very uh very interesting but I told you I'd tell you what we used it for uh we didn't cut corn with it and uh my dad for probably 30 years or more uh made sorghum molasses and uh he would cut his cane with this and we would cut it uh bundle it pick it up uh and then we strip it by hand uh and then feed it through the mill so this is uh this is his corn binder that we cut cane with all right so this is another thing that we used uh in making sorghum uh and this is our this is our cane mill uh this is a number e it's a e that's the size of it uh it's got a stamp on it here on the top of it if you can make that out 1890 and I'm sure that's the patent year on it I don't know when this was made uh if you've ever been around any of these mills and seen them work you know that they came out with this on it on the shaft this piece is laying up here which we don't use on this one this one goes to another mill that we've got but you had a sweet pole that would bolt to this this would be on the shaft and of course your horse mule or whatever would turn it uh from the end of the sweet pole when I was 15 years old uh we put this together this is a rear end out of a ton truck uh converted to a pto these gears here uh had shaft of the mill turned down uh to uh to accept this gear on the top of it and this gear is the uh gear off a old international baler and this is the drive gear off the same baler and we just sit there and idle the tractor uh with the pto running and it does an excellent job and maybe we'll see that in action sometime but I wanted y'all to see these things now I want to show you what what it is that I grew so if you'll excuse the grass I didn't spray my garden this year and everything got too big to uh to work and the grass kind of took it over but uh here's what we grew uh I got one row of it it's not a lot but this is uh sugar drip cane uh it's a sorghum cane and it is uh an old variety uh I looked for a long time to find these seed I finally found them in a uh from a guy I'm wanting to thank in South Carolina uh it's Jim's Seeds uh on uh on the internet he's got a website Jim's ornamental seeds I think and uh he sells in bulk too but I just bought enough to plant what I planted and it's non-gmo and it should uh be open pollinated and should reproduce and I'm going to try to save my seed from this uh and plant some tomorrow dad would have to buy some ever so many years but this is the variety that he grew the most that's what worked out best for him and he'd always save his seed and we'd we would uh clean the seed and dry them and and uh we'd plant them the next year and they always done great and that's hopefully uh I planted a thousand seeds I don't know I may have 800 or so uh stalks here so hopefully those 800 plus uh heads will make enough seed to plant me about a half acre next year if you can see the head right here these are uh just putting on the seed they're a long way from being ready uh or uh mature uh I mean it's going to be here fairly quick but they're not there yet and the the head will take on kind of a reddish appearance the seed will be uh where you could squeeze them uh they they'll be a little hard but not real hard uh it's what we call doughy and uh they'll just mash a little bit but but they'll have some they'll be pretty firm and uh we'll take we'll cut the heads off this and we'll uh we'll uh save dry them clean them and save them plant them next year so I'm going to do this the way uh we used to uh starting out I'm not going to use the meal or anything this year and we've also got a I've also got a 10 foot stainless steel uh evaporator pan uh that he always cooked on uh I'm not going to use that either for this little bit this is not this probably won't make a half a pint but I am going to cook it I'm going to grind I'm going to run through the grinder and uh get the juice out of it and we'll probably just cook it on the stove I've seen people do that on YouTube and it turns out good I just want to see what it does uh but we'll strip this in the field with what we call a fodder knocker and what we always used was a tobacco stick sharpened down to a point on one side with some notches in it and you just take that and you just run it right down the stalk and it would just strip the leaves right off of it we've done that for a long time but he was making so much after a while that it wasn't practical to do it that way we would cut it with the cutter and then we would uh strip it by hand and he's even made it a few times without stripping it and it actually turned out well it's just you lose uh some of your juice you don't get as much juice out of it because the the uh potter will uh carry the juice out when it goes when it goes through the mill but uh this is sugar drip if any of y'all out there are familiar uh with sorghum or cane or anything and actually uh this got a little taller than I expected uh but I really fertilized this field good and it done really well and I'm really pleased with it it's got some really good stalks on it as you can see here I don't know if you can tell but if if you're familiar with sugar cane you know that that's some or sorghum cane you know that's a that's a pretty good stalk right there and that's what we're going to do so guys I sure thank you and I appreciate you being here like I said uh just wanted to show you a couple of things I'm really thinking about possibly uh like I said it raising some cane next year and making a little sorghum putting out about a half acre uh I got to get everything set up uh get the pan set furnace built pan set and all that and that's a lot of work but uh you know it's it won't take real long to do it but I'm thinking about possibly doing that just just for nostalgic purposes but uh that's my cane crop and uh pretty interesting it done real good and I'm really tickled with it but guys thanks for watching uh hope you enjoyed this video something a little bit different but uh I know there's a lot of people out there likes old equipment I like old equipment and I like using it so guys we'll uh catch up with you a little later I really appreciate the support uh thank you for continuing watching and we'll see you next time
