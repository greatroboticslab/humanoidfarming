 Welcome everyone, FarmerCop here. This is going to be a mod video on the agricultural inputs production by design modding. I believe design modding is what it is, but anyhow, we're going to jump into how to use this thing. Now, if you don't know how to use productions in general, we're going to quickly go over it in this video, so just be aware of that, but I would recommend knowing how to understand how to use production building, because they all work very similarly before we get into this video here. You can watch any of my introduction to productions videos on any different base game production, but without further ado, we're going to take a look at how to use this thing, what it does, and is it actually worth doing? We're going to take a look at that as well. First things first, you have inputs and outputs in terms of production. Right here, this is your inputs. This dump icon here, this is where you can dump your inputs into. If you want to access the production menu, you can hit right click here to access it there, or if I'm back here, I can enter here, or escape, excuse me, to open up the menu, and then go down to productions to be able to access that. And this is where our outputs are going to spawn right here, so if you have pallets, they're going to spawn right out there as long as you have it set to the appropriate mode. This is a building. If you go into here under production, and scroll all the way down to the very end, you have it right here. It's the productions inputs, or agricultural minerals productions mod right there. And as you can see, it takes soybeans, barley, herbicide, canola, wheat, and liquid fertilizer. There we go. Those are the six inputs, six inputs? Yeah, six inputs. Okay, there we go. And it makes mineral feed, bond silage, silage additive, and seeds, which we'll take a look at that. Now, what it's going to produce, pallets of 1,000 liters of mineral feed right there, pallets of 1,000 liters of seed right there. You can see these look different than what you'd see in the store. And then it has 60 liter containers of silage additive there. Now, this isn't something you would probably do to sell these products. You might do it to sell these products. But the main thing I want to take a look at here in terms of is this worth it later on, is we're going to see if it's actually worth it to use this factory to make the products, or is it just better for you to go in here and purchase them by buying them here or going in here and purchasing. Well, the other things we're looking at are mineral feed and then silage additive, which again, that is very expensive. So this might be really worthwhile. But we'll take a look at all that here. So it's all going to work out well in terms of that. But yeah, so in terms of this, how are you going to use it? Well, if we go into the production menu, you have to put in the inputs to get the outputs out. So the mineral feed recipe is going to have 15 liters of barley, 15 liters of canola, and you're going to get 25 liters of mineral feed out. This is going to show you all the incoming materials you have in the factory currently. I do have some in here right now. Now it does say to buy materials and I can buy materials there. That is an additional mod that you can install. If you want to be able to buy those, that is an additional mod. So don't think that your factory is able to do that just automatically. But anyhow, cycles per month is 720 here. So that means if you're playing, or what that means is this a cycle or this recipe cycle down here is going to happen 720 times per month. So if you're playing with one day months, this will happen every day. If you're playing two day months, this will happen every two days and so on and so forth. And this is how much it's going to cost you to run this factory per month. So again, if you're playing one day months, it's going to cost you that every day, two day months, it's going to cost you that every two days. So there's the idea there. And these are all actually have the same in terms of cycles and production costs, just different recipes. So again, mineral feed 15 liters of wheat and 15 liters of canola to get 25 liters of mineral feed bond silage, you get 10 liters of canola and 10 liters of soil to get 15 liters of bond silage additive seeds, 30 liters of barley, 15 liters liquid fertilizer, and 15 liters of liquid herbicide to get 50 liters of seed. So again, and then that's going to have all your input totals in here. And again, you're going to dump those right where I showed you right out here to be able to get those in. Now, the last thing I want to mention is in order to get these rolling, you have to activate them. So hit activate down there. So it'll actually start running or deactivate that now. And then over here, they're all set to storing automatically, you can change that to either selling or distributing. So if you set it to selling, it's going to automatically sell your product for you. And if you change this over to distributing, that's going to move it further along the production chain, if you have something else that needs it. So if you had a factory that required any of these, it would move that further along, it won't move it to your animal pens. So I know I'll get that question down below in the comments. And I won't move your seeds to your storage, at least that is my understanding, unless you have an actual production facility that is designed to store seeds. So we would have to have seeds as an input and an output to store seeds. But it'll move it further if there is a factory of some kind in here, that is going to take those as an option. So that's just something to note there. But they're on storing here. So if you had them set to distributing, they probably wouldn't have anywhere to go. So they just kind of sit in here until you decided to spawn pallets out. Now let's start taking a look at is this actually worth doing in terms of everything. And I can tell you that it is and it isn't. So we're going to go over that. I'm going to pop a chart up on your screen right now. So you're seeing that right now. So I'm using what's called the steam price cheat for pricing that is linked down below in the description. And then I'm using economic difficulty normal. So it's on economic difficulty normal. This focuses on whether you should buy the outputs or you should make them. I don't always do that because this isn't necessarily a factory you can use to make profitable items or move your crops further along in production. This is kind of to be able to replace those three items that you would need such as mineral feed, salad, additive and seeds. So let's take a look here. So mineral feed, the inputs cost you $25.38 per cycle. It's all per cycle. And the output is going to cost you $23.80. So what that means is if you took those items that you would normally if you took those items that you needed to make the mineral feed for one cycle and sold them at a good price, you get $25.38. So basically, it's saying should you put them into the factory or should you sell them separately? And in terms of the mineral feed, you can see the output 2380. What that's representing is how much it would cost you to buy the same amount of mineral feed that you're producing from those products. So you're kind of losing $1.58 per cycle here. So it's not really worth doing the mineral feed function here in terms of that. It's better if you sold off all those ingredients and then just bought pallets of mineral feed at the store instead of using this production facility. And then if we look down there, actually, and then we actually just let's just keep moving through the chart here. So silage additive, this is the big winner here. So $24.85 is how much you would sell your outputs or excuse me, sell your inputs for if you decided to sell them separately instead of putting them into this production chain. But in order to actually get the 15 liters that you'd get out of it, it would be $747. I know that sounds crazy, but I'll show you the math here in a second. So that means per cycle, you're technically making $722. So if I take that $722 and I multiply it by those 720 cycles in a month, you have the potential to make well a lot of money here. So if I do 720 times 722, we're looking at about $519,000 a month. So theoretically speaking, you could make a lot of money on the silage additive here. It's very, very, very, very good here. And then if we look down at seeds, you're again losing money on seeds. So definitely don't use this for seeds. And actually, to be honest, the seed one is actually not, is it quite as bad? I have the seed price wrong down there. I said $900 per thousand liters. You can do it for $800 per thousand liters. So actually, that's going to lower that output. So it's actually even worse than that. So it's even worse than that chart you're seeing up on your screen in terms of the seeds. But again, you can use all the stuff on here and plug in your own numbers if you want to do the math separately. But yeah, so yeah, if we take a look down there, if we look at the, so I have the prices used for barley, canola, soy, wheat, liquid fertilizer, and herbicide. If we go just below that, I have the prices I use for mineral feed, silage, additive, and seeds. Seeds is wrong. That was my bad. It's actually $800 per thousand liters. So that's my bad. But again, that actually makes it worse. Mineral feed is $952 per thousand liters because it's $1,000 for a 10,050 liter pallet. So that's how it divides out for a thousand liters. Silage additive is $2,990 for 60 liters. So if it's $2,990 for 60 liters, if you take that price there, so you take a thousand liters, so what we're trying to get divided by 60, that means that you need 16.66 of those pallets of 60 liters to equal a thousand liters, if that makes sense. So I'm then taking that 2,999 or 2,990 and multiplying it by 16.66. That's how we get the $49,000 per thousand liters. That's why that output up above is $747.50 for 15 liters. So because 15 liters is a quarter or a fourth of the in-game 60 liter pallet. So it's a fourth of that $2,990, if that makes sense there. Hopefully that's all adding up to you guys. If you do the math, I promise you it works. It all works out fine. Now if we look just below that, the very bottom here of the list, I have cost per thousand liters using the mod. So that's how much these products cost you per thousand liters if you use the mod. So mineral feed, instead of being $952 from the store, is now $1,015. And seeds, instead of being $900, or excuse me, $800 should be $800 again, from the store is $1,177. And then silage out of is only $1,656, as opposed to almost 50 grand. It is way cheaper to use this. So if you're going to use this mod to make silage out of it, it is absolutely worth it. But the other ones I would not recommend doing. But there you guys go. Hopefully this taught you how to use this mod. And if you're going to use it, it taught you if it's actually worth it or not.
