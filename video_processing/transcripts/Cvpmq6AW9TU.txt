 Hey everyone, it's Mike Les and I just returned home from a trip to Germany. I flew over into Munich. I had to go over there for some meetings for work. And in the evenings we were driving around the countryside and so forth looking at some of the farmland. And we were in a small town in southeast Germany come across this Fent tractor dealer that also sold Pottinger products. So pulled in, they were getting ready to close up. We talked to a few of the guys and I walked around with my video camera checking things out. We'll take a walk up through the dealer's lot here from the road. And that tandem axle trailer you see there, pretty popular. A lot of timber in this area, a lot of pine. So that's used for hauling it out of the woods or the field and up to the road to load on a semi. And here is a Fent round baler. So that's definitely not something you see in the USA. I am told this Fent round baler is made by Lely and just branded Fent for the European market. I don't know if that's true or not, but that's what I was told so I have to believe it. And just walk around a little bit more here. And there's another one of them trailers for hauling timber. And just along the fields and stuff here like this you'd see a lot of pine. And they were cutting it down and hauling it away. Hauling it into town and loading it on the railroad. And these Pottinger products, I see a lot of them in the USA or North America. Especially hay and forage and so forth. But back here, Pottinger moldboard plow. A rollover plow seems to be a pretty popular thing in Europe from what I could see. So here's a couple of them right here. This would be my fourth trip to Europe over the years. I've been to Germany three different times. Then had another trip to Italy. Of course, I've been over into Austria and some of the other surrounding countries. Switzerland and whatnot. But anyways, like I said, this dealership was just buried right in the middle of this small town. And I did not even get the town name. I went back onto Google Earth and tried to find it. And since I can't pronounce it very good, I'm not even going to try to mention it. But if somebody's watching this video from this area and knows where this is at, please go ahead and comment. So as we walk to the back of the lot, here is a Renault tractor. Which is definitely something I've only ever seen pictures of. But pretty neat to see one up in person. And then of course a one row Pottinger forage harvester for corn silage right there. Definitely seen some pictures of them, but never one up close and personal. Just my observation from what I could see on this trip. Fent was definitely the most popular tractor in Germany. Southeast Germany anyhow. And did see some Deutz's. Deutz was probably second. Did see a few Masse's. A few John Deere's. And one Lamborghini tractor, which I believe is a Deutz painted silver. I may be wrong, but I got a picture of that coming up here. Did see one Kloss tractor. Axion tractor. And so forth. But like I said, they were just getting started in the field here. And until the last day when we were heading back to the Munich airport, did not really see much field action. And I just got some random pictures coming up. I took us some different tractors and semi trucks and so forth. So a Steyr, that was something new for me that I have never seen before. But that seemed to be pretty popular over here. And I was at the gas station. They had a tractor magazine here thumbed through it. And I had a lot of big stuff. And of course, man trucks, the fire truck here at the Munich airport. And just some of their semis. They really liked their cab overs here. Their roads are pretty tight and so forth compared to what we're used to in the U.S. And now we're back to Munich. I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express near the airport. And this was right up against the country. And guys were farming in this area. And I took a walk that Friday evening hoping to catch somebody in the field. But other than a few tractors going up and down the road, that's all I got. And just down the road from the hotel, I caught this John Deere 7530 coming out of the field. Ready to head down the road here. This seems to be a pretty popular setup. A lot of the tractors here, most of them have a front three-point. And I think they're pretty restricted on the size of the equipment they can take up and down the road. So a lot of them run some type of a tillage tool up on the front and a planter on the back. Anyways, missed out on catching him in the field. But that's all I got here. So thanks for watching this video. And I hope everybody enjoyed it.
