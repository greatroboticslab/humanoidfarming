 Hello guys, welcome to another video tutorial on Thick Economist and today we will be seeing about the factor factor relationship. So far we have discussed about the factor product relationship and some of the basic concepts in the production economics and so what the factor factor relationship actually deals with. So it is we know that factor is the input and product is the output. So factor factor in the sense the input combinations where whereas different kind of inputs which are used for production of a particular output which should be done under a criteria called the minimizing the cost used for the production of an output. So this is the thing we are going to discuss about it. We used to produce an output at the minimum cost. So that is that yeah here you can see the factor factor relationship that is the combination of the inputs which under minimum cost for a given level of output. So today we are we will see some of the concepts like isoquant or isoproduct. So we know that iso is equal and the quant which represents the quantity. So isoquantity which is nothing but the different combination of two inputs which gives the same level of output which is called as the isoquant. So for example if we take capital one side and labor on the other side this curve shows that different combination of two inputs like capital and labor which in the same level of output. So in this line wherever the point is concerned for example if the capital is used in a higher level and labor and a lower level or labor in a higher level and capital at a lower level. So the output of the product which is same so which is called as the graph which is called as the isoquant map. So the properties of isoquant is always convex to the orison. So the isoquant is always convex to the orison and it do not intersects for example the isoquant one and two which will not intersect and for example we have seen that isoquant one is closer to the orison and isoquant two three is far away from the orison. So it represents that far away from orison it representing the higher output by using the different combinations of inputs. So for example if the capital and labor is there and if they For example we will take the amount of x replaced divided by amount of x added. So for example if we change the capital and if we add more number of labors which will give the marginal rate of technical substitutions. So for example there are three kinds increasing marginal rate of technical substitution decreasing So we have previously discussed about the increasing rate of returns, decreasing rate of returns and constant rate of returns. So the conditions which always applies to those kinds of things and the least cost combination. So in the initial lecture we have discussed about the least cost combination which is nothing but the various combination of inputs which gives the same output and for example there are different methods are used for estimating the least cost combinations one is long and method algebraic isocline and ridgeline and least cost combination estimation methods in upcoming slides for watching the video So So So So you So So you So you You You You
