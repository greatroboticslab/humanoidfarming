 Music Tropical climates are one of the major climates on Earth. They cover about one-third of the Earth's land surface. Tropical climates are categorised by high temperatures all year round, and they get lots and lots of rain. Tropical climates are sometimes called equatorial climates because they are located close to the equator. Some tropical climates include the Amazon Basin in Brazil, the Congo Basin in Africa, and many of the forests from Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Tropical rainforests don't have four seasons like many other land climates. Instead, they have a wet season and a dry season. Many of the world's rainforests are located in tropical climates. These warm and moist forests are the most diverse land habitats on Earth. They're home to millions of different kinds of plants and animals, many of which are still to be discovered. Sadly, tropical rainforests are being cut down for timber, or burned and cleared to make way for farms, roads and cities. It's really important that we protect these tropical forests so the millions of plants and animals that live there will be around forever. Don't forget to subscribe!
