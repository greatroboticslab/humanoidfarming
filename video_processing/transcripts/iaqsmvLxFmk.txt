 Today I'm with the latest John Deere crop sprayer behind me. 4,000 litres of water this beast holds. We're going to be having a look around it in a minute and these guys are going to be showing me how to use it. I hope. So you're going to show me around a bit James. Yep. It's a massive machine. How much does it weigh? This will weigh just over 10 tonnes. Is it nimble? Yeah, you've got a real good turning circle. You know, we've got two wheel steer, four wheel steer, crab steer. You know, any tight sections you can get in the field, you know, it's capable of getting there. How wide does this thing go out? Because it looks bigger. This machine's at 36 metres on a triple fold. You can get them from 24 metres to 36. It looks like we've got the cows that have just come round the machine now. Somebody want to go near to Mark's camera bag? Oi, oi! Right then James, I suppose let's put all this into practice and let me loose on it if that's alright. Brilliant. Tell you what, let's find an arable field to spray. Yeah, let's go. And how long does it take to set it up then? Like, the unfolding process? So the unfolding process will take about 30 seconds. Right. And that's VGs up, sections out, arms out, end sections out, NORAC ready to go, ready to spray. So the universal display, you've got all your Icebus implements, you've got your section control, you've got your automatic steering. 무 compar that's increased. If that's not functioning, pop it's affordable and you're getting your pocket. And do, ah, I've got one bloody casual situation. chur Mexe-share at 100% holdistance. And do you think you can do anything at all on the demand, section outside the dadurch side and tip- jig 손-by throwing 55 skar shawls at the pole buttonранs? Click that. Take your stock or pension chart. Well that is one fantastic piece of kit and if you want to see it and me we're at the Great Yorkshire Show so make sure you get your Great Yorkshire Show tickets from the website.
