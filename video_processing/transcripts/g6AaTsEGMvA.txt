 Hey, welcome to Never Sing Farm. In the flower field is where we grow all of our cut flowers. It's also kind of turned it into a nursery for our flower garden. So we take some of the flowers out of here after we grow them out to adult size. And I'm here because I want to talk about the aquifer kit. I'm really proud of it. I've been working on it for years. It's gone through a lot of iterations and I really like where it is now. It's basically a wobbler stand. But what's nice about it is it's not like a little tiny tube, you know, you kind of punch into the pipe and then you send a little tube up. You know, it's a proper sprinkler stand that's out of the way. It comes with all the pieces you need right out of the box, which is really nice. You know, we used to have it with garden hoses and stuff. But now the poly comes with the kit, all the stakes, all the wobblers, the fittings to hook it up to a hose. And so the kit is for wobblers. And the reason I did that is because it's really good for 100 feet. So the flower fetal is 100 feet. So there's four wobblers and then it does four beds wide. So it's like 800 feet of beds just on four wobblers. And I put together a kit in like 15 minutes. I mean, it's just so easy. It probably takes longer to coil out the pipe than putting it all together. Anyway, I'm really excited about it. And it's just solved so many issues on our farm with clogged wobblers from steel stands and having to deal with hoses and stuff being in the way on the path and all of that. So we use it in the houses, we use it in the field, we use it everywhere. All right. So thanks for watching and until next time.
