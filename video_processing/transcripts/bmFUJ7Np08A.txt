Howto & Style
 how to fill a large raised garden bed without using any soil. All this pile of plant matter and garden waste that has been gathered from around the property is going to be going in the base of the bed. In the top, we're going to jam in a whole heap of this old straw or sugarcane mulch. I've even got old rotten pumpkins. They're going to go in the bottom too. The next stage is adding the mulch. And now I'm starting to zhuzh the mulch up a bit. Get it a little bit more loose on top. Three or four handfuls of rock minerals. Our own compost. Technically is not soil. Spread it around, massage it in. Did you guess what that last ingredient was going to be? I bet you did.
