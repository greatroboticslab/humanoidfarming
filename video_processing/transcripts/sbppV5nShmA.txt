The most important thing on the farm is keeping your soil in the field. We don't want it to leave due to wind or water erosion and we'll talk today about some of the methods that farmers are using to keep their soil in the field. One of our grandpas grew up right here and – I mean right in this area – and so many of the fields that we farm, or at least some of them, he was farming way back when. Well the challenge back then is, you know how he could control the weeds? Tillage. Know how he stopped diseases? Tillage. How did he kill insects? Tillage. How did he prepare a proper seedbed? Tillage. Alright, so when you till and till and till, you're going to have more soil erosion and you're going to lose a lot of soil organic matter. Now I'm not blaming him or anything else, that was the only way he could do these things. So he was stuck. Today we're not stuck. It's still the same challenge in organic production. We see a lot of organic farmers struggling with this. Well man, what do I do? There really aren't good solutions that are labeled for me to use in organic production and they end up falling back to tillage in a lot of cases – not all cases, but in a lot of them – and that is the downside. You say there's always a pro and a con with just about every decision you make in choosing tillage – there are a lot of pros with it – but the con is your soil is loose now, it's stirred up, it's more prone to wind or water erosion. So, obviously, reducing tillage is one of those things that farmers are doing and only doing tillage when they absolutely have to – that can help reduce erosion. Absolutely. So, just think about the things or the reasons why the farmers, generations ago, had to use tillage. How do you control weeds? Well, they had to do it with tillage. What can we use today? Today we can use herbicides. How do we control diseases today instead of tillage? We have fungicides. And also, we have plants that through breeding processes are able to tolerate more of the diseases that we fight, so plant breeding has really helped. Same thing with insects. We have BT insecticide, so basically the corn itself can produce a protein that the insect can't digest. So, we can control insects just with the plant. So, there are a lot of these ways that we can beat tillage just with modern technology. Well, another thing that we can do is utilize cover crops. That's something on our farm we've got silage corn and it gets harvested early and there's still some growing season left, so we'll plant another crop out there. We plant oats. And you may say, well, why did you choose oats? Well, the great thing about oats, it will get growing quickly and it will make a nice fibrous root system that will hold the soil in place. It'll have some top growth to it, so it'll protect the soil from rain and any water erosion that could happen out there. Plus, the nice thing about it is, it dies off in the winter, so we don't have to spray anything to kill that off. In the meantime, we also choked out some of those winter annual weeds. There's a lot of good things about a cover crop. Last thing that I'll get to is, you know, we used to have to do a lot of tillage to prepare the seedbed. And I'm not saying that in all cases we can get by without tillage, because sometimes you have ruts in the field and reasons why you have to till. But today, we have much, much better planters. So, a farmer can go out there just with the planter in a no-till situation, and using those coulters, you can prepare that seedbed right as you're planting. So, modern technology, I love it. It's great. It allows us to save our soil, and that helps us long-term have overall healthier soil, better yields, and more profitability. Well, for farmers, keeping their soil in place is very important for the long-term. We want to reduce erosion, but we do still need to stop weeds like our Weed of the Week. Can you identify this week's weed? Like, how? Like, provide for help. Oh! I actually go into the house that Recognite AndroidEuiful Museum is just definitely ways to prevent anybody from leaving us to move it, in the same type of harm.
