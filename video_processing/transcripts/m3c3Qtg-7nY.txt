 Here's an example of how introducing cattle to pastures benefits the soil and land. Regenerative farmer Gabe Brown introduced grazing cattle and no-till to his North Dakota farm that already used cover crops and crop rotation. Cover crop residue protects the topsoil, diversifies native fauna, and maintains soil quality. The combination of cow manure and the cattle eating the cover crops release root exudates, which increase root mass as well as organic matter content. His soil is then able to hold more water and cycle more nutrients. And once the roots decay, there's more pore space for water infiltration. Brown increased the organic matter content in the soil from 2% to 4.8% through no-till, cover crops, and cattle. He hasn't used synthetic fertilizer since 2008, all while decreasing input costs as well as cattle wintering costs. Give me a follow-up for more videos like this on agriculture and health.
