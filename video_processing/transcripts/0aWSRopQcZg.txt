 Hi, I'm Ryan Goode, Grad Program Coordinator for the Department of Agricultural Economics. I will be your point of contact for all your in-residence, MS, and PhD programs here at Purdue. I encourage you to take a look at our faculty program highlights to see what's going on in our department and to see the faculty that are involved in each of those areas. Later this fall, our admission season will ramp up, so I encourage you to start your application process as soon as possible. If you have questions, feel free to contact me. Just know that our application deadline is March 1st. All application documents and supporting pieces need to be in by that deadline. I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully seeing you next fall.
