 Let me take you back to a quiet village in ancient China, a place where even a cow could spark a controversy. One fine day in the village of Chongqing, a curious incident unfolded. Two men were dragging a beautiful calm cow to the village square, each yelling at the top of their lungs, this cow is mine, no it belongs to me. The cow, she stood there, completely unbothered, elegant, silent. The villagers gathered murmuring, staring at the spectacle. Both men were adamant. One swore he raised the cow, the other said she responded only to his voice. Now what do you do when two people claim one cow? Simple, you call for the judge. And so the village chief sent for a wise royal judge who happened to be visiting a nearby town. Soon the judge arrived, calm, sharp-eyed and patient. He listened to both men argue. Then he turned to the villagers and asked, has anyone seen this cow with either of them? An old farmer stepped up. I've seen her many times, he said. She grazes near the first man's house. His children play beside her. But another voice rose. No, she's with the second man. I've seen her respond to his call. Hmm. The judge paused, looked at the cow, then said with a smirk, alright, let's ask the cow herself. You heard that right? The cow was going to decide. He asked both men to stand apart and call the cow. The first man shouted, come here girl, I'm your real master. The second one cried, come to me, don't be fooled. The cow looked, to the left, to the right, and then she ran. But not to either of them. Instead she dashed, straight into the arms of a quiet humble man standing at a distance. The villagers gasped. The judge smiled and asked, who are you? The man said softly. I didn't come forward, because I don't like arguments. But she's mine. She's been with me for years. She knows my scent, my voice, my love. The judge nodded and declared, the cow has spoken. This is her true master. The two fake claimants, well they slipped away and shamed their heads low. And the villagers? They learned something that day. That truth doesn't shout. It walks in silently and stands tall.
