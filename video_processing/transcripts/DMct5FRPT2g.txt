 Okay, today we're talking about sound management practices in milk production, dairy farming. Feeding is the biggest expense and the biggest impact on the cow's health and milk production. The better the feeding, the higher the performance of a high genetic cow. We are talking about three pillars in milk production. One is the genetic performance of a cow, the genetic potential, the breeding. The second one is the feeding and nutrition. And the third one is the management practices to put all this together. So it's important to make high genetic cows perform well, that the breeding and the nutrition becomes aligned. And with management practices, we utilize this to the highest potential possible. We need to create a balanced diet between energy, protein and fiber. Cows being ruminants. And we have to make sure that the cows get what they need in terms of the right balance. Another aspect of sound management, especially on larger farms, is to manage, train and manage the workforce. The people who do the work on a farm on a daily basis, feeding, milking and managing the cows, administrating all the animal health requirements. Everything, all the little bits and pieces, attention to detail that makes milk production profitable. And especially milking management, which is very important for cows to feel comfortable, relaxed, with good hygiene and good best practices to make milking an enjoyable experience for the cows, and also for the workers performing the milking. Everything is relaxed and the cows enjoy coming to the milking parlour. And especially in rotary parlours, they love standing on the platform, being milked. And yeah, it's always good to see the cows content. That means they're potentially produced to their genetic potential. So calves and young stock need to be managed and raised. That's also a big part of the best sound management practice on a dairy farm, because the young stock is a future herd. And it's important to have a good system that works well to achieve good cows coming into the herd and maintain the quality of the herd. So there's many different parts of management, which have to be all put together. It's looking after the cows, the well-being, the health of the cows, the feeding of the cows. Then in larger farms, the people who do perform the work, the workers are an important integral part of the operation, as well as the bringing up of the young stock, animal health, the milking, and generally handling of the animals is of utmost importance. Apart from that, on a dairy farm, when we grow our own feed, we also have to integrate the happenings on the land, on the farm to grow crops and provide the best feed for a dairy farm possible in terms of feeding the cows on high energy, high protein quality feed.
