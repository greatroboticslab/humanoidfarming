 Have you ever been left to take care of a particular plant or group of plants before? We all know that plants need some essential things to grow such as water and sunlight. What do you think would happen if you fail to water your plants? I used to have a garden but one day I traveled for about three months without leaving anyone in charge of my garden. When I came back you can imagine the horror and pain I felt. My flowers were dead, the soil was dry, and everywhere was overgrown with weeds. There had been no one to water my flowers and see to their welfare. This is why irrigation is so important. Can you go three months without water? I'm sure you can't and neither can plants. In today's lesson we'll be looking at the importance of irrigation to crop production. Irrigation softens the soil for tillage preparations. It also provides moisture thereby preventing drying up of the soil and roots. Irrigation also helps in reducing the amount of salt accumulated in the topsoil. This salt can be injurious to the crops. Just like the human body, water cools the soil and reduces its temperature. As expected, irrigation increases crop productivity and yield and enables the crops to do well. This means that there will be crop production throughout the year even when there is no rain. Irrigation also aids in microbial decomposition and nutrient release to the soil. Irrigation could have a few negative effects though. It could provide a human environment which favors the build up of pests and diseases. It might also encourage the spread of weed seeds. Hope you enjoyed this lesson. We'll see you in the next one.
