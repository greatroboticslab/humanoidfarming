 Hey guys, Lisa Gentile here. Today I'm going to talk to you guys about mounting. I often get questions about how to properly mount. I've heard a few horror stories, which knock on wood, nothing like that has happened to me before, but within mounting, horses have spooked. I've definitely had that happen, but people have gotten seriously hurt. Now this mounting technique that I'm going to show you isn't going to be the rescue, right? It's not going to completely save you, but I want to show you guys something. Ken, who I worked with in the past, showed me this, and I'll never forget it because starting a lot of colts, you know, when I was riding with a kid when I used to get on, I would have my hand here and here. Well, what I didn't realize when I went to mount, this hand has to come off to grab the reins, and so I started changing it a little differently because when you get on a colt, which a colt to me is any horse that hasn't had training or lack of experience in the world or with us, you know, so no matter if they're two or ten, a horse that's a little unpredictable and maybe not seasoned in their training, you want to make sure that your hands are up there. Now that doesn't mean go snatching on the reins real quick because that's going to probably get you bucked off too, but your hands are never going to leave up in front where that's your center of balance in a way, right? Your hands are here, but your balance is here, so when you go to come off, when you go to let go and mount, it's crazy. Like, all of a sudden, you're a lot further away from your horse too, so I'm going to show this to you, and then I'm going to explain it again so that you understand it. So when I go to get on a horse, I like to have a slight bend in their face, very slight, like my inside reins a little shorter than my outside. Inside feeding, it's close to me, okay? I got an eye on my horse. I'm going to get in the saddle, okay? And I'm going to be in tight. My hand is on the opposite side of my swell. So when I get on, right, I'm going to go to get on, and I want to show you guys something. My hands are right in front. Sorry, buddy. I just leaned on him a little bit. He's like, whoa, back up. So my hand is right in front, right? My hands are right here. My hand was in my reins, and my hand was on the side of my swell. So when I swung a leg over, my hands never left, right? And he's been having this little lazy... When I go to film on him, he likes to kind of act like he's bored and kind of pull on the reins, and we've been working on that a little bit. But when I go to get in, I can fix that, and I can say, hey, you know, we're not doing that, right? Make him back up, get off that pressure there, make him stand quietly. So again, when I go to get off, right, I'm going to get off, and my hands are together, and I'm nice and straight with my force, okay? So I'm going to do that one more time for you all. Okay? So the way I used to mount, I used to go like this, right? And watch what happens, right? First of all, I can't even get nice and close to him and tight. I'm further on the hindquarters than I want to be. And look at my saddle, right? That totally... I'm not even going to do it because I feel bad. Because, you know, it's not like I'm light as a feather here. You're pulling that saddle off, off kilter, and you're hurting his back. And you're balanced. And, you know, I find a lot of times horses, they walk off a lot. And I kind of started to think, I'm like, well, probably because it hurt, right? You're starting way out here, and all of a sudden and now you're pulling the saddle too, and they're expected to kind of bulldog and hold and stand there. It's painful. It's painful to watch and it's painful for them. And so, and ultimately it puts you in a very vulnerable position. Now, like I said, your hand comes off, right? Say you go to get on. Look, I can't even do it that way. Go to get off, right? Look, my hand has to come off to get in front. That puts me in a very vulnerable spot. If he decided to say, you know, in that moment, right? He can. So I'm going to get off again. So show that to you guys one more time. I know I can talk a little fast. Okay. Hold my saddle off, tilt like that, right? I got him slightly bent to the inside. I'm going to get my syrup. Watch my horse right here, right? Nice and close. See how close I am? Right over and never left. Okay. So try that. And even when you dismount, stay nice and close. My leg is close all the way down, slip right down. It's balanced. You're square and you're supporting him. He's more comfortable. I'm more comfortable. And if, if or when he decided to hurry up and move forward, it gives me time to just say, Hey, no, bend his nose, make him disengage, those hindquarters, slow him down. But when that hand is in the air and he decides to accelerate, now you're one handed. And I can guarantee you, your hands can go way up and now your balance is way off and your butt's out of the saddle. So it's just a recipe for disaster. And it might've been something so small that if you were more balanced, more square, you'd be able to recover a lot quicker. And say that horse could be doing the walking off just because of you getting on unbalanced like that and pulling on his spine. So try that you guys. I don't think that anyone's hurting their horses by any means. Sometimes this might not work for you. Maybe it's easier using a mounting block. You could do the same thing on the mounting block, right? And do that same technique. You don't have to do it from the ground. Um, something secure like that, but I definitely think it would make a difference. I bet some of those horses that are walking off as getting after them about the walking off, but then kind of squaring up your position to mount would be a lot, a lot helpful, more helpful for them, more comfortable for them at the end of the day. So, um, I know that it definitely has helped me. Like I said, I feel so much more secure. It took me a while to get used to it, but, uh, no turning back. I don't think I could get on another way. So try it. If you guys have questions about that, or if you want to see it on a mounting block, it's the same exact thing. Just make sure you always have a hold of your reins before you start putting your foot in the stirrup. And that way you're right reading your horse, seeing how they're acting before you even swing a leg on them. So I hope that helps. And I'll talk to you guys soon.
