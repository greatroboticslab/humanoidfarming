 Welcome to AgriVibes with Azindu, your go-to channel for cutting-edge conversations on agriculture in Africa and beyond. I'm your host, Azindu, and today we're diving deep into a pressing issue, organic farming versus chemical invasion in modern agriculture. In the last century, chemical fertilizers and pesticides changed the way farming is done, boosting yields and feeding millions. However, these changes have resulted in soil degradation, water pollution, loss of biodiversity, and potential health risks, involving synthetic fertilizers like urea and NPK blends, pesticides such as glyphosate, and growth regulators that, while offering quick fixes, often disrupt soil microbiomes and contaminate waterways. But there is hope in organic farming, focusing on natural processes and conservation practices that improve soil health, sustain biodiversity.
