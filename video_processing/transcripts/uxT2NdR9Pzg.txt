 Can rainwater from your roof poison your garden? We all know harvesting rainwater is a great way to lower your water use. But can chemicals from that water get into your vegetable plants? There are chemicals in your roofing materials, but they're only gonna be present in your water in tiny amounts. What about bird poop? Yes, birds poop on your roof. I know, rude. Rainwater isn't safe to drink. But you can make it safe for your plants by adding a few drops of bleach. If you're really worried, just avoid watering the leafy parts of your plants and stick to the roots, which you should be doing anyway.
