 So what I do is normal people, you see this chain, they start all the way here in the corner, right? Or they start here in this corner. I don't, I start in the middle. I'll show you in a second why. So what I do right now, if I attack, you see AP cost, 80 AP, right? So I pull him. Okay, let's go. I pull him. I stop a little bit so I don't lose him. Come on. Come on. Yes, let's go. It's not fast, like I said, it's time consuming, but it helps you with chaining so you don't lose as much. Oh, I don't have my simplified graphics on. I don't see if I hit. There we go. Should hit. So now this one, I'm just going to walk away. Walk away. Walk away. Reset him. Reset him. There we go. Take that one. Now this one resets me. Watch what happens. Look at the AP cost. Reduced AP cost by 0. Current stacks, 0. Action point cost, 0 AP. So like as long as you reset the first barbarian, you can go back to it for 0 AP. So basically what I usually do is always reset the first barb. I just use him to grab other barbs. But I always reset him back until I have no other one. You can even wait for barbs to respawn. If you wait really long. If you're really patient, you can wait for barbs to respawn and still use him again. So this is really how you can save a lot of AP. It's really time consuming. Because you have to constantly get back to that one. And stuff like that. But that's usually how I do it. I start in the middle. Hopefully this helps. Hopefully I explained it well. But that's what I usually do. There's one thing to point out. If you attack other barbs. Like if I attack this one for 80. Then this one goes back to 80 as well. So you need to make sure you always come back to the one that says 0 AP. So now I just come back. Because maybe if I started from the left side, I would have lost the chain. So that's why I usually start in the middle. And then go around in a circle. Or whatever I can grab. So here let's see. Can I... I might even be able to grab these 49. I don't know what a reset point is of this 46. So here you can... Yeah. Basically done explaining. It's a small explanation. But hopefully it helps you. I'll continue a little bit. See what's possible. It doesn't matter if you reset. Right? If you reset, it's going to be 0 AP anyway. So I can just try. I can just try to grab. And this is really... Because a lot of people... Like he resets. Okay, it's whatever, right? People find it frustrating if they lose a chain or stuff like this. This is how you avoid that. Or... Well, try to avoid it. Of course. I still would have loved to grab these. But now at least I know it's not possible. So I grab him again. 0 AP. Cost me 0 AP. It's for free. Because I already burned the 80 AP. And yeah. I get a bunch more. So yeah. It's a little bit... Simple example. Because we're not that many barbs here. But yeah. You can take this to a different extent. Like this 49. You can pull him to 48. Then come back and pull these ones. You know what I mean? You can create good chains. Hopefully this explains it.
