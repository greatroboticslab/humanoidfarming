 Did you know you could start a vermicompost bin for almost nothing and without drilling a single hole? And before you ask, what about excess water? Moisture control is key. Keep it damp, not wet. If it's too wet, add drier bedding. Too dry, add damp bedding. Start with 2 to 3 inches of bedding and small pieces of food waste. Once the food is gone, add 1 to 2 inches of bedding with food and repeat. Once the bin is full, it's time to harvest the nutrient-rich vermicompost.
