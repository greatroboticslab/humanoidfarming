We got the traveler's fruit seed. We also have uh, the mutation spray We got the oasis crate oasis egg and also the hamster now all of these are obtainable with these summer coins right here But how do you actually get the summer coins and how can you actually get them very very quickly? That's what i'm going to show you guys in this video So make sure you stay tuned but essentially as you guys can see I only have seven of these things But I only participated inside of one of these summer harvest events so far And it's actually pretty easy because it's basically all the things that we've been doing in the previous harvest events And that is by you know submitting summer fruits the more fruits you have submitted The more rewards you're going to get and the more rewards Well, basically the more fruits the more summer coins you're going to have now we submitted about I think like 7 000 And I ended up getting only seven of these summer coins So you actually I believe you have to have like a minimum maybe 1 000 before you're actually able to get one coin I think for every thousand you get one summer coin Well, actually you guys can see right here. Yeah, we had 7 000 submitted and then when the timer went off We were able we got seven summer coins right there honey basic sprinkler We got shekels recall wrench summer seed pack normal seed pack rare egg reclaimer twilight crate blood moon crate and also the b Essentially what you want to do is just make sure that you guys are inside of a public server That's like one of the number one tips I can give to you guys because the public server means more people are going to submit plants It doesn't change if you're inside of a private server Well, if you have friends that join a private server and you're all contributing to the summer harvest event Then i'd say go do it and go for it But other than that make sure you join a public server because there's going to be more of a chance That more people are going to be participating inside of the summer harvest event If it's just you inside of a private server, you're not going to get nearly as many plants If you were to join a public server like even if your garden was filled with summer plants and you got like 5 000 points all by yourself It really doesn't matter because you know if you're inside of a public server You would have got all those points anyway plus whatever anyone else would have participated as well So just make sure the more people that are participating the better and the best way to do that is inside of a public server Or even better if you actually have a friend or a bunch of friends that are all contributing inside of like a private server That also works as well Make sure you guys are also buying as many of the summer seeds as you possibly can So that way you have as many fruits to submit as you can because the summer harvest event only works with summer fruits It doesn't work with non summer fruits So whatever is basically inside of the seed shop is all compatible with the summer harvest event So just make sure you're submitting as much fruits as possible And then you're going to get as many of the summer coins as possible So you get the coins on top of the other items as a reward So yeah, you basically get two rewards now So just make sure you guys are grabbing literally every single summer plant off of your garden and submitting them when you know The event actually starts in an update earlier this week I believe it was earlier this week They added a button when you can actually go and submit all your plants at once and previously You had to submit them one by one which literally took forever But now they have a button that you can submit all your plants at once Which i'm very very happy they added this because yeah, I mean it took forever to submit the plants one by one But yeah, basically how I see it is for every 1000 harvest points that you get You get one of the summer tokens and that's how I got seven summer tokens is because we got 7000 points So if you were to get 10,000 points, I believe you get 10 tokens If you got a hundred thousand points, you would get a hundred of the summer tokens So just make sure you guys are participating in this event at the top of every hour with friends If you can if not all good just join a public server and just everyone's going to start contributing to the summer harvest events That's basically all you really have to do and that's pretty much the best advice This event happens at the top of every hour So the next one for me is in 43 minutes But yeah, it just happens at the top of every hour and I believe it lasts for 10 minutes long So you're also able to like for example these uh cauliflowers right here These ones grow back pretty fast Like i'm able to like replant these like three times per the event So I would go and collect all of these and then they'd replant themselves and I'd go collect them again And then again, I could collect them like three times like the cauliflowers are like really really good for the event In my opinion, like they give me a lot of points comment down below what your favorite fruit to use for the event is But I think like the cauliflowers like one of my favorites just because they replant back so fast You're able to grab them store them in your inventory and then they just replant so so quick So yeah guys one token for every thousand Uh points you get at least that's what happened for me It may be a little bit different for you, but let me know down below inside the comment section if you get any other rewards from it But for me we got 7 000 points We got seven tokens and that's basically it also the shop does update I believe it updates maybe like every 15 or 30 minutes I'm, not entirely too sure. I think it's actually every 15 minutes. Actually, it might be every 30 I think it's every 30 minutes, but I I really could be wrong But yeah, this is the brand new summer harvest event That is how you get the summer harvest tokens literally just by playing the summer harvest events Make sure you have at least a thousand harvest points in here and you should get awarded the summer token And that's basically it make sure you guys like the video and subscribe turn on that notification bell And i'll see you guys all inside of the next one.
