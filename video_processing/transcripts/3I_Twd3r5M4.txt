 Let's talk about outdoor mushroom farming. You want to bed in a shaded moist area. I built mine but you could just as easily do it under tree cover or any shady place you have access to water them. Different varieties prefer different bedding. Straw, old logs, dead leaves, and hardwood chips are all potential options. Avoid soft wood chips since they actually inhibit growth. We're gonna build a wine cap bed with straw using the lasagna method. First we add a thin layer of straw to retain moisture. Then we sprinkle some sawdust foam we got from Norsepore evenly over the surface ensuring good contact. Keep layering until the bed is about six inches deep. Water thoroughly to keep it moist but not soaked. Other varieties like shiitake thrive in wood-based substrate decomposing lignin and cellulose. It's basically the same technique using wood chips. Then I'm gonna cover them with straw to help hold in humidity. I even added a mister system that's run off my irrigation. Harvest your mushroom by twisting gently to avoid damaging the mycelium. I've got a big bed but you can go smaller if you need to. They don't take much room.
