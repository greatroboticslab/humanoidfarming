 welcome back guys to my channel in this video I'm gonna share something that is very useful because it looks like you can't plant anything during winter so I find this thing and it makes me able to have these pineapples during winter which is so amazing because I can actually earn much money even though it's winter so it actually doesn't have to be winter you basically can keep your crops planted for the next season so for example you have pineapples during summer and if you do this trick then you can still have it during autumn and also winter and even spring okay but you're gonna need to skip one day in the beginning of the next season so here's what you do on the 30th of the season so let's say in autumn on the 30th of autumn stay up late don't go to bed until morning like this so it's actually the 30th of autumn and I stay up late till 5 50 a.m. in the morning then I go inside the house okay I'm gonna save it first okay you have to drain your stamina here until you pass out okay so we're gonna do this you can use any tools it doesn't have to be this fishing pole I use this tool because I want to increase the level as well so you keep using your tool it can be anything can be your hammer or your sickle or your hoe so just keep doing this until the face on the left corner turns blue okay it's still yellow after yellow it will turn green and then it will turn blue okay I'll keep doing this until it turns blue okay see if you notice the stamina is already zero but you still can use your tool see if you notice the stamina is already zero but you still can use your tool alright it turns green I'm gonna save it first and keep doing this until it turns blue okay okay let's see if you notice the stamina is already zero but you still can use your tool okay I think we're almost there okay I think we're almost there alright so you notice it it already it already turns blue there I'm gonna save it okay and now let's count how many times we use the tool till we pass out okay okay okay okay okay okay okay we'll take this two two to five times we're gonna save it okay we have ten times and then we pass out so we got the count already ten times okay we pass out and then we skip one day we're gonna wake up on the second and I'm gonna read the saved data okay now this time we only do this nine times so before we pass out we stop doing this pass out we stop doing this we do this nine times okay and then we exit the house and just wait there exactly 10 minutes and he will pass out like this all right wake up in the clinic skip one day wake up on the second of the next season let's see if it works or not okay so that's how we do it I I started doing this since summer that's why I still have my pineapples and I haven't planted anything since then I just add some more autumn crops yeah I just leave the pineapples because it is the most expensive crops I can sell so I hope it's it's useful for you and don't forget to subscribe like comment and share my videos thank you I see you in my next video bye
