 Here's three reasons why. We raise beef. It's been our family business since 1897. Like 91% of farms and ranches in the U.S. that are family owned and individually operated. Just like cattle, people need to eat too. The average U.S. person consumes 67 pounds of beef a year. And lastly, we love living in the middle of nowhere. My neighbors are cattle, and they won't report me to the HOA. This message was brought to you by the Oklahoma Beef Council.
