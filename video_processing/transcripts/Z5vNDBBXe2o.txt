 Start by digging a hole in your garden, ideally near a fruit tree. Then take a plastic container and drill several holes in its sides. These holes will allow insects and microorganisms to move freely between the soil and the organic waste as they circulate. They'll help break everything down naturally. Next, make a few small holes in the bottom of the container. This allows the leachate and nutrient-rich liquid to flow into the soil. It's packed with amino acids, humic and fulvic acids, and other essential nutrients. Add a layer of gravel and sand at the bottom of the container. Then add dry leaves to supply organic carbon, which is key for decomposition. Finally, fill the container with your kitchen scraps and other organic waste. That's it, your compost will begin to form easily over time. You can scale the container and the hole size, based on your garden needs. And here's a tip. Cover the top with a piece of sod or turf to prevent pests, like rodents from sniffing around. They love food scraps, too.
