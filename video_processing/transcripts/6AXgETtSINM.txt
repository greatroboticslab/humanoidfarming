 I'm at the farmer's market, but not everybody selling here is a farmer. Let me explain. Some vendors are buying wholesale and selling retail. Is there anything wrong with that? Well, everybody's looking for a way to make a living. It's just, if you came to the farmer's market to buy from the farmer, you might want to buy from the farmer. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Signs. The fruit, too perfect. Pay attention. Are there any out of season fruit or vegetables? Or out of region. It doesn't even grow in the region. For legitimacy. There's usually a farm name. Produce isn't perfect, but beautiful. And there's no boxes to be found. Only reusable plastic bins. Don't be afraid to just ask them. Are you guys the farmers? Yes. We are farmers.
