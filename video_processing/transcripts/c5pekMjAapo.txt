 To an untrained eye, this might not look like a farm. But for Ravish, it's his most prized possession. Something he has planned and designed through years of labour. So why does Ravish's farm look a little different? Five years ago, Ravish took over his five-acre farm from his father. Like many farms in Tumukuru in southern Karnataka, the family cultivated aracanut and coconut. But soon, the farm started to face a water shortage. To save the crops, the family invested in multiple borewells. This soon led to a depletion in the groundwater table. Tumukuru is theняя farm's farm. The traditional farm was called by Ravish, and only one farm being done. In the eine vorettion forest. Since they ran into longer dimensional holes, nobody has done that water.

Today, Ravish harvests close to 70 varieties of fruits and vegetables from his farm, thanks to the bounties of multi-layer farming. Using this method, several crops can be grown in the same space. By the simple method of growing them one below the other or in layers, quite unlike monoculture farming. Music Because the money is not on the cost. There is a lot to how much money it comes up on the cost. Ravish has designed an 8-10 layer system in his farm. Layers can be added or reduced depending upon the crops, soil fertility, water availability and land area. On his farm in Tumukuru, which is a semi-arid area, Ravish has selected plants which consume less water and are rain fed. His topmost layer starts with arachanat and coconut trees. These are the tallest trees on the farm. He has planted medium-sized trees like starfruit and avocado under the top layer. Small branched plants like bananas and papayas form the third layer. Fruit-loving trees like cocoa are planted in the next layer, followed by spices like cardamom, chillies that are planted along the other vegetables at the soil level. The lowest layer consists of tubers, ginger and turmeric which grow below the soil. When the land area is used to the maximum, climbers like pepper are grown around the tall trees such as the coconut. I think we've never gained any entsprechend damage to our plants.
