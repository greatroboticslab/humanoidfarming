 In today's class, we will be learning the topic, environmental factors affecting agricultural production. These factors are grouped into three. Climatic factor. Biotic factor. Edaphic factor. Climatic factors affecting agricultural production. Climate is the average weather condition of a place over a long period of time. The elements of climate are rainfall, humidity, light, temperature, drought, wind, sunlight, humidity. E. T. C. Rainfall. Rainfall is defined as the release of excess condensed water vapor in the atmosphere into the earth. Drought. This is defined as lack of or insufficient rainfall in the area. Temperature. This is the degree at hotness and coldness of a place. Wind. Wind is defined as air in motion. Sunlight slash sunshine slash solar radiation. Sunshine is the amount of heat and the period the sun's rays are received at a place. Relative humidity. Relative humidity is defined as the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. Biotic factors affecting agricultural production soil organisms. These include bacteria, fungi, earthworms, rodents and termites. Bacteria and fungi can cause diseases. Root nodules of bacteria can fix nutrients directly to plants and soil. Help in decomposition of plant materials to form humus. Pests and parasites. Edaphic factors affecting agricultural production soil pH. It affects the growth of plants. It also affects the availability of soil nutrients to plants. It affects the presence of soil microorganism. Topography. This is the shape of the land in relation to the underlying rocks of the earth's surface. Thanks for watching. See you in the next video.
