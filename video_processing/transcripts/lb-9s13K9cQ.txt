Howto & Style
 To speed up and simplify the sowing of onions in the beds, I decided to make myself such a device. I needed a small board. I staggered the buttocks from plastic bottles onto it. And on the back side there are two handles. Now with this device I make holes in a pre-prepared bed. As you can see, the rows are smooth, and the distance between the pits is the same. Then, using a regular package, I sow the seeds. I sprinkle them with soil. And I water it abundantly. And a more detailed video has already been released on my YouTube channel.
