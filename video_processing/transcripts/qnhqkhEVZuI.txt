 Frosty frozen food. Frozen peas from farm to farm. Peas are grown on farms in large fields. The process begins in March, when the pea seeds are planted using a machine called a seed drill. The farmer continues to plant the seeds until mid-May, so that the harvest is spread over a few months, because all of the peas we need couldn't possibly be harvested in just one day. The peas grow in the field for three months, and when it is time to harvest them, the farmer uses a machine called a pea viner. This machine spins the pea pods round and round against a paddle, which gently opens the pods so that the peas fall out and land on a conveyor belt. The rest of the plant gets blown back out onto the field to fertilise the soil for the next lot of seeds. Next, the peas get taken to the factory, where they are tested using a machine called a tenderometer. The lower the reading, the sweeter and more tender the pea. The peas are cleaned again to make sure no debris from the field is left over. Before they are frozen, the peas are blanched. Blanching means that the peas are dipped briefly in some very hot water. Doing this means that the pea will keep its lovely green colour, and keeps the flavour in so it will taste as good when it gets to you as it did when it was picked. It also helps to kill any bacteria that might spoil the peas. Now for the most important part, the freezing. The peas are cooled down from the blanching, and then taken by conveyor belt to a machine called the flow freezer. Air that is minus 38 degrees centigrade is blown onto the peas, cooling the temperature of the peas to a very frosty minus 18 degrees in just 8 minutes. In fact, the whole process from harvest to freezing can take only 150 minutes. Once the peas are frozen, they are tested one more time, but this time with a special machine that uses infrared to make sure there are no tiny insects or stones that might have made it through the cleaning process. They are then packed into large crates and stored at minus 28 degrees centigrade, which keeps them nice and fresh. When it's time to deliver the peas to the shops, they are taken out of storage and packed into bags. Finally, they're transported to the shops in large refrigerated lorries that keep them cold, so you can keep them in your freezer at home, ready to have for your tea whenever you like.
