But if I'm gonna be one at all, I need to learn how to tame a pet. You don't tame a pet with your strength. You tame a pet with your kindness. Now get that in your head. Good luck! Gah! Gah! Thanks! Gah! Tame with kindness? Why does everything you say sound like a riddle? Huh? Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah!

What in the world is that? Bob! Chan! Catch what to do? Right here. All this work for a small pet. You're telling me. Keep it down! Now, in you go. Freeze! You're both pet poachers! What's with this run? We're not. I told you we're trainers. Don't lie to me. Let all the pets go! Annoying little punk. Now that you know who we are... We'll have to poach you too! Yikes! Allie!

Uh, Pop? Yeah? Raaah! Chang! Wait for me! Me! Ah! Ah! Ah! Catch them! Coco! Coco! Woohoo! Ah! Ha ha ha! Serves them right! Moogah! Huh? Moogah! What's this sound? Huh? Uh... Uh... Uh... Well, I'll be... Moogah! That's a baby pet! Ha! Uh... He... Ha! Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... ... Uh... The bad guys are gone, so you can go on home. Moga! Moga! Don't you have somewhere to go? Moga! Then, want to hang with me? Moga! Yahoo! I did it! I finally got a pet of my own! Let's go home! I'll make you something yummy! Moga! Moga! A talent for training. Here, Kubo. Put this in the dino vault. Professor Play-Doh! I finally have my own pet! Moga! It's a baby pet. Hmm. Its name is Moga. You've already given it a name? Yep. Moga! Moga! is all it says, so... Moga! Moga! Woody, this pet is a baby Mogaros. A Mogaros? That's right. One of the strongest pets I know. Moga! Yeah! Moga! Moga! Moga! Maybe I'll take the trainer's qualifying test now. Don't you think it's too soon? But it's a super strong pet, right? So why wait longer? I know. Let's have a match with Kubo first. Kubo! If you beat Kubo, I'll write you a testimonial for the test. It's a deal. Moga! Okay, are you ready? Born ready. Moga, show him what you got! Kubo! Kubo! Moga! I'm school's son of the time. Which more Kl promo marks the wall as well? No ayuda! Oh, he isn't his name. You can keep hold of his little kids. Mocha! Mocha? No! Mocha! Woody, no pet is strong right from the start. You need to train them to help them become stronger. From now on, it's boot camp. Good. After some hard training, we'll have a rematch. You're on. Okay, let's go train. Booga, Booga! Professor, do you think Woody has what it takes? Don't worry, Elia. Just wait. Woody will become an excellent trainer. Because it's in his blood. Got that, Mooga? We'll train real hard and clobber, Kubo. Mooga! Now, let's get started. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Are you all warmed up now, Mooga? Mooga! Mooga! Hey, where are you going? Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! Huh? This is Fiery Berry. Be careful, it's super hot. Oh, no! Uh, huh? What? He likes them? So they're not hot? Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! It's like fire! How are you eating them? Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! Whoa! Wow! Professor! Oh, back already. Is the training going well? All done with training. We're here for a rematch with Kubo. What? That was quick. Kubo! Kubo! Mooga! Mooga! Kubo! Kubo! Kubo! Mooga! Kubo! Oh, he's improved. Totally. Mooga! Uh! Yeah! Uh! Kubo! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Kubo! Ah! Uh! But it seems like he still has a lot to learn. Ha ha ha! Just wait and see. Heh! Hey! Heads up! Ha! Mooga! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Mooga! You think you're a food fighter or something? Kubo! Mooga! He breathes fire? Huh? Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! We won! Ha ha! Woo! Mooga! Yeah! Mooga! Woody, how did Mooga do that? It's simple. If he eats fiery berry, he can breathe fire. Really? That's something even we didn't know. Professor, remember that testimonial you said you'd write? He he he he! You got it. Booga! Yahoo! Booga! Told you. Woody's going to become one of the greatest trainers ever. This is it! I'm off to be a trainer! Let's go! Booga! Woo! Worthy of the Stone Reader! Here we are. This is where I take the trainer's qualifying test? There's a ferocious pet inside the cave. You must defeat it and go to the end where you'll find an altar. If you truly cherish your pet with a pure heart, the strength of the Stone Reader's spirit will be granted. My heart is as pure as snow! Right? Mooga? Well, thanks for the info, Chief. Let's go! Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! I hope he fares well. Hmm. Ha ha ha! It's freezing cold in this cave! Booga! Hmm? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! What are you doing? I'm hungry. Ha ha! Ha ha! Hold on. I'll help. Ah! Whoa! Whoa! You're free! Huh? Uh… Huh? Moga! That must be the ferocious caveman! Moga, time for some fire! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! You okay? Moga! What do I do? That's it! Kobi! Kobi! Kobi! Kobi! Hey, come on! Kobi! Kobi! Kobi! Kobi! Kobi! Kobi! Kobi! Kobi! Kobi! Excellent! Moga! Are you okay, Moga? Moga! I think this is the spot. This is the altar that Chief Shamgear told us about. Moga? Now once I place this slate on it... Moga! Hey! Catch you again! Now the baby Moga Ross belongs to us! Yeah! You're those pet poachers! Hey! Look who's calling the kiddo black! We stole him first, but then you stole him from us! Let Moga go! Yeah! Ah! You're not getting away this time, little punk! Yeah! Ah! Ow! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Moga! Ah! That'll teach the runt to mess with us! Let's go, Bob! So long! Ah! No! You can't take him! Moga's my friend! Yuck! Huh? Uh, uh, uh... You who truly cherishes his pet... Huh? ...shall be Hemsworth ordained as trainer. Huh? What's that? Ah! Moga? Is... this a stone reader? Huh? Huh? Huh? Moga! In the name of the trainer! You're here! I claim you as my pet! Huh? Huh? Holy moly! What's going on here? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! What was that? Some kind of magic? Kiss punk! Gah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Watch out! Ah! That slippery little runt! Ah! Let's get him! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! I can't see anything! Come on out! My pet moga! Ah! Ah! Ah! What's going on there? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! You did good, Loga! Yahoo! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Booga, Booga, Booga, Booga! Witcher 3 Woohoo! Finally! I'm an official trainer! Mooga! A strange khaki. I can't believe I have a stone reader! It's like a dream come true! Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! Mooga? Return, Mooga! Mooga! I have a pet stone now! I'll cherish it forever! Mooga! Return, Mooga! Mooga! Hello, Mooga! Return, Mooga! Mooga! Mooga, it's your fave, fiery berry! Mooga! Now, go catch! Return, Mooga! This is so fun! Ha ha ha ha! Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Hmm... Ow! I'm sorry. I promise I won't play tricks again. I just got a stone reader, and you're my only pet that I can practice with. So, from today, we'll look for a new pet I can claim. Sound good? Hmm... Hmm... Huh? Huh? Oh... Jackpot! That's a khaki! I have to hurry and catch it! Huh? Oh, yeah. I can't get a pet by using force. I have to make them my friend. Mooga! Let's see what he's doing. Yeah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Wrong pipe! Ah! Water! Water! It looks like he needs water. Here's my chance! Grr! What's taking that fumbling-brained bubble so long? Thirsty? Huh? Huh? Here, have some. Huh? Oh, how kind of you. Ah! I really needed that. Much obliged, my friend. My friend? Then that means we're friends now, right? Huh? Well, not literally, no. In the name of the trainer! Huh? I claim you as my pet! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait! I'm not really a pet! No! Ha-ha! Ha! Ha! So cool, I got my second pet zone! Ha-ha-ha! Let's go brag to Professor Play-Doh! Professor! Huh? Professor! I got you water! Where are you? Hey, who are you looking for? Ah, Professor Kyle. He has a pretty bad temper, but he's one of the most renowned experts on dinos! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! As for me, I'm the professor's ace assistant Bubbles! Ah, nice to meet you. Want me to help you find your professor? Mmm, hard pass. I'm going to be a leading dinosaur professor in the future, so I don't need no help from some toddler. What? Toddler? Ugh! You're looking at the next greatest trainer on the continent! Puh-ha-ha-ha! A trainer? You? That's right! In fact, I claimed a new pet just a minute ago! Come on out, my pet! Huh? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! See? Oh no! Professor Kyle! What? Professor Kyle? Ah! Ah! Ow! Ah! Ah! See? I told you that I wasn't a pet! I'm real sorry. But how did you get to look like that? Ah! You see... Well, my latest research has been on hybrid pets. One day I was combining a khaki with another pet when... I made a teensy-weensy mistake and the professor combined with a khaki instead. Ah! Ah! Ah! And now we're on our way to Shamgeir Village to ask Professor Plato to help me. Huh? Huh? You know Professor Plato? I do! Plato and I have been good friends since our old school days. Huh! Then just follow me. I'll take you to the dino lab. Great! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You look ridiculous! Now that's enough, Plato! If you don't stop laughing I'll take your head! Alright. I'm sorry. Ahem. Ahem. This is a unique case so there's no known cure. But I'll work on finding one. If anyone can, it's you! Ah, one more thing. I hate to ask, but would you mind giving me a place to stay? No problem. You're my old friend. It's the least I can do. Oh! Thank you, Plato! Plato! Plato? I'll get you for this! I'm not a pet! First mission as a trainer! Come on! You call this food? It is food. It's pet food. I can't eat this. It's for a pet. But that's what you are now. You are! I'm not and you'd know it! Oh, come on! Let me have a sec! Ah, fine, you can have a bite. Ah! Ah! Of the sandwich, not my hand! I don't quite taste it! Geez, I should never have let him stay here. I know I'd regret it. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! My tummy hurts! Hurry! Hurry! Take me to Plato's lab pronto! Mmm! Uh-oh! Remember, you're a pet now. You can't go around eating human food. What then? I have to eat pet food? You'll get used to it soon. Luckily, it's just indigestion. It'll pass with time. Ah! By the way, Woody. Glad you're here. A wild tiger hog's been attacking people recently. Can you go look into it? Is this my first trainer's mission? Sure, we can call it that. Woohoo! You can count on me! I'll go with you! Will you come too, Professor Kyle? Me? No! Why would I go with you? Actually, Woody could use your pet expertise, Professor. Plus, some exercise will help with your indigestion. No way! Forget it! I need bed rest! Guess I have no choice then! Return khaki! Huh? No! Now! How'd you like that? Pretty impressive! I can't believe I'm carrying you when I'm sick! Technically speaking, you're my pet, Professor Kyle. If you keep complaining, I'm gonna turn you back into a pet stone! Oh, you little tyrant! The wild tiger hog was last sighted here. Oh! In the bush! The tiger hog! Look at the color of its eyes! It's being controlled by someone, I'm sure of it! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Moogah! Oh! We meet again! And this time, we're taking the Mogoross! Not if I can help it! You know those guys? Yeah! They're pet poachers after Mogah! We're not pet poachers! If you're not, then why do you keep taking pets? I'm not gonna tell you! That's right, because Dr. Thalas told us not to! What? Thalas? You two must work for Dr. Thalas! Huh? How did he know that? You just told him! Dr. Thalas? Who's that? He's an evil scientist who worships machines! What's the matter? My tummy! It's talking to me! Ha! The great Dr. Thalas and his brilliant machines will rule the world! Ha ha! I would bet on it! Moogah! Go flame him! Ha ha! Moogah! All right! What? It didn't faze him! You'll have to come harder than that! Tiger Hawk can take a blow like no other! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Moogah! You can't keep running away! Woody! I have a plan! Plan? Tiger Hogs have sensitive noses, so they hate bad smells! Yeah? So what? Stop asking questions and just get that hog over here! Oh! You got it! Moogah! Come this way! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Over here! Booga booga! Booga booga! Booga! Huh? Pluck your nose now! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Hog! Wow! Hog! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! Go! Go claim him! Okay! In the name of the trainer, I claim you as my pet! Excellent! That was a smelly low blow! It's time to retreat! Wait for me! My tummy feels good now. My indigestion's gone. You were awesome, Professor Kyle! You look like a bird, but you still have your smarts! I do! Anyway, if Dr. Thalys is making moves, then we're in for big trouble. Woody, if I can help you, I will. That'd be great, Professor! I'll help you too! Thanks, Bubbles! Our second mission... ...is to go home! Go, go, go! You all have legs, so why don't you use them? Mysterious Lucy Now focus, Moga! Moga! That was awesome! Mm-hmm! He has good answers! Good! After training some fireys, the whole pouch... Moga! Moga! Go! Moga! Moga! Moga! Wicked! Again! Huh? Moga! Oh no! Ugh, they're burnt to ashes! Hmm... Huh? Huh? Sorry, Moga. I'll find you more fireys, okay? Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! Next time, be more careful! Ugh! Let's just find them already! Ha! Huh! Think there's a bush of them across this bridge. Huh? Hey, what's that? Huh? Is it a pet? Huh? No, it's not a pet! It's a person! Let's go see! Huh? Uh... Wow! She's so pretty! She's waking up! Huh? Uh... Uh... Where am I? In a forest near Shamgir Village. More importantly, where are you from? How did you fall into the water? I'm Bubbles! What's your name? Moga Moga! My name is Lucy. Uh... And I'm afraid that's all I remember. Huh? Why? I'm Bubbles! What's your name? Moga Moga! My name is Lucy. And I'm afraid that's all I remember. Huh? Why? I'm Bubbles! I'm Bubbles! I'm Bubbles! I'm Bubbles! I'm Bubbles! I'm Bubbles! I'm Bubbles! I'm Bubbles! And I'm Bubbles! I'm Bubbles! I'm Bubbles! I'm Bubbles! I'm Bubbles! I'm Bubbles! Huh? Why? She must have lost her memory when she fell in the water. Poor thing! Then you can come stay at our house! What? How is it our house? We live together! Yours, mine, ours! I'm letting you stay with me as a guest! Don't you forget that! What's that sound? I think a pet's in danger! I have to help! Huh? Wait for me! Ha! You stepped right into a trap, didn't you? You're gonna pay for the score! Oh dear, oh dear! The more you move, the more ow your legs! Stop! What are you doing? It's you guys again! I don't know why they keep showing up! Perfect timing! Let's use our secret weapon on them! Great idea! Stop wasting our time! Moga, go and attack! Moga! Wait, hold on! Come on, give us a minute to entail us! Moga! Whoa! Oh yeah, he didn't have any fireys! Looks like we were scared for nothing! All set! Have a shot on this! Moga! A small taste of a machine's great power! Time for round two! Moga! Moga! Come back here! Where are they going? Huh? Oh dear! You must be in pain! Don't be afraid! I came here to help you! Moga! A dead end! Nowhere to run now, chumps! Ha! Professor Kairu, do something! Hurry! Yeah, hurry! You're the adult here! What? Oh, so you come to me only when you're in trouble! Now it's time to say goodbye! Yeah! trabajando! How did he get free? Lob! Tta! He won't dodge this one! Ko Ghor! behind you! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Thank you, Club Gore. Thank you. I'm grateful for your help, Gore. Oh. Only the most skilled trainers know how to give treatments to pets. Who did you learn it from? I don't remember. So I was hoping I could stay with you until I regain my memory. Of course you can. Smart new members are always welcome, right? Yes! Yeah! Hold on. You are way too weak. I'll join your team and protect Lucy Gore. Oh, how sweet. Oh-ho! It's great we have such a strong pet on our side. Which means I just claimed a new pet. Lucy, you must be tired, so let's go home. Hey, Bubbles, it's my house, remember? I remembered. Don't be so petty. Why, you. I'm glad to be a part of the team. Ha-ha-ha! Wooga! Wooga! Wooga! Don't tease Kukoski. Giddyup! Giddyup! Wooga wooga! Giddyup! Professor, go faster! Wooga wooga! Stop pestering me! Wooga wooga! Wooga wooga! Huh? You're weird looking! Eee! Blah! Blah! Gah! Those kids are making fun of our pet! Those little meanies! Kukoski is ugly muggy! Huh? Huh? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! That's right! You better run, you jerks! Call me out to scare a bunch of kids! You okay, Kukoski? Oh yeah! I'm okay, Ski! Thank you for helping me! You're so funny! Not you guys too! You're all the same! Huh? Huh? You knuckleheads! Do you know how bad it feels to be teased about your looks? Sorry, I didn't mean to... We should go find Kukoski and apologize. Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Everyone's a meanie! Oh dear! Poor thing! Who are you? We are your guardian angels! We can make all the teasing stop! Sound good? Yuski! Kukoski! Kukoski! Kukoski! Kukoski! Kukoski! Kukoski! I'm sorry about before! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! That's Kukoski! Gah! Gah! Stop! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Leave those kids alone! Fine. Then I'll play with you instead! Gukoski is being influenced by those mechanical arms! Clopgore! Clopgore! Clopper those arms! You got it, Gore! Gah! Gah! Ski! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! No! Clopgore! Gah! Gah! Gah!

I know what you're going through! Don't lie to me, Ski! No, it's true! I know how you feel, cause I used to be teased for being short. Gah! Gah! Hey, how's the air down there, shorty pants? Gah! Gah! Gah! But still, revenge isn't the answer. S-Ski! Gah! Gah! Hey, look! Kukoski is wavering! My friends treated me like an outcast every day. So? I hung out with some pretty seniors instead. Hey! You're not helping, Bubbles! Kukoski! Yikes! We made him more angry! Ski! Ski! Kukoski! Hold on! Look at this khaki! He looks like this and he's doing just fine! And he looked worse when he was human! How dare you, Bubbles! Kukoski! Gah! Gah! I think we're getting good on him! Hey! Don't start crying! Have some confidence! You're attractive in your own way! Your own way! Your own way! Please! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! He's turned back to normal! What are you doing? Keep attacking! Want to be an outcast forever? Damn it, Bubbles! I should have known you were behind this! I don't want to do this anymore! Please take this off of me! You don't have a choice! Ah! Eeeee! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Huh? No! Kukoski, try and fight it! Ah! Ah! Now finish him off! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! That little runt! Give up now! While you still can! Ah! We have to go anyway! Ah! You too! Ah! Ah! Ah! I'm the real outcast! Ah! Ah! Ski! Ah! Ah! Ah! Kukoski, I'm sorry about before. I'm sorry too, Ski. You know, if it's okay, how about we all be friends? Yeah! Be friends? Yeah! We'll make sure no one teases you again! Yeah! Ah! Thank you so much! That's so sweet! I'm so happy! And looking at this khaki makes me even happier, Ski. Huh? What? Hold on! Why is that? Huh? Desert, looks like you saved another day! What do you mean? That's very insulting! O-T-T-O, Master of Disguise! Whoa! What is this? I made a yummy pie for you guys! Ta-da! Whoa! I didn't know you could cook! It should be ready in about a minute! Oh, okay! It looks good! What's Lucy taste this? You're the best, Bubbles! Oh! Oh! Ah! Ah! My pie! Oh! Too-too! Come back here! Too-too! Oh! Beef! Beef! Oh! Beef! Oh! Beef! Ah! Beef! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! for a quiet day. Oh-choo-choo! Where did it go? Oh-choo-choo's are masters of disguise. They're impossible to find in the forest. In that case... Come on out! Huh? Ha! My pet... Tiger Hog! Rawr! Eww! Oh-ho! So you'll use Tiger Hog's sense of smell. Hog! Hog! Oh-oh! Oh-choo-choo! Wow! Oh-choo-choo! Little thief! How dare you steal my pie! Oh wait, Bubbles! I don't think a pet this timid would normally steal. Oh-choo-choo! Can you tell us why you took the pie? Why, I'm being threatened, choo-choo! Threatened? What? I knew it, Chairman Bob! They said if I didn't bring them something sweet, they would burn the forest down, choo-choo! Those bullies? Huh? Hey, Bogos! Huh? Threatening pets now? How low can you go? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Looks like we have guests! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Glad you're here! Glad? We've prepared a special present for you! Come out, Spear-gor! Spear-gor! Whoa! What kind of pet is that? Spear-gor! Same family as Clob-gor, but more fierce! We'll see how fierce he is! Come on out! Huh? My pet, Clob-gor! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! He's no match for our ferocious pets! Take him down! Spear-gor! Oh! I'm gonna go! Clob-gor! Clob-gor! Clob-gor! Oh! Oh! Oh! Whoa! Oh! Oh! Oh! Yeah! Way to go, Mocha! Smear-gor! He's totally fine! The fire only made him angrier! Smear-gor, some candy! Huh? Oh! Smear-gor! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! When Spear-gores eat sweets, they get stronger and much more ferocious. That's why they forced poor Otutu to steal. Spear-gore! Oh no! We don't stand a chance! There has to be a way! That's it! Otutu! Otutu! Can you put this pie in that pot? What for? It's all a part of my plan. How about it? Can you do it? Of course, Otutu. Nice hook! Clomber that clom-gore! What's the matter? Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry. Otutu! Spear-gore! Gork! Gork! Gork! Spear-gore! His spines got smaller! The effects of the sweets are wearing off! I wouldn't celebrate yet! Here! Recharge with this! Say! Hmm! Help me! That's it! Now please work! Gork! Gork! Gork! Gork! Gork! Gork! Gork! Gork! Gork! Gork! Gork! Hey! Hey! Hey! What's wrong? Spear-gore is vulnerable now! Attack! Gork! Gork! Gork! Gork! Gork! Gork! Look at you! Gork! Gork! Thank you so much, Tutu! I wish to repay you by joining your team! Really? That would be super awesome! I wonder, why did Spear-gore freak out before? Ah! When no one was looking, I put a bunch of fiery berries inside the pie! Oh yeah! What an ingenious idea! It was amazing! You're the best, Bubbles! Oh! Oh, shucks! Please! It was nothing! Bubbles! Why are you so red? You eat some fire berries, too! I did too! The Boy Who Saves the World What? You ran into Dr. Thallis' goons? That's right! There were two of them! Who is this Dr. Thallis, anyway? Hmm... A dino expert. He was a rival of our professors. But one day, he started doing dangerous experiments with mutants. Then he began dabbling in the forbidden subject of mechanical studies. So he was banished. I don't get it. Why is he after Moga, then? He's collecting strong pets and making them even stronger! If Dr. Thallis succeeds, there'll be no stopping him. We must act fast. Let's inform Chief Sham'gir. Oh, I love Chimpe. That's a good one! That's a good one! That's a good one! Is that really true? Yes! Oh, God! Okay! I love you! I love you! I love you! He he he he he! Everyone will think we're Mon Mo, won't they? Of course! Now let's start sniffing some pets! He he he he! There's one! Oh, God!

Had enough of the party crashers. Punching King Agua! It's good to have you on board. What do you say? You and I bust some moves. Sounds good, Ski. Aren't you guys tired? Missing Beach Toys? What? Beach Toys has disappeared? Yes. And I love him like my own child. Oh dear. He means so much to you. Don't worry, Chief. I promise we'll find him for you. I'm counting on you. How did Beach Toys go missing? Beats me. Chief said he's never been out of the house before. Could he have been stolen? How? Footprints? They're Beach Toyses. And a human's. Maybe he was pet-napped. For Tootoo! Did you find something? I heard Beach Toys by the pond, Tootoo. By the pond, right? Tootoo. It's Beach Toys! That's definitely him! Okay guys, let's rescue Beach Toys! You thief! It's not Chan and Bob! What did I see just now? I think I need a second look. My, my. Spying on a lady bathing. How naughty of you boys. You're one to talk, you pet-napper! What? You stole poor Beach Toys! You must work with Chan and Bob! I didn't steal him. He came willingly. And as for Chan and Bob, no clue. Quit pretending! And hand over Beach Toys! If you want him back so desperately, then name your price. A pet's not some object you sell! You should be ashamed of yourself! Come on out! Ah! Ha! My pet, Agua! Agua! Go knock him out! Right? I've heard rumors of a blonde money-grubbing female trainer. Then that must be her! Let's see what you've got, kid. Agua! Go knock him out! Ah! My! I thought you were just a little kid, but you're a trainer! Well then let's play, shall we? Come on out my pet! Gold Cabit! Cappy! Holy pet! That woman is a trainer too! Yes! The name's Bambi. The prettiest trainer in Tectonica. Ah, that's right. I've heard rumors of a blonde money-grubbing female trainer. Then that must be her! Then that must be her! Hm, let's see what you've got, kid. Agua, go knock him out! Agua! Agua! Beep! Agua! Agua! Agua! Oh, that must hurt. Agua! Agua! Agua! Agua! Agua! Agua! He's losing to that little pet! This doesn't make sense! Shows you how important experience is. Come on, think, Woody! That's it! Agua, open your fists! Agua! Agua! Agua! Agua! K.O. him! Huh? Beast Toys? What are you doing? Why are you helping that wicked woman? Because I don't want to go back to it! What? You don't know just how much I've wanted to travel the world! Come, Beast Toys! But the Chief has never once let me step outside the house. I know he cares about me, but I can't stay locked up anymore! I want to see the world with Bambi! See, I told you! But she's untrustworthy! She'll sell you the first chance she gets! Yes, Bambi would never do that, Toys! Beast Toys! Beast Toys! Here you are! How did you find us, Chief Shamgear? I was so worried, I just couldn't wait at home. Oh, my sweetie pie! We're turned, Beast Toys! Sorry, old man. The pet's mine now. Oh, have some compassion! Tell me what you want, I'll give you anything! Just please return my pet to me! Anything? Oh, this is embarrassing! This should get me a pretty penny! Ta-da! Hope I never see you again! Hey, you must be tired, sweetie. Let's hurry home. Shouldn't we say something? Ah, well, it's not really our place. What? You want me to take Beach Toys? Yes, I do. Ever since that day, Beach Toys has been running away. I will miss him, but I think it's time to set him free. Woody, I want you to show Beach Toys a bigger world. Chief Shamgear must really love Beach Toys. Yes, he really does. Don't worry, Chief. We'll take real good care of Beach Toys. Toys! Toys! Toys! Hey, can't you at least pretend to be sad? Yay! Yangidon, the outlaw. This is where Yangidon lives. Do you really think Yangidon will join our side? Sure, why wouldn't he join? What's this? Who are you? And why are you loitering outside my pad?

Now, let's do this! Did it work? Hands! Success! What's the matter? Huh? Look what you did to me! I'm sorry, Kyle. Oh, no! I'm sorry, Kyle. Oh, no! I'm sorry, Kyle. Oh! Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? What are you doing? Thought it might be some kind of mask or something. It's not a mask! Cause Professor Kyle's real head is way bigger than this! What? How dare you! Kyle, I don't know what to do yet, but I'll keep researching. Aww. Huh. We'll be on our way then. Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! Giddy up! Are you alright? His legs are human, so they're not as strong! Get... off of me! Ah, and I wouldn't eat human food just yet. Your body's a pet, so you'll get indigestion. Stick to pet food, okay? Oh, no! I despise pet food! What a mess! It's not that bad, Professor. Huh? Oh? My ball! Oh, dear! Let me help you! Thank you, sir! You should be careful! Huh? Why are you crying? Sweetie, what's wrong? Huh? Oh, it's a monster! Monster? No, no! A monster? What did you do to this girl? Huh? No! A monster? What did you do to this girl? Huh? No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Please! You've got it all wrong! Huh? Huh? You're not doing anywhere! Don't let him go! Professor Kyle! Ah! Please don't! Professor Kyle's got a monster! Professor Kyle? He's like that because of a bad experiment! Oh, golly! I had no idea! If I scared you... I'm sorry! Professor Kyle! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Just look at me! I'm completely grotesque! I can't live like this! I must find a way to change back! Oh! Oh! Oh! I'm hungry! Let's find something to eat first! Hmm! Ah! Huh? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ooooo! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Emily! Whohof Vallistreeloyuuutta occur defended? Has hened? Ow!arnos from bound positions! Professor Kyle? You have to get out of here! Come on, Ellia. Get on my back. Hurry! Okay. Let's go! I can't run fast with these human legs. It would have been great if I still had my cocky legs and wings. He's catching up to us. I want to transform back! Oh! Ha! Ha! Hoo! Huh? Huh? Hee-hee! Huh? Oh, yeah! Professor, your body! Hey, I'm back! How did this happen? We should go! Hold on tight! Okay! Try and catch us if you can! You know... Come on. That's enough for today. Grrrr! Hmm. An unexpected saboteur. Interesting. You could have been hurt. I'm so glad you're both alright. However, the experiment was a total failure. I'll figure out how you changed back into a khaki. But after today, it might not be so bad to stay like this. Stay like this?! No way! I want to get to turn back again! Love Sick Pink Pig. Professor Play-Doh! There's no one here. Coming through! Huh? Whoa! This way! What's going on? I think the pet is sick! Professor, I can't find a pulse! Too many layers of fat! Temperature! It's sky high! This is bad! Will he pull through? I know this beat. Huh? Well? He has... Love Sickness! What?! Are you saying Pink Pig's fallen in love?! That's right, Piggy! I can't stop thinking about Cow Pig day and night, Piggy! Just tell Cow Pig how you feel! Yeah, just go for it! It's pointless! Get on! Get on! Get on! Get on! Get on! My mom! I've never seen a male so strong! How are you? I'm not sure how he's doing! You're so powerful! Why are you? You're so powerful! Why are you trying to get a male? Why are you trying to run? I'm trying to get him out of his way. Can't take him out of his way! Can't take him out of his way! I've never seen a male so strong. Piggy? Hey, what are you doing? I finally found the pet of my dreams, Piggy. Oh, go away. You're not really my type, Kid-On. What? Am I a bad boy? I like you even more. Get away from me. Leave me alone, Kid-On. Piggy. She would never go for a weak pet like me, Piggy. Oh, I feel your pain. Don't give up. All you have to do is become stronger. We'll help you all the way. Why is he so emotional? You can do this. Faster, punch faster. Go on. Oh, my God. Kubo. Kubo. Kubo. Kubo. Kubo. Piggy. Piggy. Piggy. Piggy. Jump higher. You need more hide, Gorora. Piggy! Piggy moving on. Piggy! Piggy! Piggy! Piggy! Pig, pig, pig, pig, pig! Piggy! Piggy! Yeah, good one. I know you can beat him, Pink Pig. I'm ready, Piggy. Yanky Don, let him win, okay? Yeah, I know. Basically, if Pink Pig wins, I have to give him a chance. Yeah, Olga! Interesting, I'm game. Ready? Begin! Piggy! Piggy! Piggy! Piggy! Youngie Don! Sorry, I didn't know he was that way, Kid-On. Piggy, Piggy! Piggy! Get it right this time. Yeah, okay. Payback time, Piggy! Piggy, Piggy! Oh! Churuk! Piggy? That looked totally fake. Why are you making me put on the show anyway, Kid-On? Do you want Cow Pig to leave you alone or not? Oh! Go, Youngie Don, go! Oh! Yoo-hoo! I'm gonna lose like a champ, Kid-On! That's it. Lose like you've never lost before! Whoa! Piggy! Piggy! Oh! Piggy! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh my! So dreamy! Let's hit this, Piggy! Oh! Oh! Boom! I'm defeated, Kid-On! Blah! Wow! Pink Pig won the match! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Hmm-hmm! This win was all for you, m'lady! Oh, my! I didn't know you were so strong, Piggy! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! You guys look great together! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Oh, what's the matter, Pink Pig? Tell us what happened! Okay! It was cowpig's birthday, so I planned something special for her! Happy happy happy happy birthday! Mm? Hmm? Ooh, Yaah! I wish you a happy birthday! Happy birthday! Oh, my! Hmm, impressed, right? Oh, why? Hmm, impressed, Ray? I've never seen a pet that could dance so well! I finally met my dad, Mickey! Goski! Nooooo! Has she just left me all alone, Piggy? That's terrible! How can love be so cruel, Piggy? Don't cry! That's right! You'll always have us! Come on, we'll take you on a fun adventure! Thanks, guys! I'm very sorry! Booga booga! Catch, Bubbles! We all need a lazy day now and then. Oh, no! Oh! Ow! Ow! Professor! Can you kick the ball to us, please? Huh? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh, dear! It was a pet! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh, my word! Let's take him Gus. TARGUS! Ah! Oh! Brain, what are you doing? Let go of me! Come on! They took Professor Kyle! This is bad. Hmm. This is nice. I don't know. I feel guilty slacking off. Don't. We deserve a brain. TARGUS! TARGUS! Whoa! What's going on? Look! I didn't mean to kick him. It was an accident. This isn't just for today. Wait a minute. Then what else? Professor, are you okay? I'm fine. Just get me out of here. No problem, Professor. Hey, where's my stone reader? Lucy! I gave it to her for safekeeping. How could you forget your stone reader? Our lucky day! Our lucky day! Things happen so quickly! Our mortal enemy, Kaki Goss. The Tarsap Goss. Professor, why are they so angry? I have no idea. What was that? Huh? Mooga! Huh? Hey! Mooga! Look what we've caught! Mooga! Let Mooga go! Don't wanna! The cave is literally caving in! We're blocked in! Please, help us get out! Our friends in danger! Impossible, Goss. We could never help friends of a Kaki Goss. I don't understand why you hate Kaki so much. We despise them. Because ever since I can remember, they used us for sport. The humiliation will never be forgotten, Targus. But I didn't do that, so don't blame me! You know what? You're right, you can blame him! Are you bonkers? We have to get out of here, Pumoga! Take one for the team, Professor! Huh? Okay! Ever since I can remember, they used us for sport. The humiliation will never be forgotten, Targus. But I didn't do that, so don't blame me. You know what? You're right, you can blame him. Are you bonkers? We have to get out of here for Mooga. Take one for the team, Professor. Oh, fine. Tell me, how can I make things right with you? Apologize, Gus, from the bottom of your heart. Hmm? Where did everybody go? Wonder if something happened while I was sleeping. Oh, no! Hey-hoo, ta-ya! I'm very sorry! We're very sorry! Your apology isn't cutting it for me, Targus. Targus, Targus! Then what is it going to take for you to forgive me? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! I feel bad for the Professor. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Feel better now? Ah! My anger is lifted. Ah! Now we will help you. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! You gotta meet the same fate. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Gashu! Huh? Gashu! Gashu! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! You're all right! Ugh! Why, you little... Uh! Uh! Parsons! Light! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Whoa! Whoa! That was some awesome teamwork. It felt good, Gas. So I was thinking, you'd be perfect for our team. What? He's right! You and the Professor can be the dynamic duo! I'm in, Tygas! Wait! Don't I have a say in this? Welcome to the team! Adventure Seeking Mambo. Why are you so late? We've been waiting forever. I had a sudden emergency. I'm sorry, Mo. What's the matter? We've all been stuck here because Mambo came really late. That's not like you, Mambo. You're always on time for your route. I know. Actually, it's my son Mambo's shift today, but he's playing hooky. What? He's out in the plains, but I can't look for him until I'm done with work. Then I'll go find him for you. Really, Mo? Sure. Just leave it to me. Thanks, Mambo. Have a good day. You too. When I get my truck on you, Mambo, you'll be sorry, Mo. You fell into a trap. What's the meaning of this, Mo? Mr. Elephant has a trunk instead of hands. Give him something good to eat. He takes it with his nose. He takes it with his nose. O-o-o-ooo. O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o. Oh! I'll be sorry, Mo. You fell into a trap. What's the meaning of this, Mo? Mr. Elephant has a trunk instead of hands. If him something good to eat, he takes it with his nose. I wonder what lies beyond these planes. Whoa! We finally found you. Come with us. Your father's looking for you. Who are you? We know your father, Manmo. He asked us to bring you back. I'm not going. I'm sick and tired of working, Bo. What? I want to be free and travel the world, Bo. Then want to go on an adventure? Adventure? Yes. If you stick with me, I'll show you the world. Oh, that sounds great. Hey, you're here to help Manmo, not make things worse. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Oh! Manmo must be really angry with you, Mambo. I don't care if he is. Hold on. Those eyes. I think he's being controlled by someone. Whoa! Whoa! He's become one of our lackeys now. Not you guys again. My dad is a lackey? Woody, you'll have no chance of defeating him one on one. In that case... Come on out, my pets! With the three of us, you might get a little hurt, get on. Come on, let's go on! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! That was fast! Yeah! Way to go, Manmo! Dad! What's wrong with you? Snap out of it! Oh, no! Manmo's not himself! Stay back! Yeah! Huh? Mammo! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Uh! Oh, Mammo! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Huh? Snap out of it! Mammo's your son, remember? Whoa! Yes! That's the spirit! Keep squeezing! Hang on, Woody! Whoa! Whoa! Huh? Whoa! Whoa! Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? That's a... Huh? The power stone? Huh? Huh? What? What's going on? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Mama, watch out! Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Are you okay, Mumbo? Huh? Huh? Daddy! The power stone fell out! Consider yourself lying! Daddy! Wake up! Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? From now on, I'll work hard and be a good son! I promise! So please... Please open your eyes, Dad! Huh? You're already a good son. Huh? Daddy! You okay? Huh? Woody, I have one favor to ask. Let my son be a part of your team. What? Mambo, I know your dreams of traveling and adventure, Mumbo. I'm sorry I was so hurt on you. Daddy! Daddy! A father's unconditional love. I hope you get to see a bigger world. Son! Woody's Test! Oh, Mother! There! Tell me what happened to her! We don't know either, Chief! We found her on the ground in the square! Mother, are you feeling unwell? Don't touch me! Mother! I'm afraid I'm suffering from the dreadful disease! Ah-ah-ah, aah-a-choo! Yuck! You sneezed, wide in my face! A-acchoo! Yuck! You've sneezed right in my face! Achoo! Oh dear! Now you have it too! I'm not sick! I just sneezed! That's the first symptom. And then soon after, you're done-zo. What?! If only I had some tonic hair found deep in the forest, then I could be cured. Okay, we'll get some for you. Let's go! Ahhhh! Uh, birds are bad with viruses. Yeah! What if I catch it from you? I'm sorry! Oh, come on! Oh my! I see a light! Go get the herb now! Hurry! As soon as they hear dreadful disease, everyone freaks out! Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga! What are you doing here? You can't let me go all alone? I can always count on you! You're the bestest friend ever! Booga! Booga! Booga! The fortune teller drew me a map! So it should be easy to find! Let's see... I think we're going the right way... Wait, is this symbol a bridge? This map is just a bunch of scrum- Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga! Ow! Huh? Huh? Yikes! Booga! Booga! Oh, that stings! Booga! Oh, that stings! Go help! Yeah. They're all gone. Boy, were they angry! Ugh. Ugh. Huh? Uh? Thorns! Careful! Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... And now it's raining. Come on! Give me a break! Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... The freezing cold. You're a fire sign so water weakens you. I have to get you out of this rain. But the herb... Uh... Ow! What was that? That's... The tonic herb! Hang on, Mooga. I'll be real quick. Huh? Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Whoo! Hey, we're not giving up! Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... We did it! What's that? Whoa! Why is he attacking us? I'll summon a pet! My stone reader! Whoa! Moga! No, stop! You're not strong enough to fight! Nabbis! Watch out! Moga! Chang!!! Moga! Nabbis! Nabbit! Moga! Moga! Moga! That was fun! Fortune teller, how'd you get here? You have an iron will with physical strength, and also a caring heart for your pets. You truly deserve to be the chosen one. The chosen one? Sending you out to get me the herb was all a part of a test. A test? I'm actually a spirit oracle, concealed in this human casing. A spirit oracle? You are the chosen one. Danger is looming over the north. Protect it. There is where your true adventure will begin. The journey begins. You good-for-nothing slackers! Empty-handed again? To complete my Ultra Pet Machine, I need a Moguros. How many times do I have to tell you? I'm sorry! I want you to go out and catch one! Yes, sir! Oh, they're infuriating! When are you going to get over your obsession with these pets? Jinx? Mind your own business and make me some more Power Stones! Look here. I'm not one of your lackeys. I'm your partner, remember that. And I have a great plan. Huh? Great plan? I'll acquire something quite formidable soon. If we make a Power Stone with it, we'll control not only pets, but humans as well. Aw! Geez Louise, it's heavy! Did you pack the whole house? They're all the essentials! Remember what the Spirit Oracle said? Ah! Eeeeh! Eeeeh! Eeeeh! The Spirit Oracle? The Spirit Oracle? You, Mother? That's right. I'm only borrowing this human shell. What are you talking about, Mother? Maybe she's still sick from that disease. Ah! Go with the Chosen One. During the journey, you will find a clue to your past. My past? She was telling the truth! Oh, Great Spirit! Please tell me how I can turn back into a human! Help the Chosen One. Then your wish will be granted as well. Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait! Come back! And that's why you have to help me! Aw, life is so cruel! Woody! Huh? Is everyone packed and ready? Yes! Aw, just look at me. Isn't it obvious? Hope it's not too heavy. The place the Spirit Oracle mentioned is right here. Wow! Catan Village. You must pass through a rough desert, so please be very careful. Okay! Hiya! Booga! Booga! Booga! Hiya! Booga! Booga! Booga! I'm the Chosen One. I'm gonna save the world! Ha ha ha! Where does he get his energy? What did the Spirit see in this clown anyway? Let's go! We have to hurry! Catan, this way! Hold on! Huh? We're running low on food. We should stock up on some fruit from the forest. No prob. Just leave it to me. Yeah! Yeah! Ah, I can pick them from right here. Yeah! Whoa! Wow! I usually don't like to brag, but I was the best archer in my village. Oh, wow, really? Bubbles, I'm impressed. Ha ha ha! Do you want to see something cool? Ha ha! Yeah! Wow! That was amazing! It's nothing, really. Wow! Show me what else you can do. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmm. Well, pal, can you hit a moving target? Of course I can! Yep, yep, yep! Bullseye! You're awesome! Wataka! Let's speed it up! Ha ha ha! Are you watching, Lucy? See how skilled I am? Wow! Shouldn't we set off before the sun sets? What are those two goofballs doing right now? Oh, yeah. At tells me what's the sound? Ah! Hey, what's that sound? Ow, our pet is in great pain! Let's go, help! Ah! I can't breathe! Ha ha ha ha! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh, no! Hang on! I'll help! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! They're out! Disgusting. Thank you, Reno. You saved my life! No prob. It's my duty as a pet trainer. Judging from those arrows, I'm positive a human did this. When I find this human, he's going to be sorry! Right on! He needs to be taught a lesson! Hmm? Uh-uh! What? Uh-uh-uh! Uh-uh-uh! Hehehehe! Raaaaaah! I'll get you for this, Reno! Raaaaaah! Good job, Wataka! Raaaaaah! Oh no! Oh no! Raaaaaah! Raaaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Oh no! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Professor, do you think they can handle this mission? I don't know, but at least they're going in the right direction. Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Take. This! Raaaaah! Sandizard wants to play! Raaaaah! It took forever to find them! What are those brats doing all the way out here? Oh, it's so hot! It won't be long now. Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Because I have a fun trap set up for them! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Who are you? Raaaaah! Me? I'm Sandizard! Raaaaah! Sam? What's-ma call it? Don't think I know this one. Shoo! Go away! We have work to do! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! What this, Zard? Get that back! Raaaah! Go press the button! Don't press button, Zard! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Rrrr! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaaaah! Raaah! Raaaaah! Rrrr! Rrr... Rrr... What's this hole doing here? The desert is full of wondrous landforms you won't see anywhere else. And this hole is one of them. How interesting. Because of you I plan fails! Let's play again! I'm gonna pay! Huh? Now what these? Stop juggling them! Ah, you watch! Okay, here you go! Whoa! Huh? Huh? Did something collapse? The desert floor is quite weak, so things like that can happen from time to time. Ah! You know everything, Professor Kyle! It's common knowledge! We could've been goners! No! I'm sorry! It's bananas! Let's run away! Hold on! Why not use it to our advantage? What? Oh god! Oh god! Oh god! Oh god! Oh god! See those guys? They have something really fun to play with! Something fun? Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Something fun! Something fun! Something fun! Where is? What is that? Something fun! What is that? What is that? Something fun! Hey, give that back! No fun, Zard! No fun, Danny! No fun, Zard! Cannonball! I should've known it was you! That's right, it's us! Zandizar, go bring us that red pet! Can't let you do that! Mambo! How is it so fast? Mambo! We need fire! Moga? Moga! Moga! Moga! How does that taste? Huh? So fast-y! Huh? This dude is barn! Zaytai! Yaaay! No, don't! Yaaay! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! My stone breeder! I got it! Moga! Ah! Run! Run! Eee? What happened? Why did they all faint? At least it made our job easier. Gotcha! Zardy! Zardy! Zardy, play with me, Zardy! Stop following us! Professor Kyle, I had a really strange dream. I was having fun playing with Chan and Bob. I had the same dream! It must have been a mirage. Oh, the desert's such a magical place. Isn't it? Zardy! Zardy! Bambi, a dubious guy. Where are we now? I've lost my sense of direction. I'm sorry, Bo. I can't go on. Ah! Come on, let's keep going. M-Moga! Ah! What are you doing? Someone's trying to steal Moga! Bambi's just giving Moga some water! Bambi? It's been a while. Still a little hasty, I see. Moga! Moga! Moga! What are you doing? Someone's trying to steal Moga! Bambi's just giving Moga some water! Bambi? It's been a while. Still a little hasty, I see. Moga! We all fainted from the heat and Bambi found us. She even gave us some water. Moga! Moga! Really? Well, now that everyone's up, let's get going. Yeah! Let's go! Bambi said she'd show us the way to Catan Village. You're going with her? Oh my, so many stones. Must be heavy. Let me help. Oh, how nice of you. No thanks! Why are you butting in? Don't you see the greed in her eyes? And remember Beach Toys? I don't trust her. That's not how you treat someone who just rescued you. Oh, I'm so happy. Oh, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. How you treat someone who just rescued you. I know, but… Your scales must have improved. What? Mammo's are difficult pets to tame. He'll bring in a pretty penny. He's not for sale. I'm only kidding. Mammo? Can I have a lift too? Sure, Bo. And as a thank you, here. It looks good, Bo. I think you're a great trainer, Bambi. Really? Then, wanna be my pet? She can't be trusted. Return, Mammo! Whoa! Whoa! Ah! Ow! Hey! What's the big idea? What happened here? Huh? Woody, why won't you let us ride on Mammo? I don't want him to get exhausted and collapse again. Philly! So you want us to get tired and collapse? Let's stop here! Huh? It's the hottest time of the day now. So why don't we take a nap and save our energy? Huh? That's my stone reader. Caught you red-handed. Finally showing your true colors. Huh? Caught ya! Huh? Huh? What's going on? Get out! Ow! Have a great way! Very ungentlemanly! I'm disappointed in you. I wasn't peeping. Bambi stole my stone reader. I wanted it back. But yours is right there. Huh? What's this doing here? Remember. Oh! Really ouvert your true colors? Maybe you were going to be Eno magic? Yes, I'm in dead magic. Kim, baby. Maybe you didn't want it around me to... Which one time you threw me off? And he died off in a般 stead of these. I'm a trainer, too! Bambi is just trying to help us! Why can't you trust her, Woody? Because she's up to no good, even now! If that's how you feel, let's part ways. Katan is just past that hill. You can find it on your own, right? We don't need your help! It's better without an outsider around him, all right? He has a stubborn streak. We didn't even say a proper goodbye. Hey, guys! Now that she's gone, there's even a breeze! What kind of breeze is this strong? Look over there! Hurry! Run away! Run away, Will! I'll never be human again! Lucy, I really liked you! Is this the end? Ferticus, hurry! Yes! You saved us again, Bambi! I thought we were goners for sure! Thank you, Bambi! Of course! I'm B. Time for my beauty sleep. Good night! Hey, Bambi! Bambi! Oh? I'm sorry I didn't trust you before. And thank you. I'm actually touched. Better get some rest. We're not out of the desert yet. Bambi! I want you to know that I think you're pretty cool. Cool? Oh no! She took off with all our stones! A small price to pay for your lives, right? To win me again? Bambi! Just you wait, Bambi! I'll get you back! Nonosif's Black Magic! Kiu-kibbe! Where did you run off to? I was so worried! Kibbi-kibbi! This one was tough. I had to search the whole desert to find this little guy. You always come true. Here's your usual fate. This time, I'll just take this. Really? Had an unexpected windfall today. But next time I'm charging you double. Thank you, Junior Panty! Ow! Watch where you're going! My bad. I'm so sorry. Oh my! He's exactly my type! We should hurry. We might be late. I'm sorry for keeping you waiting. Guess he's already taken. I'm so hungry. I thought the village was just over the hill. I see something, Moga! It's Catan Village! Come on, we're almost there! Wait for me! Professor! Professor! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jeepers! This looks like something Dr. Thalys would make. Huh? Who are you, Sif? That pet is a monocent. Tell us, are you with Chan and Bob? Oh-ho! You must be that interfering trainer boy, Sif! Ah! Sif! How perfect! I've been wanting to meet you, Sif, so I could teach you a lesson to mind your own business! You're not teaching me anything! Come on out, my pet! Clopcorn! Clopcorn! Going clobberin'! No! Clopcorn! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Huh? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Clopcorn! What are you doing now? What was that? I'm over here! Oh, right! Monacefs can use black magic! He can make you hallucinate, so be extra careful! What? Hm. Let's have some fun, shall we? Ah! Ah! Ah! There! There! There! Yikes! Which one's the real one?

Seph! I have no choice! Come on now! Dorobus! Gammish! You're asking ever, Seph! You're asking ever, Seph! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! You can strike all you want, Seph! But I'll just keep picking more scarecrows! Huh? Huh? Huh? They got away, Seph! Hurry, Professor Kyle! Lucy needs to get treatment! I'm well aware of that! Please save Lucy! Cat-tan spiritual healer! Run away, Lucy! Huh? No! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy is awake! Really? Uh... Lucy is awake! Really? Uh... Lucy is awake! Oh no! Ah! Ah! Lucy! Lucy is awake! Really? Uh... Lucy is awake! Really? Uh... Where am I? I was really worried! What on earth happened to me? You were out cold, so we found a healer for you! Are you feeling better now, Lucy? Yes, but I had a very strange dream. Dream? I was being chased by someone, and it felt like it was really happening! Because it probably did! Huh? This is the healer who helped you! I'm Xena, and I know about your condition. During the healing process, I think some of your memory came back to me. That's great! Then you can help her get all her memory back! It doesn't work that way. It was purely by chance this time. It's not within my powers. Oh, I see. It's okay. Remember, we're here to protect Cuttown Village. She's right! I bet Monasif and Thalys' goons are already here! Take us to your chief! We must warn him right away! Ha ha ha! Are you serious? I am, sir. I ask permission to marry your daughter. Ha ha ha! Of course! With my blessings! The least I can do for our hero! Uh, Daddy! My eyes been on you ever since you saved my daughter from that wild pet! And you, sir, deserve to join my family! I am truly honored. Now, come with me! I want to show you something very special! Oh my! This is the Great Spirit Stone. It has protected our village for a long time. Whoa! It's beautiful! Ah! You must not touch it! Ah! Ah! Ah! Look out of it! The Spirit Stone's too powerful for a human! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! It's finally mine! Ah! What's going on? Ah! Pretending? What do you mean? Gah! Ah! Try and keep up, will you? Hey, you shameless thief! Uh! Daddy! No, no. The thief isn't me. The first one you see when you wake up. That's the real thief. Ah! Ah! Ah! We're here to see the chief. Oh, it's you, Zina. Go ahead. Hello, Chief! Are you home? Huh? Ah! Ah! Chief! Ah! What happened to you? Please try and wake up! Ah! Ah! Ah! Are you alright? Why, you thieves! Ah! Ah! Come guards, hurry! Yes, chief, sir! No, we're not thieves! Hold on. Look at their eyes. They're not normal. What? Take these thieves and imprison them! Sir! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Why are they attacking us? There's no reasoning with them. We have to get out of here. Just leave it to me. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! After them! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! But why are those guys chasing after us? The jeep and daughter were being controlled. That means Dallas' goons were here before us. Huh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Uh! Ah! Ah! Oh! Ah! I am too old for this! Ah! Ah! Woody, let's split up! Okay! Oh! White punks! What's on my head? Yuck! Freeze yourselves! Ah! Woody! I think we've lost them! Over here! I'm sorry! Booga! Gotcha, little fish! Let go of him! Booga! Let's go! Woody! Run away! Hurry! No, Booga! If we get caught too, it's over! Get out of here! Hurry! We'll come back for you, I promise! Stop this! Booga! Catan in Crisis! Hello, Jinx! Did you succeed? Of course! What a relief! Thought you might have some trouble! Trouble? I had a run-in with that trainer, but he got away! Ah! The young boy! Perfect timing! I wanted to test my powers anyway! Let's kill two birds with one stone! Hiya! Ah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! It's a market! It's a market! Wow! It's a market! Wow! That wowsy cat almost made a star of fresh meat! Huh? Fresh delicious! I'm not going to eat! I'm not going to eat! I'm not going to eat! I'm not going to eat! Huh? YUM! YUM! YUM! Welcome, sir! Here's a chance! I'm not going to eat! Ah! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh, my pants. Oh? Oh, my patient. Finally, some food! Yeah, this is gonna be good. Stop me! Stop me! We've been caught! Oh, no! We have no choice. Let's fight! They weren't after us. How fast are you, Professor? This is as fast as I go! What's wrong with them? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! He's blocking my way! What do we do? Huh? We're done for! Whoa! Huh? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Huh? Ah! Ah! Gosh! Gosh! That's Ferticus! Then that means... I saved you again! Really? Here to steal more stones, you nasty thief! Hm. Is this how you greet someone who's rescued you twice? You've got some nerve! Know what we went through in the desert because of you? Huh? Cigabit! What's wrong? Are you sick? Cigabit! You okay? Trainer Bambi! Please don't hurt my pet! I'll try not to, but your pet's not normal now! Watch out! I have no choice! Raggo! Wait! Huh? What? Let me try to calm it down! You'll get hurt! Stay away! Now, be a good pet! Yes! Huh? Cigabit! Cigabit! Cigabit! Cigabit! Cigabit! Cigabit! Cigabit! Cigabit! Cigabit! Cigabit! Cigabit! Cigabit! Cigabit! Cigabit! It's back to normal again! Uh-huh! So, you're a healer! Yes! You've got some skills! Why are the pets acting weird? There's something off with their eyes! They must be under some kind of powerful spell! Smells like Phallus' goons! I'm afraid so! But Chen and Bob aren't capable of this! So that means they must have a sorcerer! Huh? Cigabit! Cigabit! Cigabit! The pets are going bonkers! The villagers are in danger! We help detain the pets! Let's go! Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! The pets and catan are loca! Whoa! Whoa! Let me out! I'm not a thief! Settle down, boy, and be quiet! Be quiet. But I'm telling the truth! Huh? Huh? Hey, we have a problem. We need backup. What? What about me? Problem? Wonder what's going on. Don't come any closer. Huh? What in the world? It's not safe. We must go! This way. Just as I hoped. My work here is done. The Jake's way! The Tigger's with you! Those knuckleheads! Soon the whole of Tectonica will be all mine. Defending Catan Part 1 You okay? Yes, thank you! Go find a safe place to hide. Okay! Bambi! Huh? We're getting outnumbered! There are wild pets from outside the village too! We need backup! Where's that boy trainer? Woody's locked up inside the Chief's house! Where's the Chief's house? Over that way! This might be tough. I'll open a path for you, but I need you to help. When you see a way through, do whatever it takes to get your trainer out. Boda! Boda! We're saving this guy for some major coin. Oh, well. Come on out, my pet! Caliger! Wow! How bad! Go now! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! Come in! Moga! Come in! Moga! Moga! Moga! Oh! Hurry, Moga! Moga! Moga! Hey! You're a pony to speed! Moga! You're a pony to speed! John- You're a pony to speed! Ho! What in the world is going on out there? What in the world is going on out there? Huh? Huh? Moga! Moga! Am I glad to see you? Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! What is it? Moga! Whoa! He's gone hog wild. Moga! Moga! Moga! Many pets are being controlled. Moga! Moga! Our friends are in great danger! But first we have to dance with the devil. Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! Come on out! My pets! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! This is bad. Everyone is running low on energy. Come on! Stay still! What's wrong? I think I overexerted myself. I'm losing my strength. Watch out! What? No! Yes! Gorr! Flap Gorr? Won't let you get hurt again, Gorr. Then that means... Please! Woohoo! Luddhi's finally here! I'm so happy! Ready? Let's go! Get on! Booga! Favis! Get on! Get on! Get on! Get on! Get on! Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga! Sorry I took a while. More like forever. If you were any later, we'd be goners. Easy. I still haven't forgotten you stole my stones. Warnie! I'm glad you're okay. It looks like we knocked out most of them. Huh? Bye! Bye! What is that? That's... Bln! Yeah. Defending Cat Head, Part 2. That's our speed-o. It's pretty big. Pretty big? It's dinormous. But we can't back down. Attack full force. Get on! Yeah, bitch! What can't do that? This... rabbit! Return! All of you! That was close. We're not bad for him. He's too strong. What do we do? Summon another pet. Woody! Mooga! Mooga! Mooga! Move! Run, Mooga! Run! Mooga! Mooga! Moga! Moga! Moga? Moga! Woody, watch out! Hey, that's enough! You overgrown lizards! Brat! Drats, we won't last much longer like this! Hey, boy trainer! Fight or flight, just hurry and choose one! Moga, open your eyes! Moga, I'm sorry I couldn't keep you safe. You safe? A terrible trainer! No, you're not, Woody! You're the trainer that was chosen by the spirits! Chosen by the spirits? Hm. It's not medicine? That's right! It's XP Herb, a plant with mystical powers. It will come in hand in a crisis. Mystical XP Herb! In Night Hell! Moga, have some of this! Moga, have some of this! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Moga, can't! Kaaah! Kaaah! So this is how it ends. I don't want to say goodbye looking like this! Moga! Moga! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Kaaah! Whoa! Incredible! Haaa! Haa! Kaaaah! Haa! Haa! Haa! Oh no! Oh no! Aaaa! Ah! He's doing this without any firies! I can't believe it! The XP herb, is this strong? Molga! Molga, you're finally awake! Oh, I'm so glad. I'm sorry. I wanted to heal him. But I had no strength. I'm grateful. Thanks to you, my villagers are all safe. That's good. But Cat-Tan's destroyed. This is all my fault. So the Spirit Stone was stolen by a sorcerer? Yes. I had no idea he could be this evil. To control so many pets at once, he must be extremely skilled. If a guy like that works with Dr. Thad... That means we're in trouble. Because now that he has one Spirit Stone, he'll power through other villages to steal them all. If that's true, Shamgear's in danger. That's right. And the rogue got a head start. Okay. Back to Shamgear. Right. The village that needs protection now is ours. I'm the chosen one. What? Cat-Tan's Spirit Stone has put a spell on the pets? Yes. Bellis and his goons will be after our Spirit Stone too. I'm not sure if we'll be enough to protect the village. Huh? There's a talented trainer at the arena today. Why don't you recruit him for more support? At the arena? Hmm. Wow! It's so much better! Wow! He's amazing! He definitely has the skills to help us. I can do that in my sleep. Hurry, before you leave! Hey, wait for me! Wanna party to celebrate my win? Yeah! Young man! Are you trainer Biff? Fans can be so tiresome. Come on! There! What are you doing? We're not here for your autograph. We're here to ask you to join our team. Join you? Why would I? We need you to help protect the village. Shamgar's in great danger! I'm sorry, but why should I care? Let him go! Because I can protect Shamgar on my own! That little punk's a trainer! What? Little punk? I was chosen by the spirits! I doubt that. Wanna battle it out? A battle? That's right! If I win, you're gonna join our team! Huh? Huh. And what if I win? Uh, if you win? How about this? If I win, you have to be my servant! Deal! Woody! Fine! See you tomorrow at the arena! Let's party! We want him to fight with us, not against us! Plus, the pets are still healing! Don't worry! Most of them are in good shape! What? The arena? Yeah! We're battling tomorrow! Only the strongest pets compete there! Why do we have to fight, Ski? I made an important bet! A bet? You shouldn't make battle pets without asking us! I'm scared, Choo-Choo! Don't worry! Cause I have a great plan! Not doing it, Thoim! My mouth, Choo-Choo! Hey, wait! Come on, guys! Hide pets! You're on your own! Hey! Fine! Forget it! I can just recruit a whole new team! Hmph! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Hi there! You can have this, if you'd be my pet! Grr! Grr! I've got a craving for something more human! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! Grr! My favorite! Thank you, Ski. You're the best, Julia. I was only doing what Woody asked. Woody? Yep, he had to go out. So he asked me to feed you guys. Well, enjoy the food. Oh, Ski. You know what? Woody always makes sure to take care of us. You're right. Woody's my first ever true friend. He's never teased me not once. Does this mean... Woody! I want it spotless. Yes, sir, I'll make it sparkle! No way! Woody! We were looking for you. Me? Whatever for. We've all agreed to fight for you in the battle, boys. Huh? Really? Yes, Woody. Even though we're weaklings. You're not weaklings! If we work on your individual strengths, I know we can win! Woody! Besides, I have a great plan up my sleeve. Now, ready to go, Train? Ready! Hehehe! Hehehe! Hehehehe! Hehehe! Battle at the Arena! Hehehe... Hey Biff. Shouldn't we prep for tomorrow's battle? Huh? Whatever for? Victory's in the bag! But Biff, this time we're battling the spirit's chosen one! Huh, whatever for? Victory's in the bag. But Biff, this time we're battling the spirit's chosen one. Makes no difference. Hi, Biff. Oh, hey, ladies. Relax, let your fur down. Where's Biff? Did you get through to him? No, I'm afraid not. Looks like Biff has lost his drive as a trainer. Oh, you're right. I don't know what happened. I've been certain days of training and cheap spirit, Nobo. The battle's about to start. What a pathetic bunch. Let's end this quickly. They're all yours, Nobo. Nobo! Yikes! Come on, any volunteers? I'm not going out there. To me, they're skiing. I'm too scared, Chuchu. Oh, come back! Oh, that's weird. They were so confident a minute ago. What's the deal, Wingo? You're on your own, Thor. What? Why, you coward? Looks like I've been shell-shopped off. Then you're going fast! He got two down with one throw, Chuchu. It was just pure luck. Oh, Chucky! You're good fortune on tier, Chucky! Because now you have to deal with us. Huh? Sleep bubbles? Give no meaning to you snooze, you lose! Ha ha ha! Huh? These are way too slow to hit me! Huh? What's going on? Get away from me! Ha ha ha! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh! Yeah! Ta-ta! Can't run away from me! Our plan worked! Good game! Acting scared was all applied! Very smart strategy! Those little... Jajako, show them your strength! Go! Huh! Jako! Wataka! He needs a nap, too! Ta-ta! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Oh no! Now it's just you and me, Jako. Oh, Joutu, it's your Q! Ha! That one flew the coop, remember? Ko! Roar! Roar! Oh! Jajako, behind you! Huh? No matter how strong, no one can withstand a goosing! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Whether a pet's weak or strong, it doesn't matter. You all have strikes, so let's put him to use. We must keep Mui awake till the battle. Kaa! Stay awake, Kaa! That way, he'll sleep through the noise at the arena. Kukoski's flexibility, plus Beach Choice's hard shell makes a great combo. Master of Disguise Ota-2 will hide out, then attack after my Q. Come on, let's show him that we're no weaklings! Hmm, practice and training make a pet strong. It's my duty as a trainer. It's a trainer's duty? Hope you keep your word and join my team. Of course, a promise is a promise. But first, I need a sec. Huh? Look, guys, I'm really sorry. I was too arrogant. I think I forgot how to be a good trainer. We're glad you're back. It's good to see our old Biff again. My friends. All right, let's go train like the good old days. Let's go, Yuba! Woody, give me a little more time. I swear, I'll come back even stronger. You got it. It'll be worth the wait. Kyle's special training. Okay, how about we start training? Booga booga! We're ready to go on! You'll have to work hard to beat Thalus and his goons. Oh, why aren't you training too, Kyle? Yeah, Cor, when you need it the most. What? Remember, the professor used to be human. But now he's a pet guan. The nerve! How dare you call me a pet! I'm offended! Professor Kyle! How humiliating! Now that I look like a pet, they want me to train like one too! Watch where you're going, you clowns! Eh? What did you say, Kidan? Kidan? I'm not a pet! I'm not a pet! I'm not a pet! I'm not a pet! I'm not a pet! I'm not a pet! I'm not a pet! I'm not a pet! I'm not a pet! I'm not a pet! I'm not a pet! I'm not a pet! I'm a pet! Oh my god! Eh? What did you say, Kidan? Ah! Er… If you bump into someone, you should say sorry! You talk too much... But I like your necktie and shoes! Give them to me...go! Not in a million years! Ah! Ah! Eh! Here! Here you go! Thanks, buddy! Have a nice day, goodbye! Oh... I'm so pathetic! You look good! Huh? You look funny, toy! You're the weirdest looking pet I've ever seen! I won't be laughed at by you whippersnappers! I'll teach you a lesson! Come on, dance with more energy! Alright, I'll try! Oh, children! Molly! We're coming! Dance for us again next time! Thank goodness! Why? Why? Why? Why? Professor! I look for you everywhere! Oh, Woody! I can't go on being so weak and afraid! Please train me to become stronger! What? Okay, I will. Are you ready? I'm as ready as I'll ever be! The training you'll focus on is fart bombs! What? Fart bombs? How will farting help me defend myself? Here, a fiery! Huh? What's this for? Just trust me and eat it! Hmm, alright! Oh my! Ow! It stings! My eyes are watering! I knew it! If you eat fireys then your farts come out spicy! Booga! Booga! This is lethal enough to be a weapon! However, it won't work if my targets moving or standing far away! I've thought about that already! By working out your glutes, you'll be able to fart at your command! Booga! Booga! You've completed your training! I'm grateful for your help! No problem! Well, must be off! Where are you going? I'm going to test out my new found skill! Booga! Booga! Gas supply recharged! Huh? The Rude Rock Toys is! I'll show them! Huh? Let him go, please! Sorry, no can do! We came to scout the area and got some pets to boot! What do I do? Those bots need to be taught a lesson! Hey baboons! Leave those pets alone! Huh? Look, it's Birdman! Or what, you big chicken! Or you'll regret it! Is he going to twerk or something? You're gonna paint! You're gonna paint! Huh? Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! You're gonna paint! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Take this! Ha! Ha! Ha! Wow! Thanks for saving us, Toys! We're sure you're a Rupi boy! We didn't know you were so cool and strong, Toys! I was pretending to be weak so as not to scare you! Hmm. Hand over my things if you know what's good for you! You understand what this bozo's saying! Huh? You leave me no choice! Huh? Yeah! Uh, I forgot to recharge my gas supply! What's the deal? Wait, hold on! I need to eat some food first! We're not waiting for nothing to- Ah! Ah! Not again! When needs to be eaten! Thank you! SheTime's not on the horizon! Same again... What's the meaning of that? Stay slow, will ya? It looks good on you. You think some silly headpiece will make me obedient? Of course not. But this will. With this, you'll be quite passive. Now you're our dutiful Poppins. You're going to the river? Yes, I'm hoping it'll jog my memory. You should go. On your last try, you got diverted. I'll go with you, Lucy. What? You really don't have to. Don't be silly. It's not safe out there. Oh, Lucy's right. That's why I'll go with Lucy Gore. No way! I'll protect Lucy on my own! A little pipsqueak like you? Pipsqueak? You can't even protect yourself. I wanted to come on my own. Are you alright? Who is this man? Lucy? Thought you might be hungry, so I picked these. Me too! Hey! Those are too sour! Joke's on you! Because Lucy loves dangy fruit! And I was just about to remember. Wait for us! Wait for us! Well, Lucy? Do you remember anything? Not a thing. Who goes there? Lucy, stay back! Out of my way! I'll protect Lucy Gore! As if! I'll protect her! I'll protect Lucy Gore! What's that sound? Stop getting distracted and focus! Did you hear that? Guess it was nothing. False alarm! What are you doing down there? Are you still cold? This is all your fault! What? You're the one who pushed her! Because you, Captain, are fearing Gore! So you're not gonna own up to her? Own up to what? It was the... What? We must hurry, Lucy! Did that really happen? Stop being a nuisance and go back home! That's what I should say to you! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! We're okay! Did you see? I saved Lucy Gore! That's it! I have enough! Oh! Huh? Instead of helping, you're only getting in my way! Just go home! Lucy! Wait! I came all the way here and haven't remembered anything! I told you to go home! Who are you? I'm Golden! And everything that sparkles belongs to me gone! Including that bubble around your neck gone! You can't have this! Really? Then I'll take it by force! Ugh, Lucy was really angry. It's all because of you! Don't blame me! You're the one that woke up the bees! You don't wanna make me angry! Please, I'm not scared of you! Gorn! Get off Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Give me my shiny treasure gone! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! It's finally stopped! Bubbles! Bubbles! You came to my rescue! Thank you! Yeah! You can always count on us! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! Gorn! The spear! It's so familiar! Go on ahead! This spear will keep you safe! Why do I feel so sad? Sham gear gets invaded! Good job, Hawkein! You've gotten stronger! It's all thanks to your training! A pet in distress! Kathy! Is that a- In the name of the trainer, I claim you as my pet! A pet trainer? As talented as ever! Now, Sham gear's spirit stone is as good as ours! Would he say that? I don't know what it's going on! You're not going to be a pet! No, I don't know what it's going on! I don't know what it's going on! Now, Sham gear's spirit stone is as good as ours! Would he say that? I'm not going to be a pet! I'm not going to be a pet trainer! Now Shamgear's spirit stone is as good as ours! Woody said the village was in danger. I can't wait to see that boy's face when we snatched the baby Mawgoros from him! Hey! You want to invade? You'll have to pass through us! Now who are you? Only fools rush in. Come on! Let's go show off our training! We were all about to be slayed by Spino when Mawga breathed a huge ball of fire and we beat him! Wow! Elia, now don't forget to mention me! Why, you didn't do anything! How dare you! I've done plenty! The Book of History chronicles just the broad historical facts, so I can't record every small detail. Yes, I know that! But jotting down my name once wouldn't hurt, would it? What kind of writing is this? I can't read it! Only dinosaur scholars know these characters. There are many important secrets in the book. To protect them, we use this special system of writing. We need help, Kee! It's Biff! What's going on? What's going on around here? You scoundrels! Oh no! If you don't want to end up like him, then give us your spirit stone! May a thousand hexes fall on you! I would never give it to you! Not in a million years! Calm down, it's not helpful to get so upset at your age. That's enough! I'll go! Rudy! Biff! You okay? Those rogues won't be easy to beat. It's a boy wonder! I'll handle things here. Get to a safe place! Wait! Come along, Mother! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! It's that pet, Monasif from Catan. Then next to him must be the sorcerer. But who's that other man? After what they did to Biff, I'll make them pay! Coming out, my pets! Get off! Abyss! Mambo! They want to play? Then let's play. Come on out, my pets! Mambo! He's a trainer? What's worse is he's working with those goons! I'll show you how powerless you are. The gate's on! Attack! Mambo! Ramgas! Mambo! Get on! Get on! Get on! Get on! Hey, come on! Why not? You fighting back! Watch out! Get on! Ramis! How did it dodge that? Jorvis! Sonic boom attack! Ha! Go-hee-hee! Dammit! Oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh! No! Oh! Not so tough, huh? Smash him to pieces! I'll be! Booga! Ha ha ha! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Not so tough, huh? Smash him to pieces! Hopi! Booga! Whoa! Whoa! Booga! Nice headbutt! Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga! Booga!

He's a seasoned trainer who knows every pet's weakness. That man is a force to be reckoned with. Woody fights back. Lucy, what's wrong? Why so sad? I don't know what it's like. I can't remember, but my heart can still fail. What? I don't think I follow. This spear must be important to me. Is that all you've got? Will Moga be alright? Once he gets dry, he should be fine. Right now, he needs to rest. Admit defeat and surrender. Give us the pet and the spirit stone and we'll go. We're not giving up, Gion. We'll fight to the end. Boom. GAMBIS! You're only prolonging the inevitable. He's infuriating, but he's right. That trainer is on another level. There has to be a way. Hey, Dodo. There is a way and you know it well. Have you forgotten our battle already? Battle? That's it. Come on out, my pets. Gusky. Ha! Huh? Ha ha ha ha! Look at them! Woody, I hope you have a good plan. Don't I always? Huh? You're in it too. I need your fart box. Huh? Sheesh. Ha. Smells like desperation. Take them out! T-near. Ah! Ah! Kouki! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! C-Cubbie! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Tch. Now they're tag teaming. Ah! Koukowsky, you're up! Koukowsky! Koukowsky! Koukowsky! Professor, go get them! Ah! Gah! Gah! Pup your noses! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! We did it! Gah! This wasn't supposed to happen, right? Ha! Without us, they'd be Gunners.com! Do they know we're their secret weapon-ski? This weapon's called Dice! Ha! Heh heh! Heh heh! Why that little punk? Yeah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Three down and one to go! Yang-Gi-Dan! Just leave it to make it on! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! It's a dummy! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! This is... It's Monasif's black magic! Yeah! Not again, Kiron! You annoying yellow clowns! Oh! Oh! Agua! Gah! I have to be careful, or I might hurt my own team member! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! What's going on? That pet is... Gah! Gah! Did you miss me, Master? Uba? Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Uba! What are you doing here? Master! Look what I have! I've finally become a trainer too! Wow, for real? Gah! And I owe it all to you! Congrats! And you teamed up with Varipu! Gah! Gah! Yup! He's my first pet. Hey Trotterbols! Must I remind you we're in a big fight? Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! I can help you now, chef! Uba, careful! It's an illusion! Don't worry, master. Verpoo, let's go hunting! The clones are gone! Verpoo can sniff you out so your silly tricks won't work! Is that a challenge, Sif? Enough, Monosif. No need to waste our strength. That's what we have him for. Bacala, cause we're only getting stuck. Trainer of Darkness! Come on out, my pets! How did he claim such big ferocious pets? Bout, Falkion and Prakis? Uba, hurry, summon your pets. Let's crush them together. I would, but I have only Verpoo. What? I haven't been a trainer that long, but I'll claim more soon. We need them now! Here he comes! Whoa! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Guys! Where did that sound come from? From the village! Oh, no! Oh, no. Ha-ha! Ah! Ah! Oh, no! Uh... Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Where did that sound come from? From the village! Oh no! Get on! What's going on? This is terrible! Come on, let's go help them! What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What are you doing, Clogor? Put us down! You two stay here, Gorr. Absolutely not! I have to go and help our friends! I can't let you, it's too dangerous! But Clogor... No matter what, you must protect Lucy! Okay! I trust you! Wait, Clogor! No, Lucy! Lucy! I couldn't bear it if something bad happened to you! I'm begging you, please stay here with me! Oh, Bubbles... Bubbles! Hi! Ow! Whoa, hole, ku!

Sorry, I tried my best. But I couldn't just watch while my friends got clobbered. I may have no pets, but I'm still gonna fight! You two? Alright, let's give them all we got. They actually think they have a chance! What are you waiting for? Grab the pet and let's go! Careful! Stay back! Oh, Lucy. Did he say your name? Return, pet! Huh? What are you doing right now? He's retreating. Why? How's she? Have you lost it? Go back and get the riot! Oh, huh,委! Tsk! Tsk! Why is he attacking its own sight? You don't... You don't deserve to be forgiven! Zip! Great James, you all right, Zip? Master, here's our chance. Okay! For now, let's bail! Holy smokes! I can't see a thing! Hey, where did they go? Why did Lucy have to turn up? That was dangerous! Who knew Thalyss' goods would have such a powerful asset? But why did that trainer flip on his crew? I know why! My awesome archery skills scared him and set him off! Am I right? Are you joking or just delusional? I'm serious! As soon as I came, the goons fled! Dish, Dish, this isn't the time for such nonsense! We were very lucky today, but things are going to get worse. Because knowing what we know, no village is safe now. You're right, sir. We have to do something. Let me go. I'll warn the villages. What? You're in no state to go. I'll go instead. Ha! You can't! Hey! Uba? Master must protect Shamgar, so I'll go with Biffy! Hey, put me down! And who are you calling Biffy? Why I'm calling you Biffy? Cause that's your name! What? No it's not! Be safe, we're counting on you! Leave it to us! My name's not Biffy! Come on! Let me down! That man, the trainer... He... He knew who I was! Hurry Lucy! Go! He had a scar. It seems so familiar to me. Who did that man be? What? Lucy's with them? Yes. That's why I think he fell out of his tracks. Why, you knuckleheads! You didn't recognise her all this time! Yes! We had no idea that goes Lucy! Yeah! We weren't there when you kidnapped them, remember? Tch! With Lucy around, our new puppet is utterly useless! What do we do now? The baby Mogoroz has gotten strong too! Why! Why is he the last piece of the puzzle that will complete my построaman? Huh. But what if there's another way? There's another way. There is no other way. He's the only baby Mogoros left. Catching an adult's impossible. No, no. Not make one. Wake one. A real Goros. A real Goros? Goros' only exist in Legends. Just wait and see. I'm working on something very interesting. Hmm. Ah. Finding Elia. All done. You picked a lot today, Kubo. We have a lot of pets that need treatment. Kubo! She should be back by now. Professor! Professor! Hey, Woody. How are my pets doing? They'll be good as new soon. Anyway, glad you're here. Come with me to the forest. Huh? What for? Elia went to go pick herbs. But she's been gone too long. Elia! Kubo! Don't worry, Professor. But I can't help but worry. Elia is like family to me. I've known her ever since she lost her parents in an accident. She lost her parents? She did. It happened when she was a child. I had no idea. To get the herbs, she had to use this ladder. It's broken. What do we do? I'll go down and take a look. Oh. Where are you? Where are you? Oh. Oh. Wait. That's Elia's sandal. Yeah. Baron. Where did you get that sandal? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? I've been starving all day. You'll make a tasty meal. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Hey! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Aah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Yeah. That was too close for comfort. Ah! Ah! Why did you catch it? What happened to all your clothes, Professor? They just fell. What do you think I made that rope with? That sandal was definitely Elia's. It was. And I'm sure Varen knows what happened. Get away! Do you have to wear that get-up? Yes! Unless you want to go find my clothes for me! This will haunt me forever. Ew, what is this? Yuck, it smells! Ew, gross! What are you doing? It's Varen Drew, which means the pet must be nearby. Must be nearby? The bush! Fess up! Where's Elia? Come on, tell me! Beauty, you're being too hard on Varen. Varen, do you know the owner of that shoe? Varen! Tell me, did she have long, straight hair? Varen! That's her! Then do you know where she is now? What? Is she in your stomach now? Not again! Don't lose her, Woody! Stop right there! Where did she go? A light! Elia! What? What? Woody? Am I glad to see you! I thought you got eaten by Varen! Eaten by Varen? She didn't eat me, she saved me! Kubo! Ah! Kubo! While picking herbs, we got attacked by Renatius. But just then, Varen saved us! Varen? Oh, Kubo! Oh, Kubo! However, Kubo was too hurt to go home, so we found a safe place to recuperate. Varen even found my lost sandal for me. So that's what happened. I'm really sorry, Varen. Woody! Where are you? I'm in here! And I found Elia! Really? Elia! Where are your clothes, Professor? I can explain everything, Elia. Would you cover yourself up? This is all your fault, Woody! Please! Uh, thank you for finding me. Yangidon's rival. Why are we in the forest, Goa? To find another strong pet. We must be ready in case those goons attack. I don't think we'll find a strong pet here, Gor. He's right. He's wrong. There's one I've had my eye on for a while now. Who's that, Gidon? Veldor. Whoa! No way! You can't! Veldor's a terrible choice! Why? He's not a team player, and he has a bad temper. Plus his teeth are unnecessarily big for his mouth! You're talking about me! Wow! It's Veldor in the flesh! You're pathetic! Just losing to me tamed you into a household pet! G-g-g-g! I never lost to you! We battled, and I wiped the floor with your scales. Don't you remember doing that? Let me explain! Wow! That means you're super strong! Veldor, will you join our team? Not interested. I'm not a huge fan of trainers, and I don't want a team of the crybabies. You actually cried? Hey! Hey! This time you'll cry! You'll learn not to mess with me! You'll learn not to mess with me! Whoa! He's fast, go on! Whoa! He's fast, go on! Yeah! Yeah! Ha! You've upped your game! A little! But you're still not! For me, Dorm! Dine! Dine! Ha! You're weak before, and you're still weak now! You okay, Yungidon? I'm totally fine. I felt bad. Went easy on him. Yungidon, your nose... Blood! Huh? Yungidon! You'll pay for this! Get on! Yungidon! You'll pay for this! Get on! Yungidon! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Yungidon! Yungidon! Yungidon! Where... where am I, Kidon? Oh! Feldor! Heee! Let's finish this once and for all! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! What's wrong? Did you get hurt? Chee... Oh! Oh! Oh! This doesn't change things! As soon as the rain stops, I'm out! Like I can! Oh! dude! Don't wait! We're like I'm out! It is matted him because you need to wake up to eat. Oh! Makes it touch! Oh! Wow journey! You wait! We're leaving, maybe you've down to me! Huh! Oh! Oh! I was about to take a long time… What happened, Kid-On? Hold on! Don't waste your strength. It's over for us anyway. No, it isn't. I know my mentor will come and rescue me. Mentor? Oh, that boy trainer. I wouldn't hold my breath. You're just another pet to him. You talk too much. You know that? Why are you helping me? I thought I was your enemy. You still are, Kid-On. So tell me, why? Because that's what my mentor wants. What? Look, Veldor. Our team needs a strong pet like you. Hmm. Well, whatever. It's not like we're getting out. Pink-Pig? Huh? Oh, I found them. There he is. Really? Mentor! Yonkidon, are you alright? I'm great, Kid-On. And Veldor's here too. Sit tight. We'll get you out of there. Yeah? I can't believe he really came. Klopgor, move this big one first. Klopgor. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yonkidon! Oh, Mentor! Ha, ha, ha. Thanks, everyone. No need for thanks. That's what teammates are for, Gold. I'm glad you're both okay, Pink. It's cause of our great teamwork. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Well, Veldor, what do you think of our team now? Ha, ha, ha. Good job. Maybe you've had a change of heart? Ha, ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. A chance encounter. Thalus' goons beat us to the punch again. I know. If we'd gotten there a little sooner, we could have stopped them. At this rate, they'll steal the Spirit Stones from all the villages. That won't happen. We'll save the next one. Where's this wind coming from? Oh, it's a twister. Oh, my God. It's coming this way. I won't let it suck me in. No! Are you okay, Uba? Watch your hands. I didn't mean, I mean... You wealthy thief. How dare you read my phone? I didn't know it belonged to you. Uh, Uba? Huh? Who are you? What do you want? Oh, so you're Woody's teammates. I'm sorry about before. No sweat. Told you I wasn't a weirdo. I heard about you in Catan. So what you doing out here? Same as you. Warning people of Thalus' goons. But then we got caught in that sandstorm. Looks like we're in the same boat. Have you made it to a village yet? Yes. However... We were too late. They'd already invaded. How many villages have the goons gone through? I'm sure there's still a few unharmed. You're right. So let's not waste any more time. Might as well stick together, since we're on the same mission. Sounds good. It would be our pleasure to escort you ladies through the desert. Catan! Catan! Catan! Oh, oh. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Rock, paper, scissors! Oh. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Oh. Oh. That. How much farther do we have left? We're not even close. Ugh. I'm too hungry to go on. Ready, ready, ready! Yahoo! Play with me! Huh? You scared us! Let's play! Let's play, Sarty! Play? We don't have time, so scram! Please play, please play, please play, Sarty! That's enough! Wait a minute. I think it's acting odd because it's sick. Here. I'll try and heal you. Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Looks fun, Sarty! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Huh? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! I mean it. That's enough. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Huh? Huh? It's going absurd. Come on out, my pet! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Oh! Ah! So fun, Sarty! Hey! I'm Uba. Sart? Who are you? Santezard! Play with me, Sante! We're much too hungry to play with you now. Sart? Hungry, Sante! Yum yum yum, Sante! What? There's real food? Follow Santezard! Okay! Uba! We can't follow that pet! A pet that wacky is untrustworthy! To my knowledge, pets don't lie. It's people that like to lie. It's people that like to lie. I'm not sure what you're doing. I'm not sure what you're doing. I'm not sure what you're doing. I can't imagine there'd be any food here. Yum yum yum yum yum yum! Everything's rotten! We can't eat that! Huh? No eat, Santezard! Yum yum yum yum yum! Gross! Nummy Santez! Tummyowie! Nummy Santez! That's what I thought. Bright Side, if it found that food, it means there are people nearby. Oh! What's that? Huh? It's... a mechanical hand. Where did it come from? Hey guys, there's a path! Biffy, look! Is that... Dr. Thallis' letter? Dr. Thallis strikes! I wonder how Biff and Uba are doing. Me too. It's been a while since they left. Their safety of the other villages are in their hands. All we can do is wait. Let's hope they return unharmed. Tab! Bob! And is that man... Yes, that man is Dr. Thallis. We finally meet. That catty! I think it's a machine! Unbelievable! How in the world did he make that? You wanna know? The strength of the spirit stones enabled me to complete my project. Don't tell me you stole again from another village! Bingo! I've conquered every village in the continent. Except for one. Shamgir village. How is that even possible? He won't get away with this! Come on out, my pets! Get on! Valdor! Well, khaki bot, it's time they bow down to my greatness! Sharm! Look sharp, cause things just got real good on! Just try and keep up, Valdor! Get on! Get on! Get on! Get on! Super fast! Valdor! Yaki bot! Moga! Moga! Moga! Moga! Ha! You call that fire? You're gonna pay, Kidon! Watch out! Watch out! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh! Valdor! Yaki bot! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! You're gonna pay, Kidon! Ah! Ah! Watch out! That is close. Great little fire! That's an explosive skill. Now do you see just how awesome machines are? Fire blast threw me off. Its speed and its skill make it hard to defeat it. There must be a way to trip it up somehow. That's it! Now which critter should I take care of first? Oi! Dr. Creepy! What? Did you call me Creepy? Look around, you're the only creep. I'm so wanky, I have no friends. Is that why you play with machines? How dare you! Exterminate him now! That's it! Come this way! Oh no! Hurry, get up! Don't move! Now, Veldor! Excellent! No more explosive farts from you! What do we do, Doctor? What do you think? We make a run for it! Oh! Hey, they're trying to flee! Mathurveye! Go get him! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh great spirits! Please keep Shamgear safe from harm! Mother! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh great spirits, please keep Shamgear safe from harm. Mother! Thales and his goons have left, so rest easy! A divine revelation! What? We have to leave this extinct! What do you mean we have to go? Just hurry and get the spirit stone! Alright! Come on, move it! Chop chop! Yes, Mother! We must hurry! And over. The spirit stone. The spirits are cruel. Why didn't they warn me earlier? How are they? We lost them. Whoa! Look over there! Fire! It's the Chief's house! Chief Champion! Fortiteller! Are you alright? He took the spirit stone from me. He had a leather crock headpiece. What? This whole thing was a set up. They wanted us to chase them. It was their plan all along. This is terrible! What's the matter? It's Elia! Nice! Finally Shamgear's spirit stone is in the palm of my hand. I hope you're not empty handed. Of course not. Now, it's time to wake the legendary machine, Gauros! Dangerous secrets! Dangerous secrets! Oh yeah. This is definitely Thallus' lair. Hmm. I don't think anyone's home. It looks like the door's locked. Well, it won't be for long. Easy. Wow! Impressed? I know. Oh, Biff! You picked the lot! Were you a thief before? A thief? That makes sense. Explains why you're so good at it. No, you're wrong! Don't worry, I don't judge. I wasn't a thief! I swear! It sure is spooky in here. Let's search this room first. If we're lucky, we'll find the spirit stones they stole. You careless fools! How many times have I told you to lock it up? It's Thallus! What do we do? We're sad! We have to hide! Let's hide in there! That's perfect. Quick, get inside! Yeah, come on! Thank you! Here! Uba, hurry! So great! Finally, I have all the stones! That woman! You sure she can decipher the book? I'm positive. Oh, I'm so happy! I'm so happy! I'm so happy! I'm so happy! I'm so happy! I'm so happy! I'm so happy! I'm so happy! I'm so happy! I'm so happy! We find where Golros is buried, then we'll use the spirit stones' powers to unleash him! Golros? Oh no! The machine that destroyed the world! Those scoundrels! They're playing with fire! I can't hold it in! Calm down! It's not time to attack yet! That's not it! What did you eat? Everything's going as planned! What's that sting? Gross! I think it's coming from over there! Oh, yucky yuck! Oh no! Hey! Stop pretending! I know you cut the cheese! What? It wasn't me! Think I don't know what your farts smell like? I said it wasn't me! Maybe the culprit's you! What?! I would never! Doth protest too much! It wasn't me! Get out right now! Yes sir! Those useless nincompoops! Thank goodness! Ah! You're awake! You're awake! How could you do this? We had some good times! Sorry it has to end! I'm such a fool! How did I not see through you? Ah! Ah! Ha! You okay? I owe you! Thank you so much! I'm just glad you didn't get hurt! My name is Billy and I'm a historian! My name is Elia! Billy! Billy! Elia! Were you waiting long? Not at all! Here! For you! A rose! It's beautiful! In return, I'll make you some tea! So where's the professor? He went out today! Oh! What's this, Elia? It's full of scribbles and gibberish! It's the Book of History! Secrets are in code! Oh no! Oh I'm sorry! I didn't know it was important! No, it's alright! But tell me, what are those secrets? He he he he he he he he he he he! I cozied up to you cause you're Plato's assistant! But I had no idea I'd hit the jackpot! Now! I want you to decode where Golos is buried! Do you honestly think I'll do what you want to do? I can't help you! I can't help you! I can't help you! I can't help you! I can't help you! I can't help you! I can't help you! Do you honestly think I'll do what you want? If you won't willingly, then I've no choice! Don't you dare! Who's that? Come out! I know, I'm trying! I'm stuck! Come on! Who are these bosu- Muscle spasm! Some familiar faces! How dare you trespass into my lair! Let the woman go! Ha! If we don't! If you don't, we'll have to summon our pets! Oh ho! So you bozos are trainers! In that case, we have some special pets of our own! Oh! Oh! What are those things? Trainers! Under siege! What are those things? Trainers! Under siege! Mechanical pets? Now I've seen everything! Machines are so convenient! I can make as many as I want! What are they doing now? No! Huh? We have to run! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Everyone okay? Got me! Got me! Huh? Huh? Got me! Oh! Oh! You weren't flying the coop, were you? They have us surrounded, so let's peck our way out! Come on out, my pets! Duggles! Trespassing's a serious offense that must be punished! Duggles! Take this, Ross! Trespassing! Ha-ha! Is that all you've got? Togo! Cougar! Shh, they're stronger than I thought. Ah! Oh, watch out, Verbo! Huh? I could've sworn that one was down for the count. Let me help you. Huh? Yeah. Do you feel better now? That girl is a healer. Hurry and go clip her wings! Huh? Ah! Ah! Ah! No! Tadako! Tadako! Xena, you okay? Xena, open your eyes! Ooh! Oh! Oh! Ah! We're not gonna make it. We need help. Bambi! Take Xena and go to Shamgear! You want me to what? Xena's hurt pretty bad. She needs medical treatment. Then, what about you guys? Don't worry about us. Just hurry and bring backup. I'm not leaving without you. No way! Uh-oh! Ah! Gah! Better get going! We can't fend them off for long! Maruba! No buts! Just go! Uh-okay. Come on out! Medicus! Ah! Quick! Get her on! Okay! Seize them! Whoa! Whoa! Go! Hurry! Medicus! Fly! Caw! Come on! Wah! Ah! Caw! Uh-oh! Quick! Ah! Ah! Ah! G-get off! Thank goodness! Say hi to Master for me! Gah! Gah! Gah! Gah! Thank goodness! Say hi to Master for me! Gah! Gah! Gah! Uba! You alright? I'm still in one piece! Gah! Gah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! I guess it's just you and me now. Yeah. Are you scared, Biffy? Ha! Quit calling me that! My name's Biff! Ha! Now, annihilate them! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Not without a fight! Bring it on! We, as trainers, will defend Tectonica! What was that? Ha! Ha! Flying like the wind, Fedicus! We have to get to Sham Gear, fast! Ha! Ha! What was that? Fly like the wind, Vedicus. We have to get to Shangir, fast! Into the lair! Stop trying to fight me. Face it, you're not in my league. Elia! Let her go! So stubborn. Professor! You're finally awake, Plato. Elia. Elia! Kyle, Elia's been kidnapped! We have to go find those scoundrels! Yes, we know what happened. We've already been out looking for those goons. We've looked everywhere, but we can't find them. I know where they are. Huh? Because we just came from the scoundrels' lair. Barry? The villains! It's pure evil to awaken Golros! They took Elia so they could decode the Book of History. If they manage to unleash Golros, then Tectonica is finished! What if we get there too late? Decoding the Book of History will take a long time. If we hurry, I'm sure we can stop them. Full speed, Veldor! You've got a door! Yes! Please, Piv. Uba. Hang on. We're coming! YAAAHHHH! Enshrouded in gloom, at the far edge of Tectonica, there lies in deep sleep a mechadonum. Well, Doc. What do you think? Ha-ha! I'm very impressed! It is forbidden to disturb the beast. It's all decoded. Oh! That was done faster than I thought! He-he-he-he! The Cave of Gloom, eh? Ten! Bob! Got ready to set out! Yes, sir! Oh, but before we go, leave the basement door open. Sir? Why would you want to do that? The woman that got away will be back with her squad of rookies. Since we won't be here to greet them, we should at least have a welcome gift ready. Oh, you're awake! You okay, Bo? Where am I now? In Shamgir village. Trigger Bambi brought you here. Bambi? Where's Bambi now? She left with Woody to take him to Thalys' lair. What? They went back there? It's dangerous! Please calm down. You must not exert yourself. They need me, but I can't help them. Oh! It's a mess. It's a mess. It's a mess. Oh! Please calm down. You must not exert yourself. They need me, but I can't help them. Oh! It's a mess. It's a mess. Oh! It's out of our heads now, so we wait. Oh, great spirits, please look after those brave souls. Biff! Biff! Uba! I don't see them anywhere! Biff! Do you think they could be inside the lair? Maybe. Let's go look. It seems like nobody's home. It sure looks that way. Where could they have gone? You don't think they're hiding somewhere, do you? Oh! Look! This is Elia's writing. The goons must have put her in a trance. What? Does that mean Thallis knows where Golros is buried? It does. And I'm sure he's going to the Cave of Gloom. We must hurry and stop him! Let's go! bchutz! Just be myself! Oh no! That means... I'm sorry. I came too late. I'm so sorry. No, they're fine. They're probably somewhere. Everyone alright? Yes! Kami! Bambi! Are you badly hurt? Show yourself now! That... that's a machine! It's another one of Pallas' pet spots! Bambi! I think she's seriously hurt. She needs to get treated quickly. Bettecus! Hush! Hurry. Take her to the village. Hush! Another friend got hurt? You're gonna be sorry! Come on out, my pets! Get on! Hush! Yuck! Check out that mug! I think I found your long lost twig! Take that back! Be very careful, Woody. Because that machine looks much stronger than a khaki-bot. I will. Carr! Fire! Farewell, little runts. For today will be your last day on earth. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Another mecha-pet! Morning! Time to rumble! Let's go, you tin can knockoff! Had enough! Faldor! Bulgum! We won! I doubt it. There's no way it could be this easy. Huh? There's barely a scratch on him. Yes! Yes! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! We almost got crushed, Dorvis! Are you okay, Dorvis? Dorvis! Ah! Pallas created a monster. Yes, an unstoppable atrocity. Spikes! Woody up to now! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Ah! Good job, Mocha! Good for now, but we can't fend him off for long. Then what do we do? Woody, are you willing to take a risk? You sure this is the Cave of Glitter? Huh? It doesn't look like a cave to me. Just wait and see. Open the barrier, for the spirits have granted my passage. And this is my proof. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! I can't believe my eyes! Now, let's go meet Galrus. Ah! What? That's too dangerous! I know, but that's our only option now. In that machine, there has to be a spirit stone. If we can remove it, we can stop it. Still, it's too risky for Mocha to go inside that monster's body! The only pet small enough and strong enough is Mocha. Ah, but... If we don't make a decision soon, that machine will make it for us! Mocha Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! What? You really wanna do it? Mocha! Mocha! I have no choice. Come on out! My pet! Ta-ka! Mocha! Mocha! Hopefully this will protect him, Ta-ka! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Get off him! Ta-ka! Mocha! Kaa! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! No! It's... You monster! Spit Mocha! Mocha! Right now! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Go! Mocha! Mocha! Go! I can't get him! Ma! Mocha! Mocha! He's become more vicious! Did our plan backfire on us? Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! Mocha! No! Mocha! And.. Mocha! Mocha! Oh no! We're all goners! I can't risk it! Everyone return! The machine pen collapsed! So then... Booga! Booga! Wow, you did it! Booga! Booga! Booga! Your plan was a total success, Plato! Thank goodness. I am so relieved. Oh, Plato. Let's go! We have some villains to catch! Let's go! How much farther do we have to go? Does this Goros thing really exist? Here we are. Oh! Whoa! Behold the legendary... Goros! Cave of Gloom The If we infuse the Spirit Stone's powers, it will awaken Goros. Well then, let's get started. Jinx! Huh? What is it? The troublemakers are here. You'd better hurry, Sif! Drats! Those pests have followed us. What? Persistent little brats! I thought Mecha Veldor would take care of them! Chan! Bob! Yes? Take the puppet and handle those runts! But what if he falls out of his trance again? Yeah! I bet that Lucy girl will be with them! That'll never happen! With this Power Stone, my sorcery... has become stronger than ever! But on the off chance he acts up. Use this! This is it! So... So... And the rest of the universe will be with them. I've got no more power stone. It will be with them! Yeah! I bet that Lucy girl will be with them! has become stronger than ever. But on the off chance he acts up, use this. This is it. So, this is the Cave of Gloom. It's open. They must be here. We have to hurry. Okay. Wow. The cave is humongous. Yeah. We have to find Thallis as fast as we can. If we're too late. Oh no, not him! It's that trainer. The one that went berserk. Oh yeah. He must have been sent to stop us. He could try. Hold on, Woody! What is it, Lucy? I have to ask him something. Ask him what? I keep seeing him in my dreams. He might be the key to unlock my past. No, Lucy. It's too dangerous. I know, but... Sorry, Lucy. I don't think they came here to talk. Come on out! My best! Oh, immortal mecha dinosaur. I renew you with great power. Now arise in full glory. It won't be long now. Way to go, Veldorf! Oh! Why, you... Oh! How'd you like that? Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Mokka! Mokka! Sadwages, they're not making this easy! It's an earthquake! Oh no, have we started the reawakening? The reawakening? It's the process of reviving Golros. The power required can shake the ground. So Golros is waking up? We don't have a minute to spare. Okay, just leave it to me! What? What is it? To pass through, I need to defeat that trainer! Stop! Oh, Lucy? That's enough! You are in my dreams, and you didn't seem like a bad person! So please let us go! Oh no, not again! If you don't, Tektonika will be in danger! Oh no! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! chwilascона Lucy remembers Hironics Kittyちょlez Are you okay, Lucy? Yes, I'm fine, but the fish got away.

Why, I'm the future ruler of this continent. I want you to leave now. You're sure? Do what we want, and this girl won't get hurt. You've got your pets. Now let Lucy go. Wow, you're as good as they say. Sure, a deal's a deal. Lucy, are you hurt anywhere? I'm fine. Oh no! Did you really think we would let you go? So naive. You despicable swines! How did he do that?

So don't look back. Keep running. We've got you now! Hurry, Lucy. Go! Okay! Hmm. How dare you mark my face. I'll make you pay. No, you'll pay for deceiving and kidnapping us. Well, why don't I settle this for you right now? Huh? That footbridge looks like a nice target. Huh? No! Stop! Huh? Huh? Huh? Yeah! Whoa! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Lucy! Are you back? Ah! I'm back. And the memory too. Ah! Ah! Search some right. Now finish some art! Ah! Daddy, no! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Dad? D? I remember everything. I need you to come back to me! Ah! Ah! Ah! What? Hold on! I don't get it! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! What's happening to him? I think he's transforming. Huh? No! No! I know! Let's get that girl away from him! Daddy, it's me! It's me!

I have to stop it, no matter what! Goros is a monster that destroyed Tectonica! Yeah, you can't take it on by yourself! Remember? I'm the trainer who saves the world! This isn't the time for jokes! If my mentor stays, I stay, get on! I stay too, Gor. It made Lucy cry, so it must pay! Count me in. I'll have to fight it eventually. Moga! Thanks, guys! He's too brave for his own good. You can't beat Goros in head-to-head combat! I have a plan! There's a deep crack! I'll lure Goros over and make it fall in! It is very deep. Ah! Even if it survives the fall, it won't be able to climb out. Huh? You should hurry! You need to get to the other side! Alright. Please be careful, Woody! Moga! Ready? Go attack! Moga! M-Mogaaaa!

As you can see, I have no form. So you must defeat Goros in my stead. Sorry, I'm no match for Goros. Why did I have to be the chosen one? Because you're the descendant of Shamgeer. The trainer that fought Goros and won. What? Long ago, with my help, Shamgeer can find Goros. Now the duty falls on you. I will bestow upon you my powers. That beast just passes by. It found us!

Your smile is still the same. It's really you, Moga! Huh? The Spirit! Moga! The Spirit's Shield. Moga! We have to help Moga pronto! But how do we do that? Ow! That's hot! Hey, look! Let go of Moga!
