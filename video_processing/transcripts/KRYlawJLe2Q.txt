Why farmed animals face legal animal cruelty

 What is the most painful animal life for animals? Animals feel pain. This is a scientific fact. And yet in animal industries all over Australia, pieces of animals' bodies are cut off, sliced open, and burned away while they are fully conscious without pain relief. This is routine and is inflicted on millions of animals raised for food every year. But why do animal industries do this, and why isn't it illegal? In Australia, animal farming is a multi-billion dollar business. The majority of animals born into these production systems are thought of only as property. Their wants and needs come second to profit, especially in factory farms. Instead of allowing animals to live freely and follow their instincts, factory farms force them into industrialised systems that deny animals any semblance of a natural life. In factory farms, mother pigs are kept in tiny metal crates. With mothers unable to move away from their hungry suckling babies, piglets teeth can often damage their mothers udders. Young pigs, packed into crowded sheds, sometimes bite each other's tails in frustration. Rather than address the behavioural needs of these animals, the industry's solution is to cut off piglets' tails and cut the tips off their teeth. This is done when they are only days old. Similarly, hens, frustrated at being unable to engage in their natural behaviours, can peck at one another when forced to share confined spaces. So the industry removes part of their beaks. These industries could give animals more space or reduce their numbers, but that would lower their profits. Instead, they cut bits and pieces of live animals to make them fit into their cruel systems. But it's not just on indoor factory farms where these painful procedures happen. A cow's horns can be dangerous to other cows if they're forced unnaturally close together, such as in trucks or sail yards. They can also cause injury to the humans handling them. A cow's horns are not unfeeling like fingernails. They have a blood flow and contain sensitive nerves. But the industry cuts them off, causing intense pain. Or if the calf is still young, the growing horn buds are burned or scooped out. Pain relief is cheap and available, but still rarely used. Lambs, like puppies, are born with long tails. But unlike puppies, they don't get to keep them. Lambs' tails are cut off in their first weeks of life. Or a rubber ring is used to stop the flow of blood to the tail, causing it to die and fall off. Knives and rubber rings are also used to remove the testicles of male lambs, calves and piglets. It's legal to perform all these surgical procedures without pain relief and while the animal is fully conscious. But why is this allowed? Every Australian state has laws that prohibit harming animals. If any of these things were done to a cat or a dog, there would be serious legal consequences. But animal agriculture industries enjoy a loophole known as codes of practice. The codes, which outline how agricultural businesses can treat animals, contain many outdated farming practices. This shields those practices from animal protection laws, despite science telling us that many of the practices cause animals extreme pain and stress. That's why, in Australia, cutting the tail off a dog is a crime, but cutting the tail off a lamb is just business. So, if the law doesn't protect farmed animals, who will? Let's look at an example. Sheep raised to produce wool can suffer from a painful and sometimes fatal condition called fly strike. This happens when flies lay eggs in a sheep's wool or skin, producing maggots that feed on the sheep's flesh. For decades, the wool industry's solution to deter fly strike has been a practice called mulesing. Slicing chunks of skin off a lamb's rear, often using the same shears used to shear wool. When global awareness of mulesing was raised, there was international outrage. Boycotts were organised and dozens of huge companies said they would stop buying Australian wool until the practice stopped. As a result, a new market for non-mulesed wool was created. Unfortunately, for many animal farming industries, cutting pieces off animals' bodies has simply become an accepted part of doing business. And with governments prioritising economic interests over animal welfare, it is only the fear of losing the support of retailers and their customers that will motivate change, as the case of mulesing shows. Through what we buy, or choose not to buy, we have the power to make change. You can let these animal industries know. While they continue to inflict terrible suffering on animals, you won't buy their products. They want to buy small groundbreaking products to pretend to sell in equilibrium, even though it is very rare to lower into yourוcastes for example.
