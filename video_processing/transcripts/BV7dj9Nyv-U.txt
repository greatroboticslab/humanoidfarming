Howto & Style
 As the season is wrapping up for most farmers in the northern hemisphere, it's the fall time, we're getting close to winter, we've all of a sudden got a little bit more time to reflect on the season, plan for the next, and maybe start thinking about implementing some new systems into the farm going into the next season that might make life a little bit easier for everybody. A lot of people have reached out to me over the years to ask me about CRM programs or invoicing programs or various different software programs that farmers would use to manage customers, take orders, generate harvest tallies and things like this that you would do, you know, what I did for many years on spreadsheets or other different types of applications that we that were a bit more roundabout. There hasn't been a lot up until now software programs meant specifically for farmers and a lot of people ask me which ones would I endorse and there's actually a few out there now but the biggest reason that I've been hesitant to endorse any of them is that some of these applications use a percentage base on sales to charge the farmer and to be honest I'm not really a fan of that. To me it kind of seems like rent-seeking you know you want 10 to 2% of my sales well like you're not getting those you're not generating those sales you just you might be helping me balance some of the tasks to get those sales but you're not helping me generate those sales like you're not going and getting those customers they're my customers not yours but there is one that I've heard about that my good friend John Hofer at Wise Earth Farms is now using. They've reached out to me asked me to check the software out and I want to tell you about it because I like it and I think they've got a really good value proposition and I have a special deal which I'll tell you guys about and it's the perfect time to take them up on this offer because it's free. So the program is called Local Line and it's basically a CRM so it's managing your customers your invoices it's aggregating orders all in one place it'll spit out a pick list for you to take out into the farm to harvest the stuff you need and I've gone through the software I really like it it's really simple like I said the payment structure of it is is fantastic I think it's really fair you can add some features to it which can increase the monthly amount you pay or you can go really bare bones it's up to you but it's there it's a relatively new company too and the thing that I've heard about them from a number of farmers that I've I've spoken to about it is that they've been really good at taking information from the growers that are using the program right now to improve things going forward and apparently even according to John they've been really quick to implement these things so I'm referring to John at Wise Earth Farms if you guys have watched my videos over the years I've done a lot of stuff with John Wise Earth is right here in Kelowna John's a pretty good personal friend of mine we farm together for a year I'm gonna spice him into this video he's gonna talk a little bit about local line but before we go to that I just want to tell you about this offer that they that local line has asked me to share with you guys my audience so since we have time going into the fall to start checking these things out this is good this is a real win-win right here so normally what they offer on their site is a seven day free trial and then if they if if you want to get them to set up your account so that means going in and plugging in products and kind of setting you up so that you can use the program they charge $250 to do it which I think is totally reasonable because there's a lot to doing that but what they've offered you guys is not just seven days but 30 days free and then they'll set you up for free so it's there's no risk here there's no reason not to try it if you don't have a CRM check this out because it's gonna make your life a lot easier now before we jump to that I just want to tell you a quick little personal story that kind of ties into local line so I used to have a customer that was a distributor customer that I sold to for many years about eight years and he had a distribute distribution business where he would buy from local growers and then he would take that product and go and sell it to high-end restaurants that were sort of out of reach for all these local farmers but he spent a ton of time each week going back and forth with each farmers so he would be like you'd call me and say hey are you gonna have this product and this product and this product product at these weeks and I'd say yeah I'll plan to have those for these weeks that that call might have happened a month or two before then he'll circle back the week before and say hey do you have this and this and this and I'd be like I'm short on that I've got this but I don't have that and I've got some of this so on and so forth and then he goes and fills in the gaps so he spent a lot of time going back and forth with each grower needless to say he went out of business ended up owing me a bunch of money ended up owing John a bunch of money a bunch of farmers a bunch of money anyways he sold the business and the guy who bought the business and I'm not gonna say the name is now using local line and he's eliminated all that work of going back and forth from the farmers which probably was the majority of his week now the farmers can just basically adjust late they can just put in what they're gonna have and then he orders what's there so it's simple there's no back and forth and you can do the same thing with this software with any type of customer so if you're selling to restaurants you can have it generate a fresh sheet they get that fresh sheet they log into their local line account and like they don't have to pay for it you pay for it your customers don't pay for it they can place the order boom they're done and you can even put in inventory and limit certain products so that you that you know you're not having people order things that you're short on or or whatnot so it removes a ton of time and so I want to show it easy because I just think like you know my god how much time could this program have saved this guy and potentially saved his business I know what I was getting into selling to restaurants I did a lot of back and forth with chefs like text messages emails phone calls this makes it so easy for the customer as well because they just go to one place one portal and then place to order and then they're done and then there's no oh I thought you said you had this or I thought that and it eliminates all that so not only does it make the the ordering more streamlined but it saves it covers your butt in the case that there was a miscommunication somewhere so let's just jump to John and he's gonna tell us kind of what he likes about the program and what they're using it for we use local line as a order platform for our farm we run a vegetable vegetable farm we sell to restaurants retail customers and the farmers market so we use that for to allow our customers to order our products and to generate invoices digitally and through paper copies directly to our customers we can do a pick list so when we deliver our product we can have a confirmation invoice that then later on gets set up as well and it allows payment online as well if I think how much money we've already saved just making invoices that's paid for itself like right there so and then plus we have now a system that generates a fresh sheet so we've saved money on generating a fresh sheet because there's automatic reminders that go out twice a week we have saved money on miscommunication because the customer can go in and re-edit their order so if they have an issue with an order some customers don't know that so they will place multiple orders but a customer is able to log in on their end and go and see all their previous orders all their previous payments everything in the past so for the customer it's huge as well because they can see history and then they could potentially say oh hey wait a minute I didn't place that order there could be you know there could be that whereas if it's all generated on your computer and then you give the customer an invoice and someone put it away and they're like did I receive that maybe not or all that sort of stuff so I we've totally saved the money already that we've spent what I like about it is first before we'd have emails coming in and then the email would have all the all the product in there and then sometimes people might be like oh that's not what I expected well now there's a picture and it's a description of what it is and if you click the wrong button that's not my problem so it has eliminated any confrontation it's eliminating error error yes oh it's eliminating a lot of errors because before that people would text we'd have texting we'd have a phone calls and we'd have emails coming in and now the rule is go through local line so those customers still email their orders in but they still have the capacity to go on to their computer and see that order and modify it and do other stuff so if they're in a hurry and they're not near a computer they will text it in and if they have time they'll just go into their computer place the order and it shows up and it's good to go all right if that interests you guys I urge you to check it out there's no risk here the link is in the show notes 30 days free trial things are slowing down for you on the farm sign up check it out see if you like it and they'll set you up with it so you're gonna be pretty much ready to roll right out of the gate
