 welcome to today's lesson so today's lesson is about crop husbandry practices this topic is the agriculture form 2 and you are with me Andrew Kobe so on crop husbandry practices we're going to start with land preparation and we have to know what land preparation is so when talk of plant preparation land preparation it involves the practices which are carried out on a particular piece of land to create a suitable soil to needness for planting so there are some practices or activities which are carried out on the land so that that land should be should be ready for plant planting so those activities known as land preparations so the size of soil clouds the soil depth and the looseness of the soil must be appropriate in order to facilitate the generation and establishment of the crops so in order for crops to germinate and also to established we must consider the size of the soil clouds as well as the depth and the looseness of the soil so timeline preparation and deep browning create favorable conditions for is a management of subsequent field practices such as weeding and past i mean and past control so land which has been prepared for the purpose of growing crops is called a seed bed so the land which has been prepared and the aim of preparing that land is to grow crops that land is known as known as a seed bed well let's now look at importance of land preparation why is it important to prepare the land so the first important is to remove vegetation which may interfere subsequent operation or which may interfere the next operation or the foreign operations so you have to remove the vegetation other important is to bury organic matter into the soil which later decomposes so if you do run preparation it means uh you are burying organic matter uh which will later decompose and after decomposing means they add nutrients to the soil so land preparation also uh helps in binding soil particles as well as adding nutrients into the soil soil so another important is to kill paste and diseases causing organisms so to prepare the land it also helps to kill the paste as well as disease causing organisms this is done by exposing the pest and disease causing organism to harsh weather i mean harsh environment conditions on the soil surface so yeah if you expose this uh this soil bone paste as uh disease causing organisms to harsh weather conditions it means at the end they will die so that's uh importance of uh land preparation uh another one is to kill perennial weeds like uh coach glass which could otherwise compete with the uh of the crops so you know if you prepare the land means you are removing the vegetation so in such a way you are also killing the perennial weeds which could otherwise compete with the crops and to improve the physical conditions of the soil by loosening um soil making it suitable for root development that is root penetration so land preparation also it improves the physical condition okay by loosening the soil so if the soil has been loosened it means it will be easy for roots to penetrate so another point is to facilitate proper anchorage of plants so if you prepare the land it means you are facilitating proper or encouraging the proper anchorage of the plants and also to improve infiltration of water in the soil so we've talked of root loosening the soil so if the soil is loose it means water can easily if you treat in the soil so those are some of the advantages of uh land preparation another one is to try to bring up the surface i mean to bring up to the surface nutrients which are present in the sub soil section so there are other nutrients which are presence i mean they're present in the sub soil section therefore if you prepare the land you are bringing those nutrients to the surface so that they can be used by the crops and they can be benefit to the crops in the later stage so let's look at operations which are involved in land preparation so land preparation involves a number of operations so these are some of the operations which are involved in land preparation so the first one is land clearing then i've got primary cultivation secondary cultivation then tertiary cultivation so we're going to look at each and every uh operation in details so let's now start with um land creating so when talk of plant clearing land clearing can be defined as removal of vegetation cover from the surface before prowing so to create is to remove the vegetation cover from the surface before you start prowing so that's land clearing so the vegetation can uh can be trees the previous uh season crop remains weeds grasses slabs among others so if you are creating this these uh what i've mentioned here what i've mentioned here it means you are doing landing killing so this is just a picture of a woman uh carrying their land so you can see the woman is using the whole uh carrying the glasses there so that's landing okay so land creating it involves the following activities so talk of the following activities so talk of failing of trees and removal of tree stamps so if i've got trees and you want to cultivate crops on such a land it means you have to fill the trees and also remove the strength i mean the term stamps of the trees then talk of flashing or cutting of dog glasses or slabs or bushes so you slash the garden glasses that's the land clearing talk of burning of vegetation so burning of vegetation is also one way of clearing the land though this one is not recommended because it destroys uh the soil structure and also kills some of the useful microorganisms so in the process of burning finding some of the useful microorganisms they are killed so fire can also spread it to an area where it was not intended so if you burn it means fire can also be spread into other area which uh which were not intended so that's why burning is not encouraged uh uh as one way of uh killing the land so land killing can be done manually all can be done using chemicals all can be mechanized using machines so you can do land killing manually so talk of manual is by using hand hand i mean by using hands then chemicals and using machine so those are ways of doing i mean doing uh land creating so let's start by looking at hand method so when talk of hand methods uh hand method uh it involves the use of hand tools like uh slashers machetes so these machetes uh uh uh just the same as pangas so those are some of the tools which are used in hand uh method so the use of tools is slow and therefore only a few hectares of land can be created over a long period of time so if you are using uh uh if you are using uh uh uh these hand tools the work could be done in a slow pace because it's the use of human effort therefore uh a very big press i mean a few few hectares can be created in a very long period of time so that's a disadvantage of using hand method so this method leads to delay in seed bait preparation and may result in late planting and this consequently poor crop yields so as i've already said that uh the use of hand method is very slow so this one will delay in preparation and later on planting also drain which will later lead to uh poor yields so this method of land clearing is commonly used by small scale farmers because you cannot use this method in large i mean in uh by large scale farmers because it's very slow therefore things not work let's look at chemical methods so on top of chemical methods it involves the use of chemicals called herbicides which kills weeds so the herbicides will kill weeds and if you are using herbicides uh to kill the weeds uh this one is known as a chemical method so these are some of the examples of herbicides which are used to kill them with to go round up to go gramozone to go atrazine and among others of course a lot of chemicals which are used uh to kill the weeds then we've got mechanical method so talk of mechanical method this uh involves the use of tractor mounted implements for example to go tractor with a chain to fill trees in a forest we talk of a bulldozer uh which is used to remove the stems so this method is commonly used by large scale farmers so mechanical or using machines mostly dies by large scale farmers so let's look at advantage advantages of mechanical methods so mechanical method uh it is efficient in land clearing it's very efficient in the land clearing as compared to other methods it has got a low labor requirements because uh talk of mechanical it it may be one person operating the machine so low labor requirements while we talk of um uh hand hand method you cannot use one person to create the land you need a lot of people to create the land so this one uh mechanical it means it is low labor requirements then large area can be created within a short period of time so it is very fast you can create a large piece of brand within a short period of time so let's look at limitations so limitation just the same as advantage i mean disadvantages of mechanical um mechanical method so the first one is the cost of purchasing and maintaining the machine is high so to purchase to buy the machine as well as to maintain the machine the machine the costs are very high so those are some of the limitations of mechanical then let's look now at importance of land caring in general what are some of the importance of land caring so these are some of the importance of land caring so it makes subsequent preparations such as plowing easier and efficient so if you prepare the land it means next operation i mean next operations or subsequent operations will be easy such as plowing it will be easy to plow where the land has always been created then it helps in the eradication of pests and diseases so certain crop diseases such as uh uh maria root slot which affect deep bushes can be prevented by removal and destruction of stems so if you create the land some of the pests as well as diseases can be removed you know some of the uh pests they are harbored by the weeds talk of uh stems so if you create it means you are preventing the pest as well as diseases as well as diseases so pests and animals such as squares mice and monkeys which destroy crops inhabit bush i mean bushlands so they inhabit in the bushland so if you create the bushes you remove the glass you remove the weeds it means you are also uh making these pests as well as animals to go away because they will have nowhere um to stay or they cannot be inhabited in the place which is created therefore it is very important of coming to create the land so another importance is uh land caring it helps to open virgin lands talk of forest land or bush areas cannot be cultivated unless they are first created of bush or forest so there are other areas these areas have not been converted before so to start cultivating you have to create the land so those are some of the importance of land so those are some of the importance of land creating so however forest areas these are water catchment areas and they should be avoided um that crane it is a land reclamation method especially in uh uh um you meet bushlands those areas are prone to then surprise uh infestation and are not suitable for human settlement and livestock keeping so there are other areas whereby people they cannot settle there uh land clearing is land i mean reclamation it means uh you can use land caring uh to bring back that land whereby it can now be used that's what it means by and decremation method so therefore land caring in such areas makes them become habitable by people and livestock so the second one is primary conversion after land clearing go to primary cultivation so on top of primary cultivation this is the initial opening of the land either after carrying the bush or after a previous uh season of cropping uh uh after clearing the land you start now digging the land that one is known as primary cultivation initial opening of the land after clearing the land so primary cultivation can be carried out using hand tools or mechanically using various tractor drone or ox drone plows so this is just an example of uh a tractor drone now uh uh club so you can see that um it is opening up the land which has been created so this one is known as uh primary cultivation so let's look at importance of primary cultivation so primary cultivation it makes subsequent operations easy such as planting so if you do primary operation it means subsequent or next operation will be very easy of course so many operations after uh primary operations so those operations will be easy after primary cultivation it facilitates aeration and water infiltration in the soil so since you are opening up the land it means you are losing the land therefore it will be easy for water to infiltrate in the soil and also a aeration will be very easy and it controls weeds such as uh rhizomatous weeds by burying or uprooting them so it's one way of controlling weeds by buying them or uprooting them it also buries crop residues to decompose and add nutrients with the soil so it's one way of burying crop residues in the soil so after the crop residues have been buried in the soil they decomposed and they decompose and they add nutrients in the soil it is easy i mean it eases the penetration of uh the crop loads so since you are saying that uh it loosens the soil therefore the crop loads would be easily penetrate into the soil it also controls past and diseases so this can be done by uh exposing the past as well as disease causing organisms into harsh weather conditions to go to uh sunlight so that they can they can they can scorch by the sun they can be scorched by the sun or they can be killed or they can be eaten by the predators so those are some of the importance of primary uh cultivation so let's look at tools which are used in primary cultivation so i've got hand tools or hand method so hand method or hand tools that are used by most scale farmers so such tools are holes to go fork holes the dog of ox plow among others then i've got mechanical methods so mechanical method this they use uh it is mainly used in large scale farmers so it involves the use of disc plows talk of chisel plows moldboard plows uh uh rotary cultivators among others so initial capital and maintenance of these machines is very high so that's a disadvantage of mechanical method so let's look at factors that enforce the choice of the tools and equipment used in primary cultivation so when you're doing primary cultivation you cannot just use any tool you have to choose which tools to use uh during your primary cultivation so there are factors which are enforce the choice of the tools to be used so the first one is type of the tools required so this would determine on the size of the seeds to be planted for example small seeds need fine tooth hence many tools are used so if you are to plant uh very small seeds or fine seeds it means many tools will be used during uh primary primary cultivation so that the soil should be made small i mean yeah the soil particles should be very small so you have to use uh many tools you know good cultivation death second factor so deep loot uh deep rooted crops require a tool that will plow deep in the soil so you have to use the tools that uh will plow deep in the soil if you are to cultivate uh deep rooted crops then what type of soil heavy soil i mean heavy tools are required when plowing heavy soil so i've got heavy soils and you have to use heavy tools so if you are cultivating heavy soils it means you have to use heavy tools then soil moisture content also so a fault hole may be more suitable than a regular hole in wet soils so you know if you are using a a regular hole in wet soils that uh what soil it will stick it will be sticking to the hole in the soil so if you are using a solid soil so if the soil is having uh uh i mean if the soil is wet you have to use a fogged hole unlike a regular hole so um in steep areas uh you are supposed to use animal drone implements so these are some of the factors uh uh uh which affect the choice of tools to be used in primary then let's look at timing of primary cultivation when can you do primary cultivation so the best time to prepare the seed bed is during the dry season so that the weeds can be scorched by the sun so yeah you do primary cultivation in dry season so that the weeds should be scorched by the sun so that they should completely uh die then a seed bed which was previously cropped is best prepared immediately after harvesting so after harvesting you have to prepare the seed bed then air and preparation enables the farmer to plant it air so if you prepare the land area planting will also be done airing so that's all i had in this presentation so if there is any question that's our whatsapp number and that's our email thank you see you in our
