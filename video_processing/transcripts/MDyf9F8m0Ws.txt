 With the constant talk about ways to lower pollution within our planet's water system, there tends to be a topic that most do not realize causes harm and is often overlooked. What is that, you may ask? Well, the proper term is agricultural runoff. This pollutant started when factory farming was preferred over organic farming. Often on factory farms, there are thousands of animals kept in captivity and the usage of harsh fertilizers and chemicals on crops. This led to a mass production of food, but also a mass production of waste that is not being managed properly. We call this waste agricultural runoff, which includes harsh chemical fertilizers and many traces of manure from cows, pigs, and other animals. These components find their way into all categories of water, globally in our oceans, within some of our largest rivers, and in small local ponds and lakes. But who consumes this water? People. All of us do. So what can we do to make a change? The encouragement and support of organic farming. Taking farming back to how it used to be, natural. Eating more sustainable diets. Less animal product consumption. And we also need to demand a change in industrial farming. These changes will be helpful in stopping agricultural runoff from running out of control. on combination of kids. And we also need to add toНАЯv Tribal.
