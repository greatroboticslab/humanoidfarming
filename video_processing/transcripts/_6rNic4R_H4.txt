 It's another day in the shop. Today we are working on the field cultivator and this job is not going to get done as quickly as I was hoping for. A couple of weeks ago I had Colin change out the points or sweeps, whatever you want to call them. Yesterday we started replacing the spikes on this Harrow and after our impact batteries died we called it good for the day and then started again this morning. It wasn't until we ran out of spikes at the end that I realized that 50 of these were back ordered so I still need to wait on the rest of that delivery. This cylinder was pretty leaky so I dropped it off to get rebuilt and then two of these shanks are bent so I have those to install. Besides that we just need to grease it, give it a good once over and it should be ready to go. Look who showed up for work when I got done with the job. Oh that looks good! There's more to go so you can help out once the new ones get here. Yeah I'll help watch, no problem.
