 Welcome to Integration, Strategies in Business for a World in Flux, where we explore the art of moving forward, not just sustaining, transforming. I'm your host, Samantha Dewell, and I hope you are as inspired by my guests as I am. They come from many different walks of life. The great ones among us do not see setbacks, only the landscape of possibilities. My guests have learned to navigate what is, to find ways to keep going and leave the world better than they found it, so that when the storm comes, they don't just endure, they lean into it. And on that note, I hope you enjoy my guest today. Hello, Terry, and welcome. This is Terry McCosker. And for many of you listening who may be farmers in Australia, certainly this man is of great note to you. But for many of my listeners who are not in the farming space and maybe more in business, this will be, why am I listening to this man? I don't know anything about agriculture. But what he's done and what he has achieved throughout his life, I think, is something that lends itself to any area of business, and certainly in terms of persistence over time. I will put it into the notes because his bio is five pages long. It's kind of extraordinary. And I was trying to pick out what will I say about Terry that's significant. So I'm going to just say some of the top things that I kind of got out of it, apart from that he's got an award that's an Order of Australia medal. I know I am, it's fairly rarely given out. And an Honorary Doctor of Agribusiness from the University in Queensland, which is also, I think, a first, if not the only that I've heard of. Someone not going through that. But also that he has been published since he was 19. He's now done 40 peer-reviewed published papers in eight different disciplines. That's just kind of extraordinary all by itself. He's a commercial parlor. He's done a Churchill Fellowship. And, you know, he's one of the first people to start this holistic landscape space under a study back in 1978. So he's not new to this area. He's been doing it for a long, long time. He's worked in Africa. He's worked all over the world. I suppose the thing that I find really, the bit that I find really wonderful is that he's trying to integrate what maybe people consider the soft arts or the witty poo area of consciousness consciousness and intuition, dowsing, and the sort of more unusual areas of looking at what can be done on the land when our Indigenous knowledge is not open to us. And how can we, as people that are not native to this land, get access to that, which I think is intuitive to all of us is the ability to tap into that. So on that note, despite the many other things that he's done, which I really couldn't say in this thing, I'm going to open by saying, hello, Terry. Oh, and I'm Samantha. For those of you who only know Terry, I'm Samantha Jewell, and I've been working only a mere 30 years, not 50. And I've been trying to advocate for people like Terry and people that work on the land and have achieved in any way stewardship of the soil. Welcome. Well, thank you for that very long introduction, Samantha. That just brings back a few memories. Well, your audience know you so well. I mean, I think the thing people don't realise is you've achieved 10% of Australia's farmers in terms of educating them about regenerative agriculture. I mean, it comes under lots of terms, but this is the one that's currently in vogue. And that's massive. 10% is, what is that in terms of, I mean, it's 100,000 farms. What is that in terms of land, farmable land in Australia? I don't really know. We've never really tracked it. Somebody had a go at it a year or two ago, and just in Queensland and New South Wales, they got to 12 million hectares. But the database is probably incomplete. And then when you start taking into account the bigger properties in North Queensland and Northern Territory, West Australia, those sort of areas that we've influenced, it's probably in the tens of millions of hectares. But I don't really know for sure. I am really amazed by this effect because having done the minimal amount I have and trying to go out and talk to farmers. And some time ago, I brought you down to Victoria to try and get your course put in here. And I went out and talked to farmers everywhere. And I was like, they're not going to listen to me at all. And some of the people have been on your list to come and do your course because Terry also educates an enormous amount of people on business in farming. Some of them have been 17 years waiting for you to come down and be interviewed by you. I was like blown away how long people were willing to wait to – they had them pegged in the back of their book. They wanted to come and listen to you. And that's amazing. That seems to be pretty normal for you. I don't really know. Again, I don't keep track of those sort of things. I'm very grateful for the fact that I get to work with people who are willing to change and willing to change landscape and steward landscape. And I think I'm in a very, very privileged position in that I get to influence a lot of people positively and change a lot of lives. And that's just an absolute privilege. And I guess that's – it's a change in lives and a change in landscape that keeps me going and that motivates me. And I think that's not about any accolades or anything else. It's getting out there and making changes. And I've been, as I say, in a very privileged position to be able to contribute to that. I would say it's a little bit more than privilege. In one of your podcasts that I was listening to when you went broke and then you went – you were working towards making a whole lot of money and you made this critical decision that you would keep congruency between your values and what was you and what you were trying to do. And you made the decision you'd only work with people that were ready to listen or want to listen rather than trying to convince people to change otherwise. That is a major thing that you did. And it's one I'd like to do a little bit more deep diving into in terms of how you came about to have that – come across that decision and how – and what influenced you with it? Well, I think I got wrapped up in the 80s hype about making money. It was – that was in the days of Bond and all of these people that was a – was a focus of the 80s was on making money. And I'd come out of a really, really good job in the mid-80s. And the world was sort of my oyster and I had to decide, well, where do I go from here and what do I do? And I thought, well, making money would be the thing to do. And so I poured myself into that. And the more I poured myself into that, the worse off I got. And then I got to the point within about five years where there was nothing left. The equity and the capital that I did have had turned into more debt and I had a negative net worth. But the most important thing was I still had my family. I got three beautiful girls and my wife, Pam, who stuck with me through those really tough times. And at one stage, my family was on the dole. They were on welfare because I couldn't feed them. And that's – you know, you don't feel very good when you're in that sort of place, when you can't feed your family. And so I made a complete shift from what I had been doing. And it was to do with going back to ecosystems and going back to land. In the mid-80s, I had had a discovery that I had been degrading land on a large scale in the Northern Territory unknowingly. And nobody could tell – Was it a holistic thing that you were doing that you did a large scale? Yeah. You were integrating it? Yeah, I ran an extremely large privately funded research project on a cattle station. And basically, I was told to fix it. Like, whatever needed to be done, we did. And I had a – there was four of us, full-time scientists, on this property. And we had collaboration with departments of agriculture in Queensland, Northern Territory, West Australia, several CSIRO divisions, several universities helping us. It was an amazing collaborative experience. And what I learned through that process was to focus on systems and to understand systems. But what I had realized towards the end of that, and I had the data to prove it, is that the perennial grasses and the desirable perennial grasses in my landscape had a very, very low stocking rate. Like, I'm talking a beast of 13 hectares was going backwards. The landscape was going backwards. And I picked that up within about four years. And so that sort of goes against the whole viewpoint of people trying to take animals off the land. It's kind of showing, highlighting why that doesn't work. Well, even at very, very low stocking rates, it still doesn't work. And I didn't know why. I brought lots of people onto the property. I'd drive them around. I'd show them what was happening. I'd show them the data. And I'd say, you know, why? And generally, the answer I got back was, that's just normal. That's what just happens. And I knew in my gut that that's not what should happen. But I had no idea why. So I had a really bad gut feel that I carried with me for quite a long time. So at this point, you'd say their decision to make a change was not to do with anything external. It was totally within you. It was an intuitive feeling within you that there was something more that you weren't being, that you hadn't found yet. Yes. But I sort of felt by 89, I was being exposed to the right ideas, but I didn't understand them. And so I met Stan Parsons in 89, put him back to Australia in late 89. And we did our first grazing for profit school in March 1990. And I still didn't get properly the impact of the grazing management on these plants. And the reason is that I was deeply buried in an old paradigm. And it took me a couple of years to be able to switch my head into a new paradigm. And so I really, you know, I fully understand why it takes people, why it's difficult for people to shift paradigms. And that's what I had to do. And I had to shift that paradigm. And in the end, the way I did that was I was very fortunate to get a Churchill Fellowship. And I went overseas. And I went everywhere where Parsons and Savory had ever been. And that convinced me fairly quickly that they were right and the science was wrong. And then there was so much evidence of that as I visited farm after farm after farm on two continents. And so I then came back to Australia. And then that's because I'd had massive opposition to starting to talk about rest in pastures. Incredible opposition. And I threatened to be run out of business because of it. And so I had to decide how was I going to handle that. And so that was when I made the decision because I still remember where I was. I was sitting in Harare in a hotel waiting for the flight back to Sydney in, I think there was 91. And I had to decide how will I go forward. And I decided that from then on, I will talk to people who are willing to listen. And I will not ever try to convince people again that are not ready to listen. So in something I listened to, you were actually attacked quite extensively by the people that were opposing you. And throughout that, how did you manage to remain brilliant and continue on with that? And I know you speak a lot about your wife supporting you, which is wonderful. But how did you personally remain strong through it? Because I knew the truth. And because I had gone to the trouble, if you like, of spending three months overseas, going everywhere and looking for failures, finding failures, looking for successes and finding successes, talking to many, many people, but principally talking to land managers rather than scientists. And I knew the truth when I came back to Australia. So it wasn't actually hard to, well, you know, in a sense, from a business sense, it was hard. But from a personal internal view, it wasn't hard at all because there was the truth and there was what other people perceived. And that's what carried me through. And it has ever since. Because even today with what we're doing with soil carbon, we're up against the same academic opposition. Bill, even now, even 50 years later. Even now. Terry, it's terrible. I thought it was just, you know, a couple of university, Melbourne University academics here trying to hold on to their jobs. But it's up there as well, is it? Yeah, it's everywhere. But again, it's not within the context in which we're working. And it's not with the same tools at which we're working. And it's not at the same scale at which we're working. And they're not seeing the landscape shift that we're seeing or the human shift that we're seeing. So again, I understand why people want to stick to their paradigms. But we're just breaking paradigms. I suppose that's, I think that's one of the things I was put here to do was bust a few paradigms at a community level. And you've got internal steel. That's what we're talking about here. One of my bosses once said to me something along those lines. He said I had incredible moral courage. And so I suppose it's, but it's just knowing and understanding your gut. And my gut tells me very clearly if I'm right or wrong, if I should do something or if I shouldn't. And I knew, my gut knew that I was doing the wrong thing when I was pursuing money back in the late 80s. And my gut knew that. But I didn't. So I learned now not to go against it. What do you describe as your gut? Because I had just had a wonderful podcast with Jane. And we almost spent the entire talk trying to sort of describe what this was, this thing. She calls it energy and thinks it's quite physical. And yet not. I know. I'm still trying to articulate it for her as well. So I'm curious, you come up with a way of describing it because you must come across a lot of people that go, what is that? What do you mean by intuition? How do I find that? Yeah. I suppose I describe it in looking at the fact that we have three minds. We have a conscious mind, which is only about 3% to 4% of our mind's capacity. We have a subconscious mind, which is massive in its capacity. And that's the other sort of 96%, 97% of the capacity of our mind. And then there is a superconscious mind. And that's the connection to all knowledge. And I understand that. I guess I have intuition about things that I know hasn't come from me. It's coming from somewhere else. From that superconsciousness that you tap into. I'm sure it's the superconscious. It's definitely the subconscious because for all of us, our subconscious knows a lot more than we do because it's orders of magnitude more powerful. And I think the other misconception that people have is that our mind is inside our brain. Our brain is our brain, but our mind is completely different to our brain. And our mind is much more significant. And I've done exercises where I can extend my mind out to certain distances. I can pull it back in. I can sort of extend it. So, for example, when I'm teaching, I extend my mind out to include the entire classroom so that the classroom is learning subconsciously. And I know that they pick up a lot more subconsciously than they're picking up consciously. And you differentiate that from the word spirit then. Some people would call that spirit or something else. Probably it's not spirit. I think that's just a reality. But I think that if you go into the superconscious, then you're into spirit, more of the spirit world. And you can physically communicate with your subconscious by using tools such as dowsing. And I use a pendulum a lot if I need to confirm something into my conscious mind. But I think that, you know, I always say that your mind is not your brain. Your mind is much more significant and much greater and much more widespread than your brain. So I separate it. And so I separate it into three levels. The conscious level, which is where most people live most of the time. The subconscious level, which actually runs your life, whether you know it or not. And then the superconscious is where we can connect if we... And that's the level at which Jane and others are operating, where you can connect at all sorts of different levels. And once you get into the superconscious, you're then dealing with consciousness. And I don't understand. I can't define consciousness because I've listened to lots of people who are very high-level scientists and very high-level thinkers. And they're still struggling to define consciousness. But the latest that I've been coming across is that we all stem and that everything that we are and do stems from consciousness. And so do you use that... Like when you say you wait for people to be ready to listen to you. So when you come into a situation with people where you feel they want to know, but they can't get past their own blocks that prevent them from knowing or being able to assimilate the information, yet there's a willingness. What do you do to work on to help them at that point? That's a process there. So what we do is we run the Grazing for Profit or the Farming and Grazing for Profit School. And that's a seven-day, very, very intensive program. And what that is designed to do is actually blow people's minds open. And we introduce them to the concept of paradigms. We start talking about the mind, the subconscious, how the mind operates, and as well as all the practical stuff around farming. But it's integrated, and it's a process, not a course. And through that process, people's consciousness lifts and their ability to deal with their paradigms changes. And it's not to say that all their paradigms are going to be busted in one go, but at least some are. And then once you learn that you can bust paradigms and move into a different state, it becomes easier to do it again and again. Do you think that the fact that they're in a group and they're getting validation from others, having that change, is part of the work? I mean, you speak at some point about your executive... Executive link. Executive link having that effect by the group coming together and where they couldn't get that change at home, they could get it in a group. So do you think that's one of the critical parts of it? It certainly is. What you can do with education is that you can open people's minds up and you can begin to shift paradigms and you can give people knowledge. But knowledge by itself does not change a business or a landscape. Skills do. And it takes time and effort to convert knowledge into skills. Like, you know, if you wanted to learn to play the piano and you'd never played it before, that takes a lot of practice to be able to play that thing over time. And so if you don't put that hard work into the practice to develop the skill, then you won't actually get the outcomes in your business, your family or on your landscape. So what do you think is the thing that's stopping people from doing that? What do you find is the single barrier to that? And when you observe people trying and not doing it, is it laziness or fear or...? It's a combination of lots and lots of things. But we can all find excuses. And whether those excuses are laziness, whether it's we're too busy, whether we don't have the money, you know, we don't have the time, all of these things are excuses that we can all put up for ourselves. We all do it all the time. I still do it on all sorts of things. So, and I, you know, I know I'm doing it, but you just can't stop yourself because we're programmed and we're programmed from very early on to deal in a certain way. And one of the reasons that change is very hard for all of us and learning new skills is hard is that when we're learning something new, the brain does it in the frontal cortex. And that takes an enormous amount of energy for the brain. And the brain says, look, I don't really want to put all this energy into learning these new things. It's hard. And you've got to force it to. But what happens is that as you develop a skill, those skills then become unconscious skills. So the brain shifts those skills to a different part of the brain and uses a fraction of the energy to be able to do that. So if I was playing the piano, initially playing the piano, it does your head in, right? There's too many keys and not enough fingers. And driving a car is a better analogy. Not everybody's on piano. But whatever it is, like it's driving a car or playing a guitar or learning to read or, you know, anything at all is a new skill. And that takes a lot of energy in the frontal cortex. And eventually the brain, once it becomes like what you would call second nature, the brain shifts it. Like it has shifted then. And it doesn't use much energy to do what it was taking a lot of energy to do before. That's just the physiology of change. So it's a tricky thing. We all face it, you know, every day. In terms of your handling of farmers, you know, 10% is an enormous number of people that you've been speaking to. Do you find that pretty universally you can get that idea of making it into a habit across the line and so they will try and start doing that? Or is it harder than that? I just don't know your exposure to it. It's their choice. People have got to choose whether to put that hard work in or not because it is hard work to shift. To learn, for example, just to go in and start changing your chart of accounts in your business. Start looking at your business in terms of management accounting instead of taxation accounting. Starting to understand your gross margins and what makes you profit and what's losing you money, etc., etc. Most of us don't want to know those things. So we're just happy to sail along and hopefully we've got enough money in the bank at the end of the year. So it takes commitment to go through that and come out the other side and realise, no, this was a lot easier than I thought. And now I enjoy it because it's so easy. But it was hard. I find it amazing how many people in the farming industry, I've always thought that that would be really critical to them is knowing how much their inputs cost and how much. And a lot of them don't even look at it. They just don't. I'm like, what? Having come from restaurant business where we look at every little detail, I'm like, wow. I don't know their inputs in and out. It's pretty obvious. But that's not. Yeah, that's correct. Yeah. And sometimes they know the inputs, but they're not well related to the outputs. And so a lot of business people and most people, real people, just watch the cash. If there's cash in the bank, we're doing okay. If no cash in the bank, well, we need to cut back on expenditure or earn some more income. It's as simple as that. So do you find when you're communicating it to them, do you find that talking about that bottom line is sort of like the in point for them or is it other areas? Is it more spiritual or general areas? Or what is the greatest thing that you think gets them motivated? I think it's the thing that really turns people on is seeing they shift ecologically in their landscape, finding more birds turn up, finding lizards that they hadn't seen before, finding grasses and plants turning up that they hadn't seen before, observing their livestock. And I love that you're talking about the ecological rewards because I think that people forget or have this perception that farmers don't care about the land and don't care about their animals because, well, they kill them at the end of the day. And it's hard to get across that concept that actually the land is the most important thing to them. The land and their animals and their plants are all massively important. So it's wonderful to hear you say that is the key reason that motivates them to want to learn more is because they're seeing that change. That's just wonderful. And knowing how to or understanding how to make that change is exciting. I think for 35 years now, I've been teaching people about ecology and how what they're doing in a production system interacts with an ecosystem. And I find that that is what turns people on. They just love it. It really is the first time it's ever been put in that context. And when you understand that context, the more that you work with Mother Nature, the more she helps you and the better your productivity is, the lower your costs are usually. So that's the paradigm shift so that we think that. And the other thing that really is impacted, and I've come across this time and time and time again, is that human health is impacted. As you heal the land, the land heals you. And that is a very, very common theme. That's interesting because a lot of farmers live in really desolate areas from a food point of view, ironically. Like they might grow a crop or something and there's not a shop for miles to buy a diversity of food. So unless they're growing and they may live in an area that doesn't have good, you know, not a good vegetable grow zone for, you know, for the diversity of things that we need. And yet you're saying that even with those conditions around them, the land itself and fixing the land is healing them as well anyway. Yeah. So I think if you look at some of the farming systems that operate today, the farmer gets up in the morning and decides what he's got to kill that day. Yeah. When you make the shift to working with Mother Nature instead of against her, you get up every morning and you get excited about what's going to live today. And that is the difference. And that makes a difference to our own soul and our own being and our own, you know, enjoyment of life. Mm-hmm. And it's that when you can make that shift and get on that, that sort of today that's called the regenerative journey is getting up to make things live every day. And that doesn't mean to say things are not going to die. So, you know, at the end of the day, your animals are still going to be slaughtered for food production. Your crop's still going to be harvested and processed, et cetera. But to me, the living thing that we've got to deal with is the living organisms within the soil. That to me is where the paradigm shift is. What's got to live is what's in the living soil. And if we just focus on that or even reducing what we do that's harming soil biology, we'll start to see a shift. We'll start to see a turnaround in our agricultural systems and in our own health. And are you seeing change in the ones that don't want to listen to you by the – like, I keep being amazed by how the looking over the fence thing didn't happen. But is there getting to a critical mass now? You referenced it at one point where there is a critical mass point. Because that was five years ago, I think, that interview I listened to. Is that changing? Only occasionally. It's very difficult for neighbours to look over the fence and then decide that, well, maybe what we're doing is not the right way we need to change. Again, what you're saying to yourself is, well, if I was to change, everything I've been doing for the last 20 years or so is wrong. It's actually not. It's just that there's something new and we've got better knowledge than we had 20 years ago. And therefore, we need to respond to that better knowledge. And it's not a criticism of what dad did or what granddad did or what I've done previously. It's simply knowledge changes and circumstances change, markets change. You know, all sorts of things are changing all the time and we just need to keep up with that. Yeah. Look, I think that's a really good point because you're bringing it back to – I think people do get very caught up with being invalidated or feeling wrong for things. I think that's – I have to say that was the thing when I came and saw the Peter Bick movie. I ended up seeing it three times because I went to Tasmania and Canton. I loved how Peter was so particular about not making anybody wrong. You know, he was so non-judgmental. And, you know, the farmers listening, that was probably one of the key feedbacks because there was a lot more farmers responding in the one in Canton. And they all said, oh, you didn't make anybody wrong. And it was like, wow, that was a real standout. For people. And it must be hard not doing that for it to be such a big thing. It must be everybody does it. Yeah. And I think that's been one of my big lessons. I think when I started out and I had so much opposition, I had to basically be a zealot to survive. And that probably wasn't good. And in the way I was doing things in the past, I was probably making people wrong. But I've learned that everyone's on their own journey for their own reasons. And we've just got to accept that and that we don't have all the answers for everybody. I do think that Peter Beek, just for those of you who don't know, we're talking about a movie called RootsSoDeep.org. And it's really quite wonderful because he's managed to get all these maverick scientists together to prove that the stuff that we're talking about is correct. But I think he was in a unique position because he was a filmmaker and he wasn't trying to pitch an agricultural practice to a farmer. He was just kind of have a look at it and let me have a study of it. And he didn't say anything to them about how they should do it. He didn't try and tell them to suck eggs. So it was kind of a unique position, I suppose, for him to be in, to be able to do that. So I thought it was great that you brought that movie down to Melbourne. We've had a great response to it and to the work that Peter's done because it tells the human story, not just the science story. And the fact that the human story is far greater in the movie than the science story. And I think that's where it's at. All change is a human story. Absolutely. And I have to say my limited experience of walking on farms has been that whenever I encounter a farmer and his wife that are happy, the land is happy. It's like it's almost correlates. And if you walk up the drive and there's this distressed farmer, the land feels distressed. It's not just like you can see the land first and then see them and you can almost know it's going to be that way. It's kind of fascinating that it's so correlates. And you would have that, I would imagine, much more than me. Yeah, no, it's absolutely right. And you can drive down the road and sometimes you see a farm and it just says, I'm sad. And you feel for it. The land has a consciousness as well. And we can work with that consciousness. So I think, yeah, it's responding to our thoughts in particular because our thoughts are very, very powerful. Our emotions are even more powerful. So when we get emotional, we're positively emotional or negatively emotional about things. And we have an accelerated impact, if you like, on the consciousness around us. I think that's why, I certainly talked to Jane, that's why she used to just work with animals and she now just works for people. She said the animals taught her, but the people are really where it was all at, was helping them work out whatever they needed to work out. And then the land would change around them. That's correct. People got to change first and then they can change the land or their change in attitude will change the land, which will then heal them even more. It is a circular thing. And the more success you have in changing the landscape, the better your own health gets. Yeah. And you spoke about that by what you did through the work in your school. So you spoke about that in your course, that that's what you were doing quite a bit, was getting through to that point. And I suppose the reason I wanted to bring it back to this is from a business point of view, because I believe that the world is currently in a flux where with Trump coming up and saying no climate and people are talking about dictatorships everywhere. And there's this huge flux in business and life in general. I think people are struggling to see a way through. And I think the point of what you've just said about getting back to what's internally about the balance that the rest of it kind of all works out around you once you get that part right, when you work on yourself. And these tools that you've been discussing about how you go about doing that, I think these are things that are needed in the world at large, whether it's in business or family or relationships or anything that you're looking at. But that how to get back to that core point of intuition and balance within yourself and finding tools with which to do that, I think is great. And you did mention one of the tools that you'd read a book that helped you. I'm going to go blank on her name. What was the key book that you read? It was probably The Field by Lynn McTaggart. By Lynn McTaggart, which I have read myself. And I wondered how if you do give that book to many people to read. I don't actually. But I do recommend it where it's appropriate. So not everyone is at the ready to dive into consciousness, which is what that book is about. And it's also very heavy on quantum physics. It's hard to read. I found it hard to read too. So I was just wondering, did you have any other books that you or tools that you recommend for people that might be on that point or looking for something to try and help them with whatever they're going through in life? Yeah. So there's a couple of courses that I recommend. One is the Dawson program. And it's about human health. And that was one of the first areas where I started to really get involved in this at an energy level. And it uses what's called vibrational kinesiology. So it's about frequencies and vibrations to do a lot of healing in humans. Some of the things that I've seen outcomes from just a session on that is mind-blowing. What we can do just with energy and with intention. There's two three-day workshops you do over a weekend on that. And that's a website. There's a website, I think it's called the Dawson program, where you can track down those courses. They're not run all that often. They're run annually, but not all year. Are they in person or online? They're in person, yeah. That's going to be local to the person. It's a hands-on course where you're learning to dows and to be able to diagnose and also then correct issues in yourself and your close family. That's the first one. The second is we bring Patrick McManoway out to Australia once a year for a month now. And he runs courses called, we call it Quantum Leap. And there's several levels of that. So there's basically level one, level two. And then there's what we call the, anyway, it's where the people that are experienced get together and have a round table. And Patrick's out here at the moment. So I think his courses are booked out. But that group now has also got several consultants in Australia that can do what Patrick does along similar lines to Jane. So Patrick is a Scotsman, but he lives in the US. He trained initially as a medical doctor, but his life is really healing in other ways now. So people in America can find him and go to him over there? Yeah, I don't know how many courses he runs over there. He certainly does consulting over there. We run a lot of courses in Australia. A lot of people now have done that and incorporated that into their daily lives and businesses. So the Dawson program focuses on the human, on using subtle energy in human health. And the Quantum Leap courses, they focus on using subtle energy in agriculture, so in land and livestock and water in particular. Again, amazing changes in land, livestock and water when you use intention correctly in some of these areas. So there are places, a couple of places that people can go on. I think there's probably a website for Quantum Leap, Quantum Agriculture. And just touching in on that with the water thing. Now, I read Philip Mulvey's book on the small water cycle, which I thought was wonderful. I don't know if you read it or not. Yeah, I think too, but I haven't got to it yet. Oh, it's a really great book. I quoted a lot of it when I wrote my own book on carbon. So a lot of people, there's always this contention people coming up with going on about, why do we talk about carbon? It's biodiversity. Why don't we talk about water? It's water. Water is everything. And I'm always saying, look, you can talk about carbon, water or biodiversity because they're all intertwined. You have to have all three of them working. So it's pretty difficult to measure water and biodiversity compared to measuring carbon, which is a stable element. But I would be very interested to hear what your observation is with all the carbon knowledge you have and all the agricultural knowledge you have about this intention factor in the small water cycle and how it affects it. What have you observed with that? And what does that mean? I think there's two levels here. People can learn regenerative agricultural practices and implement those and you'll get great responses. But those responses generally will then plateau. And I find that if you then go to another level yourself in terms of understanding the energetics of landscape, vegetation, soils, animals, etc. And working at that level, then you can take that landscape with you to another level. So I think there's those two sort of places. The majority of people pull up the first level and don't necessarily get to the higher level. But more and more people are starting to really understand that there's a lot more than simply the physical stuff that we do. I suppose that would be the hardest thing, though, is to get across those hurdles. I mean, you've got to look at things as gradients, I suppose. And most people are going to go, let me look at the science and then go, okay, we're changing the science. And now you're talking about how to do it physically. And now you're talking about how to do it mentally. And now you're talking about how to do it energetically. It's a big gradient learning gap there. It is a gradient. And it's a journey for everybody. It's a journey. And some people can make that journey quickly. Others can take a lifetime for that journey. And some won't complete it in this lifetime. So I think it's definitely a journey. That's a very, very good way to put it. So in terms of water and carbon, I think there's a very well-known sort of relationship between carbon and water. And the more carbon you have in the soil, the more water the soil can hold. So for example, you know, one of the properties we measured recently, they've added 32,000 tonnes of organic carbon to those soils. And for every tonne of organic carbon, you will add somewhere between four tonnes and 10 tonnes of water holding capacity to that soil. So at six tonnes per tonne of carbon, that's 200,000 tonnes of water holding capacity added to that property. That has a massive impact then on biodiversity, small water cycle and productivity. Yeah, I think that people underestimate just what we're talking about here because they just think, well, the rain falls out of the sky. How many litres or tonnes is that? Who knows what that is? And really what we're saying is you've got two farms next to each other and one will be rich with biodiversity and birds and animals because the water's been able to penetrate the soil. Like it starts with that penetration. If it can't get in, nothing else is going to happen. It'll just run off. Thank you for raising that. And would you believe that the scientists that are currently opposing what we're trying to do do not understand that? They think that productivity is driven by rainfall. No, it's driven by carbon. You know, and I know, and lots of other people know, that it's not how much rain that falls that's important. It's what you do and how much of that you use. So if we're in a rangeland situation, in a degraded rangeland, we might get a 400 mil rain. But if it's degraded, we'll only effectively use 10% of that. That's 40 mils out of the 400 that falls. Amazing, isn't it? So if we turn that around and manage that landscape and steward it back into health, it can use 75 to 80% of that rain that falls. So it's not how much rainfall. It's what you do with it and what the landscape can do with that rainfall once it falls. And a lot of our scientists just don't understand it because they measure rainfall and therefore that's what's got to influence things. Well, it's one of the reasons I like the Hegarty's land because they've had some of their highest yield and highest protein years recently with only 188 mils of rain in desert land, which they have through energetics and regenerative agriculture have made be highly productive. And even when presenting that data to the scientists, they wouldn't go out on the land and look at it. They just didn't want, they wouldn't look. Nicole Masters was presenting it in a workshop I attended and she said they just wouldn't look. And the scale and the graph is just off the wall and they wouldn't go out and look at a scientific convention. She was amazed. They just, they don't want, they don't want to break their paradigm. They don't want to undo all their work. That's correct. And it's no different from us breaking paradigms. Scientists are the same. You know, they've got their careers invested in the science. They did their PhD in or their masters or what they learned at uni. And that's their truth. And if your career is based on a particular truth, it's very, very difficult for you to change. Is there any way in the science, I know nothing about the university system, but is there, is there no room in the university system for a scientist to completely flip on their original statements and come up with new information? Absolutely not. They'll get slaughtered. They won't get funding. If you go against the existing paradigms, your funding dries up, you're ostracized. You know, there's quite a lot of discussion online around that sort of stuff now, around what's happening in the universities, which used to be bastions of truth and discussion and, you know, rigorous debate. In a lot of cases, that seems to have disappeared. You can't debate things as a truth. And if you step outside that, then you're in trouble. Is that because they used to be funded without needing to get a grant? They used to just, they could just do whatever as, as a, you know, a person searching truth within the university structure. They had money paid to them for just an employment, like a salary. So it was a different structure. I don't really know. I think some of them are still on salaries, but I don't know the reason for the shift. But it's certainly shifted in probably the last 40 to 50 years. Again, it's gradual. There's a journey that the universities are on. A journey to destroy themselves. Yeah. And hopefully they don't because we actually need. Yeah, we do. We need them. But I think the way they're going, quite a lot of them are self-destructing. And eventually funding will dry out. And I think one of the things that is an outcome of this is that society today is very skeptical of science. And I was at a conference recently where a very eminent scientist and a professor and very well regarded in her own field was saying, you know, we need to trust the science. And my question to her was, how do we know what science to trust? And she said, well, yeah, I know that because I trust the people that I read their papers and I read them deep enough to know whether it was done well or not. And so on. And then in the end, she said, very hard for you to know what to trust. Well, also because even in your statement, in your question, you're assuming that the basic premise of the information that they were doing their research on was correct. If it's based on an incorrect premise, then everything they're writing is wrong. It's like doing calculations with a held down number on the calculator. It's just not going to come out with the right answer. So we do seem to be, or what was it, I suppose you could say the world was flat until we realized it wasn't. How long did that take for us to realize? Yeah, a very long time. It took us a long time. So I suppose we're a ways off yet going back to real science. Yeah, I mean, and I think it's a great analogy because you look at what happened to Copernicus, you know, he was put in a tower and mopped away for the rest of his life, basically, for saying that, you know, that the earth revolves around the sun and not the other way around or whichever way around it was. And so, you know, that's still happening to scientists today that step outside the norm, put in a tower necessarily, but kicked out. Well, that's why I'm admiring you and giving you, you know, like an extra tip to you for having stood by your values when you made that decision to get that congruency between your values and what you were doing for money. Because we all have those moments where, you know, we get access to money and it means we've got to let go of something else, whether it's family and work and time or, you know, those life balances and those life choices are really important. I remember one time I met with you and you said, I walk with my wife pretty much every night. And I thought, that's a really wonderful thing because it means you're putting that in as one of your priorities to not only for your health, but for your relationship with your wife and spending time just being with her. And whether you talk or you don't, it's kind of irrelevant that being this thing is really important, particularly out in nature when you're walking around. Yeah, so we still walk together, but we do it in the mornings. We take the dog for a walk. She was busy today and didn't come for a walk with me. Generally. Yeah. And I think people underestimate how some of those very simple things that we sort of take for granted, like if you don't have a dog, maybe you don't walk all the time. But I have noticed that the people that do that regular taking time to just be in nature, it balances even the craziest minds that I've met. I've met some pretty crazy minds. That does fit. And it keeps something back in balance for them. Yeah. If I'm finding myself a little bit unbalanced, I'll just go outside, take my shoes off and just stand and earth myself. Yeah. But I love, you know, after we go for a walk, I love just going into my veggie patch and just getting my hands in the soil and digging and planting and harvesting and so on. Getting some of those mycorrhizal fungi fumes back up into your body. Yeah. People underestimate how powerful that is because we've evolved with the fungi, with the earth, with the soil microbes. And I always say that to people when they talk about all these things like prebiotics and probiotics and all those things. I say, you know, it would be really good just to get like pull a carrot out of some healthy soil and inoculate yourself with some of the microbes that are there because the microbes are so critical to our overall health. And I think the pandemic was terrible for destroying our relationship to microbes because we became so silly about it. Do you feel that you've had any way of sort of counteracting that in the circles that are, they were particularly silly about it in Victoria. So I'm still aware of them walking around with masks. I essentially refused to participate in the silliness. So I went to the office every day, right through the entire process. I did because I needed to fly. I did succumb to two injections. Hard, wasn't that? Yeah. And I regret that. I admire when one of my daughters refused to get vaccinated and her husband refused to vaccinate her kids and they suffered for that for a while. It was hard. Now they're benefiting from the fact that they didn't. And I think so I'm a little bit ashamed of myself for actually bowing down to get two, but I've never had another one since and won't. We were hoodwinked through that process. And I think it was a salient lesson. Society is to. I think it was a one of a kind, didn't you? I mean, to get the entire planet hoodwinked like that is a kind of an extraordinary moment in our collective history. It is. And it is. The science behind it was well known. And back in, I think it was the 60s in the US, there was a university that did some work on trust. And I found that if a person in a white coat being a doctor or a scientist told you to do something, regardless of what it was. And they set up experiments where they had people in a room next door and they had you with a dial in front of you. And you could dial up the electricity to hurt the person next door, depending on what you were told they were doing or what their responses were. And when you were told to do that, people that would consider themselves to be very normal, I think it was about 50% of them killed the person next door when they were basically told to dial this thing up by somebody in a white coat. And so that science was well known and effectively used by Fauci et al. during the pandemic. Do you not think it's eroded our trust in doctors now? Absolutely, it has. I mean, the majority of people- There's all good people out there who were so attacked. Absolutely, it's eroded it. It's eroded, again, it's further eroded our trust in science and it has certainly eroded our trust in doctors. There's no doubt that- But how has that helped a cause like whatever Fauci was trying to do? It helped the big pharma. There was a lot of people who made a lot of money out of it and that's what it was about. But not long term. I think more people are moving away from anything to do with it because of it. Yeah, that's the population. But the pharmaceutical companies made an absolute fortune. It still is to a degree. Because people are sick so long. Well, now you've got long COVID and you've now got vaccination damage. So you've got more people sick as a result of the vaccination. But anyway, those are my views on it. Look, I have similarised as curious what you were saying. Yeah. All right. Look, we've spent an hour, so that's probably long enough. You've probably got things you've got to go to. I do, actually. Thank you so much for talking to me, Terry. And as always, I'm fully behind what you do with Carbon Link. If anybody wants to know if they do would like to get their soil measured. We didn't really talk about the carbon space. But not only does Terry educate farmers, he also has a measuring company for measuring carbon if they would like to do the Australian Carbon Credit Unit and for selling it. You did mention in one of your podcasts that you were working with somebody to develop a different system outside the ACCU into Europe. Did you manage to do that? No. So Europe is actually getting down the track now of starting to allow soil carbon credits. And that might happen at 26 or 27, maybe 27, 28. So they're not ready and there's no scheme there where we can do it unless it is voluntary. And there is a group in the UK doing some voluntary credits on soil. But we'll probably wait until it's sort of more ready and we're more ready as well. Yeah. All right. Well, lovely talking to you again, onwards and upwards. I'm sure we'll get there in the end. Thank you, Sam. And thank you for the research that you did and the great questions. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
