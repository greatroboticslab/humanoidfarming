Howto & Style
 What do we have here? Woo. Let's give it that pull. Okay. Not bad. It took me a few seasons to figure out how to grow carrots well, but I finally did it. So in this video, I'm going to show you everything you need to know to do the same. That little bit of soil just hits right. Very first thing you got to figure out guys is the variety that you're going to grow. There are so many different carrot varieties. It's actually really fun to poke through catalogs and figure out which ones are the ones for you. But as far as the actual gardening decision you have to make, there's not a whole lot of variance. It's 55 to about 70 days for these bad boys to get big enough that you can pull them out of the ground. And so the only consideration you want to make is size. Do you want to grow something in a container or a smaller space? Maybe a little finger, maybe Tonda de Perigi, or then you've got the stuff that grows really well in ground or in raised beds like Danvers, Shin Kuroda. And then you just have to say, what color do I want? Obviously orange is the classic, but you can grow a rainbow mix. You can grow the Scarlet Nantes or you can grow one of my favorites, which is the Cosmic Purple. Any one of these that you choose will be planted at the same time in the exact same way. So let me show you how to do it because that is where people go wrong. It's planting their carrots. Okay, let's figure out how to plant it in ground. That is the hardest way to do it. You can apply this tip to in containers or in raised beds as long as you do it right. So I'm going to just pull a trench out. But if your ground is super tough, like this is, we've been walking over it like crazy. You may just want to loosen it up just a touch because obviously carrots are a root crop. They want to get down in that soil. So if you've got some like hard clay, that's why all of the world record carrots are grown in a mixture of sand and compost because they just need a little bit of that space to kind of spread that taproot down into the soil. So I'm just going to loosen this up a touch. Okay, I'm nice and loose in the soil now. Now I can come through with my tool and just drag a very thin furrow out. You can use the board that I've got right by my knees as well. If you want to, you can do something like this. Just go kind of like that. And carrots want to be planted relatively shallow. In fact, it's about a fourth of an inch. So you'll just do that fourth of an inch by the amount of soil you spread back on top. So what I like to do is I'll just do it in a trench. So carrots want to be spaced like an inch or two apart, but it's very arduous to space many, many rows of carrots that way. So most of us will just plant the packet by kind of dragging it out. I learned this technique from Jacques. It's the Jacques Tickle is what he's calling it. And you just kind of come through with a crease in the packet and you just tap your seeds down the row and try to modulate it so you get a nice amount of seeds. But you're going to have to come through and thin these out no matter what you do. So there you go. I've got the seeds laid out, but what I want to do is just gently cover. I've noticed that it doesn't matter if you go more than a quarter of an inch deep, you could go to a half inch. It's just going to take a little bit longer for them to come up. This is where you can go wrong though. It's what you do after this point when you're growing carrots is your first potential big opportunity to mess them up. So let's cover these up. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to water this in immediately. I'm going to give it a pretty thorough water just to make sure I hydrate the seeds. But carrots can take, I don't know, 10 to 15 days to sprout, which is a very long time to make sure that this soil stays nice and moist because the seeds are pretty delicate. So one thing you can do, it doesn't really matter what you use, but a two by four board is pretty good here, is just throw this on top and kind of press it down and leave that for those 10 to 15 days. That way the soil underneath will stay moist and they won't dry out because if they start to sprout and dry out, that's where they'll die off. And then you have to reset the process and the carrots just won't do that well. So while these sprout, I'll take you back over to the patch and show you how to care for them once they're up. So we're back over at old Carrot King Kev's patch and that's my new nickname. These are grown. These are ready to harvest, but I'm still going to show you how to properly thin them and the effects of thinning them at this stage of their growth because that's probably the number one thing you can do wrong after not sprouting them correctly. So let's go ahead and take a look underneath the canopy. So here's a look at some carrots that are growing here. Like I said, most of these are ready to go, but you can see how I've spaced them. So take a look right here. If you think about the width of a carrot, let's say a carrot's going to grow to about an inch in diameter. Well then you need at least an inch between the middle of that carrot and the middle of the other carrot right next to it. Otherwise they're going to run into one another and compete for space. So what I did when growing these is when the tops were about an inch or so tall, maybe a little bit longer, one to three inches tall, I came through and I actually pulled carrots out of the ground. Those carrots obviously aren't here now. So you can see an example right over here of a carrot that you'll call maybe a little bit of a baby, failure to thrive. So take a look. These are the types of carrots I pulled out about 30 days ago in this little section here, of course, across this entire row. It's really important to do this because otherwise you're going to get a ton of these carrots and you're not going to get too many of these style carrots. And this one's actually still a little bit small because you can see I didn't thin these out as perfectly as I could have. Whereas this one and this one, I guarantee this one's just a little bit larger. It is. And it has the opportunity, if I let it keep growing to get even larger. So another little tip on thinning is if you wait a little too long to do it, it's not the end of the world. If you're thinning really young when there's not even a baby carrot developed at all, you can actually just come through and clip at the soil surface, the leaves off because then it won't thrive. It's going to decompose and you're in a good spot there. But if you've waited a little bit longer, you can actually pull out baby carrots. They'd be about maybe this size and they're actually delicacies. So it's a good way to multiply your harvest while still thinning out and letting some of these big ones develop. But thin to about a minimum of an inch, I would say maybe two, three inches if you're being a little bit more aggressive or you're growing a bigger variety. But besides that, carrots really don't need a whole lot. They need adequate water across the season. You want to grow them in the cooler parts of the season. In fact, you can actually grow carrots from late winter into spring and you can also grow them from late summer through fall, even through winter because they're going to kind of be in nature's refrigerator. They'll be sitting in the soil preserving themselves and you kind of pull them out when you want to eat them and they get quite sweet when they're harvested in the cold. But there are a whole host of ways your carrots can look that will suggest a particular problem. So I want to rapid fire through some of these situations you might find in the garden right now. If your carrots have poor germination, it likely means that you haven't kept the soil consistently moist. So follow the board trick. If your carrots have tiny thin roots, that means that you didn't thin them out. So follow the trick I just told you. If your carrots are sort of woody and dry, you either waited too long to harvest them and they started to mature past the point of being harvestable. Or if they're young, woody, and dry, that means you gave them inconsistent water. If your carrot tops actually start to produce a flower, well then you definitely waited too long to harvest them because they're now bolting and going to seed. So you can harvest it, but it's probably going to taste pretty bad. If your carrots don't form one large taproot and instead form a cluster of small, little carrot roots, that typically means you've given it too much fertilizer, specifically nitrogen. If your carrots have short fat roots, and it's not because you grew a variety that is designed to produce short fat roots, it's probably because your soil is too hard. So follow that loosening tip you saw me do when I was germinating the carrot seeds. If your carrots are forming a decent taproot, but are small and stunted, it could be a mixture of things because carrots are relatively sensitive, but one common cause is too much heat. So you may want to put it under cover or grow it in a cooler portion of your season. If your carrots are super hairy, I like to call these herrits, you actually have a disease called Aster's yellows, which is a bizarre name for this disease, but it is incurable, and it's caused by an insect called leafhoppers. They spread it around. So if you want to avoid it, you really have to prevent the leafhoppers from hitting your carrots in the first place. And there's a ton of info on our blog actually about how to do that. If you have thin spindly carrots, but they're decently well developed in length, it probably just means they didn't get enough resources when they were growing. So not enough access to sunlight, water, or maybe your soil didn't have enough nutrition. This happens to some of my carrots that are in the under canopy of the beets that are in the middle of the bed that I've been showing you. So carrots are a crop that I hesitate to say I've mastered, but I've certainly gotten a lot better at growing them than when I started over 12 years ago. Thinning and germination, the absolute most important. And don't forget that you can actually turn your carrot tops into a beautiful carrot top pesto. But for me, I tend to throw it over to my hens.
