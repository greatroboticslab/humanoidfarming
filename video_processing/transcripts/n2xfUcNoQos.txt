 Did you know that bees have feelings, experience pain, can count, and even enjoy playing? The science and the behaviour of insects and their feelings is expanding, and our previous view that they are merely emotionless tools that support our ecosystems is changing. It's not just bees we're discovering more about. Ants are quick learners that look out for each other. Wasps have social skills. Locusts have an exceptional capacity to estimate distances. And cockroaches demonstrate different levels of shyness when exploring new and unfamiliar environments. The science around insects is growing, but there's so much more to learn. Insects make up over 5 million species, yet research on them is scarce compared to what we know about vertebrates. Right now, 9 species of insects are authorised for farming across Europe. At the industry's current growth rate, the EU could be farming insects by the trillions by 2030. It's critical that the latest science on insect sentience is taken into account in the policies surrounding this industry, and that steps are put in place to protect the welfare of these sentient beings. They might be small, but make no mistake, insects are animals too. Find out more.
