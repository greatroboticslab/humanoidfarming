 Music Alright, this is something that we also built here on the farm during the same time we were doing our concrete pad over there. This is an inline fence speeder. We took the lumber that we had over there. Both of these ends open up and we can put two round bales in there at a time. This, because we used the salvaged lumber, we did buy the four posts. The four posts were purchased and the metal roof was purchased. The concrete, there's only about three yards of concrete in this. So, I haven't put a full figure on it, but it's more like $2,500 range on this particular project. So, I always look at it when you buy a hay ring and I can put two round bales in there. That would require two hay rings. There's a $600, $700 investment there. If you have a bull in that field, he'll smash that hay ring out the first year. So, anyway, we think this will help us. It's a permanent structure and it will keep the cattle out of the mud. If you turn your camera around, you'll see a brand new baby cat that was just born and hadn't even stood up yet. Anyway, alright, so back to our hay facility. There is a cost to the roof, the cost to the slant bars. But what I say, as mentioned before, I think that by the time you buy hay rings on a regular basis, this will pay for itself in three or four years.
