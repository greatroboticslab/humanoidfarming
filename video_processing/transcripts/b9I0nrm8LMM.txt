Obviously we all know it comes with its own issues. The main diseases that we're having to deal with when we're grazing Lucene is our red gut and also clostridial diseases. So red gut, we see it in Lucene because it's a highly fermentable and really easily digestible pasture. We particularly see it when we only have a monoculture, so only Lucene. We don't have a combination of grasses and something more fibrous to break it up with. The way it's happening is that we have in our rumen, normally that's breaking down our really fibrous feed. So with Lucene that's moving through really quickly and we don't have it taking up as much volume as it normally does. So we have a rumen that's a really small volume and then it shifts to being mainly digested in that cecum, so in our intestine. And that means that we have gas production in our cecum. So we have a smaller rumen and an enlarged cecum, which means that they're able to shift around in that abdominal cavity. And that twisting actually includes our blood flow and that's where we see the disease and a really sudden death occurring. So it typically takes three weeks for red gut to develop. So one of our main ability, our main method to deal with red gut is to do five days on Lucene and then two days off. You're sort of breaking that cycle and by putting them onto a pasture that has more fibre in it, you're able to build back up that rumen size and stop that process from occurring. So when we are grazing Lucene, another option that we tend to try and use is having a hay in there with them. It's obviously hard to get them to want to eat that hay rather than the lush Lucene. It's a bit of a balancing act, trying to keep them on Lucene, which is such a productive feed, but not seeing that disease occurring. So our clostridial diseases are what we're vaccinating against with our five in one, our six in one or our TAS. which is our eight in one. The most common one we'll see in prime lambs on Lucene is pulpy kidney, so enterotoxemia. The easiest way to be preventing against this is to be vaccinating before and making sure they're up to date with their vaccines before going on to a really lush pasture. It's that sudden change in feed. Normally a six in one will be more than enough to cover them, but if you're having particular issues on farm, sometimes eight in one, our TASVACs can be really helpful. Sometimes if we're having a delay between death and then doing our postmortems, it can be confusing if you're doing your own postmortems that you're looking at red gut because you will see a really inflamed intestine in there. So another point to remember when we're grazing Lucene is that it actually, the plant itself is storing sodium in its roots rather than the leaf matter, which the animals are actually able to eat. So supplementing salt has been shown to increase growth rates. They've done studies in prime lambs showing it like quite a significant increase in growth rates by just providing them with some less salt. it can be Church Quaroo Salis abi. Now, it's more expensive compared ник significantly as an altitude of the terrenaz like that. It is really good at large business. I've approved entirely mine at présent and the Сам are gorgeous across the bay using a lower ruler of the plate like that. You create the band itself up. Always a big deal here, and you can check out our hands yourself with this. To make sure that the process of mentioning psychologicalacre, that's been optimized for your personal life, and you can expect consistent behaviors as well by your downtime. Nevermind speaking in the teaching. Thank you.
