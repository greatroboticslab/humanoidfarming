 The Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the places where the agriculture is most promoting because of the volcanic soil. We have been doing agriculture as a long-term impact activities in Hopin Crisis Fund and we have been working with low-income communities based in Mujia villages and we have been working with youth and women who are most vulnerable in economic side and we have been teaching them how they can use the ground that they have around them as a source of resources. So I have been teaching them how they can do farming and how they can plant different roots so that they can be very beneficial for their economic life. We have been doing the project of potato plantings as one of the priorities that we have been taking with them and we are showing in less than three months we have got the Everest of potatoes and the community was very proud about the result because this have helped the community economically and they have committed to start another project of sweet potatoes in the same weeks so they can have the Everest in December that will have a huge amount of money for their benefits. So thank you for supporting this agribusiness in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and we hope that everyone who wants to support this will come and they will join this action. We remember you for change. Thank you.
