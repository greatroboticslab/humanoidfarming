 I bought some worms so that I could take my garbage and turn it into fertilizer from my garden. All I had to do was get three big five liter buckets, drill holes into one, place one with no holes at the bottom, and then I filled the bucket that had holes with some soil, eggshells, coffee grounds, cauliflower leaves, anything from my kitchen that I was gonna throw out and compost, but now it goes in the worm farm. Got my worms and put them right on top of all of that. Then I added another layer of a bunch of stuff, and the top bucket with no holes can then lay on top. So basically the worms will eat your scraps, poop, and the poop will fall through the holes in that middle bucket, and the top bucket will start to sink down, and when it starts to lower you know that it's ready, and you can add more food. Just when you add you gotta mix it up so the worms don't fall through the holes. I'm very excited so come back to see what worm poop looks like.
