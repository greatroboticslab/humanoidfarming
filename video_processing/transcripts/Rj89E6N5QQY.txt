 Whether you grew tulips this last spring in the ground or in a container and now you're wondering what you need to do to store them for this next winter or you want to use the same space for something else, I'm going to show you what to do. Start digging up your tulips, kind of look at them real quick, squeeze them, then make sure there's no rotting pieces. The next step is to get the excess soil off of these and we're just going to do that with our fingers and our hands here because the soil is really really dry and these are very dormant. The soil is really moist and it's doing a really good job of sticking to the bulbs. You can rinse them off with some water. Using either a cardboard box or a plastic storage bin without a top, you want to fill it with shredded newspaper and then what you want to do is you want to take your dried, cleaned bulbs, kind of mix them in there, make sure they're getting insulated and covered. Next, place your bulbs in a cool, dry, dark location, preferably a shed or a garage, where you can keep them for the rest of the summer until you replant them this coming fall or the next late winter, early spring. So we hope that was helpful and thanks for watching!
