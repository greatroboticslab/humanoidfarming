 Have you ever wondered how a pumpkin grows? It takes about 120 days. That is about the same as four months. Let's take a look at where it all begins, starting with the seeds. First, pumpkin seeds are planted in soil. With a good amount of water and sunlight, in about a week, little sprouts emerge. Over the next few weeks, sprouts grow into long vines with big green leaves. The vines can grow even longer than you. They can even climb fences or other structures. Around eight to ten weeks after planting, bright yellow flowers bloom on the vines. These flowers aren't just decoration. They are actually the start of where the little pumpkins will form. Bees also like the flowers and stop on by to pollinate. Over the next two to three months, these baby pumpkins gradually get bigger. Some pumpkins can grow incredibly fast, adding several inches in circumference or how round they are in a single day. During this time, the pumpkins also change color. Most will turn orange, but pumpkins can be other colors too, including white, green, and blue. After four months with more sunshine and water, the pumpkins grow larger and eventually reach their full size. Pumpkins are mostly made of water, around 90% in fact, which is why they need so much of it to grow. After they have finished growing, they are ready to be harvested. But the pumpkin story doesn't end there. Inside each pumpkin are many seeds. You can save these seeds to plant next year or even roast them for a tasty snack. From a tiny seed to a fully grown pumpkin, the life cycle of a pumpkin is quite a journey for a plant that can be used for decorations, recipes, or whatever else you have in mind.
