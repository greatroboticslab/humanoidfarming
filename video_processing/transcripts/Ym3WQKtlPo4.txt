 Hi guys, I want to share with you the system we've been using here. We're basically planting using the power of grass. As you can see we've got a bed of trees and then we've got a corridor bed of grass. And what we're doing here, we're cutting the grass and feeding the tree. So every other corridor is for supporting the tree. Or it could have been a veg system or anything else. So this is really interesting because here we've used processes. You know, really processes of life to produce this fruit. You know, I've harvested bananas here and we've got a few exciting things coming up. Basically, it was a system with really no manure. Just a little bit of the horse manure but no chicken or cow manure which is, you know, more nitrogen. So the horse manure, I understand, is going to bring a little bit of information to the soil. It's a little bit more complex. It's not going to be so plain. So we call it information, structure and matter in the soil. But it won't give it that nitrogen, you know, and all those other fancy nutrients that plants really thrives for. So we're really producing this through processes of life. We're really counting on the life in the soil to produce those fancy nutrients. And how we maximize the life in the soil is by covering it. We know that already. Giving it a nice bit of shade, a nice organic matter. So the work here. First, we've got to pluck some of the very, very basic weed that's growing spontaneously in the tree beds. Right? If you pluck it at the right time, you really don't need to be coming back so often. Just that one, you know, little quick pick of the weed. Just lay it down. And we're not worried if it's something that's going to sprout. Because it's not going to sprout because we're going to cover it with lots of grass on top. And it really is going to eliminate all the little weeds that we don't desire for here right now. So we lay the banana matter around the seedlings to give it a high level of water. And we're going to use the seedlings to give it a hand. Okay? Just to give it that extra support. In the drought season, this is really special because it guarantees the irrigation. And then we cover it with the grass and that really guarantees irrigation for a good two to three months. That banana can hold the moist in the soil. It is the rainy season, but nevertheless, we've got to feed the soil the same ways. It's important that we chop up the leaves. Otherwise, it creates that kind of like isolation where the water won't reach the bed, you know. It will hit the leaves and run down to the corridor. So we need to chop up the leaves to make sure the water is coming through all the little ripped gaps. So we got a clean. We did it for 2 hours or 5 minutes. They fell. It's not good. It's won't hurt. We're going to have a remote Siobas or whatever. No, we need to report right away. And you need to remember, right? But if you list this before the shift with 20, it's going on the climax. Now you have coming toризower. And you don't have to go toおおismана. And just think about this. Bright guy is coming out. It seems like that. You are always working on a hmmsp simulator. Then we have doing it. the yeah yeah Plotdown, sc fringe. Looks very thick before��base. Go to ? Government could make sure different that, right? Thank you. Thank you. Right, so that's it. The work's on the way, right? So we cut the grass as you've seen, okay? If this was in large scale, there are ways around it. There are machinery that will come in and cut it and already throw it into the bed for you. So this is very practical, this is one of the main systems for large scale agroforestry. The principle, we use this principle in large scale. We also took the opportunity to give the citrus a nice trim. And we've gone ahead with all those trees that we planted and we made a nice little bed for it. We planted it with the seeds on the bed already. We've gone selecting some of the weaker ones and removing them. So we've left two or three of the strongest ones. So we already started selecting the seeds that sprouted. Therefore, facilitating and promoting the competition between the two or three stronger ones already. So from the Agroforestry Academy crew, let us know if this was interesting. If it might work for you in your system. Thumbs up, thumbs down, comment. Let's talk about it. Bring me your doubts. And sign out till next time.
