 In metropolitan areas across America, development is replacing agricultural land. When farmers see their neighbors selling land to developers, they can conclude that agriculture as a local way of life is waning. To protect agriculture and remain rural in the face of development pressure, local governments often need to enact an array of easement acquisition programs and planning and zoning tools. Political will backed by public support is also needed. For almost 50 years, Carroll County has worked hard to keep land in cultivation. Its agricultural land preservation program is highly successful and ranked among the best local programs in the nation. In 1973, Carroll County's first comprehensive plan included a goal for preserving farmland. Five years later, the county created an agricultural zoning district containing about two-thirds of land in Carroll County. Agriculture and agribusiness were established as the preferred uses in the agriculture zone. Residential development within the new district was restricted to one lot for the first six to 20 acres, then one lot or portion for 20 acres, plus three conveyances from the original parcel. Carroll County also has two rural legacy areas. The county complements the state programs with its own well-financed purchase of development rights program. The county program offers two payment options, a lump sum at settlement, or an installment purchase option that features tax-free interest payments over 20 years. The creation of the installment purchase option increased landowner interest in the county's land preservation program. The county program tailors its easements to protect conservation values on each individual farm. Easement language is added to create 50-foot stream buffers on properties with streams and to require landowners to work with the soil conservation district to prepare total resource management plans for their properties. Through these efforts, Carroll County has preserved more land through the state's farm and preservation program than any other county in Maryland. The county has achieved 75% of its goal to permanently preserve 100,000 acres countywide. In addition to conserving high-quality soils for agricultural production, the county is protecting wildlife habitat, improving air quality, mitigating downstream flooding, maintaining lower tax rates for property owners, and improving water quality in local rivers and the Chesapeake Bay. By preserving farmland, Carroll County also protects its economy. According to the 2017 U.S. Census of Agriculture, the most recent year available, Carroll County sold more than $110 million in farm products, more than $72 million in livestock, poultry, and their products, and almost $38 million in crops, including greenhouse and horticultural products. Recognizing its success, the Maryland Department of Planning extends its congratulations to the Carroll County Agricultural Land Preservation Program for winning a 2021 Sustainable Growth Award in the Preservation Conservation category. Hi, I'm Ed Ralstein, Carroll County Commission. Carroll County is very proud of our Agricultural Land Preservation Program, and I'm pleased to accept the 2021 Maryland Sustainable Growth Award for Preservation and Conservation from the Maryland Department of Planning honoring this program. Operating since 1980, Carroll County's Agricultural Land Preservation effort is the most successful in the state of Maryland, preserving more farms and more acres through the purchase of land preservation easements than any other jurisdiction in Maryland. In fact, this program also ranks among the top five similar programs administered across the country from local governments. In fall of 2020, Carroll's nationally renowned land preservation effort reached the important milestone of 75,000 acres permanently preserved. This is three quarters of the way to our long established goal of preserving at least 100,000 acres to secure a successful future for Carroll's farm community. Once again, I'm humbled and I'm very proud to accept this award on behalf of Carroll County Government and the many people who contributed to the success of this program. We also send the biggest thank you to all the farm owners who participated in the program. You are ultimately the people who make the program work and are responsible for the beautiful landscape that will forever exist in Carroll County. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
