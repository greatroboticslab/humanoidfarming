 production enhancement in banana crop II HR technologies banana is a second most important fruit crop after mango in India having rich nutrients and minerals it is preferred by all age group people in all seasons selection of a variety for a specific agro climatic situation its spacing planting material selection nutrient management disease and pest management and reducing post-harvest losses are the important technologies for growing this crop dr. B. Narayan swami principal scientist IHR explains spacing for banana is six feet by six feet for cavendish for remaining all varieties seven feet by seven feet the recommended dosage of nutrients for banana crop is 16 tons of form yard manure per acre the recommended dosage of NPK for tissue cultured banana is 200 100 and 300 gram of NPK per plant for suckers it is 175 gram of N 105 gram of phosphorus and 220 gram of potash per plant it has to be applied in four split doses banana special it is a popular micro Newton formulation developed by IHR Bengaluru banana special is having micro nutrients essential for the crop season dosage is five gram of banana special per litre of water with a shampoo sachet and two lemon for 20 litres of solution it is recommended for canopy spray for five times first spray can be taken up at the fifth month of the crop second spray sixth month of the crop third spray at seventh month of this crop fourth spray at ninth month of the crop fifth and the last spray can be taken up at tenth month of the crop fourth spray at ninth month of the crop it can be covered the bunches also fourth spray at ninth month of the crop bunch feeding of nutrients can be taken up effectively after the tenth month of the crop bunch feeding of nutrients will definitely enhance the productivity of the crop after the full emergence of third spray the crop of organic fruit in the crop as we use 7.5 gram of sulphate of potash plus 7.5 gram of urea plus 500 gram of fresh cow dung in hundred ml of water in 100 ml of water stir it well and take it in a plastic sachet mix all these nutrients thoroughly cut the male flower in sixty degree angle by by leaving 9 inches from the bunch. Tie the entire sachet to the cut portion and leave it for 15 to 20 days. All the nutrients will be absorbed by the bunch. These techniques definitely enhance the productivity of banana at least by 18 to 20%. Friends, adopt banana bunch feeding technology for better yield and quality. These new innovations from IIHR are a boon to the banana growers. For further details, you can contact the Director, ICAR IIHR, Hesargatta, Bengaluru, 560089 or phone 080-230-86100 or contact Dr. B.
