 G'day guys, how are you? Over behind me at the moment that's Simon, he doesn't want to be seen so we're covering his face. There you go. Now we're just putting some hay in here and I'm being lazy because Simon's doing all the work. But we're putting some hay in here and Simon just gave me a tip and I thought I'd share it with you guys. So check this out. You see there Simon is putting that hay on its end. You can see that's the ends of it and that's where it comes across, it's tied in. So we put it on the ends and why do we put it on the ends Simon? Keeps the moisture out. Keeps the moisture out. So if you put it flat on the ground like that, onto the concrete, it's going to suck up the moisture and going to go off. If you put them on the ends for the bottom layer like that, they won't suck up the moisture as much. So there you go, little tip for you and then you can put them on top however you want to do. And here's another little difference that you might not know if you're buying hay as well. So this one here is green, this one here is brown. So this one here is six weeks older than that one. So they go brown on the outside. Once you break that open, they're beautiful and green inside. If you have a look into there, you see they're beautiful green in there and they're all good to go. So a lot of people get turned off by these because they're brown, but they're prime lucen. They're just shedded. There we go. So we've got our, that's grassy lucen in there. So it's just grass with bits of lucen mixed through it and all the rest of it. This is the prime lucen. And you can see there, you've got some that are green, some that are brown down the bottom there. And what was the difference, Simon? So that there's your fresh stuff. The hay here is probably about a week old. And this stuff here is about six weeks old. About six weeks old. About six weeks old. And you can see where it's broken open a bit there and it's green. So you got, you can see it there. Look at that. Brown, green. So that's six weeks older than that one. That's your prime example. Prime. I thought it was funny. Simon doesn't think I'm funny. Doesn't like being on video either. So like I said, we don't normally put our hay into here. We've got the hay shed for that. But at the moment, Betty's laid up with her bung knee. So yeah, nice and easy for everybody to get to. And there you go. It's all hooked in on pellets. And ready to go. We've got our lucen. Got our grass. And we're good to keep the critters fed and happy.
