 So is there really a difference between farm fresh eggs and eggs that you would buy from the store? So let's crack these two eggs side by side in the same pan, farm fresh, store bought, so you guys can see the difference between these two yolks. So first we're going to start with the store bought egg. So if you look at these two eggs, you can see the store bought one is definitely more of a pale yellow, where look how bright orange the eggs from our chickens here in our backyard look. Not to mention that these ones taste a lot better.
