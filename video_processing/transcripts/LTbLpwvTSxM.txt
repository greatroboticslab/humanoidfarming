 A few more combinations of vegetables that really grow well together. I have another 3x8 garden bed with a trellis right in the middle. Here I combine a pumpkin plant with pole beans, cucumbers, zucchinis, holy basil and peas. And just to try it out I also added tomatoes and mizuna. And if you have a small space you can still do companion planting in containers. Tomatoes grow well with many herbs like summer savory. And this one's one of my favorite combination planting carrots with peppers. And if you like herbs a lot they're the easiest to grow together. They don't require much room to grow and you can do several combinations. My herb box includes mint, lemon balm, thyme, sage, feverfew, savory, scallions and parsley. They're very low maintenance but when it comes to mint you just have to be careful.
