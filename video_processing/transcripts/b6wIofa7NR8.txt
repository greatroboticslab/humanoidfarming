 Here are the seven things that a new sheep farmer are gonna need to know if they wanna start doing sheep. Number one, sheep carry a barn with them on their back. In severe weather, they'll take care of themselves. Don't overthink it. Just provide them a windbreak and a place to get out of the rain. Other than that, they're gonna be fine. Number two, the breed is not as important as you think. Don't overthink it, go with what works. See what your neighbors are doing. Raise sheep that work around you. Number three, realize that you are not actually a sheep farmer, you are a grass farmer. If you work on growing grass, your sheep are gonna be fine. Number four, your biggest concern is gonna be parasite management. Keeping your sheep free of parasites is achieved by rotational grazing, culling your sheep, and relentlessly watching your flock. Number five, you will have losses. It's just part of the game. Number six, you will pull your hair out. Sheep are very frustrating animals. And number seven, my personal favorite, you're gonna love it, sheep are great. Isn't that right guys? Yeah.
