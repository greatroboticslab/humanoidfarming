 Do you rent machinery for your commercial or farming business? Hi, Doug Green here from Air Farmers Mutual. Do you rent machinery for your commercial or farming business? Always make sure that there is sufficient insurance coverage in place when equipment that you do not own is in your care, custody and control. If the value of the rented equipment is over $100,000, your insurance company needs to know. Our Paramount, Commercial and Supreme Farm packages max out at a $100,000 limit. If the equipment is valued at $100,000 or more, we should schedule or add it to the policy for the duration of the rental. There are two ways you can insure equipment that you are renting. Option number one, take the insurance coverage offered by the rental company. Make sure that the coverage is sufficient to cover damage or theft and that it is a sufficient limit to cover full replacement of the equipment, including taxes, freight and any tariffs. Or, talk to your agent or broker before renting equipment to set up coverage with your insurance company. Your Air Farmers Mutual Paramount Commercial or Supreme Farm packages may have sufficient limits and coverage and your agent or broker can advise you exactly how to proceed. I'm Doug Green from Air Farmers Mutual. Thanks for watching.
