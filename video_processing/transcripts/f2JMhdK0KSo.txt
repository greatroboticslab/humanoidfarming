 Luis Alfonso Abril is a Colombian cowboy singing about living in harmony with nature. It is man's responsibility to conserve what God gave, he sings. But for Abril, this is more than just a song. It's a way of living. Abril produces everything he eats. He proudly says the only thing he has to purchase is salt, rice and clothing. A decade ago, when Abril bought his finca La Esperanza, Farm of Hope, things were different. The 136 hectares of land were up for sale because the land was said to be infertile. Now it's home to 50 cows, pigs, chickens and a wide variety of vegetables, fruits like bananas and mango, as well as carbohydrates like Colombian yuca. How did things change on this land? Sustainable cattle ranching. It all starts with a healthy soil. He stopped using traditional cattle ranching practices like burning grass to fertilize the ground. First, we eliminated drugs used for our cows by veterinarians and second, we eliminated the use of burning crop residue to fertilize the ground. Zero crop burning because we were killing microorganisms with this practice, but now they can grow in the soil. Abril explains that cow manure is a host for microorganisms that help regenerate the soil. Without the traditional use of antibiotics and anti-parasitic drugs on cattle, beetles like these grow in abundance in cow dung. Alfonso says his cattle was grazing here a day ago and it looks like a delicious salad because there's eight different species that they could eat from on this ground for five days. Another thing that helps produce healthy forage is the quick rotation of cattle on the property. Pastures recover faster, soil's ability to retain water improves, and carbon is captured and restored. All these practices contribute to food security and climate mitigation. Michelle Bege, Casanare, Colombia.
