 Like all plants, the growth stages of marijuana plants go through several distinct phases prior to maturation. In this brief video rundown, we highlight the stages of marijuana growth that you'll need to be able to recognize to help produce a healthy, potent crop. Germination simply refers to the sprouting of a cannabis seed in soil or hydroponics. Under proper conditions, cannabis seeds will usually germinate within 48 hours. However, in rare instances, it can take up to 7 days for a seed to sprout. After successful germination, the next identifiable growth stage of cannabis plants is the seedling stage. Seedling cannabis plants sprout from the soil and almost immediately begin to develop familiar visual characteristics. During the seedling stage, plants produce two initial leaves that open outward from the stem to start receiving sunlight. Soon thereafter, trademark cannabis leaves begin to grow at the top of the plant. It's also during this marijuana plant growth stage that the plant's root system starts to develop. Cannabis plants typically remain in the seedling stage for two to three weeks, after which they'll enter the all-important vegetative stage. Before we move on to the next stage, we'd like to remind new viewers to go ahead and subscribe to the Way of Leaf channel here on YouTube.

By the time the vegetative stage comes round, cannabis plants should have already been transferred to larger pots with soil that includes appropriate NPK ratios. During this stage, marijuana grows rapidly as it takes on more nutrients and carbon dioxide. Vertical growth increases on a daily basis, with some plants gaining as much as 2 inches in height in a single 24-hour period. After successful maturation from the vegetative stage, cannabis plants will enter the flowering stage, which many growers consider to be the most important stage of all. During this stage, plants require a 12-on, 12-off light cycle. This is crucial for the development of flowers, which are the plant's reproductive part and are where the majority of THC is concentrated. Temperature, humidity, and nutrient content are all crucial during the flowering stage as well, especially for growers that want to achieve potent trichomes with ample amounts of THC-producing resinous glands. Depending on the growing conditions a cannabis plant is exposed to, plants can remain in the flowering stage indefinitely. After all, plants, including cannabis, don't really have a specific lifespan. When it comes time to harvest, growers will want to be sure to adequately prune, clip, dry, and cure their flower. After all, even perfectly grown cannabis can end up a complete waste if mistakes are made during the harvesting process. So that's it, the 4 major growth stages of marijuana plants.

You know, whatever of this video is helpful andなら, is this scary in the beauty of that you've got to be sure to participate in it? Well, I need to be sure that I Keith can add that either, but there's a condition that doesn't assume I think the Ned's injected and spokeenzie, Bosco Allen. But that goes nuts. I hope I've been saying for him twice a while. I'm a missed person and supervisor. Alright, thanks for your circulation on LinkedIn and other times, and take the 1970s.
