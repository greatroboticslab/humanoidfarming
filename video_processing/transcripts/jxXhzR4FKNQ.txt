 Folks, those rippling waters of the Gulf, the surf coming in on the sand, the smell, the sounds, the seagulls, and this bear and son knife. They'll all serve you well. That's right. Aluminum handles. We got the pocket clip. Screwed together design, and it is a lock back. Super satisfying. And these are just $29.99. You can pick them up in our store and on our website for the Gulf of America at smkw.com. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
