 Good afternoon, I'm Jamie Norris with Sun South in Brundage, Alabama. We're going to cover a few maintenance tips, some pretty basic things on your 5075E tractor. It's probably one of the most popular tractors we sell around here. So we're going to start by taking a look under the hood. If you come around to the side, you can actually see we've got screens. We've got screens that come out between the radiator and condenser. It's handy to keep it blown out, keep debris from getting caught up in there, making your tractor run hot. This tractor is equipped with a clear glass on the bottom of the fuel filter, where you can just easily look in and see if you need to drain the water. There is a drain plug at the bottom for easy access, just to drain the water off. Your air filter is right out front of the engine, easy access to be able to just change. Quick and easy. And while you're here, it's also a good idea, you can check your coolant. And also to make oil changes easy, John Deere's got the oil filter right there on the side of the engine, easy to get to, easy to put a strap around and change. We've also got your battery right here, easy access shields along the side of the tractor, make it easy to get to. And behind this panel right here is very easy access to your air conditioner, air filters, to keep them clean. They are known to get stopped up in dusty conditions. Checking the hydraulic oil on your tractor is very easy. There's two sight glasses on the back of the tractor. Your oil level should read between those two. As you can see in this case, we're right on the mark. Perfect. And that'll pretty much wrap up. A basic just kind of check over before you hit the field. We covered several points to look at to help ensure the longevity of your machine and reduce downtime. Just stop by your local SunSouth. We'll be glad to help you out with some of these service tips.
