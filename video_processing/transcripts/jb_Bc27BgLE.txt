 I'm Jason Kalsaman, one of the agronomy specialists with Canola Council of Canada. We're doing some scouting on some early bud stage canola and we're seeing some ligus bug feeding on these buds. Research indicates that some ligus feeding can actually stimulate yield and help the plant produce more buds, but under less than ideal conditions these plants may not flower and an application of insecticide may be warranted. Continue to scout, check your fields and if you're looking for more information on ligus bug thresholds go to the Canola Council encyclopedia at canolacouncil.org
