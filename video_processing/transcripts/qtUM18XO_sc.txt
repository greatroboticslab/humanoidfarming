Science & Technology
 By 2030, the world's population is projected to rise from more than 6.6 billion people today to more than 8 billion. How will we feed this growing population? One way is by using biotechnology to improve crops, to produce more food on less land, and use fewer resources. Farmers have embraced this technology. They've seen improved crop yields to feed growing populations sustainably. We'll see you next time.
