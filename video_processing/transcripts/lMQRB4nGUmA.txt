 My name is Thao Obankole from Forest Centre of RIT. So the reason why we are here today is to educate farmers, vegetable farmers, how to grow vegetables of different varieties. I'm telling them different habitats that different vegetables like. Not every vegetable that grows in all the habitats. Some vegetables like shaded area, some like sunny area. And we educate them about different varieties. They need a kind of conditioned soil, soil with organic matter. When they have organic matter in their own soil, the soil can control erosion. The soil can retain water perfectly. And another thing that we thought then is that different methods of propagating the vegetable. Like some, when we are using seeds now, we call it broadcasting method. Then drilling method. After making the bed, we drill the bed and put it on the bed. Then we can also broadcast the seed on the germination of the bed. Yeah, but when we are propagating stem cuttings, we don't do broadcasting. We call it direct sowing. We put the seed, I mean the stem cuttings, on the bed directly. Soil sterilization. This is done to kill any harmful microorganisms. These are the steps to follow to make a soil bed. Decide the dimensions of the bed. Removal of debris and stones. Tillage. Tillage. Tillage. . . . . Tillage. . Raking and leveling. Peg it out 1 meter by 2 meter. Application of treatment. Treatment can vary based on preference. After treatment, you should cover the soil bed immediately. Planting occurs 24 hours after treatment. Example, if I treat my soil bed at exactly 8 ARC OAM, I'm expected to plant by the same time the next day. Planting process. Certain plants have seed dormancy, a state in which plants such as sheochor would not germinate when propagated due to unfavorable environmental conditions. To break this barrier, seeds to be planted have to undergo extreme conditions, one of which is immersion of seed in hot boiling water, 100C or extremely cold water, and 15C for varying hours followed by 7 days of refrigeration after which planting occurs. Planting has three methods. Drilling, broadcasting, and direct sowing. Selecting seeds can be strenuous as some types can be very tiny. So to select them, a process called concocted flotation is used. In this process, the seeds are immersed into a bowl or a bucket of water. Seeds floating upwards are considered as the bad ones while the seeds floating downwards are the good seeds and can be planted. Weeds can absorb soil nutrients more rapidly than plants resulting in competition between the plants and the weeds. To curb this, avoid poor crop yield and protect the environment from herbicide pollution. Certain agronomic practices are carried out. Hand weeding, hand pulling, hoeing, and mulching biweekly. Mulching. To control weeds, retain soil bed water, reduce evaporation, and add nutrients to the soil. Mulching material decays and becomes humus, organic matter, which retains water content in the soil bed. Selecting the right seed varieties through extraction and seed cleaning. Removal of inert materials and perforated, damaged seeds that may have insects such as weevils, beetles, affecting the yield of the others over time. I soil conditioning by using compost or manure. Soil changing. If you notice the soil getting weak, you can change it. Medicinal plants and vegetables with their benefits. King of bitters. Helps treat malaria and reduce menstrual cramps and high blood pressure. It can also be used during states of fatigue or tiredness. Jute malo. Is good for ulcers and pregnant women. Yanrin. Yanrin. This is good for the eyes and for treating diabetics. It will be juiced and oil added to it. Ugbono. Is good for infertility, but drinking water soaked for five days with its roots. Justicio circulum. This is a blood booster and purifier. It also prevents high blood pressure. Unripe pawpaw. If soaked in water for four days can be used to treat chronic ulcers. Diagnosed patients should drink a glass of this water for 21 days. Jatropha. Can be used to treat toothaches, spinal cord pains, and back pains. Sorsop. Used to treat insomnia by boiling its leaves and drinking it. It's also used to treat fibroid and bacterial infections. Sorsop. Music. Sorsop. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. All these things, now that they are not outside you, they are only getting in the natural forest, even all plantations in the natural forest that are there. They are a very long time species. Maybe like 50 years ago now they have been existing. I am healthy, very healthy. You are doing conservation, you can conserve your home. Try to, you can get the wet leaves. Wherever you go to, get the wet leaves. My name is Joshua Begatoli. I work in the forest unit. I am in charge of medicine and medicine. So what you have learnt today, part of the training as well, is really encouraging. Because people that came here, they knew more than before. And just to let them know that all the plants we have here, they are very, very important. And also to treat, for the plant's teeth, and also to cure. Some of the things that we have shown there now, they really embrace it. They want to practice their own, in case maybe another training. They would like to know that. They would like to be very happy, very excited, very educative as well. So we would like to work on them anytime. My name is Ajigola Nazifatolanyika. I am a vegetable farmer. So, the major thing I learnt today, though I am a vegetable farmer, so I do cultivate tomatoes, kukumba, pepper. But what I saw today, is quite different from what I have been doing. I learnt about some herbs today, like moringa, spinach, and delights. So, we don't need to be going to hospitals. I saw most of the HITA people, staffs today. And they are healthy, they are looking fine. Unlike people outside, you see us, like you just look at me now. I am big. I don't know about the herbs. But what I see today, I am so amazed and I am so happy. So, thanks to HITA, thanks to the organisers, we are very happy. So, I will go out there to tell people about their programs and their stuff. My name is Amalia Kwemi Sande. I heard about this, you know, farmer's outreach online, which I applied. And though my intention was, you know, all these fruit and vegetables, but when I entered this place, I saw different things. I have learned a lot of things from this place. So, some of the things we can use, because if you are not healthy, there is no way you can, you know, farm. There is no way you can feed the nation. So, I saw some of the plants that I have never seen before. I saw some of the way that, you know, you can treat some of your crop on the farm. So, it has been very, very impactful. So, there are some crops or leaves, I mean plants, that were introduced to us. So, which by the grace of God, maybe I will try to get some of it, then I will multiply it. Then, also, I will teach some people around me, so that they can benefit from it. Thank you very much. My name is Omolola Dari, and this has been an amazing outing for me, an amazing training for me, organized by Radio IITA. I really look forward to learning a lot about vegetables. I am a young farmer, and one of the things I learned today is we actually have vegetables that are medicinal, and we have some others that are, you know, for food items. One of the insightful things I learned is about the medicinal plant, and I look forward to actually learning more and making use of it. This training has really impacted me. I know that you don't have to actually go to school to learn about all of these plants. IITA has that provision. You can come here and learn, and this training has really helped me to achieve that in learning about common vegetables I have around me that I don't even know are medicinal. So, with this, I can learn and also improve my health, and I'm really thankful for this opportunity. When people are overlooking the streets for me, I ask for a while to pray for good walks and de 발 Girl questions when you get proof of thinking of manibo or someone else. I encourage you to speak speaker if you are there like the communication with philosophy and a man escola that has naturally shaped food at home, and needy vêbings. You also have the gathered and of those who make food available. This means to be very protective. 낮 بلی后 س связ They mouی بوجیم دونی Danی روید مارکÍ N TFŁB 30 nerves رویم Thank you. Thank you.
