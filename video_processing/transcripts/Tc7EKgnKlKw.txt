Science & Technology
 Hello everyone, I am Debra Chakrabarti, Cedar Analyst in Agriculture and Food Vertical at BIS Research. It is my honor to present you today's webinar, Farm Management Software Enabling a Trusted Supply Chain. BIS Research has been tracking the agriculture and food market since the past seven years. While several smart farming technologies have been introduced over the years, Farm Management has stood out due to the combination of benefits it provides to the whole agricultural ecosystem. Farm Management Software provides a convenient and effective solution to the problems of handling large amounts of data generated from farms which are larger in size. Farm Management Software provides a lot of information about the farm. The software ensures the utilization of each acre of a farm to its maximum potential. Immense interest shown by professionals and students from various organizations across the world and from agriculture and food supply chains through registration show the amount of potential everyone sees in Farm Management Software. For today's discussion, we have an esteemed list of speakers. Guillaume Antoine Rabai, a management board member and Chief Digital Officer at Agrivi. Guillaume is in charge of designing the product strategy, monitoring the different lines of product development and overseeing all technology partnerships. Guillaume Antoine Rabai, a significant experience in scaling up fast growing teams, projects, as well as implementing digital transformation in bigger corporate settings. Guillaume is engaged within local startup community gatherings where he shares best practices for product development and successful go to market strategies and is a regular speaker in the creation media to share his views upon the future of agriculture, scale up strategies and product marketing. We also have Om Rautrey with us. Om leads global marketing at SourceTrace. He is very passionate about bringing forth the social capital that technology can bring. He brings 14 years of experience in the field of digital marketing, community building and knowledge creation. Om has also set up the Agritech initiative at NASSCOM and led it for two years. Om is also set up the field of digital marketing, building alliances and exploring global opportunities for the Indian Agritech sector. He has been featured at ET Now's Leaders of Tomorrow show. He regularly writes for various national and international publications. also we have with us our host speaker, Rakhi Tanwar. Principal analyst at BIS Research, Rakhi has been tracking digital technologies in agriculture for past seven years and currently serves as the principal analyst at BIS Research. Her specialization ranges from digitization in agriculture and food industry, crop protection chemicals, new farming methodologies to human and animal nutrition. Rakhi's work has been printed in Agrom pages magazine and has been quoted by various agriculture food magazines such as CNN International and among others. I thank all the panelists for their gracious presence. So let's discuss about the agenda for today. We will start by highlighting the key issues currently affecting the farming industry and understand the need for farm management software and data analytics for a sustainable future. We will also emphasize on the use cases of farm management software across the agriculture and food industry, followed by the adoption scenario and opportunities across the globe. In the next 40 minutes, we will all keen to learn from your knowledge and experience about farm management software and data analytics. And towards the end of the discussion, I will open the panel to the audience. For any questions, I would request everyone in the audience to kindly mute their phones during the webinar and type in the questions towards the end of the webinars. Any questions that we are not able to answer today shall be reverted offline. Having said that, let me open this panel for discussion and invite thoughts from Mrs. Raki Tanwar. Over to you, Raki. Thank you, Debraj, for such a thoughtful introduction. I would like to warmly welcome the audience and our esteemed guest speakers. Thank you for your valuable presence. I would like to begin by discussing the key global issues outlined by BIS research impacting the farming sector and generating the need for farm management software. There are various concerns such as rising urbanization, shortage of skilled agricultural workforce, the volatile climate and shrinking natural resources, along with the degrading soil quality and lack of transparency that are impacting the farming industry. All these factors are interlinked. Urbanization has led to shortage of skilled labor and conversion of cultivating land into urban centers. Due to which infrastructure has also had this has also adversely affected availability of natural resources that are essential for cultivation. During green revolution, the use of chemical fertilizers grew 10 to 20 times over the years with gradual increase in consumption of chemical fertilizers. Modern farming became dependent on these types of inputs. This has caused the soil to degrade and would continue to do so if sustainable practices are not implemented. To overcome these challenges, the adoption of digital farming solutions becomes crucial. Countries in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific among other regions are inclining towards adopting advanced farming technologies such as FMS and data analytics in order to increase the farm produced per hectare. Now let's understand how FMS is adding value to the supply chain. FMS and data analytics software has a huge influence on the entire value chain starting from managing inputs to the end user. It allows efficient resource allocation as well as helps in overall management of farming operations. FMS acts as a bridge between various hardware systems and sensors allowing seamless communication and control over them. This reduces manual efforts of record keeping, field visits, manual inspections, instead everything within the range is managed using a software. The information gathered using various sensors throughout the farming operation is very crucial. FMS allows farmers to optimize farming processes which increases efficiency. This could help in managing resources and inputs, reducing waste or overuse. The issue of degrading land quality can directly be addressed by efficient resource allocation and calculative input management. Data analytics manages, centralizes and optimizes the farm's production activities and helps the farmer in decision making, using that information throughout the production cycle. Through automation, instances of crop failure would decrease as the farm would be continuously monitored and required measures could be taken at the right time. Since farm management software and data analytics is actively transforming the agriculture industry, understanding the market in detail is crucial. For this, I would like to invite our guest speaker Om Rotre to discuss more on how farm management software is serving as an ideal solution. Over to you Om. Om Rotre I want to begin by thanking the whole NBIS research for organizing this and making us a part of this initiative. I want to begin by saying is, you know, as I mean, I guess there's a lot of information that you can get from various sources, but as it implements. I have a new solutions. Like to give up what we are seeing in different geographies that we operate in. Currently source operation. So we will. The sector is evolving and I'll probably take you through. Take three different case studies on ground implementation and impact. So yeah, they were if you can give me the next slide. So, you know, all of us know about the biggest issues that face food production, food supply and food trade. So, you know, the issues can be looked at three different segments. One is food security, which is, you know, the production and availability of food for all. Second would be food safety and third would be food trade. And we will see how digital platforms affect all three. Next slide. So, you know, we'll talk about the pre COVID and the post COVID world in a few moments. But before that, you know, these are the questions that the food world was trying to answer since forever. I mean, I've been a part of this sector for five years now, but I guess these were questions that were being asked even before digital entered the food trade sector. So, you know, all of us wanted to know where the food comes from. Is it safe to eat? Then you have compliance agencies and multiple governments in different geographies which are trying to regulate how food is traded, what food is traded and the ethics of it. So, you know, what we are looking at is digital solutions which can answer these questions better for all stakeholders. So, how do you collect, you know, all these data points and how do you transfer that to the stakeholders in a easy to share and consume and consumable manner? Next slide, please. Now, you know, when I started working in this sector, I mean, the questions that everyone asked as, you know, a budding technology sector is, you know, how much technology can seriously impact the world's oldest sector, which is agriculture, right? So, you know, until a few years back, I mean, we went to conferences and people told us that, you know, the best that technology can do is barely scrape the surface because the problems in agriculture are really deep and complex. But I'm happy to say that in the last two or three years, what we have seen is, you know, you can look at agriculture and food as a data issue. And at sources, what we do is we work with more than 1.5 million small farmers. And what we said is, you know, can you turn this, the farmer, the food and the consumer, can you do a data web that benefits all of them? So can I turn the small farmer into a data point as a product, as a producer, as a, you know, as a potential benefactor from that trade and also as someone who interacts with, you know, food businesses, with governments, with consumers, how do you empower a small farmer with data? And that's what you will see in coming slides. Next slide, please. So what is the data that we need? I mean, when you look at the, you know, we conventionally look at the technology and food and agriculture interactions as two different sectors. One is called agri tech. And once the food enters the processing, we call it food tech. But what platforms are doing now, and we at sources that precisely what we are doing also is breaking down that definition barrier between what's agri tech and what's what's food tech. So what it impacts is, you know, before these two sectors became concretely different sectors, you looked at the farmer, the farm, you know, pesticide usage, issues of deforestation, etc. As serious agricultural issues, and then you looked at food contamination, food trade compliance, importance, route, all that as, you know, smart labels. You looked at that as food tech issues. But, you know, as we started working with multiple governments and large multinational corporations, we saw that these issues are not exactly watertight. I mean, you can't exactly break them down into two different segments. Today, a consumer wants to know where the food comes from, wants to see, you know, who is the farmer. So the agri tech and the food tech, those barriers are being broken. And we look at farm management software or platforms or digital platforms, whatever you call them as the key instrument or the key tool that is breaking those barriers and definitions down. Next slide, please. So, you know, as I said, what does the farm management system do? It it aggregates data. And we look at we we monitor farms, we monitor farmers, we monitor entire ecosystems, beat processing, beat transport, beat warehouses. So we monitor food production systems and food transport systems. And then we. And then we. It is. It is. It happened via smart hardware, IoT devices. Weather reports, you know, unit. We all work with a lot of corporations where we are the digital interface that companies or corporations have. So we aggregate data from non digital formats. It can be extra seats. It can be paper pin formats. It can be a physical lab tested report that we scan and upload onto the cloud. So the aggregation happens in different ways and it also depends on who are the stakeholders and how, what, what tools they are using currently. Once that happens, you need to report that data to the stakeholder. So you are working with a compliance agency, you know, a rentree or a ferry or a import agency. It can be a government. It can be a bank or it can be, you know, we also see that a lot of our customers use digital for internal monitoring purposes. So you monitor different parts of the production system. We need to aggregate data from different partners, different tools, different stakeholders. Then the reporting happens if a good farm management software should also. Oh, reporting. It can be now reporting is. It is it also works in different ways. So for example, when we take a project with you who needs that data. Uh, the stakeholders and what should be the limit access to those data points. So reporting is a key part. Uh, you know, reporting like applications with dashboards, emails. So how need to look at that data then sharing now sharing is it can be within ecosystem. For example, let's say if you are a food company who you share it, the data with, you know, action workers, your contract farmers, uh, your, your importer exporter. And then finally, as you are seeing, you know, we are also gamifying, uh, the current part. So also sharing data with the, with the end consumer. Next slide, please. So, you know, post COVID we have a lot of data. So, you know, we will talk about digital and as I said, we will talk specifically about impact. Post COVID. Uh, and what if you have been saying in last two years is this, these are the impacts. That digitization and the platform platform platformification, if I can call it that is having on agriculture. Right? Next slide, please. So, you know, post COVID we have seen as a company, as a sector, uh, and also looking at the amount of VC fund that is flowing into the sector. We have seen that there is a significant uptake in, in platform adoption. Um, and why did COVID have that? First was as COVID was ravishing the world. Uh, we saw, we work a lot in, in the global south and we show that, that the farmers were having difficulty in going to the farms. Or for example, inspectors or compliance agents, uh, extension workers, all of them had difficult in, difficulty in monitoring the projects that they're handling. And a farm management software enables and automates that that monitoring. So, you know, uh, we're not, we're not exactly pulling human out of those processes, but we're giving them new tools. So, you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, that is. And. Uh, agents on the field. So that's one factor. Second was, you know, we, we. So that, you know, the unprecedented disruption in global global value chains, right? Uh, you know, sourcing, supplying, logistics, uh, lab testing, all those interaction points broke. So what we have done in a few projects post COVID is, you know, how do we. A aggregator with a warehouse agent with. Not parts that we are handling. Logistics was not a big part of what source stress did before COVID, but that's, that's probably a huge chunk post COVID. And the trust deficit. Uh, here, as I said, we'll talk about the consumer gamification. How do you build trust with the consumer or about where the food comes from? Next slide, please. And, uh, Rocky, can you please just update me once? You know, I'm closer to. I can wrap up. When you look at the. We're looking at. No, who is the creator of data? Where did the data from? Uh, who is the user? So we work with, uh, multiple governments, donor agencies, uh, MNC small cooperatives, which are less than 1000 farmers. So we work for us, the data creator of the data user is completely across the across the spectrum and format. As I said, you know, who are the stakeholders? What is their comfort with technology? We also work with, for example, you know, uh, Android applications, but we also work with. We also enable pushing data into non digital formats where the user is someone who does. have access to the police and mobile technology or Internet. Next slide, please. Now, uh, this is a. In a map for so stress, you know, we call ourselves a platform. What we have been doing is also constantly building on these such points. So for example, we have been in operation for eight years now. For the first few years, our expertise was in the first mile. Uh, farmer, farm, geo tagging of farms. Uh, you know, looking at the production processes. So, you know, if a company or a government is working with a large number of farmers, uh, you know, up until 2018, most of our projects had had 100,000 farmers or 200,000 farmers. So really large projects where, you know, data was a key issue. You didn't know who your farmer was, what he was growing. Uh, you know, their access to schools, toilets, uh, financial, uh, financial tools. So a lot of that, a lot of our work in first five years was bringing all these data online. The first digitization in many countries, uh, in around 15 African countries was done by us. So then I guess what we moved into is also, you know, having a, uh, AI, ML for pest and disease monitoring, uh, sending out weather data. Uh, and you know, in last two, three years, what we have seen is as we moved into traceability, what we have seen is how do you also, you know, once the produce leaves the farm and the farmer, how do you track it via logistics, processing, uh, in a storage, shipping, and then retail. So these are the components that we have built over the last four years. And now, uh, as a, as a, as a solution that started as a farm management software, we have now scaled into becoming a. I don't know, there is no term for it, but probably a value chain software. Uh, and as I said, what you are doing is breaking down the agri tech and the food tech parts of it. Uh, I'll give you one example. You know, uh, the latest problem that you're working on is how do you make the consumer interaction more interesting? Uh, we know that, you know, putting a QR code and giving origin data is a, is a first step and we are still doing that. I mean, I don't see that as a trend that is saturated yet. Uh, but we are going ahead of time. What you're doing is. You know, imagine if you can scan a QR code, you can see where the farmer, uh, you know, who grew the food and you can tip the farmer just the way you tip a delivery boy or a Uber driver. Right, so because we are collecting the farmers bank account numbers, et cetera, we can do that theoretically. We can do that. We still haven't, uh, done that in practice because we haven't. We don't have a consumer, a customer who wants to implement that part, but next two years. I mean, that's where you know, that's why we as a basically origin farm management software is moving towards, uh, towards consumer interactions. Next slide, please. Uh, next one. Uh, so you know what we will, what I'll show you is probably, um, this is one, uh, a problem that we're currently working on. So rice is put us from India. So, you know, traditionally this is done. Uh, the sourcing is done by via sourcing agents via, you know, locally called Arathias. Uh, and you know, uh, Basmati is a key export from, from India. Now, how do you turn the Basmati export into? Uh, a kind of a digital tool enabled trade? So. You know, currently most of the rice exporters don't have data of farmers. The data that they have is of sourcing agents. Uh, but they don't know where the rice comes to those agents. Right? So that's the first problem that you're solving. Second is most of these races actually go to a lab which takes 25 to 30 days. The rab report comes back. Uh, there is a delay, uh, for the company in, in looking at, you know, which agent give them better dice and who didn't. Uh, so we are also bridging that, uh, you know, that data gap and also the time gap. And third is, you know, now we you look at most of most Western countries who want to see what went went into that rice. What is the kind of pesticide that was sprayed? Where was it grown? Etc? Uh, next slide, please. Uh, next slide, please. So this is a project, uh, with Central Bank of Nigeria where we worked with, um, you know, more than 200,000 farmers, uh, you know, because it's a government agency, we could, uh, you know, collect biometric data of farmers. We could, um, in fact, if you can go to the next slide. Uh, so here there are multiple stakeholders that is a bank, uh, you know, that is a smart card, uh, agri stack, which is run by the government and then there are different partners, you know, uh, as you can see, I mean, you know, like n switch or, um, or the, or the, uh, and sorceress. So this is a good use case of what a farm management software can potentially do, right? So you can bring government and non-governmental agencies onto the same platform. And by making each and every farmer out of those 200,000 farmers, making all of them and all that transactions visible, what you're doing is you're giving them, uh, an entry into the formal economy. You're giving them financial history, uh, a record, which, uh, you know. As we can see, I mean, it also enables them in their future, uh, tradings with. Government and other agencies by giving them a formal financial history. Yeah, next one. Yes. If you could wrap up in the next two minutes, please, so that we could. Yeah, thank you. Sure. Give me just one minute. So I'll skip this. Uh, can we skip this and go to the QR code? Uh, next one. So this is for a global food major, a spice importer from US. So what we can, what we do here is you can go to the next slide. We put QR codes on, on each of the packets. And as you can see what we, you know, the data that we are capturing is, you know, where, uh, you know, the farm where it is grown, the farmer who grew it, what season did he grow it in? The trucking, the warehousing, and, uh, you know, the, the chilies go to the lab. They come back with a test report. We, we also digitize that. And last screen that you can see is. Well, you know, what is the name of the pesticide and how often the farmer spread it? And did he follow the protocol which is set by that particular company or not? So, uh, you know, and all this data can be transferred through the end consumer no matter where he is. So this is the potential of a farm management software. And this is how the data can be transmitted to different agents. Uh, so I'll, I'll probably just wrap up here and wait for any questions if there are any. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Uh, over to you, Dion. Yeah. Hello, everyone. Thanks for having me tonight. So, um, and hello everyone from every places in the world. I saw there is someone from Columbia as well, and from India, I guess. I guess so thanks again so what you may have seen from the Holmes presentation is actually that FMS is a quite complex business and that it's actually something very comprehensive with a lot of potential use cases so what I'm used to doing when I'm having this kind of like webinars is first starting by telling you or telling the audience a secret so this is my secret to you guys and my secret is actually that farm management software are not very easy to sell having said that if we can move to the next slide I will explain a little bit more how we've tried to bridge this issue at agreevi why are this why are if MS is pretty difficult to sell first of all as you have understood from Holmes presentation there is a huge level of complexity here there are tons of potential use cases one of the key issues actually that when you're addressing like big enterprise client from the food and agro value chain sometimes they don't even know what they want to solve so one they don't even know what the problem they have is actually sometimes they don't even like the word farm management system or farm management software they don't want to they don't want to discuss with you because you're actually talking about it in a certain way or they don't want to discuss about features so in a nutshell this is something which is still a pretty complex business so at agreevi what we've decided a couple of years ago is actually to address it a completely different way and this is actually our approach which is fully value-based so what does it mean actually we believe that the first way of trying to implement in big organization farm management software has to do with solving challenges and solving issues by bringing immediate values in that event what we are actually doing when we are getting to know our customers is actually to tell them what are the key set of immediate value we believe we can bring them through the usage of the farm management software so there are six or seven of them i would like to align today and then we will switch to the use cases so that you understand exactly how this is setting up so the first one is transparency so as holm said in his presentation thanks to the usage of the farm management software you're going to be able to get access to a clear and transparent overview of a huge network of farmers know what they're doing know their processes getting to know their practices the second one is efficiency does mean that by working through a farm management software by using it properly you're going to be able to increase your operational excellence and your yield eventually the third one is food safety and i'll come back to it later on the fourth one is quality the fifth one is sustainability and the sixth one is stressability as holm explained in his presentation so if we move to the next slide what i would like to show you guys is actually how we are bringing this value-based approach to clients through identifying real issues the key value chain stakeholders are facing in which ways they can solve them so the first of this issue is product recalls so product recalls for those who don't know what it means are actually happening when quality control is finding on the retailer's shelves products within which there is abnormal traces of remaining pesticides so you can move to the next slide and the results of a product recall most of the time are actually huge costs for the companies involved direct costs indirect costs which are running from 10 to even sometimes over 100 million dollars in average from recalling those products so where is this coming from if you move to the next slide you realize that everything is starting at the farm level and it has to do with the pesticide usages it has to do with spraying it has to do with a set of sustainability and food safety requirements which could be regulatory and which could be imposed at the country level but which could be as well imposed at the company itself level and basically given that there is a rule and given that there is a certain threshold which cannot be uh overcome farmers cannot actually do preventive spraying which would mean that they can spray whenever they want to achieve a better um a better result in terms of yield or temporary get rid of pester diseases so what is very important is that by using a farm management software you could reach the monitoring which is required and get evidences of the risk which are found and when and at which period of time the spraying would be allowed so if we move to the next slide this is what we are actually telling to our clients if you would like to empower the food safety in your organization by using a farm management software or a central platform and the combination of those features you would manage to actually get rid of your product recalls issues within the platform then you can combine a set of very efficient features which are starting from pest risk detection uh alternative artificial intelligence modeling scouting and evidence product selection which would actually give you the list of the right products you can use based on a maximum residue level regulation in the local market where you are the variable application rates which you're used which you're actually allowed to use on your field at this exact time and eventually the implementation of the traceability module and potentially as well the compliance reports to be sent within your organization or to your regulatory bodies so that you can eventually in some countries even get subsidized so this is how we address one of the key features here one of the key problem and challenges related to product recalls if we move to the next slide we are also talking with our customers about food waste which is another very big issue so if you're trying to highlight the value-based approach food waste is of course one of the key challenges that all of the potential value chain stakeholders are facing so what does it mean exactly if you move to the next slide you'll see that actually roughly 40 percent of the agro outputs are going directly to west nowadays for a very uh clear reason very important reason is that most of the organization are setting quality standards in terms of pesticide usages and in terms of quality of the output which are actually um not being uh abided uh true by a couple of uh farmers and eventually there is a huge weight uh at the at the field uh level for instance we have a client of ours who needs to achieve a time window of four hours from field to can and everything else which is actually not being harvested and sent over to processing during this time frame uh is actually being wasted so if we move to the next slide what's very important to to to actually try to to cope with these challenges and how to actually foster the usage of farm management software in this event is to understand that uh all along the processing uh all all along the production processes we have to be able about the quality of the food which is produced by identifying the pesticide residues so to do so and to manage to quite qualitatively monitor the level of pesticide used during spraying for instance and all along the process of production process you will avoid food waste and financial losses and this is actually the immediate value which can be brought to you by a farm management software and we switch to the next slide then you'll get access to the key features from the general digital platform which are related to these challenges and the key features which are you bringing bringing to you the exact value which are solving this problem first of all within the same platform all farmers would get access to the agronomy best practices they could share within each other which they could get inspired from and which they could actually turn into best practices for underperforming farms as well they will be able to get all their spraying activities recorded and compared with the key uh regulatory and mandatory objectives they have in their respective markets they will get access to the product database telling them exactly which product could be used at what time then they could get access as well to wedding period analysis bringing them the exact time window during which each there shouldn't proceed with any further spraying activities and of course uh harvesting safety dashboards telling them how when and at which space they could harvest their producers in the ways that they are meeting their food safety requirements to minimize as much as they can the waste during the harvesting process so this is how we would address that agree the food waste issue and then to finish on a more positive note with the next slide there are always uh there is always very um very much positive cases so it's not always about reducing something negative but it has as well it's sometimes something to do with improving something which is already doing really well and you can as well use uh farm management software with a clear goal of improving efficiency and reaching a better or even better operational excellence so this is what we're trying to do uh with the client of ours in the us driscoll's who is actually the biggest berry producers in the world and with driscoll's actually we've been uh facing a couple of like um new challenges with that that which had to do with uh rnd so if you move to the next slide you'll see that this client is very specific because they have uh 25 rnd farms on three continents worldwide and actually they also have next slide um um next slide that there's more than 1000 varieties of inbreed sorry it's like before getting too fast for me 1000 uh 1000 varieties in breeding each year so the combination of the two uh is already something which is requiring from scratch a very very good operational excellence but this client wanted to go further on and manage to integrate all the different type of farms which were working on the production or their on their breeds uh all over the world at the same time which within like an integrated central platform so the challenge was if we go now to the next slide actually to find a way to reach this transparency level and to increase efficiency by integrating different practices different farms on different continents which were working with uh different products into one single platform and we were starting um with a very fragmented way of working with some countries and some farm really working with pen and paper some other working with excel some other having already some kind of like pre-precise like agronomy apps and some other having some kind of like third party platforms or ERPs or stuff which have been developed locally and eventually the idea of the fms has been to aggregate as as holmes was saying in his presentation all these together into one platform and being able to get the overarching view of those activities by reaching a monitoring constant monitoring of the practices of the of the farms of their processes and eventually being able to advise on even better way of working to reach a higher efficiency so if we look at eventually which are the features which which kind of like popped up after that we identified the needs and after that we identified the challenge we wanted to to solve we will go to the next slide and see that it is about a central platform which has been localized across several countries when we say localized it means localized in several languages so the specificity of agrivi accepts that it has the capacity to globally deploy it does it is as well that it is available in more than 20 languages with with this value identification yeah by identifying the immediate value we can bring through the farm management system to driscoll's we actually managed to set up a platform which was solving complex farming process tracking into one or a single overview we've integrated as well a lot of iot sensor data analyze them and turn them into actionable insights we provided advanced analytics and reporting for uh at the same time the overarching view which we are basically the headquarters of the enterprise client but as well for all single farm on each continent getting access access to customized reports and analytics which were actually uh bringing value to them directly on the ground but as well on a more aggregated way uh at the company level we've managed to integrate with a lot of other um third-party system fetch value and data from them integrate them within the farm management software and turn them into insights so that basically the overall fms becomes a global platform for farm holding management so this is in a nutshell what i wanted to to tell you guys today so that you can understand that even if selling an fms is something which is pretty much complex we believe that the right way to do so is of course to uh understand how this can change the way food is produced but basically that we have to highlight even to big value chain stakeholders um the key value uh which could be generated through the usage and identify as well the key challenges that you have to face so that we can actually understand the needs and turn the fms into a proper solution which would be creating immediate value to solve their issues thanks very much thank you jim for explaining us these interesting use cases now let's understand in detail the several applications where farm management software is being used let's move to the next slide uh talking specifically about agriculture industry fms and data analytics have several applications and sub applications such as for precision crop farming applications include yield monitoring farm mapping resource management and irrigation management similarly for livestock management applications are animal growth monitoring to milk harvesting and feeding management alternative farming includes applications such as lighting management hvac where fms is being widely used and aquaculture includes feed management water quality management and aquatic species tracking considering these wide applications fms and data analytics are receiving a colossal reaction from speculators and investors around the world the precision crop farming segment particularly is contributing the highest market share the highest market share and this high adoption rate is accredited to the improved farm profitability and beneficial results of utilizing fms and data analytics in daily operations particularly this application has witnessed a higher adoption rate in the developed regions let's move to the next slide the governing trends of the fms and data analytics market vary across different regions as of now in 2021 north america is at the forefront of the market with the large market concentration in the us according to bis research the north america market for farm management software and data analytics is expected to witness a compounded annual growth rate of 17.47 percent from 2021 to 2026 this is due to the introduction of newer technologies which is on the rise to meet the growing food demand in fact north america has been one of the early adopters of precision agriculture solutions while farm digitization is yet to settle in several countries of africa and asia farmers from the countries of north america are exploring these kinds of advanced farming technologies for their sustainable and efficient production moreover the region also serves as one of the most important regions for the farming industry as leading oems are either based out of or are generating a significant share of their revenue from this region a few of such companies are dear and company trimble inc cubota top corn corporation and driven industries among others moving on to the next slide the growing market of these software and analytics products is expected to increase the involvement of companies across different segments of the value chain to understand and track the ongoing activities across this market one needs to understand the ecosystem properly this figure talks about the farm management market ecosystem ranging from established agricultural oems such as deer and company aqua corporation class and cnh industrial to suppliers of systems and technologies and it based decision support systems and agri input companies such as seed and fertilizer producers the market also consists of several agricultural research institutes such as csiro fronhofer wegnigen university among others additionally the market also encompasses a number of venture capital investors startups and advanced solution providers companies such as the market and advanced solution providers it and big data platform providers such as ibm and microsoft are also significant stakeholders in this market moving on to the next slide this varied range of market participants provide opportunities to other players who are willing to bear the high risk involved in the industry level as i spoke to the Etienne'sades directly of aden the group of human investment industry andphase e narrative link economists advance Loftrade advanced auctionо phoo vm from systems approach prospects emerge The upsurge in such activities is also a result of efforts by the big agricultural giants in order to expand their market share, specifically in the digital farming sector. Presently, various big agricultural companies, namely Monsanto, DuPont, Bayer, and BASF are constantly increasing their investment for the digitization of farming sector by acquiring or collaborating with the data science companies. The market still holds a lot of potential in terms of growth, thus it is essential to scan through the opportunities existing in the market. BAS research has penned on a few opportunities here. Let's talk about each one of them in very brief. First is initiatives by government pertaining to digitalization of agriculture industry. With every country attempting to achieve social and economic development, the adoption of farm management software and data analytics has given tremendous opportunities to help farmers manage their daily operations. This has resulted in government taking initiatives to adapt and deploy precision agriculture solutions such as farming software and data analytics tool. Government of developing countries are focusing on the growing demand for sustainable food production systems by allocating high investment amounts in farm management software. To give an example, the American Research Service, that is ARS, has collaborated with companies to advance the role of FMS enabled with AI in livestock monitoring, analyzing irrigation systems, using robots for harvesting, and utilizing drone technology to monitor crop health among other applications. Now about the second opportunity here, integration of next generation technologies with FMS. FMS and data analytics solution is playing a massive role in developing both conventional and new farming techniques. Further, promoting digitization in agriculture industry would involve increased and integrated use of various advanced and next generation technologies, such as AI, drones and robots, autonomous equipment, etc. Integration of these next generation technologies with FMS would result in higher quality yields and reduce harmful impacts on the environment at the same time. To give you an example, FMS enabled with AI in its various forms, among all other technologies, can emerge as one of the most promising prospects for the advancement in the field of agriculture. If AI and ML is integrated into one same system, the software can help in forecasting and predicting yield and related information which could be utilized by various stakeholders, such as crop insurance companies. Now about the third opportunity, improvements in farm management software. Capabilities of every technology can be improved. Similarly, since FMS is also providing significant benefits in the farming operations, scope of improvements is also there here in FMS. One of the key reasons for this is that the current products that are available in the market across the globe are not able to scale up to support a large user base. Also, many diverse small scale agricultural applications are unable to communicate and share data through these softwares and solutions, which at time leads to duplication of efforts, leading to waste and inability to integrate solutions. Without taking much time now, I would like to conclude by saying that FMS is surely putting a significant impact on agriculture industry. Other than that, the gradual rise of other advanced technologies such as AI, ML, blockchain and robotics are going to shape the future of farming over the next decade. Thank you. Over to you, Debraj. So, thank you very much, Raki, Guillaume and Om for discussing adoption of farm management software in the agriculture industry so illustratively. With the increasing need for innovation solutions, farmers have constantly looked for technologies that enable them to enhance yield and maximum revenue, maximize revenue opportunities. This has motivated the agriculture companies to enhance their investment in research and development of their technologies. BIS research believes that the farm management software and data analytics market will reach $5.26 billion by 2026. And this is expected to remain a major game changer in the agriculture industry, supported by government initiatives as well as farmer friendly business models by agriculture OEMs. In case you wish to see our sample of market intelligence report on farm management software and data analytics, you may ping on the chat and our team will get back to you soon. So, with this thought, let me conclude today's session and now I declare the forum open for any questions from the listeners. I request the listeners to kindly type in the questions on the chat box available on your screen and I'll be happy to pass the questions to the esteemed speakers today. So, over to you guys. Over to the audience. Please type in the questions that you would like to ask to the speakers. Please type in the chat box. Okay, so we have our first question here. It's not addressed to anybody else. I mean, let me just quickly go through the question and let me know if anybody would like to take out the question. Would like to take on this. Is your software feasible in developing countries like India where most of the small holder farmers are illiterate? How do you encourage the small holder farmers from countries like India to use your product because most of the illiterate farmers are not willing to adopt new digital technologies? So, because any of you would like to take up this question. This question is from Sumit Meshram. How do you think you're going to do it, and how do you think you're going to do it, and how do you think you're going to do it, and how do you think you're going to do it? Yeah, I can go first. Okay. Sure. So, Sumit I mean, I guess, yeah. Well, see, I mean, I guess everything that we do. I mean, we, as I said, we work in some 16 African countries, India, Bangladesh, where the farmers don't have access to smartphones. But, you know, farmers are not willing is probably the wrong thing to say. I mean, the, what you have to do is reduce the challenges in. Once you make that easy to. Is not inting a lot into what they're doing during the day, right? Once we make it, we remove all those blockages. They're very willing to adopt technologies. How do we encourage is build value. So most of the customers that we work with, they have to build some kind of reward into the proposition. For example, China organic is one of our customers from India, and they, they export organic cotton. So they say they have been able to pay the farmers 10% more than the previous digitization error. So if you build that value in, they're, they're willing to adopt. Third, how do we make it easy is, you know, in most of our cases, the farmers don't exactly use the application or software by themselves. There is a farmer Mitra. Extension workers, whatever you call it, I mean the staff. So that always a mediator who takes the technology to the farmer and does the initial hand holding. So, you know. Should I answer the question as well or. I think. Yeah, sure. Yeah. I know. So from our end, we are technically available in whichever country in the world. But we have to deploy additional languages depending on demand on those countries. So for Indian language and I'm not an expert. So please forgive me. I'm not sure there is only one in India, but basically this is something which would have been, which would have to be taken into consideration if we would need to localize. I believe that English could be as well working, but then for unliterate farmers. I think this is, this was a question. And for adoption, our approach here is a little bit different. So we are trying to work through value chain towards B2B2C models. So what we are trying to, to, to, to, to reach through this strategy is actually bigger stakeholders who already are disseminating our products and the usage and the adoption of our products within their existing networks of partners. So it would mean that for instance, if there is a key value chain stakeholder in India, which are a part of the value chain it belongs to, who is already cooperating with a lot of small orders in India or wherever else in the world. But the question was about India, then we would actually try to set up a relationship with, with this, let's say bigger customer and throughout its existing farmers network, bring the agrivis solutions to small orders and regarding adoption. Basically what we are providing to clients as well is, our additional data and consulting services to actually ensure adoption in any type of settings, which could mean that eventually in the case that like the end users are not literate, we can actually ensure that we are through the existing adoption phase, filling up the data usage by ourselves so that the key stakeholders are getting data back because at home mentions the data. Inputs are key at home mentions the data input are key at the very beginning and eventually work a lot on these other aspects which have to do with automation, direct data collection from sensing, remote sensing tools and so on and so on. So there are a way to let's say, find work arounds in these particular cases, but our strategy overall is actually a B2B2C. So we actually are thinking that the best way to reach adoption and to reach the biggest number of key users would be small orders and SME and SME founders is actually directly through the B2B strategy or B2B strategy models through bigger stakeholders over the value chain. Perfect, perfect, perfect, thank you Guillaume for the answer. I guess there was a similar question to Guillaume also. What is the company's current take on reaching small older farmers of the developing countries? I guess I actually tried to answer to that one as well. So I hope I answered two questions. Right, right. So we have one last question. And since we are running out of time, this would be the last question to the panel. I think this is one interesting question. How do infrastructural constraints such as poor network or poor Internet connectivity affect the growth of farm management software and the corresponding market? So I can take that one very quickly because this is something we we got to understand very quickly in the product development phases. So the mobile app which is related to the agri-review farm management software. So not to get into details, but we've got an overarching web app and we've got a mobile app, which is actually the one which would be using farmers on the ground is actually enhanced or empowered by an offline mode, which does means that we're not depending on the way that we're working anymore on internet connections. Perfect. So I believe since we are running out of time, so any unanswered questions will be answered with the help of the speakers and the IS research analyst later on. We'll reach out to you audience. So on that note, let's I mean, thank you so much for your insightful answers. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for joining us for this session. Thank you so much for joining us for this session. We have learned a lot about how farm management is enabling the supply chain. Thank you for sharing your insights and market enablers, application, regional adoption and use cases a lot. I mean, use cases actually help us to understand the practical nature of the query. And since we are also getting a lot of questions now, I mean, to all the audience, once again, I'll tell you that with the help of Guillaume, Om and analyst at BIS, we would try to answer these questions and send it across by email. So please don't dishearten yourself. I mean, it's a long day for everybody else and us also. So let's just conclude today's webinar on a good note and hoping that someday we'll see a very sustainable future in related to, I mean, the agricultural industry. Right. So thank you everyone who attended and I wish you all a wonderful weekend ahead. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
