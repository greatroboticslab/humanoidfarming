 In late summer, fields begin to change colour as green turns to gold. While we enjoy holidays in the last of the warm sunshine, down on the farm it's harvest time. Combine harvesters are used to gather the crops of wheat, barley and oats. Farmers hurry to harvest their crops in the good weather before the rains come, often working late into the night. In their hedges, plants like blackberry and elderberry have used the last of the summer sun to produce eye-catching fruits. These attract birds keen to fatten up for winter. The birds will later spread seeds from inside the fruit far and wide, helping new plants to grow next year. As the days start to grow cooler, orchards are filled with the sounds of the last harvest of the summer. Delicious apples and pears. And when the swallows fly south in search of warmer lands, we know that summer is over. Autumn, with its rich colours, is just around the corner. Autumn, with its rich colours.
