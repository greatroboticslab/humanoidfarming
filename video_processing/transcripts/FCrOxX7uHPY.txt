Education
 This is your spinner. Make it hit right on this edge right here. Yep. Yep. So guys, when we're stacking this hay this morning, I don't know how y'all were taught, but I'll tell you what I was taught. You always stack your bottom layer turned up on the side. And the reason you do that is as you add weight to it, this is stronger than laying it flat like that bale right over there is, or flat like this. This hay will just push down and compact and get through the bale, but if you'll stand them up on their side, they last a lot longer. They'll, they're able to stand the strain better. So what's a spinner? It makes the bale spin, uses their own momentum to keep them going. Perfect. It's getting there.
