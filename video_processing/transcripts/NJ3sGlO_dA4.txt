Howto & Style
 This is a sweet potato. It might be a little bit hard to believe, but yes, all you need to do is go down to your local supermarket, grab yourself a sweet potato, chuck it in some water, and that's it. So this one is about two months old and they grow these amazing vines that wrap around each other and they have the coolest little shaped leaves that you can actually eat. So just make sure you change the water over every 10 to 14 days. And if you try this, make sure you tag me.
