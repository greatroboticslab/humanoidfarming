 Hey guys, here's a couple tricks that will help you when you're growing tomatoes this year. I like to prune my tomato plants up about six to eight inches up off the ground. I have found this helps with blight. It keeps the tomato from getting super bushy. It also helps the tomato plant focus its energy upwards growing fruit. Next thing you can do is go ahead and trim your suckers. You see the main trunk of the tomato plant and you see the branch going out. That little guy in the middle is called a sucker. Suckers are easily pruned off. They typically don't produce fruit and a lot of times they steal energy away from the branch that would actually produce the fruit. So go ahead and prune those off and you'll get a lot more fruit. Lastly, try to avoid watering the tomato plant leaves. Keep them dry and you'll avoid funguses and mildew. All right guys, I hope that helps with your tomato growing this year. If you have any questions, drop them down below.
