Howto & Style
 If you're planning on starting a garden this year, these are three things you should know. Number one, really, really good soil. I wish I would have known this when I first started gardening. If you don't have good soil, it's going to be so much more difficult to have a successful garden. Number two is it's totally okay to buy seedlings. Don't worry about starting things from seed. Buy some seedlings that are already started. It's going to be a lot easier to have a successful garden. And number three, only plant things that you love and you know that you will enjoy.
