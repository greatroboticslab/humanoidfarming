 The first thing you need to know is the difference between a gestation crate and a gestation pen. A gestation crate is a small pen that houses only one individual cell. A gestation pen is a large pen that houses four to six cells at one time. A gestation crate is a small 2 foot by 7 foot pen housing one cell. It does not allow her to turn around or have any natural movement. It kind of confines her. It's easier to monitor an individual cell in this crate. However society thinks it's animal cruelty and inhumane to house swine in this crate due to it does affect her natural movement. A gestation pen is a large 10 foot by 10 foot or it can be a larger pen that houses up to four to six cells at one time. It allows the cells to move around freely and naturally allowing them to lay down, stretch out, move around. However it's hard to monitor one individual cell at a time due to there is a large area and so many pigs in this one area. Why switch from gestation crate to gestation pen? Many animal activist groups such as PETA believe it to be inhumane. It affects the cell's natural and free movement. So many have protested against swine producers to get their attention. In the top I have a picture of a protest going on showing a large pig in a small pen. That is showing that the pens are too small for the pigs and that they're getting bruised up and they're filthy and that's how they interpret it. In the bottom corner I show that a pregnant woman in protest to go vegetarian for the swine showing that she's pregnant and in a gestation crate and how she's confined and it's not natural for her. Who's switching? Many swine producers have made the switch. However, Mini do not want to make the switch from gestation crates to gestation pens due to the cost. They don't understand why they're having to take gestation crates out and put pens in because it will cost them more money to do this and redo everything in their barns for the pigs. However, one company is making the switch. They're called Smithfield and they are in the process of making the switch. They plan on having all of their gestation crates removed and replaced by gestation pens. This should all be finished by 2017. The main injuries are such as body sores because they lay for a long time on one side or the other because they are restricted. Another is joint problem because they can either stand up or they can lay down. So they can stand for long periods of time which causes joint problems because they weigh so much and are confined. This can also affect performance rate. They can lower it. They can also pick up nasty behaviors due to boredom such as the pig on the bottom. She's telling Maddie she's bored so she's chewing on the bar. This can just be a nasty habit. This can be a nasty habit. This can be a nasty habit. This can be a nasty habit. This can damage teeth. This can cause her to not gain as much as she's needing to. And overall just cause major problems. Injuries that come with gestation pens. However with the gestation pens not many activists see what the gestation pens can cause. When a whole bunch of cells are put together. They are prone for injury. They are going to fight. They are going to just be animals and be territorial. Which causes damage to the outer skin. Which is cost on the producer because they have to doctor the pigs for the injuries. So there was an article I found that was written in 2007. There was a 2.5 average body score increase on skin lesions with the gestation pens. Versus only a .6 average increase on gestation crates. So being housed together is more prone for injury than for them being housed alone. Injuries with gestation pens. So the cells are going to fight when put in a group. They are going to fight for dominance. For food. Territorial. That's just in their nature. Cells also will mount each other due to cycling. Which this can cause injury to one another. Because they are constantly on top of each other. They can scrape each other with their feet. They can bruise the back. It just causes injury. And with the gestation crate this was never an issue. So monitoring cells in a gestation crate. When using a gestation crate it was very easy to monitor an individual cell. Being able to monitor her health. Her food intake. Making sure she is getting all the nutrients she needed. Also it was easier to monitor whether she was cycling. But one of the main reasons was due to illnesses. It costs less to doctor one cell when she becomes sick. And it's easier for you to notice it right off the bat. Her being alone in a pen. And you seeing her everyday. However monitoring cells in a gestation pen. Is harder. Because you have so many in a pen. It's hard to pinpoint one cell. That's sick in the group. Also if one pig is sick in the group. It costs more to doctor four to six pigs. Versus only doctoring one pig. And most likely the someone in the pen or all in the pen will get sick. Because they are sharing the same area. They are drinking out of the same water. They are eating out of the same trough. They are urinating and fecesing in the same area. It's just more prone for them to get sick altogether. Than if they were in a gestation crate alone. Cycling also is an issue with a gestation pen. Sometimes sows don't come back and cycle. It takes them longer. However it has been beneficial that sometimes sows come back faster. And cycle more quickly in a gestation pen versus a crate. Due to the interaction. Which one is better? It's hard to decide which is better. Because each has a pros and cons. The best thing is the safety and health of the animal. However, people will never be happy with the decision some companies make. For their swine production. I hope you found this video helpful and you learned something new. Thank you.
