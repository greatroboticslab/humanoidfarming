 He announced today he's not just maintaining but increasing his tariffs on China, which is one of our largest trading partners. And among the Americans who will almost immediately feel the pain are farmers, because China buys a lot of their... We as soybean farmers in the United States have a 35 to 40 year relationship with China. The tariffs definitely affected us. The Trump administration has moved to cancel or freeze trillions in federal funding. That includes billions in funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. William Brangham is back now. 94% decreased dramatically. In just the first 60 days of 2025, U.S. sorghum exports to China, the income lifeline for farmers in Kansas and Texas, plunged almost completely, evaporating 94%. The once bulging silos now stand as grain graveyards, crammed with kernels no one wants. Does Trump know how his actions and statements are wrecking American agriculture? Every new tariff is like locking another export gate, pushing U.S. farm goods off the global trade scales. The fallout is unfolding faster than ever, as a supply chain that once fed millions of jobs collapses right before the new harvest. If this is only the beginning, what will happen when soybeans, corn and beef are each shut off from export? The biggest farm crisis in decades is smoldering, and the boom could explode by the next harvest. Stay with Deep State for the next few minutes as we peel back the numbers, dig out the causes, and predict who, farmers, consumers, or the entire U.S. economy, will pay the steepest price for this economic overhaul. In just the first two months of 2025, the volume of U.S. sorghum sold to China, a market that once absorbed nearly 90% of the output from Kansas and Texas farmers, plunged horrifically. From more than 1.4 million tons to 78,316 tons, a wipeout of 94%. That number isn't a typo. It's a blazing red exclamation mark on every income sheet across the Great Plains grain belt. The first blow landed on March 4th, when Beijing slammed a 10-15% punitive tariff on $21 billion of U.S. farm goods, slamming shut springtime contracts mid-negotiation. But sorghum took an even harsher follow-up. On April 4th, China hiked the tariff to 34% on all U.S. commodities and instantly suspended the import license of exporter C&D USA Inc. That suspension was like yanking the handbrake on a highway. Containers stuck at port. April-May, contracts canceled under force majeure tariffs. The shock rippled back to the fields almost instantly. USDA data show domestic sorghum stocks ballooned 42% to 150 million bushels as of March 1st, pushing cash prices below corn, a crop historically cheaper. The agency also slashed 2,024-25 export prospects to 2.54 million tons, down 58% and a six-year low. For each farm, tens of thousands of dollars vanished before the combines even fired up. In Stockton, Kansas, farmer Dan Atkison said last year's load hadn't shipped when the new contract disappeared. Chinese buyers requested an indefinite extension. Grain elevators posted offers so low, selling bleeds, storing kills. In the Texas panhandle, some feedlots started blending surplus sorghum into livestock rations just to stem losses. Yet domestic demand can't rescue the $1.5 billion revenue sorghum once earned when ships docked at Guangzhou. While the USDA debates relief, rural cash flow is shrinking. Farm banks tighten credit lines, seed dealers demand higher deposits, and fuel costs climb as logistics snarl. The new planting cycle heading into summer has turned into a gamble. Sow sorghum and prey, or switch to corn and wheat, even though those markets wobble under tit-for-tat tariff waves. The 94% sorghum crash is truly a chart in freefall. It's a vivid warning that, America first, is turning fertile fields into warehouses of unsellable grain. And if sorghum has already collapsed, what awaits soybeans, corn and beef as the tariff gate slams shut again? America's farm rescue journey has entered its most dangerous bend yet. From May 22 to 25, 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, reported a figure unseen in more than 30 years. Wheat bookings went negative 49,100 tons, meaning cancellations outstripped every new sale on the books. Most of the damage came from South Korea, scrapping 65,300 tons, and the Philippines pulling 12,000 tons in one swoop, plunging the export balance for the week ending May 29th deep into record-red territory. The twist is on May 30th. The Philippines spun a full 180 degrees, inking a 110,000 ton feed wheat deal with Australia, snubbing U.S. grain, even though Chicago prices sit at a two-year low. South Korea pivoted too. Earlier in the month, Seoul's milling giants openly demanded origin flexibility, willing to pay a premium for Russian or Eastern European cargos rather than wait for Washington's whiplash trade policy. The impact showed up instantly in the USDA ledger. Every lot earmarked for Korea flipped, turning into a net reduction instead of fresh business. Why do buyers walk away when U.S. wheat is actually 8 to 12 U.S. dollars per ton cheaper than rivals? The answer boils down to two words. Trust deficit. After President Trump reimposed a 25% tariff wall on Asian steel and aluminum in April, Beijing hit back with a 34% escalating tariff on U.S. origin grains. Wheat isn't on the direct hit list, but shipping lines slapped a risk surcharge of 9 to 12 U.S. dollars per ton on every U.S. contract, fearing routes could be shut if the tariff war widens. Add insurance and the CIF price into Asia, inches above Black Sea wheat. A paradox unthinkable before this trade fight erupted. Inside the Great Lakes system alone, the National Grain and Feed Association estimates over 2.1 million tons of wheat now sit flat on its back in storage, up 37% year on year. North Dakota growers admit, we're selling 40 to 50 cents below break-even, and the ships still don't come. The consequences stretch far beyond a few 10,000-ton cancellations. U.S. world wheat share has dived from 44% in 1980 to just 11% today. An all-time modern low. Meanwhile, Russia, sanctioned over the Ukraine war, ramps exports beyond 40 million tons, seizing the number one seat for steady supply into Asia and the Middle East. When the Philippines and South Korea, both top 5 U.S. customers, shift orders to Australia, Russia, even Eastern Europe, the message to Chicago is unmistakable. Cheap isn't enough. Policy must be stable. Refinitive analysts warn, dueling tariffs have turned U.S. wheat into a political gamble, while feedlots and flour mills need at least nine-month contracts. On Kansas fields, fallout is immediate. Local banks tighten credit, demanding 15% more collateral against price swings. The Stafford flour mill scrapped a $48 million line upgrade because it's no longer sure of raw supply. One farm has resorted to mixing wheat into livestock rations, the last-ditch move when selling bleeds, storing bankrupts. The shock isn't confined to U.S. borders. In Manila, the price of pandasol bread, long tied to U.S. flour, spiked 11% in three weeks due to new logistics fees. Southeast Asian consumers pay for Washington's tariff war, while American farmers take a double hit, lost market share and eroding credibility. Unless policy swerves, the 94% sorghum collapse could replay in wheat, on four times the scale, since wheat is a pillar of global food security. With negative 49,100 tons. In just the first reporting week, the only question is, when does the export ledger slide from dark red to blood red? The picture is tilting, and U.S. farmers, once proud of feeding the planet, now watch traditional buyers line up at Russian-Australian-Eastern European silos. The 2025 wheat crisis is underway, and that 11% market share is merely the starting line for a steep slide if, tariffs for protection, remain the White House's guiding star. And the turmoil resumed right on March 4th. Beijing, without mincing words, immediately suspended soybean import permits for three U.S. agribusiness giants, and slapped a 10-15% retaliatory tariff on a $21 billion basket of U.S. farm goods, soybeans being the lion's share. Barely six weeks later, China's Ministry of Finance shut the valve again, with an escalator tariff of 34% on every U.S. shipment effective April 10th, turning the phase one purchase pledge into nothing but packing paper. The double blow instantly pushed U.S. soybean stocks up to 380 million bushels, the highest in four years, forcing the USDA to cut the 2024-25 season average price to just $10.10 per bushel, a level unseen since before the pandemic. Compared with $14.97 per bushel at end 2023, today's quote has dropped through the basement by more than 30%, erasing the Midwest's already thin margins. While Chicago scrambles for outlets, Brazil is racing ahead. In Q1 alone, the South American giant shipped 17.7 million tons of soybeans to China, a record tally, accounting for over three-quarters of all cargoes sailing out of Santos. Not stopping there, on May 8th, Buenos Aires signed a U.S. 900 million letter of intent to sell soybeans, corn, and veg oil to Beijing, formally declaring war for U.S. market share. Result? Reuters says America's soybean slice in China fell to 68% in Q1, while Brazil surged to 26%, and is forecast to keep gaining once the South American harvest wraps. In Iowa and Illinois, Late Spring's familiar sight is silos jammed with golden brown beans. Farmer Gary Schnitke figures that at $10 per bushel against average production costs of $9.65, net returns are negative right on the field. Hence, a wave of growers switch to corn or leave land fallow, accepting a lost season to dodge deeper red ink. USDA notes national soybean acreage could drop 4% for 2025. Those hanging on simply blanket grain and storage, praying for a rebound. Yet Agrisource warns U.S. exports could sink another 20% to 1.5 billion bushels if tariffs stay. I.e., recovery chances? Near zero. World markets get the memo too. By May, Cbot November, futures hovered around $10.20 per bushel, the lowest band since 2020. Broker Stonex calls it the death line, because below $10 over half the Midwest farms bleed cash. By contrast, in Sao Paulo, domestic bean prices rose 7% as fresh Chinese orders pack South American elevators to the brim. Bottom line, with China's door slammed and tariffs piling up, U.S. soybeans are trapped between stuffed bins, bargain prices, and South American rivals swooping in on customers. Sorghum has already evaporated 94%. Soybeans, the biggest U.S. farm commodity, are hot on its heels, sending the entire farm belt into panic mode. Unless the tariff spiral is broken soon, what awaits is not recovery, but a sweeping wave of farm bankruptcies in the very next fiscal year. Beef, chicken, and pork face a pressure cooker threatening the dinner plates of millions of American families. Overnight, about two-thirds, nearly 1,000 U.S. meat processing plants were put in pending review because their China export licenses expired with no renewal, throwing up to $5 billion in deals into jeopardy. That dangling passport means every shipment leaving Kansas, Iowa, or Nebraska, risks either clearance or a forced U-turn. The second bomb detonated right at Shanghai Port. Since mid-March, Chinese customs have tightened protocols. U.S. meat containers must break seals, unload, and X-ray every tray. Many loads sat chilled so long they spoiled, forcing on-site destruction. The U.S. Meat Export Federation warned storage charges have jumped $800 to $1,200 per container and clearance times now run triple the norm. Firms pulled back, new orders shrank, and reefer vessels diverted to South America to dodge the logjam. The fallout hit Chicago futures head-on. On April 9, June lean hog contracts slid to $0.89.78 per pound, an eight-month low. Live cattle prices also plunged as traders feared cash-strapped consumers in a tariff war. USDA data that same week showed China canceled 12,000 tons of U.S. pork, dragging total bookings to a yearly low. The domestic pork cutout lost another $3.82 per hundredweight in under 24 hours. For Midwest farm math, every one-cent drop in hog price wipes almost $15 billion of sector income per month, pain-matching sorghum's 94% crash. Meanwhile, the SOS convoy of exports stalled at Shanghai. Reuters insiders say some frozen meat boxes had to re-temper three times, quality tanking and bacterial risk soaring. Asian media even report over $10 billion in U.S. goods, from meat to wood chips, parked indefinitely because new sailings can't beat China's looming 125% tariff deadline. When cold stores run out of room, firms have two options, dump product domestically at fire sale prices or dump it outright. Domestic prices slid instantly. USDA now projects 2026 hog prices to average just $63.5 per hundredweight, 3% below this year, the first multi-year dip since COVID. Broiler prices in the Southeast fell 7% in April, amid a supply glut with no exit, while premium beef lost $2 per hundredweight on the boxed beef market the same day the White House announced a 50% tariff hike. Plants, instead of gearing up for summer grill season, shifted to maintenance or shortened shifts. This twin squeeze, frozen ports, dangling permits, is shaking America's livestock lever. When China, the third largest customer, slams the gate, domestic prices sink below the costs of feed and refrigeration. If the tariff face-off drags on, USMEF estimates another 1 million tons of U.S. meat could vanish from exports within 12 months, slicing 12 to 15% off every hog producer's margin. In short, after sorghum and soybeans, it's now livestock's turn to become the newest casualty of America First, and the farm bankruptcy cycle is pounding on Midwest doors. Still no sign of making America great again. America's farm export pipeline isn't just bleeding orders. It is officially jammed from field warehouse to seapier, plunging US agriculture into the darkest chapter on record. It all starts with numbers that make logistics pros blanch. The Port of Portland, Oregon, lost 51% of outbound volume in the first 10 weeks of the year. Tacoma, Washington slid 28%. Even the strategic crossroads at Los Angeles, the West Coast's biggest outlet, vaporized 17%, while the twin ag hubs Savannah, 13%, and Norfolk, 12%, show the same picture of stacked containers and canceled bookings. Each percentage point equals tens of thousands of tons of corn, wheat, or soy meal locked in storage. At Los Angeles, vessel calls dropped from 12 ships a day to barely five. Steve Door's shifts were halved, turning a once-roaring wharf into a silent box yard. When ships sail away, empty containers vanish too. Kansas growers can't rent a single 40-footer for sorghum, and Iowa's soybean contract is late because there's no box. Pouring gasoline on the fire is a scheme to levy up to $3 million per vessel built in China. The moment Washington floated the idea, carrier MSC threatened to cut sailings, while United Grain Corp calculated wheat, corn, soy freight costs would jump 40%. Austrian traders have already pivoted to Australian barley. The classic rate-up, buyer bolts, story, mirrors sorghum's 94% crash. The rural rearguard hurts even more as inputs soar. On March 4th, Ottawa hit back with a 25% tariff on $30 billion in U.S. goods, spanning combines, John Deere parts, pesticides. The cruelest punch is potash. 80% of U.S. potash comes from Saskatchewan. University of Illinois and Ohio state analysts say each ton will cost $100 more if that 25% flows straight into invoices. A 2,000-acre Nebraska corn farm suddenly needs an extra $60,000 just to feed its soil. Costs up, cash flow frozen. Since March, USDA has paused new credit lines and deferred support payouts. Silos and dairy barns are mothballed. A Montana farmer is stuck with $648,000 in feed mill loans. Community banks watching collateral values plunge slash limits. North Dakota wheat growers must pony up 15% extra margin to buy summer seed. As working capital dries, default risk weighs on the entire farm credit system. The one-two punch of export gate locked plus import lane toll booth grinds farm margins to near zero. A bushel of corn sold on the Chicago board now nets less than $0.08, a far cry from $0.40 pre-tariff. Freight surcharges and fertilizer alone have siphoned $0.12 off each bushel. The nightmare feeds on itself. Fewer sailings mean scarcer boxes. Higher freight sparks more cancellations. Cancellations swell inventories. Spot prices dive. Banks cut credit. And the loop keeps tightening. Without a policy breakthrough, sorghum's 94% could repeat in corn, wheat, even feed grain, shoving America's ag supply chain into its worst logjam since World War II. Put differently, tariffs aren't just building a wall outside. They're erecting an inner prison, trapping seed and farmer alike in an unsolvable cost and logistics crisis. If Washington's America First keeps locking ports and taxing the very fertilizer that feeds the crop, the question isn't how much will exports fall? It's when will rural America be rescued from an economy once branded the greatest on earth. Scan the farm towns. With sorghum and freefall, wheat contracts deep negative and soybeans piling up unsold, rural service links are snapping. Right at the year's start, Landis, Iowa's biggest grain coop alliance, suddenly axed 55 workers, 10% of staff, citing business restructuring. Though everyone knows vaporized export revenue is the real culprit. Southward, many Kansas and Nebraska elevators shifted to three-day weeks. Grain handlers now chase temp jobs at groceries or repair shops. Credit, the lifeblood of any farm is clogging. Q1 farm credit system data show delinquencies up to 0.55% from 0.36% and substandard AG production loans topping 8% of the book. Thin capital community banks instantly hike margins or demand extra collateral. In South Dakota, a 160 hectare parcel was repossessed because the owner couldn't scrape together $40,000 for fertilizer. Bankruptcies spread as night follows day. Successful farming counts. Chapter 12 filings up 55% in 2024 versus 2023 and climbing faster through mid-2025. The figures sting like the 1980s when high rates and low prices wiped out 200,000 family farms. No wonder NPR warned, if tariff policy stays its course we could face the worst farm crisis in half a century. When jobs vanish, credit jams, and assets are seized, the collapse won't stop at the farm gate. It will drag down diners, gas stations, schools. This time, unless Washington unfastens the tariff choke, the 1980 replay warning won't be prophecy. It's the skid mark already staining America's once-golden fields. Unstable tariffs are methodically gutting U.S. agriculture. Without emergency measures, millions of farms will shoulder catastrophic fallout. From unsold sorghum to gridlocked wheat and soy, and now a cratering livestock sector, the Midwest reels under an income loss and bad debt spiral. Washington can't keep gambling on tariff walls. Right now, Congress must pass a federally-sized support package to offset freight and carry costs, while expanding trade risk insurance so farmers can survive the season. But salvaging the sector is only step one. The White House must reboot multilateral talks, cool the tariff war, and restore international buyer confidence.
