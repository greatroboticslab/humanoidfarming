 hola chicos and don't forget to subscribe to my youtube channel and i want to thank you for the continued support i'm almost a thousand subscribers so guys let's keep it going i want to share with you guys today an amazing experience i had when i traveled to colombia to learn about the civil pastoral systems that we had the flight was a bit unorthodox because we had to leave from the normal man international airport we head north up to miami and then from miami now we went on a three and a half hour journey down to bogota colombia a very high altitude place temperate climate very cool and this is what is very unique about the colombia region is that they do have regions that is very tropical that is just like us back home and you could see the differences in what we call the livestock systems based on this adjustment in in environment so from bogota we then took and explain to what we call vladdupar or caesar department which is a little bit that tropical region i'm talking about it was great it was very close to the andes mountain i could look through my hotel room and basically look over the mountain into the neighboring venezuela um it's a very old environment compared to bogota was like a you know capital based type system it was lovely the opportunity to meet with corpica um sonny and milton who took us around colombia showed us in the market i noticed the purchase stuff was great we then visited the research station headquarters corpica in bogota and we met with the team that is director and also met with the bilateral company that kind of guided us us so what is civil pastoral system i've been asked that question because i've used it a term you know routinely in videos civil pastoral system is the combination of tree shrubs and grasses in combination with livestock so we find a way to harmonize the production of crops trees and livestock in your environment which would lead to a sustainable environmental conditions and agricultural practices in columbia it was a little bit different where columbia is known for timber production production production of wood and they were trying to show how is it that we could create a shorter term investment by adding livestock within the timber production system this i believe led to the success of the civil pastoral system in columbia as livestock was now the short term as in a charter a cash crop compared to timber which would be considered a long-term investment it's a bit different in jamaica and would not work with that same type of model it required a little bit more innovation here in columbia was introduced to the mombasa grass that they used extensively in their civil pastoral system because it was known to be drought tolerant and shade tolerant they use eucalyptus for timber and then they would graze the cows in between the timber trees on the mombasa grass we learned about various different civil pastoral systems using different tree crops calabash uh very city uh the bastard cedar and we did a wide tour across columbia visiting different areas looking at different tropical systems looking at the red braham this guy owns 200 hectare of lands and had to be protected by his own soldiers because he and the gorillas were in a constant warfare overland we traveled by car we traveled by donkey but columbia did have a lot of sustained agricultural practices that we could take back to jamaica for one we saw the 50 ton silo bags there in columbia and that idea was what sparked the whole investment into the silo pack up um and the silo press um with jamaica development board and then we went to buy gas you know traveling so that we actually bought gas on the street this is the typical gas station in columbia and you know the food was also great a lot of beef a lot of patties type of vibe and i was what you call a millionaire a peso millionaire in columbia for the few days so on our way back home the idea sparked how is it that we're going to integrate this system into jamaica so we actually created our own nine sides across the island and we sit down and started to design how is it that we want our civil pastoral systems to look in jamaica because our belief is that if farmers adopted this system they would say the economic benefits of you know selling mangoes selling ackee selling timber or using the forages to provide them to their livestock to cut their feed costs so we did a lot of mulberry and trican theracottings we did lucina we brought back cannavalia braziliannaces from columbia which is a very high protein legume to show that we could improve our local resources using using you know our adaptive crops and we went out to plant across the island these farms we planted in the fence posts for a lot of farms across the islands we created fodder banks um the fence post was to you know provide shade and then to reduce the cost of the whole fence post maintenance we did fodder banks for for small ruminant farmers using mulberry to improve the the protein content on farm and digest over crops on farm with an innovative system that is chelis system for the cannavalia to grow on in pastures that you know we said would improve the total digestible nutrients or the total nutrient profile will be improved for pastures thanks to mr riley and hunslo government really helped us and we actually utilized the system you know we showed them how we could plant the moringa trees and end up using it back on the farm now we did a whole information schematics or by denby 2015 for farmers to understand and i really love the civil pastoral system so our next episode will be my trip to china see you soon and don't forget to subscribe
