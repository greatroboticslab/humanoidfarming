 What is the economic, environmental and energy balance? We're looking at the economic, environmental and energy balances that happen at the farm level from the production of feedstock, for example straw, that could be used in bioethanol production. It's an exciting area to be working in at the moment. From a personal point of view there are academic challenges in terms of looking at the intricacies and the system that we have to consider and looking at economics, energy and emissions all in one go which is a unique part of what we're doing. But it's also very interesting in terms of the wider aspects of the programme because I'm now working with colleagues who I've never worked with before and learning about different aspects of science that I've never come across before. We are concentrating on the sustainability of bioethanol production, particularly focusing at the farm level to see whether we can use the feedstock of straw in a sustainable manner. Is it sustainable from a profit point of view for the farmers? Is it sustainable environmentally in terms of greenhouse gas emissions? And is it sustainable in terms of the energy that we generate from the system? So to actually undertake this research we need to collect a lot of data on the amount of energy that is in the products that go into a farm system. We need to understand how much nitrogen, for example, farmers put onto wheat. We need to understand how much wheat you get out of a hectare of land. But within a farm system approach, farms are very complicated so we also need to understand things like crop rotations, machinery and labour requirements and also the input and output prices that farmers face in order for us to make a full assessment of what would happen at farm level. And building on that, we also need to look at some barriers that farmers may have to actually using straw for bioethanol production. They may not want to use straw for that purpose. For example, they currently use it in livestock bedding. Some farmers return it to the soil in terms of incorporating it into the soil. And we hope that those farmers who do incorporate it into the soil will allow that straw to be used in a bioethanol plant. But we do need to understand the barriers that exist for farmers to allow us to use that product. Within the research, we're undertaking a national, as in England, coverage of farmers. We're researching 250 farmers, doing a full survey of in-depth questions to ask them about their barriers and incentives to actually using straw for bioethanol, but also looking at dedicated energy crops such as Miscanthus and short rotation coppice. The research is unique in that it's looking at using effectively a co-product, which is what straw is, from a current crop. So we're not really competing with food. A lot of current biofuel technologies, so-called first generation, actually use the grain and turn that into ethanol. But what we're doing is looking at an alternative to that, which is to use the straw, which doesn't actually go directly into food consumption. And therefore, you remove that food versus fuel controversy. So for us, we're looking at 3,000 a few acres. We're solutions to this we're utilizing vast electrodes in thetal-さ. To divine
