 Hello everyone, how is everyone? I was just thinking of doing another video of just what's growing this year and what's not growing well this year. So let's start with first which is potatoes. They are growing beautifully honestly. Potatoes are just blooming. I'm having two varieties of potatoes. I don't know the names, I don't care about the names, I just know there's loads of them. So one which I bought from B&Q in UK and I just planted them in the ground, deep trenched them, chucked them in, I put I don't know I would say 15 centimeters of soil on top of it which is about six inches. They grow lovely. Another variety had delivery from Asda and I forgot about those potatoes so they just started sprouting and my message just said well just take them on allotment and grow them maybe something will grow so I was thinking like yeah why not I'll grow them. I took them and I managed to grow quite a lot of them. I will show you them in a minute. I'm happy about that. Another thing is peas. Peas are growing lovely and they are easily very easy to grow. You just need to water them, plant them on the sunny side, give them something to climb on obviously and they will produce loads of peas. The next thing I would say, or the next year is beetroots. Beetroots are lovely and they grow quick. One, two, they are really easy to grow as well. I usually buy them from B&Q as well. So I've got little plants about two inches then I plant them in, water them, just water them. I will weed around them so nothing will take their water that's needed for them with nutrients. Strawberries are growing lovely. That's my message, strawberries. She has two beds with strawberries. One bed is about 12 feet long. The other one is just 6 by 6 feet long. We have quite a lot of strawberries. Really easy to grow as well, just water them. I'm trying to avoid any plants that have to come over every day or every two days because I don't have that much time. I've got kids and work as well. Like most of people, but I still encourage everyone to grow something. Well, because you've got free food basically, you pay £3 by you. You have or you harvest at least £100 worth of it on the end. Cabbages are growing lovely as well. They produce lots of leaves which I used for juice as well. I could have used it for a coleslaw but I didn't and I wasted a few leaves as well, which is not ideal. But I know I'm going to have six big heads of cabbages. I've got broad beans, plenty of broad beans and I know they will be producing for another two months. I've got three heads of lettuce, lemon balm, plenty of lemon balm, plenty of weeds. You might laugh but weeds are really good as well for compost, especially nettles and what you call them? Dandelions. Dandelions are really good. They have loads of nutrients that are needed for those veggies. What else? Good herbs. I'm not going to name them but there's a few. Cougettes are growing slowly this year. I don't know what's happening. I think I didn't water them too often. I had motivation last year to water everything every two days but this year I'm just not bothered. I've got loads of work to do and stuff at home that I need to do as well. So yeah, if you have time I would advise you to grow those veggies, especially if you are in UK. They're easy to grow and they don't need much attention. I'm actually happy with my puffs this year as well. I covered them with wood chippings last year and this year as well. So I don't have that many weeds to pull out around the beds. I'm surprised there's barely any snails this year. I use snail pellets obviously for slugs and snails. But still last year I had loads and this year it's just barely any snails. So why not? I'll take that. Another thing is I'm happy with the water system that I built. You can see it there. There's my water barrel gutter and I've angled the roof so all the water drips into the gutter. And then I have plenty of water. I don't have to worry about that. I've got water close to my allotment that I can take but I've got still my own clean water that I can wash my hands with and I don't have to go anywhere. which is really ideal when you have your own allotment. And especially in the summer sometimes you can't take any water and water your allotment for a week or two. Which is stupid but it is what it is. That's why I built that thing, the barrel, so I can water everything. Yeah, and I'm right now I'm just sitting and relaxing. Just thinking what else I could do. I still have behind me that piece of plot to finish off. On the grove, just grass in there and so I can sit and let's not have a picnic with my kids. I'm also happy with composting bin or box I made out of pallets last year. I've got loads of compost. And you know, maybe in the next two months I will chuck everything out of it around the vegetables. Because that is not only helping vegetables to grow but it's easy to get rid of the weeds around your vegetables so you don't have to pick everything out. I guess it's acidic or something and just burns the weeds down. There's also later less slugs, snails, slugs. There's less ants. I had a problem with ants this year. And those white little things or black things on the broad beans. I don't know the names of those. insects. But they are really annoying. Honestly. If you touch them, they stain you because they break apart. They're really soft and it's just rubbish. So I had to rip out one broad bean plant because of it to get rid of them. Luckily I managed to get rid of them. Well, now I'm going to show you those potatoes. Those are my potatoes from home. They're growing quite close together and thick. I think that should be a problem. Peas. There's plenty of peas. Beet roots. I've got leeks still growing there. They're about six to eight inches. Got cabbages in here. Trying to keep those cabbages covered because last year pigeons came over and they ate like, I don't know, at least half of the cabbages, which is annoying. And snails would just munch on them ridiculously. And those potatoes here. Those that are bought from the shop. Those are grown really well. So I've already seen them. I've managed to dig some with my hands. And I found that they are close to be ready. Which I'm really happy about. About some of them are like fast. And I'm big. I'm six foot one. I'm not small. So I know. These are potatoes. These potatoes are really big. And some are still about. Or maybe that size. Don't know what that is, but bigger than strawberries. There's a few strawberries there as well. If you can see them. We've already picked most of them. I don't think we'll eat anymore. Those are just to be left for snails. We froze. The ones we picked. About, I would say. Two. Maybe one and a half or two kilos. Of strawberries. At least six small boxes. Which is really good. Another thing I want to mention. About vegetables. And fruits. Why I'm growing them. And why you should grow them as well. It's because they're full of vitamins. And minerals. And I know I'm talking about that. On my every video. But this is really important. For you. For your body. So you can be healthy. Think clear. Don't eat all that crap from shops. Please don't. Don't do that. You're going to be sick. Then doctors will prescribe you with some. Some crap. Then. You'll feel a little bit better. But something else will come up. And you'll be constantly sick. Which there's no point in doing that. Either buy vegetables. Or. Which I don't buy. Because I don't really. Like vegetables from shop. Or just grow them. It's really easy. And I know some of you will say. Oh I don't have garden. And I don't have. Allotment like you do. You're lucky. To be honest. I live in a. Second floor flat. I don't have balcony. I don't have garden. I never had allotment. Only have allotment. For the last two years now. But I always try to. Sell something in the pots. So. There's no excuses. Honestly. You can buy a pot for 60. Pence. Or. Cents. Wherever you are. Big pot. Sell something. Get the soil from the park. And get on with it. It's that easy. You can plant potatoes at home. You can plant. Tomatoes at home. You can plant. Leeks. Lettuce. Radish. Cucumbers. Most of the things you can think of. You can plant that at home. Especially because it's warm. And there's always constant temperature. And then. It's easy to water them. Because. You just see it. It's dry. Okay. I'm going to water it. You don't have to walk anywhere. Like I do right now. If you need any tips. On. What to grow. And how to grow it. Just let me know. And I will encourage you to subscribe to my channel as well.

But it's really sunny now. Like. Today. I even had to have a nap. Because it was that hot. Everyone had a nap. My missus. My kids. It was just unbearable. I live in the UK. And it's usually just raining. Or it's windy. And now. We have really hot summer. So I hope you have fun. Take care. And. See you next time. Bye.
