 Hi, I'm Pete and welcome to Just a Few Acres Farm. In this video I'm going to talk about tax breaks for small farmers and there's a lot of money on the table here. I was amazed when we started farming at all the tax breaks available. It's a good time to think about this stuff because tax season is here. Now, I don't do our taxes. We hire an accountant to do them and we get this big tax booklet back every year. It's quite complicated for a farm and we have an LLC as well, a Limited Liability Corporation. When we started the farm I had to do a lot of legwork to find the tax breaks that are available to us. It's not like they're automatically triggered. You have to go around to your county assessor's office, look at the state tax forms, look at the federal tax forms, talk to accountants to get the information that pertains to you. So I'm going to divide this discussion into two big groups. The first is property tax and federal tax relief available. And the second is sales tax. The first step in all this is filing an IRS form 1040 Schedule F, Profit or Loss from Farming, with your federal taxes. And this triggers everything else. So you need to get to know this form. The biggest federal advantage to this form is once you file it you can deduct all of your farm expenses from your income. So the feed that you use, the equipment that you buy, the fences you put up, all that stuff gets deducted as a business expense on Schedule F. These deductions wind up being huge. After all, most of the things that we buy are for the farm except for personal necessities. We claim a percentage of our utility bills because we're using electricity and heat on the farm. We're able to deduct the tax we paid for gasoline and diesel fuel that was used on the farm. We get to deduct the vehicle and equipment maintenance as long as it's farm related. So this winds up being a lot of money. Filing your Schedule F also allows you to qualify for a lot of the USDA farm programs. You know, the same ones I ran it about a few videos ago. Not only the ones I ran it about but also some really good programs like the CRP program which is the Conservation Reserve Program. And also disaster relief in case of tornado, hurricane, flood, what have you. Drought we had here a few years ago and we qualified for some money from that. It's important for you to start with a Schedule F and to begin filing that the year that you begin farming. Sometimes the programs require a minimum number of years of filing a Schedule F to qualify. Like the barn grant that we got required three years of Schedule F as part of the grant application process. Now aside from income tax breaks arising from Schedule F and the eligibility for federal farm funding, we don't get any other tax breaks from the federal government. All of our tax breaks come from our state, New York. And I'm going to talk about the tax breaks that are available in New York as an example for what may be available in your state. Every state is going to vary and I don't have the time to research every state. So as I go through these programs from New York, they'll give you some cues for what to look for from your own state. The biggest tax breaks available in New York are to our property taxes. Property taxes are a huge deal in New York. We pay school taxes and then separate town and county taxes which are all based on our properties assessment. And New York has a bunch of great programs that pretty much result in money coming back into our pocket when we get our tax refunds. To qualify for the property tax programs in New York, you need to file at least three Schedule F's in a row. And then you can go to your county assessor's office and do all the paperwork with them that sets you up as a legitimate farm business in New York and qualifies you for all of these property tax programs that I'm going to go over. The biggest one is a New York State school tax credit. And believe me, this is huge. We pay thousands and thousands of dollars in school taxes every year. And this one allows us to get a hundred percent refund on our school taxes that we pay based on the value of our farmland. The funny thing about this program is that every fall our school tax bill comes and we pay those thousands of dollars and then we have to wait until we file taxes the following February to apply for that money and get it back. But thousands of dollars of that money comes back as a direct credit on our taxes. Another big one, sometimes almost as big as that first property tax, the school tax credit, is the 2% agricultural assessment cap in New York. Particularly in our county, because we live close to Ithaca, which is expanding rapidly, and because there are a lot of big giant dairies around us, the price of land is going up quickly. And every year, it seems like our farm gets reassessed and it gets reassessed for a great percentage more than the last assessment. But the state has a program where they basically say your property taxes or your, based on your assessment won't go up more than 2% each year. So if we get reassessed in a given year and say our land assessment goes up 5 or 10%, which it has, our property tax bill for the next year can't go up more than 2% regardless of the assessment. The third program in New York, which may exist in your state as well, is the property tax exemption for new farm buildings. So we built our big barn three years ago and the minute it was finished, the county assessor was out here to add its assessment to our property assessment. And I had to go to the county assessor's office and file a form for this 10 year exemption. So what this exemption says is that for the first 10 years after you build that new farm building, they're exempt from the property taxes on that building. So this is saving us money at least for the first 10 years. I can't emphasize it enough. These state property tax breaks are huge. They're not hundreds of dollars. They're thousands of dollars, probably approaching $10,000 for a farm our size. But you need to do the legwork to qualify them. Nobody's going to come knocking on your door and say, here's your money. You got to go around to the offices. You got to play their game. You got to submit the right forms. And then they're available to you. So do the legwork. The second big category of tax breaks is in sales tax. So if you live in a state that charges sales tax, you're probably going to qualify as a farm to not pay that tax for farm use supplies. So I'll give you our example. We live in Tompkins County of New York, which has an 8% sales tax. If you go out and buy pretty much anything except for food and clothing, you're paying 8% on top of the base price and tax. It's really simple to get this tax exemption in New York for farmers. All we do is print out a form ST125, hand write in our information, bring it to whoever we're going to buy farm products from, and they take the sales tax off of our purchases. And usually you only have to fill this certificate out once for each supplier. And then they just keep it on file and you just bill against your account. It's a pretty broad ranging system in New York. In other words, it's loosely defined. So if I go out and buy a box of screws for a fence that I'm building or anything that I'm constructing, I don't pay tax on it. If I buy feed for our animals, if I buy parts to repair machinery or oil and filters for maintenance, all that is tax exempt. This tax exemption even applies to online sales. So a few years ago when the government started to crack down on sites like Amazon to charge sales tax for things, we filled out the same form through Amazon. And now whenever we buy things online from those big suppliers, we don't pay sales tax on those things either. I spent some time preparing this video looking around at some of the other states' requirements for sales tax exemptions. And it seems like every state has different nuances to what applies and what you need in terms of your farm operation to qualify. So you need to do some legwork on that one as well. Another category of tax breaks is for your on-farm fuel use. And this one isn't huge for us. I imagine it's huge for the crop farmers that are burning gallons and thousands of gallons of diesel fuel every year, but for the diesel and gasoline that we use on the farm in our tractors, this doesn't apply to any of the vehicles that we drive over to the roads, say to farmers market, we get a credit on our federal taxes for the tax we pay on the fuel we buy at the pump. So just like the school tax credit, I have to pay the tax the year before and then file to get the money back on my federal tax return. So these are the big ones in a nutshell. It was a little difficult to put together this video because so much of what we get in terms of tax breaks is state specific. And I had to just go over what we get in New York. Again you need to research what's available in your state. I certainly think it's worth your time to invest in the legwork because it can make a difference between your farm being in the black and being in the red. There's so many thousands of dollars on the table if you have a small to mid-sized farm operation. It's also worth taking a trip to your local USDA and FSA offices to research the federal programs that are available in your area. I only know the tip of the iceberg on this. Enough to rant about some of them and enough to say go and check on others like the CRP program because that's a great incentive to keep your land in pasture which is what farms like ours are all about. It's tough to make a living farming right? I can't say that enough. And anything that you can get to help you get by while still playing by the rules is fair game. So my recommendation is you go out and look at these programs and I hope that this video has been informative and helpful. I'm not a tax expert but if you have any comments I'll try to answer them as best I can below. Thanks for joining me and have a good day.
