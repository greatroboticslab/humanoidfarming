Science & Technology
 In this video, let me show you how to define various fertilizing activities and its applications for various crops using Panagro Fertilizer Program. Every estate in Green Valley Plantations relies on its soil test report for the nutrient requirements of its crops. This report forms the basis of the fertilizer program that Green Valley Estate follows which includes the set of nutrients to be applied to the crops, calculate and arrive at the exact percentage of fertilizer to be applied to the crops, the frequency of its application along with the cost and the required labor. Managing all of this in a manual system is a challenge for Green Valley. In Panagro, fertilizer program helps at defining various eel-based fertilizing activities and its application separately.
