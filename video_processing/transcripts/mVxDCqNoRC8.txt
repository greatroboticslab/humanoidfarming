Soil Health Practices to Improve Trafficability

 We're here in the southeastern corner of North Dakota looking at some high clay soils where a half inch of rain can really make a difference at harvest. The field that I'm in now has been no-till for four years and has a history of cover crops. The cover crops on this field have primarily included cereal rye as a moisture management tool. We'll take a look across the road where the field is managed with conventional tillage. So what I want to show you is the difference in soil structure between these two fields and how that helps hold up equipment at harvest time. One thing to note is that the field we're in now that has a history of no-till and cover crops was harvested with a combine with tires. The other field that has a history of conventional tillage was harvested with a combine with tracks. So to keep that in mind as you look at the rutting on the different fields that were combined at the same time this season. One of the main reasons that this soil supports equipment so well is because of the soil structure. So as I break apart this soil you can see that the aggregates are falling apart but my hand isn't getting that muddy. That means that these aggregates are fairly stable and they're they're helping to support they're providing what's supporting the equipment. One of the other benefits in this field is that we have residue on the surface. So as I walked into the field I'm actually walking on the residue to keep my boots from getting muddy and so that can be a huge benefit when when running equipment on fields that may have some moisture in them or or have experienced a half inch of rain like this one did last night. We're over in the conventionally tilled field and I just want to show you the difference between what we were just in and this field as far as soil structure. So you can see that the that the equipment was not held up very well in this field you can see the the tracks and the ruts from the equipment running across it. So against my better judgment I'm in amongst all this muck here and we'll take a shovel full of soil and see how this actually looks. When you pick it up there's just no structure in this at all. It falls it falls apart it sticks to my hands it really sticks to my hands so there's there's no structure in this that helps this break apart easily into the aggregates that that we had in the other field. Oftentimes the benefits of building soil health aren't just seen during the growing season but they're seen at harvest in the way that soil holds equipment. So as you're looking to achieve the goals that you're setting and using soil health building practices think about trafficability as one of those goals.
