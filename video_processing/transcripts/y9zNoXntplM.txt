 What we're doing this year is we've combined personal research at the university with a year-long class looking at local sustainable agriculture, answering the question whether it makes environmental sense, if it's environmentally efficient, to pursue urban farming and to pursue local farming. There is a lot of farming research out there and agricultural research that tends to be for conventional farming. So the land grant schools with schools of agronomy and agricultural science are a very different kind of agriculture than we're trying to research. So there's some data out there especially on the metrics that we're investigating energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for sustainable agriculture but surprisingly little actually so it is an unknown in a lot of ways. The reality is we really don't know what the environmental costs or benefits of this type of farming are. Does this make environmental sense? Is this as efficient or more efficient than conventional agriculture? If it's not, can we make it more efficient? And if it is more efficient we want to use those numbers in order to develop environmentally friendly policies. We're pursuing the project using undergraduate interns and so that's where the class aspect comes in for the research project. We have 12 U of C interns who range from second year students to fourth year students who are spending their summers on farms both in the city and surrounding the city. Right here we're at the growing home Wood Street farm where they've combined a job training program with their food production and we have an intern here for the summer. And I work side by side with the program interns who are also learning how to farm and they have access to fresh foods through the program and then they'll go on to do other things but take this experience with them. What I'm getting out of the experience isn't that different from growing homes mission overall where they're using urban agriculture organic agriculture as a vehicle for job readiness and building a community around the farm. It's such a great opportunity for the university I guess the student body there is it's just a great field experience so I think because it's kind of involving so many different people and types of disciplines and types of students that depending on how it goes it you know there's kind of a great future there for continuing.
