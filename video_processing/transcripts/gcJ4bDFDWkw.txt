 I'm Ed Twidwell. I'm the Extension Forage Specialist with the LSU AgCenter and I'm standing in a Bermudagrass hay field this afternoon and wanted to just visit a little bit about hay production. I've had a pretty decent year as far as hay production goes. We've had pretty decent moisture so the hay cutting has been pretty good this year. Now this time of year one of the things we need to focus on is fertilization. You know what we want to make sure we have a vigorously growing Bermudagrass stand. It needs to be fertilized properly and one thing is a little bit different about hay compared to pasture is when you produce hay you're removing the entire plant so you're removing a lot of nutrients. In fact for each ton of hay you're removing about 50 pounds of nitrogen, 12 pounds of phosphorus, 50 pounds of potash and 6 pounds of sulfur. That's just in one ton of hay. So if you're removing say two tons per acre you're removing double that and if you're really trying to have high production say four to five tons you can multiply those numbers by four or five. So we get up to that four or five ton per acre range we're getting some pretty high yields and you need to replace that with fertilizer. The other thing to think about is cutting management. How many cuttings of hay do I want to take during the growing season? And it kind of depends upon what your goal is. If you're after high quality hay for the dairy cows or the horse industry, you're probably looking at cutting about every 30 days and that's really what these hybrid bermudagrass varieties are designed to do is to be cut about every 30 days. The other thing is if you cut them a little bit later you may have a little more high little higher yields but not the quality is going to going to be a little bit less. So you kind of got to decide where you want to be. You know if you're harvesting for beef quality hay you can maybe cut that down to maybe every 40 or 50 days. You're sacrificing some quality to have some higher production. And typically we think the bermudagrass is going to be a little bit higher yielding than bahiagrass. Bahiagrass tends to be a little bit more prostate. Probably works a little bit better as grazing grass as compared to bermudagrass for hay production. But you can make hay out of bermudagrass. You're just probably not going to be able to cut it very frequently. Now this time of year, late July, getting a little bit late as far as trying to establish a hay field. We typically would like to try to establish the bermudagrass in May or June. One of the things about bermudagrass is it can be planted either with seed or vegetative material. Now the seed of bermudagrass is extremely small. There's about two million seeds in a pound of bermudagrass. So when you plant a bermuda seed, you need to probably seed with some fertilizer or sand or something to help carry the seed. And the vegetative material with bermudagrass, particularly plant, we call it long hay cuttings. You need to have about four or five nodes on each plant. We shoot for about 1,500 pounds of material per acre. So spread that material out, disc it in, and hopefully get some rain on that and you should be in good shape. This time of year, if you're looking at planting a forage for production, about the only thing you can really look at planting are summer annuals. These would be such things as pearl millet or sorghum sedangrass. They can be planted pretty much through July and hopefully give you some grazing in about 45 to 60 days. We give you a little bit of grazing in the maybe August and September before you get your ryegrass planted. And finally, one other thing to kind of look at the remainder of the growing season here are insects. A major insect issue we have with bermudagrass hay fields is armyworms. And armyworms get their name because these insects move like an army. They can come in and destroy a field overnight. I mean, you can have a field that looks nice like the field we have one day, the next day. It can be pretty well devastated. So just keep an eye out for birds and it'll give you an indication that you might have some armyworm infestations there. Another insect issue that we're starting to see some issues with, it's kind of erratic at this point in time, but it's a bermudagrass stem maggot. It was found in Georgia about 10 years ago. And if you go out in July or August and you see some of your plants that look like they've been frost damaged, that's an indication that you might have the bermudagrass stem maggot. It's probably not going to be the whole field. It just, in certain areas, your field may look like it's frosted. And that's a sign that you may have a bermudagrass stem maggot. So my recommendation is this time of year, get out and scout your fields. Kind of pay attention to see if you're starting to see any insect damage and then take some precautionary measures. We do have a good number of insecticides that can be used to control these insects. Thank you. Thank you.
