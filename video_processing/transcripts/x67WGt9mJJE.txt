 Here is the best method to get tons of harvest points fast for the summer event. Now the next harvest starts in like 40 minutes, but instead of waiting, let me just show you what to do because it's very simple. In the seed shop, you just want to get the tomato seeds. Yes, it's only a rare, but trust me, get a ton of these. It should be in stock like almost every time, every five minutes, just keep buying it. Have a small area where you put all these seeds, so I'll put it like around over here and just spam it around the same area so it's a lot easier to pick up. It doesn't end there though. Once it's all grown, it'll look something like this. Obviously, try to get more. Collect every single tomato till your inventory's full. You'll even get some seeds back. You're going to keep doing this till the next harvest starts so you have a whole hour to collect tomatoes. They grow back fast, and once your inventory gets full, you just want to keep gifting it to your alt account. Repeat the process and put all the tomatoes back to the summer harvest. You'll get up to like tens of thousands of points. Not even kidding. I hope this helps. Don't forget to like and subscribe.
