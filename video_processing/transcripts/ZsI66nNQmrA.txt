We broke up. Right? I got a little bit. I said, you know, she's like, another female. What was the purpose of, you know, what's the purpose of her. my homeboy my homeboy said he was like I feel like my homeboy I don't know if it's true or not because I just don't know but my homeboy was like you should have went up there like he was like oh you should have went up there and talked to her like he feel like she was low key trying to get me to come up there but I'm like nah like that ain't how you get somebody to come talk to you like we grown you want somebody to come talk to me you could be like hey tell him I said come here you know what I'm saying I think she was hating I don't know what she had going on I'm trying to figure out what y'all think man because it was just weird bro like this thing was weird bro like why would you send another dude to come to me and tell me something like that like what was the purpose of that that's the whole thing like I get you know what I'm saying you want to tell him that you know what I'm saying you want whatever whatever you know what him got going on I don't know who he is or what she what he is to her but it's the point that he felt like he had to come to me and say that you know what I'm saying and then the dude and then the dude turned out the dude turned out being weird as fuck the dude was weird as fuck like he came to me he was like hey bro uh old girl upstairs blah blah blah she was talking about you she was saying how you you weird or some shit I'm like I'm gonna say what her name is and how he told her name I'm like bro that's my ex bro that's my ex that's my ex girlfriend like of course she gonna talk when we broke up and then when we broke up it wasn't it was a bad breakup it was it wasn't even like no it was a bad breakup like when we broke up we was beefing it was like we ain't like each other like she was mad at me I was mad at her it was a bad breakup and we ain't talked since I ain't seen her I ain't talked to her since like I ain't said nothing to her four months later you send a whole dude to come tell me some some weird shit and then the dude turned out to be weird as hell he I'm like hey bro what you going to like I I even like I testing him I was like well what's up bro like I was like what's up bro so what you coming to me for like what you coming to me telling me this for what you getting at bro like what's up what you mean he was like oh nah bro you know I ain't no smoke or nothing like that he was like I ain't got no problems with nothing like that he said basically he was trying to like like he ain't want no problems I was like well what's up bro like I want to see if he wanted to hit low key I was trying to see if he wanted to fight like I was like I'm like I'm confused like why would another man come to another man and say something about a female that said something to him so I'm like he must got some kind of problem like he must want to check me like I'm trying to figure out why he did that so I'm like I'm like well what's up bro like why you coming to me like what's up bro what you trying to do he was like oh nah man oh nah man I ain't I ain't trying to do none of that blah blah blah blah he was like I was just saying blah blah blah blah I'm like bro you acting you the one acting weird right now bro like you literally came out of you literally came at me about another female for no reason you ain't I can see if you came to me you was like hey bruh she don't like you you know what I'm saying you need to go or or or or you know what I'm saying hey bruh I don't know what he what he had going on like I don't know the purpose he didn't even tell me he just wanted to just say that like I'm like I should have went up there but I didn't want to start no drama cause you know my ex she kind of crazy with it she's Spanish and stuff so I wanted trying to come up go up there and she try to cause a scene or whatever the case may be or what so I just stayed in my distance had my little drinks chill with my people with my friends and stuff like that and just let it go but the homeboy was this close this close like I'm talking I'm like I'm like right here I'm like bruh what's up what you what you talking about bruh and he he went to backing down cause he knew I was dancing so she almost started some she almost started the mess last night she almost started the mess last night hey y'all know I got too much going on I got the farm I got the homestead but at the end of the day I'm not about letting no dude try me especially by the female that I already had bruh you know what I'm saying like bruh I already had her bruh me and her was together she was living in my house she was telling me she loved me and all this stuff now it was something oh he weird and all this and now you and your feelings and you sending people to come talk to me like I felt like I felt like if you really didn't want nothing to do with me or you really didn't want to like like you should have just let me do my thing you do your thing we just ignore each other I felt like you creating that energy or creating that making that comment was draw with gokey trying to draw me in like like like you wanted me I don't know it was just weird bruh like I don't
