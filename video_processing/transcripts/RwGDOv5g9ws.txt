 This village woman knows the secret to growing ginger. In her garden, the young ginger plants aren't on the ridges, but tucked away in the ditches. It's a smart setup to protect these delicate shoots. This technique keeps them cool and hydrated, perfect for growing strong. But something fascinating happens as the ginger matures. Look closely. What was once a ditch is now a ridge. As ginger grows, farmers add soil little by little, helping the plant stretch upward. Eventually, the landscape flips. The ditches become ridges, creating a dynamic farm that adapts as the ginger thrives. This ever-changing field reflects the resilience and care behind every piece of ginger we enjoy.
