 So here's how you do it. Step one soak your seeds for 18 to 24 hours in a shot glass of bottled water or dechlorinated water. But whatever you do don't go over the 18 to 24 hour mark. You don't want your seeds to over soak because this can slow down the process of germination. Step two get two cotton pads for each strain that you're germinating. Max five seeds for every two pads. Take your seeds and place them inside the cotton pads. If you have one seed place it right in the middle but if you have several seeds make sure you spread them out evenly. Step three spray the pads very lightly literally like three four times with a light mist. You want the pads to be lightly moist not soaked. Do not pour water on them directly or over spray them. Step four cover the seeds with the moist side of the cotton pad then lightly spray them again with just two sprays. Step five take each strain and place them in their own ziplock bag then give the inside of the bag just one final spray. Then seal the bag 75%.
