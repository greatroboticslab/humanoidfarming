 He's got a PhD in blackberries, you know? I think he just might. He's got all these blackberries planted for me, but I want to show him some other blackberry plants. That's right. We drove all the West Virginia to help Nate set up his own food forest. And of course, I had to show you a couple of shots of him actually doing some work because nobody ever gets to see that stuff. And I don't know which was harder, actually planting the bushes or actually keeping all the ducks away from them because all they ever wanted to do was eat those blueberries off them bushes. And in case you didn't know, Nate's in the middle of nowhere. So we're having to literally cattle panel the entire area that we just planted to make sure we keep those plants protected. And as far as the blackberry bushes he wanted to show me, well, his are the wild ones with thorns on them. And the ones we planted were completely thornless. And they even got to teach Nate how to double his yield for blackberries by pitching off the tops of them. This was one of those things that it took everybody and Will survives in order to make all this happen. And I know I said not to plant blueberry bushes with blueberries on them, but Nate's already going ahead and eating them all. Blueberry. That's good. That's good.
