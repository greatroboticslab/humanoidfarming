Howto & Style
 Have you ever wondered why your plants look so vibrant after a nice rain? Well, rainwater contains nitrogen, which is an essential macronutrient that plants need. It's also slightly acidic, which allows for vital minerals to be absorbed into the plant more efficiently. Unlike tap water, rainwater does not contain chlorine or salts, which can accumulate in soil over time and hinder plant growth. Best of all, rainwater harvesting is easy. A one-inch rain event over a thousand square foot surface area can yield an impressive 600 gallons of water. So, do yourself and your plants a favor and give Rainwater Harvesting a try.
