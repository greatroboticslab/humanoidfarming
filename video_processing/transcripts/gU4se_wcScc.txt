 Okay, that seems to be recording. Okay, good afternoon. Hi, Richard and Emily. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. This is the final webinar that we're running for provider support for the agriculture, land management and production T level. And this is just an overview really of all the documents and resources that you need to make sure that you are ready for delivery in September. Okay. So today we're going to cover resources, curriculum planners, the key date schedule, sample assessments, our DLR resources, a little bit on the industry placements and events and supports. And of course, as always, happy to take any questions at the end. You are on mute at the moment. So if you do have any questions, please put them in either the Q&A function or the chat. And Ali will keep an eye out for those as we go along, but we'll plan to answer everything at the end if there are any questions, because that's usually easier. As I've said, we will record this webinar so that we can put the recording on the website for other people to listen to the Q&A. So to start off with, just to make sure you know where to find all the sort of generic resources that you need, the key resources for the start of the year. The majority of these will be updated for September. So the ones that you see on the website at the moment may well be for this academic year that's just finishing, finishing and will be updated before September. So things like the T Level Welcome Pack, which has got lots of important information in and the teaching and learning, teaching, learning and assessment guides are really good sort of basic guides to the T Level that you need. There's also a guide for higher education institutions at the moment that doesn't yet include land, but that will do in plenty of time for when your learners are looking to progress. But it might be a useful document to share with any HEIs that you work with or if you have any HEIs or if you have a HE provision actually on site as well. OK, and there's quite a useful little navigation video on there as well to support you with finding all the resources, because I know sometimes it can be quite hard to find things on the website. So, you've got a link to the resources page as well on the slides, which I'll send out to you after the webinar. OK, so your most important document that I know that you all have had access to already is actually your qualification handbook or specification. So, again, I've put a link on there to the webpage where you can find that. But this is the document that has all the information that you need in order to deliver the qualification successfully. So if you go to the documents tab on that page, you will find the specification there. And it's also the same place that you will find all of your sample assessments and so on as well. We also have on the website some sample and exemplar curriculum planners. These are editable and downloadable so that you can adapt them as you wish to use with your planning ready for delivery. Again, those can be found on the resources page and you will find that there's a sample plan for year one and for year two. And then there's a sample for a week, what a weekly timetable might look like. If you didn't already watch the curriculum planning webinar that we did back in February, it would be worth going back on to the events and webinars page and just have a listen to that. The recording is on there and gives you a bit more guidance on how you might plan your curriculum for the year. Just as an addition to that, it's important to remember that in land we are a bit different. We've got a heavier weighting for the occupational specialism compared with some of the other waves. So it makes up 70% of the TQ time and the core only 30%, which means you must remember that you've got to start that delivery of the occupational specialism in year one alongside delivery of the core. Otherwise, you're going to run out of time for delivering. Another really important document that hopefully you have had a look at already, still in draft form at the moment, but will be finalized soon is the key date schedule. Okay, this gives you all the information you need on the dates for 2023-24. So it gives you information on the registration dates, booking dates, the different assessment windows for the exams for the ESP. And then also the results release dates in August as well. So it is important that you have that document saved somewhere or printed off because it's very useful to help you with your planning. So you can think about when you're going to deliver your ESP assessments and also obviously when you've got your exams and going forward, you'll also need that for your occupational specialism dates as well. So really important. Okay. Another, obviously lots of documents as always. Another really important one is this registration assessment entry and results guide. So alongside the other sort of generic resources and the key date schedule, this is how you actually do your booking. So this is a really important one, important for you to share this with your exams team as well. And perhaps your quality team, anybody that might be involved in registering learners, amending learner details, viewing results and so on. So it's got quite a lot of detailed information in it to help you with your booking and entries and accessing your results on Ward Garden. Okay. Okay. Again, we've added, I've added the link on that side. So just a reminder of the assessment schedule as well then. So as you know, you've got your core exams, which is made up of one common core exam and one core pathway exams. Now, typically we would expect those to be undertaken in the summer of year one initially, with then potentially retake opportunities in the autumn and summer of year two, should you need to have retake for any of your learners. Obviously, it's up to you in terms of your curriculum planning when you decide to sit those exams. If you're not 30% of the TQ time, we would expect that you'd probably be aiming to sit those initially in the summer term at the end of year one. And the same with the employer set project. Again, typically undertaken in the summer term. I think the window is March to May in year one. And then those retake opportunities in the autumn and summer of year two. Just to take note that for a learner's first attempt at the core assessments, they have to sit the core exams and the ESP in the same assessment window at the moment. Your occupational specialism, as we've already said, the delivery of that is going to start in year one of the course due to the size. And this supports the delivery of the knowledge and skills and engagement in their chosen specialism alongside that core component. So it's not so dry. And learners will undertake that assessment in the final third of their studies in the second year. So, again, the summer term, it comes right at the end. The only things to note with that is that crop production, occupational specialism will also have an autumn assessment window in year two to allow for seasonality of some of the tasks. And also, once you have sight of that occupational specialism assignment, you might want to look at how you plan that out, because some of those tasks for the different occupational specialisms, horticulture, for example, may need to be done slightly earlier in the assessment window rather than all being left towards the end of the assessment window. So on the website, you can find a range of sample assessment materials. So we have a sample theory exam for the common core paper one and a mark scheme to go alongside that. So if you go back to that qualification page that we saw at the start and you go to the documents under the assessment materials accordion, you can see a little snip there on the screen. You can see element 8717 slash 30, which is the core. So if you drop down that accordion, that's where you find the common core paper and the sample marking scheme. Likewise, if you drop down each of those individual accordions, that's where you'll find your core pathway and occupational specialism sample assessment materials. So for land based engineering, livestock production and floristry, you will just find the core pathway exam and the ESP and occupational specialism for each of those under the crop, woodland and portico. So we've got the core pathway, culture accordion. We've got the core pathway that covers all three of those occupational specialisms. And then you've got the employer set project and then you've got the three different occupational specialism assignments for those different OS's. OK, a little bit more complicated for that one. OK, moving on to digital learning resources then. So City and Guilds will produce a set of digital learning resources for each of the topics within the Common Core. So that's those 10 topics that you can see on the screen there. They are currently all in the process of being finalised and they will be uploaded as and when they're completed, but will all be on the website by the end of August. OK, so as you can see, there will be resources for health and safety, sustainability, working in the sector, ethics, business, equality, communication, relationship management, finance and information and data. And on the next slide, we'll just show you where you find those. So, again, if you go to the T level resource hub and you scroll down on the resource hub page, you will see an accordion that says tutor resources. If you open that accordion and scroll all the way to the bottom where you find the agriculture environment and animal care, you will find currently there's one folder there for unit three. They're working in the agriculture environment, mental and animal care sector. So that's the only one that's there at the moment. But like I said, all the others will be on that before the end of August. If you click on that, it will download it as a zip file. And within that zip file, you'll find four individual folders. You'll find the first folder with a scheme of work. The second folder has a series of PowerPoints within it that you can download. There's then some worksheets which have both blank ones for you to give out to the learners. And then also sheets with some answers in for the tutors to help give them a bit of guidance about the types of answers learners might give. And there are also some sample multiple choice questions. There's papers that you can give to the learner without the answers on. And then there's, of course, the mark scheme for the tutors as well. So there are quite a lot of useful resources within there. So it will help you with the delivery, that delivery of the Common Core once you get started in September. OK. I just wanted to mention briefly about the industry placement as well. So although this is monitored by the DFE and are not part of the TQ, there is some quite good resources available to support you with delivery, help you to identify what would be an appropriate placement for a learner. I know there's been lots of conversations in agriculture in particular as to whether learners can work on a family farm, if that's their background, or whether that can be part of their industry placement. So that first link on there, the delivery guidance, is a really, really useful document that explains exactly where the learners can get their hours from, what type of placements would be appropriate. It does in fact say that they can use a family farm for a placement provided their supervisor isn't a member of their family and there's not a conflict of interest and so on. So there's lots of really great guidance in there. We've also put a link to a log book for students, which is again really useful to help them log their hours. And there's some information about the specific agriculture, environmental and animal care route as well. So again, three documents that will be useful, both for you and perhaps your employers as well, in terms of getting them prepared for having students on their industry placement. Okay. Just briefly talk about the events. As you know, this year we've run a series of events as a kind of countdown to delivery. There will be a new events calendar uploaded before the start of the 2023-24 academic year, and we will have a whole series of events to support you in delivery of the new qualifications. So this will include live webinars such as this one, webinar recordings, face-to-face events and regional networks as well. And of course, you can always request a technical advisor visit and we can come out and see you as well for that. So that will be available on the website shortly, but definitely before you come back to start for the autumn term. Okay. And if you do have any sort of comments on any of the events that you've been to this year, any feedback, anything that you've thought has worked really well, anything perhaps that you would like to see that we haven't done, then I would be quite happy to receive any feedback on that so we can make sure that we support you fully with your delivery. So as always, we do provide lots of support via the website. If you haven't already familiarised yourselves with the T Levels section of the City and Guilds website, then I would suggest you when you have a spare minute, you go on there and have a little look at what's on there. There's all sorts of information on there relating to focus groups, employer industry boards, e-bulletins and all sorts of other stuff as well. And if you haven't already signed up for communications, if you go to the T Levels page and then click on providers at the top, scroll all the way to the bottom of that page and there is an online form for you to fill out. And that means you will sign up for our e-bulletins and any other communications that we send out. You can select which T Levels you're interested in so you won't get them for all of them. If you don't want them, you can just sign up for the agriculture, environment and animal care ones and you will get all our updated bulletins. And within that we have everything from any relevant news relating to T Levels to events, links to recordings, all sorts of things. So lots of useful information within that page as well, if you sign up to it in that newsletter. OK, and finally, I've just added a slide at the end with a checklist for you that you can print off if you want to and just use to help you ensure that you've actually accessed everything that you need to in preparation for delivery in September. So it just means that you can hopefully use it to help you navigate around the website and find the documents that you need and make sure that you've downloaded them, printed them off if necessary or read them through, pass them to the appropriate person. So as we've said on there, that registration assessment, entry and results guide is worth sharing with your exams department, especially if they're new to T Levels. So if this is the first T Level that you're running, because the process might be slightly different to what they're used to. Yeah. And just to help you really to support you with finding, finding everything. And actually, a very quick one today. That is actually it from me today. So it's a very quick overview of everything that is available for you to access. So I see we've had a few other people join us. I am going to stop sharing. Put my camera on. Now, if you have any. Oh, sorry, Ali. Do you want to end the recording as well? Yeah, I can do. I didn't. I'll just come off camera. OK.
