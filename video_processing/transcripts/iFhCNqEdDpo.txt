Science & Technology
 Am I the only one that didn't know rotating crops can supercharge rice yields? Let's break it down. In the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, agri-scientists have found a game-changer. By rotating rice with upland crops and adding organic amendments, soil quality improves dramatically. This leads to healthier plants and bigger harvests. Imagine more rice with less effort. So whether you're in Vietnam or anywhere else, crop rotation and organic amendments could be the key to bumper rice yields. Try it out and watch your fields thrive.
