 The Richland Soil and Water Conservation District has two new farm implements available for farmers to rent for use in Richland County and the 25 Mile Creek Watershed. The first piece of equipment is an 8-foot INJ roller crimper, a heavy rolling drum which attaches to a tractor and is used to kill and flatten cover crops. Using this roller crimper allows farmers to reduce their herbicide use while growing cover crops that improve soil health and fertility, reduce erosion and protect water quality. The second piece of equipment is an 8-foot Truax no-till drill with three seed boxes. No-till drills allow farmers, pasture managers and those interested in planting wildlife food plots to plant their crops without first tilling the soil. This method of soil management reduces erosion, encourages soil health and protects water quality. You don't have to till the soil which can cause soil erosion. You don't destroy the root structure of the soil and you can just plant right on top of it. Very little soil disturbance, very efficient, get a very good stand. Those interested in renting the Richland Conservation District equipment must have access to a 50 horsepower tractor with remote hydraulics and are responsible for equipment transport and use.
