 Biodiversity is responsible for sustaining all the processes that allow life within the planet. Hence protecting biodiversity is an investment for companies, not only for their well-being but for their own survival. For this reason we created the Biodiversity Check Agricola, a voluntary, flexible and personalized tool that will help you determine the level of importance that biodiversity has for your company. How does BCA work? This tool initiates a process of dialogue that leads to the voluntary implementation of measures that integrate biodiversity into your business management. BCA analyzes your company in three levels, the production area, the farm and the landscape, that is what is found beyond the farm limits. At these levels, business management is also analyzed in a transversal way. The steps for its application are very simple. A consultant analyzes the environment and profile of your company. This person is a previously trained professional with experience in agriculture, biodiversity and environmental management. He or she will guarantee that the recommendations are technically and financially feasible, depending on the needs and reality of your company. A pre-visit is carried out in which we share, explain and clarify doubts about the tool. We prepare ourselves to know the farm by previously studying which are the main sites of interest. Carry out the field visit. In this visit, we talk in depth about the needs, resources and important points of your business. This dialogue is confidential and without value judgment, since our interest is to support you in your business and environmental management. Based on the obtained information, we make a report with the recommendations. We present you the report and together we elaborate the biodiversity action plan for your company. And so we finally reach the main objective of the BCA, the implementation of the biodiversity action plan, which contains the measures that your company chose voluntarily. The Biodiversity Check Agricola has two modalities, individual BCA for companies and convoy BCA for associations of small producers. BCA will bring great benefits to your company since it will allow you to have an innovative business model by opening doors in demanding international markets. Increases the value and good reputation of your company and products. Minimizes risks by securing vital resources such as water and ecosystems. Represents long term cost savings since healthy biodiversity on the farm reduces the volume of pesticide use, less fertilizer, improves soil conservation, reduces water consumption and others. It contributes to making visible your company's actions to preserve biodiversity. The survival of your business depends on the conservation of ecosystems. Shall we talk?
