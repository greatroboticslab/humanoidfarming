Howto & Style
 Hey what's up guys it's Garnin with Dave and today we are going to install this in-ground composter. Now if you guys want to come a little closer I want to show you yes you can grow things in pure compost. Yep that looks pretty good. We're going to be grabbing some of these worms already and we're going to rehome them. So from here there's really nothing fancy I'm just going to dump everything in. Once you go ahead and dump it in we're going to do a little bit later and we're just going to add a little bit more of the soil on top. You can go higher but for video purposes I'm just going to keep it a little bit low. I'm going to experiment and come back and I'm hoping we can have enough worms to start a worm bin.
