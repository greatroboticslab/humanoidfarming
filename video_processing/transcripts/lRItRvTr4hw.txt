 All right as a farm butcher what you're looking to do when slaughtering is be as humane as possible and that may seem a bit odd for someone who's not from the country or not been around slaughtering in the past but the options of using either a knife to just slit the throat and snap the neck or using a rifle or a bolt gun I'm always going to go to a bolt gun I've been put onto it by another farm butcher and since going to the bolt gun I will not go back to a rifle as my first option. You can clearly see how effective it is the other lambs just standing there wondering why its mates doing the horizontal jig and it gives you the opportunity to be able to get up and get the other animal bolted before moving in and then cutting the throat to bleed out the animal and I understand you can see movement still but that I assure you is just the animals nervous system it is brain dead.
