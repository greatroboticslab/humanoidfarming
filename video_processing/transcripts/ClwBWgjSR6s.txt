Howto & Style
 I'm back with another cucumber salad because more than 7 million of you loved my sliced cucumber and carrot salad from a few weeks ago, so here we are again. This one is light, herby, and deliciously creamy. The whole milk Greek yogurt is key. Do not use low fat. It's so good. You'll start by whisking together a quarter cup of Greek yogurt with one tablespoon of vinegar and a tablespoon of olive oil, then season to taste with salt and pepper, and then add in thinly sliced shallots, a thinly sliced cucumber, and a generous amount of chopped leafy herbs. Any leafy herb works here, and today I'm using a mix of cilantro and mint, but dill, parsley, tarragon, and basil will all work just as well. This salad is versatile and forgiving, so play around with the flavors. If you don't have or don't like shallots, you can use scallions. Use a flavored olive oil like garlic or lemon, or for a tangier salad, you can use sour cream. Let me know if you make this and how you make it your own.
