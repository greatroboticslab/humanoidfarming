 The Bowerfields The Bowerfields The Bowerfields The Bowerfields The Bowerfields The Bowerfields The Bowerfields The Bowerfields The Bowerfields In any other place, our sinist would be on Hicks and Commonview. The Bowerfields are far from anywhere. I have no magistrate, constable, and hope that everyone will take the blaze to be an act of God. Here's the dream that I've had. Safe from vagabonds and longbows, weaving fortunes with ourselves from yarn. These small dots here, these are your people. We have become like animals, goat drunk and lecherous. We are no longer hungry. We're certainly not sober. Least for now. We're also known. My name's Edmund. I'm here to make improvements. We lost this in the whole time, I don't like this. If you go home, everyone will be safe. Agriculture without profit is absurd. Your maps, they win lives. This is my house, goddammit! This is our land. This is our land. This is our land. Create mode. You're dead. Aye no no, fuck it. Tap that car. Click and create your player's. Check out- Thank you.
