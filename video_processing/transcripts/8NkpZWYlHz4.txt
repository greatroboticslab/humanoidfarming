 Hi there, little farmers. Welcome to Kiddo Learning Tunes. Today, we're going to take a fun farm adventure to meet some amazing animals. Do you know the different types of farm animals and what they give us? Learn how farm animals help us in fun and exciting ways. Let's explore together types of farm animals. Look at all the animals on the farm. Farm animals come in all shapes and sizes. We have dairy animals, poultry birds, ruminants and equine animals. Each type has a special job on the farm. Let's meet them one by one. First, let's talk about our dairy animals. These animals give us milk, which is used to make tasty foods like cheese, butter and yogurt. Here's a friendly cow. Cows give us delicious milk every day. Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! And here's a playful goat. Goat milk is healthy and yummy too. Bah! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! And here's a strong buffalo. Buffalo milk is super creamy and makes yummy cheese. Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! Next, let's meet our feathered friends the poultry birds. Poultry birds give us eggs and sometimes even meat. Let's see what they do! Meet the super helpful chickens. They lay eggs that we love to eat for breakfast and even make tasty chicken soup. Cluck. Look at these cute ducks. Ducks lay eggs too and love swimming in ponds. Quack, quack. And here are the geese. They're great at keeping the farm safe and their eggs are big. Honk, honk. Now, let's meet the ruminant animals. These animals love munching on grass and help keep the farm clean. Ruminant animals are so helpful they give us wool, milk and help keep the grass trimmed. This is a fluffy sheep. Sheep give us soft wool to make the warm clothes. Bah, bah, bah. Oats are here again. They help by eating weeds and keeping the fields clean. Bleat, bleat, bleat. Cows and bulls are cattle. They give us milk and even help plough the fields. Moo, moo. Moo, moo. Lastly, let's meet the equine animals. These strong animals help carry things around the farm. This is a horse. Horses are strong and fast and farmers use them to carry things and even ride them. Nay, nay. Nay. Donkeys are hard working too. They're great at carrying heavy loads. Hee haw, hee haw, hee haw. Mews, which are part donkey and part horse, are also very strong and helpful on farms. Wow, look at all the wonderful things farm animals give us. From milk and eggs to wool and even a helping hand, farm animals are truly amazing. Thanks for joining me on this farm adventure.
