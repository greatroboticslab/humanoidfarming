 Hello and welcome to a conversation with Rad and I am your host Radcliffe and today we're diving into some captivating discussion. We hope every episode brings you fresh insights, inspiring stories and candid conversation. In a few minutes we'll be discussing lifelong friendship, career journeys, connections that shape our lives and a trip down memory lane. So please find a comfortable seat and let's jump in. Today we're having a conversation with Pedro Scato. Pedro Scato's journey is a powerful testament to service and leadership and resilience. His dedication began with the military service as a U.S. Army Reserve combat medic from 1988 to 1991 where he played a critical role in administering emergency medical treatment during field exercise, assisting in inpatient and outpatient care and conducting blood sample preparations for laboratory analysis. This exercise instilled in Pedro a profound sense of discipline, responsibility and the ability to exercise under pressure. Our guest is experiencing technical difficulties. Our conversation will resume shortly. Thank you for your patience. So sorry for the delay. Without further ado, let's introduce our guest Pedro Scato, who is one of the original members of the Bar, the Black Alumni Reunion Review, a group that was inspired by the friendship back in Buffalo. Hey Pedro. Hey, welcome. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks for joining us. Um, today I want to, um, let's start out first by saying, you know, um, where you're calling in from and possibly just a little bit about yourself, maybe a fun fact about your, you know, your journey. So let's start there. All right. Right now I'm in, uh, Pendleton, Oregon, which is Eastern Oregon. It's about, uh, 280 miles from Portland, which is where I live. Yeah. So that's kind of why the, some of the delays is I'm in a rural community right now. Or is it that, um, the traffic from Portland, Oregon was just horrible? No, it wasn't that bad actually, but yeah, I'm out. I, I've dropped some pictures in the, uh, in our chat yesterday for folks with all the deers and quails and all that stuff. So I'm in rural, rural part of the state, but I didn't want to miss this conversation. So me and Rad worked it out. As far as like getting on here, I'm like sitting in front of the house in a school. And that that's, that's a good spot. So, so that's cool. So are we going to have any, um, deer meat or anything like that for dinner or something like that? I saw those pictures. You said it, what was it? Was it pheathened or what was it? Okay. So there was, there was, um, there was wild Turkey that was running around. There was deer and then a couple of elk that we saw, but we, it's not hunting season right now. So none of that's going to be dinner. So if, if no camera is there, nobody's going to know. Somebody will always know. Somebody will always know. You know, uh, so I, I want to, I want to start by. Go ahead, sir. Yeah. No, no, it's, it's fine. I'm hearing a little feedback from, I guess, a little bit of breeze from outside, but it's, it's okay. We'll compensate for that a little bit. Uh, I want to, I want to, I want to start by saying, you know, Pedro and I have known each other for a long time, right? Uh, we, we, we run in the same church circle. If I want to call it that the, you know, our, our, our parents, um, you know, went to the same church and we had no choice, but to attend church as well. We surely did not have any choice. You're right about that. But we, we enjoyed it, right? Um, those Sunday schools, we, we definitely enjoyed it. I mean, the Sunday school actually helped me because when I took the writing of John at Bus State, ironically, it was some of the, some of the stuff that we already knew from church helped me write those papers. Hey, anything, anything to help, right? I mean, um, that that's okay. I'll, I'll take it. Or anything, anything to have a start off a conversation with our professor to make them think we try to act like we know more about the Bible than them. Good Pentecostal. And, and I think you probably do. You, you were, weren't you in the choir or something like that? One of the, you know, Did they put me in the choir? Well, okay. The thing about being generic, Jamaican American, your parents don't ask you nothing. They just tell you. So I can't hold a note, but you know what they say about when you're being in choir, you think you're the best singer. Cause you're being drowned out by the people who can sing, but no, I was not in the choir. But, but that's fine though. Um, better singers always drown out the other singers, singers like me and you. So we were, we were in the back. If we ever were in the choir, I know, I'm sure I wasn't in the choir, so I'm not even worried about it. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I wasn't in the choir. I went to a couple of Bible studies, but I was not in the choir. So, you know, we said we're going to talk about, you know, so you're, you're in Portland, Oregon, what's going on out there right now for you? Um, so right now, as far as what's going on for me, I, um, I'm working with this, uh, group from the black sovereignty coalition, which is a group that have a collective farming for black folks. And then what we do is we trying to get people that look like us to understand like our history more than what we were told in our history, you know? So what were we brought here? They dragged us here. We had to work every day. We couldn't call up, um, primarily providing food. And so I think that we are the expert on farming. And so through this coalition, we're bringing people, black people back to understanding what we, what we do, you know, from history, farming and understanding where our food, food come from. And so that we're not, um, it's all about connecting us back to the land and, um, that we're not ingesting a bunch of processed foods because that we know the whole society is taken by that. And now these chronic diseases that people have a lot of them could, you can trace them back to what people eat. Yeah. So I'm here at work on the farm. Um, what we do here is regenerative agriculture. So that means no tilling of the land. Um, we don't use pesticides and we don't use, um, we try to make sure that what we're doing has like a low carbon emission or no carbon emissions. So we use, um, weed whackers and mowers that are electric. We use broad forks to, um, turn the soil over. We do a crop rotation and we utilize stuff like biochart and compost. And, um, that's pretty much what we do here as far as like regenerative and, uh, oh, we also make sure the soil is rich in nutrients. So, so how receptive is that though for, um, for folks that you're trying to bring in and you're, you know, you're interested, you're reintroducing them, right? Cause you know, how, how, you know, how receptive are they? Because, you know, some of us pretend like we don't know how to, you know, put our hand in the soil and, and, you know, and those types of things. So people taking it. We have, we have a, a several different approach to it. We, um, in Oregon, there's a huge outdoor school thing. Like that's part of the curriculum. I don't remember that we didn't have this in New York. So what happens in Portland public school kids, it's called outdoor school. So for like a week, the kids are, and the staff go like to like a camp. Okay. And it's mandatory unless the kids have like some kind of medical thing, they, cause you're going to miss some week at school. Right. So I think that's a pretty, um, ingenious way of getting kids, um, learning about outdoors. And so, because that's in the already in the public, the public school system at the farm, what we do is we have, um, middle school kids that come through the farm and do tours. And our farm is not the only one that that happens. And so I think the kids are already in tune sometime way more than the adults. And then as far as the adults, we work with like a lot of the companies that are up here. So I don't know if you know, like a lot of the shoe athletic shoe headquarters are here. So I'll just mention some, but like Columbia out with outdoors, Nike, Didas, um, shoe on shoe, Roger Federer, guys, he's played tennis. So like, those are five big ones. Oh, and then armor on under armor. And so those corporate folks, what we do is, um, they do retreats at the farm and then we do a lot of outreach and bringing like, so let's say your company wanted to come and you all wanted to do like some kind of training and development for your staff team building. We do that at the farm and then we all do that doing harvesting. And so like people that's the incentive to is that when you come and we're harvesting, whatever is harvested, you leave with a basket of whatever, you know what I'm saying? You could leave with some kale, lettuce, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, and all those things I'm saying, we grow their flowers, sunflowers. Um, okay. So, you know, from farm to table, that's, that's good. So you, you start, you're starting the kids out young, which is a good thing, right. Getting them understanding, you know, what, you know, the ground means, you know, for you, for the stuff you're ingesting and stuff like that. So that is, that is great. So what type of acreage are we talking about that you're, you know, they're doing this on is, is there, is it a large area that they have, that they allowed you to do these types of things? So we're on 4.5 acres right now, and it's a shared lot. The, this land is provided by Portland Parks and Rec, which the founder of the farm also works there. Okay. Um, it's, there's like a lease set up, but it's like nothing like, you know what I'm saying? Um, that's just like really helping to promote the work that you're not charging an astronomical amount of rent, right? So it's tied in. And we also have a contract through a piece up, Portland clean energy fund that I encourage us to do stuff that are sustainable, where we're, um, we don't use, we're no, no till farm. So it's a regenerative agriculture. So we don't use nothing that uses gas. We have, we have solar power that's out there. All the weed whackers and the tractors, everything used to operate out there are run on electric. I thought you were going to tell me you have, um, the cows pulling the, you know, no, that's Cuba. That's, that's, that's great though. Well, we don't have a donkey cat out there. No, no donkey cat. No, no. So it seems like you're enjoying yourself though, doing, doing that type of thing. You also mentioned that, you know, um, the type of farming you guys are doing and, and how you, you know, you track the progress and different things like that you use, incorporated drones and stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. That's the part that I'm really excited about. Okay. So, okay. I used to, um, I do Lego robotics coaching with, uh, one brother, um, Antonio Jackson, who was a Kappa up here in a Portland alumni. And he, so when I first came, I didn't have work. So I just was doing volunteering with him and it was, it was, it was really interesting because I didn't really know much about Lego robotics and stuff. And then he suggested that I learned like the kids and I was like, okay. Okay. And then like, no, I mean, like I wish I knew stuff like this in college, bro. So learning like the kids, it gives you so much ins like mom, I was mind blown. So I get a different perspective. You're, you're going into it. Different perspective. Like, mind you, I'm biased because this is what I'm doing as a volunteer thing. And I love it now is that all of these learning up. Oh, and then some of it was like, so it's not just Lego. You have to put servos on the Lego and learn about a little bit of coding. And that's something I kind of stayed away from when I was at those small server models, you were able to put those on and stuff like that. Yes, sir. And then like, I even have some videos that I might share later of like me putting together the robot and how excited I was. And then I, I, um, just like the kids made the robot, like, like a Roomba, right? So you get the little Lego robot and you have a like pads on the bottom and have it pushed the thing around in your house. And you're like, well, I see how the Roomba works now. You know what I'm saying? It's just like epic learning. I mean, I'm, yeah, I'm nerding out about this, but that's good. I'm not, you know, it's good when you're excited about something and it's, it's positive, right? Because you're saying this is what you're, you're using to, to help you with the farming as well. Oh yeah. So, okay. Yeah. So good point. You're keeping me on track. So the connecting that to the farm. So I'm doing the Lego robotics and then, um, I went and got one of them DJI drones, right? And, uh, some of what's happening at the farm, there's a brother named Nicholas who we utilize these, um, sensors to check the moisture levels of the soil. The soil. Okay. Yeah. And then like, you know, a certain, um, food, certain, um, plants needs more water than others. So you do, you have, you have a range of what the water is supposed to be. Right. And then all of those sensors, the drone flies around, records a sensor. And then you could tell farmer Daniel, Hey, the corn needs more water. And then we have these timers that are set up for, uh, the water sprinkler system. And then also we have, uh, since it's black future farm on Sundays, we have what's called black Sunday. So we have this, the farm be a space for black folks to just come and just kick it. There's no work. We just talk about being resources for each other. Okay. The drone is utilized. Then we use it to take pictures of the group. We used that to, um, just fly over and just retrieve data for whatever. Also, we have a washback station that has a solar panels on there. What's a washback station. Okay. So washback station is basically a structure that's, um, a wooden structure with a roof and then there's a sink. And so when we harvest, when we harvest food, we just bring it like, like, let's say carrots, right? You know, you take them out of the ground. You don't want to take them to market with the dirt on them. So you have the sprinkler that spray. That's where you do all your cleaning up of your, um, vegetables and stuff like that. Okay. Yeah. And then we back them up. And then another thing too, is that everything that we, we don't sell none of the produce sites. So earlier you mentioned farm to table. We have folks that are people from their own restaurants or food trucks, the, um, lettuce will go there and it shared. Okay. Okay. Nothing is sold. And then also we give stuff to the schools around us. So those kids that come and come through, they get stuff when they leave. And we also provide, there's like a food pantry, but it's, it's kind of different than the ones that like, when I lived in Brooklyn, it was just the cheese and stuff like there, it was processed stuff in Brooklyn. I'm sure it has changed now, but, um, listen, Brooklyn has good stuff. All right. So I'm sure. Hey bro, I did my research. Um, they have similar things to what we're doing in Brooklyn. I know they do. Um, but yeah, so what happens is that we, we send like the radish, the lettuce to the food pantry and then just in our question from pushing, like, so people see a lot of that instead of a lot of pasta and a lot of cheese, like, you know, government. And that's good. I mean, you're, you're, you're helping, you're helping people, you know, eat healthy. And, and that is, that is wonderful because just like you're talking about Brooklyn, I'm sure, you know, with around the farming area that you're not seeing a McDonald's or so every corner. So that, that's, that's a good thing, right. To have, you know, people having fresh produce and stuff like that. You know, people, people live on healthier, less trip to the emergency room because of how they're eating and stuff like that. So I commend you for, you know, for being a part of that, you know, so. Yeah. And then, you know, this term called food desert. Yeah. So like east of here, well, I'm saying like I'm important, important. There's a section where the re gentrification have pushed the people. And so out there, there's like nothing, like there's a lot of housing. There's a lot of industrial and office spaces, but there's not really like nice restaurants and, you know, no Mercado or Bodega or none of them places to, for people to get stuff. So another initiative for the farm is that we got a bus from TriMet, which is the bus company around here that we're going to have a, a, like a food bus. And so, you know, like similar to like those Korean vegetable stores in Brooklyn. Yeah. So the, the bus will set up like that and it has solar on it and then it opens up like the, the side of it opens up with those staggered boxes. Yeah. People will be able to like just grab food, like no charge. That's wonderful, man. I'm glad you're, I'm glad you're there helping out with stuff like that. Cause I'm, I love hearing stories like that. So let's, let's, let's move on a little bit, right? So we can talk, we can talk about food all day because I love when people are eating healthy and stuff like that. But there was a time when, um, you probably, you know, and I'm going to go back to Buffalo, right? So, um, a lot of this conversation kind of, um, stems around our time in Buffalo. When did you, when did you, um, attended Buff State? I arrived. So let me give props to Trevor X, Trevor Williams, the Don. So me and him went to Wingate. I'm just laying out the... No, no, it's fine. No, no, it's fine. You just lay that path in, in, in how you get to Buff. So me and Trevor, um, went to Wingate. I mean, I know y'all from Jamaica, but me and Trevor, uh, went to Wingate and then we took like Spanish and a couple other classes. And then Trevor was like, I think Trevor was graduating before me or... Is that where you got your last name? You know, the Spanish that you took? I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We'll talk about that offline. Um, but, um, so Trevor, Trevor had mentioned that he was going to go like to Buff State, right? And, and there's a couple of times I think I came by y'all's house and, um, I was looking at new Paul's and a couple of other places. Right. And then I think Trevor was already one semester in because I didn't get up there and they did EOP. Oh yeah. So this is what happened. Trevor told me about all the EOP stuff and all them guys and Danny and these people that I don't even know them, but I was like, yo, tell me like, how is it up there? And he was like, yo, it's fun. You know, like the EOP folks and we have a good cohorts of folks, you know? And so, um, and just thinking about my experience at Wingate and then, you know, being in a space where you're familiar with people. And so I just said, Trevor's like, talk to these people. So I went and I passed up on the other schools that I had looked at and I just was like begging the Buff State people. Like, I know it's like, whatever, but let me in, you know? So let me ask you a question. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt, but you're saying the Buff State people. Um, I know a lot of the, the fellas came across Tassie. Was Tassie a part of that? Yes, man. So yeah, it's good that you said that. So I was in direct communications with Tassie, right? Cause you know, Trev like gave me the whole, these people, you need to talk to EOP, talk to that, and then since I already had acceptance in another SUNY school, I don't think it was because I didn't have any, um, like I would have been accepted if I would have applied, but I didn't. So I was kind of, you weren't aware of it. So here's the thing, right? I'm like, I don't know nobody that went to New Paul's. I want to go to New Paul's. You know what I'm saying? And now here that Buff State is dope. So anyway, I took Trev's advice and I did what he said. And then I get this letter back from them and they were like, oh yeah, you could come in the winter. So bro, no joke. In January, that was when I came to Buff State and then Seth, Trevor, all of them was already there, but like the- So you came and saw all of these, the fellas there? Yeah, that was established, you know? But yeah, my kind of connection was Trevor, you know, Trevor, I know him before. And then, um, I get to meet people like Monsel, Frank, Danny and them, and then all of Trevor's folks, you know, from the houses and apartments that they lived at and all that. So we'll get into more later about like all the shenanigans that we were up to. So, so, so were you a part of any of those houses and was that, was that, you know? Yeah. Since I came in later, I didn't live with, I didn't live with, uh, in the house, in the house that those guys were in. I was more likely to like visited, like I'd be over there on forest, all the spots. Right. So what happened was that a little bit further, what would happen? Like, so yeah, I was in tower three and then, oh yeah, I think you want me to talk about this or I should talk about this. No, please continue. No, please continue. We're, we're in Buffalo. We're in Buffalo. So I'm in tower three. Right. And then I have a, they assigned me to a room and there was like nobody, no roommate. And then Buff state, so you had a single. Yeah, man, I was single, but I didn't pay for a single. So, you know, a buff state oppressive regime. They were like, they send me a letter saying, you didn't, you didn't pay for a single. So we're going to have to consolidate you. Like, no, this is a direct quote from the letter. It says you, you paid for a double your financial aid, dah, dah, dah, dah. And so we were going to have to consolidate you with somebody else. And then lo and behold, Tennyson Lewis was who was, but I had a, they put me with Tennyson. Um, and then Tennyson and those guys, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, one second, one second. So you room to Tennyson the first year you went there. Yeah. Within the first year, like I think the second semester when they, they didn't want me to have the single by myself, they consolidated me and him, but then it didn't last. Cause you know, I'm a, I talk a lot about like what I want. I know it's like, I advocate for myself, right? Okay. I'm obviously, you know, that talk a lot for what I want, but as I got older and more educated, that's advocating for yourself. So I used to go down to the R and D and I was like, yo, is there any way that I could be, I could move? And it's not because of tennis. I was like, you know, you know how it is. If you have a single in the towers, right. And you were like a freshman, you have privacy. Then you get a roommate all of a sudden, you know what I'm saying? Like it wasn't allowing me. I wouldn't know about that. I had a roommate when I lived there, but it would have been more fun to have like, you can't go from going from a single to a double is bad. So anyway, if you, if you, I don't know what happened, but tennis ended up going like to live somewhere else, but fast forward, I'm in the lounge and I'm like always studying. And then this football player dude just kept coming through the building. Right. And then it was Claudel. Yeah. Sorry. Continue. So Tennyson, um, you know, cause I was going down at RD because I want to get my single room back. So then I don't know what happened. Tennyson got a different room or something. And then, so we'll land it. We'll land it. It had treat up on a month. I mean, um, you were, you were tattling on the, on the guy. Nothing that I said at it, it had to do with Tennyson. Everything was like, yo, um, I enjoyed having the single room. I'll try to figure out how to pay for that, the single room, like all that. It, there was nothing about my roommate doing anything at all. Me and him is good. Okay. So it was just, you just wanted your own privacy. Yeah, man. And then I, I didn't want nobody like knowing that, you know, okay. So anyway, um, I'm like hanging out in the lounge studying and then, um, this football dude kept walking by and they want, you know, he would be like, yo, what's up. And then, um, next time he was like, yo, man, you always down here. So he's like, come upstairs. I hang out with the brothers. And I'm like, who is he talking about? Football dude. Claudel. So I took the books upstairs and then I was like, oh, where are you? Say they live again? Second floor or something. So I go there. Right. And it's like where him and Fed and some other people live. And, uh, it was like, is that your, is that your first introduction to those guys? Yeah, kinda. Yeah. Okay. But what I did remember though, no shade on nobody, but there was forties. Cause you know, I, wait, wait on, on campus. Yeah, I'm on. They had forties on the tables up there. I thought forties were reserved for the, for the people with, um, with houses and apartments. Yo man, but you know, these guys are from spring valley, you know, so, and one of them are, you know, so they were like kind of doing a little better than the rest of us. Okay. I see. I see. So that's, that's how they, they kind of brought those substances on campus because they were from places that. This is safe space. So I'll talk about it. And we, oh, now they can't bust, they can't do nothing for us. You said statue of limitation is gone. Done. Yeah. It's done. But yeah, what I did remember though, like no joke is like that Claudel is a very caring person. And like, just for that brother to just like reach out to me in the lobby. And then like, what is that? 40 years later, we're still friends. And you know, the weddings that we've been into, been at and stuff and, um, different places around the country where we like seeing each other and then like, you know what I mean? And then like Trevor came to, uh, like when I was in San Diego, Trevor came to, um, like a conference and, um, we just hung out, went to Pete Pacific beach. We took some of his colleague down to Mexico, you know, like, so these, these little things that were done in our infancy as like, uh, young men. Yeah. You're 19, 20 at that, you know, and just, just, just those little things, little act of kindness that people gave to each. Cause like Radcliffe, like no joke, somebody just talking to one person in the lobby, another friend, like Trevor could have like not shared anything with me. Right. And then I probably would have gone to new pulse and I would be on a different podcast now or no podcast. But that's the, that's the butterfly effect. Right. Um, and, and, and sort of, uh, you know, um, a different way where, you know, one thing happened and then, you know, you know, those subsequent things happen, um, just like, you know, this, this, this infamous trip in the, in the shuttle, the, the buff state shuttle, which I would love to hear some more about. Um, somebody mentioned that, um, there was, there was a moving party, you know, for somebody with, you know, with some buff state equipment, you have an idea what they're talking about. Are you talking about what Jojo mentioned last time, you know, I'm saying no names. Those members, statute of real inflations are gone, but. I'm just saying, I just couldn't, what was that story all about? What do you mean? Okay. Let me, okay. Okay. Let me, okay. So in those times of meeting people, so Tennyson was a PSA guy, right? Public safety assistant. And then Joe Johnson was also PSA assistant. But yeah, I see that about the furniture. I'm getting there. And so at sometimes, you know, Tennyson's approach to things were not very popular. Let's put it like that. Well, how he was doing at his job. Just remember the brother is not here. We're going to talk about it a little bit later. He's not here to defend themselves. Oh no. That's what you do. I don't want you to throw shade. There's no, there's no, what's the term? Anyway, but there was a van, a shuttle bus. So at one point, me. So I'm sorry, I just keep interrupting, but that van was made to take students around the campus, right? I just want to be clear. I just want, I'm just trying to get. It was a shuttle van. Yeah. So me, Tennyson and Joe used to drive the shuttle van as part of our PSA duties. Okay. At some point, one of said vans was used to transport a honey and their phone when they were moving to an apartment off campus. So since, since the statute of limitation is gone, do you want to share the party that was actually driving the vehicle? It wasn't me, bro. I can't remember that it was me, but you said not to talk about folks. So I'm just saying, you told me the statute of limitation is, you know, is way gone. So I'm just asking you, is that you said it wasn't you. I know, I know that I got canned for it and then they wanted me to rat people out and I didn't. And then last time Joe was on Joe, Joe, Joe, remember. Joe said it wasn't him. I don't remember Joe saying it wasn't him. I don't, I'm asking. I don't think it was Joe. Okay. Joe used to do stuff, but Joe don't. Yeah. Joe didn't do that. So I think I know how to subtract two from three leaves one. Okay. Okay. But yeah, I'm not going to speak ill of any of my friends, so I'm not going to say, so those are the things that were happening with one of the people from, yeah, those are the things that were happening with our, you know, with our shuttle, bro. I don't know where this is going to, or this podcast going to be on the street. Anyway, somebody drove the van and helped the honey move. And that was not a uncommon thing, bro. It's our community. So anytime we need help and any, let me just say that and I'll, I'll, I'll, uh, whatever come at me from this, I'll take it. We were kids that didn't have any resources. And so when we were in spaces that provided us, um, especially when we thought we could get away with it, let's say that. Um, cause we always thought about that first. Um, we did it. There you go. So yeah, somebody needed help and we helped. And that is fine. That's kind of how we roll. But I know I helped the unload furniture. I'll say that much. Accomplice, but that, that's kind of how we roll. You know, we help each other when, when we need to get, we were there for each other in, in different ways. Um, just like, you know, some, some other brothers, what we're talking about, you know, the 40 party and stuff like that, or the Labatt blue or whichever I wasn't a drinker. So I wasn't sure of all of those type of, um, beverages that people will indulge in, but I guess, you know, if another thing, oh, sorry, there was one thing I don't, I don't think it came up in anybody's thing yet, but we used, Buzz and B was a private, uh, um, was a point, a place where a lot of things happen. So for example, I know that, uh, Rambo talked about welly. Well, I'm going to throw another wrench into this thing. There were a couple of us that used to go by Buzz and B. And as you know, there was like native American people from the Seneca nation that used to hang out in front of Buzz and B. And I want to own this cause I was one person that did this. There's other people that did it, but I don't know if they're going to talk about it, but let me tell you what happened. There was a brother over there, call himself Indian Joe and over, over Buzz and B. Yes, sir. Indian Joe. And, um, he would have the, um, food stamps and then he would, I mean, we didn't have no money. Right. So he would like X amount on a dollar and I'll get you chicken or whatever in there. Right. And so, Hey, we indulge cause we, we saw that as a way to eat protein and we didn't care what he was going to. You can imagine what he used the money that we gave him for that. But like, you see what I'm saying? We are very ingenious in the way how we figure out how we take care of each other. And that happened on a lot of occasions where. You're resourceful. Yeah. That's what it is. You're, you're very resourceful. Yeah. And so Indian Joe, I'm not, that's it. The name he gave us. I don't know if that was. So Indian Joe was supplying you with, with what you needed. And check it out another way. Cause we took the one, we took a, there was a class we took with, I forgot the guy's name. It was a lawyer that teach at Bo State. So one time, like a dumbass, I actually raised my hand in class and use a scenario from real life. And I, I didn't, I took out names. So I was like, if somebody gets assistance from the government and they happen to go buy us something at the store. And he, he was like, he was like, is there any currency being exchanged? And I was like, no, no, no. He just, you know, gift us. And he's like, well, there's a gray line, but yeah, you know, trying to figure out like how much trouble I could get in for that, but nothing ever had to be. We don't deal with gray. It's black and white. You know? So, so you, you, you mentioned welly well, for those who don't know, welly well is, is, is welfare, right? Public assistance. Right. Um, and I, I think, um, some of the, some of the brothers talking about when they were there, they needed, they needed assistance with, with housing and stuff like that. Was, was that something electric? Yeah. You said, was that something that I utilized? Well, I heard this infamous thing about the bum up yourself, you know, like don't brush your teeth and be whatever. I heard that, but I didn't do that. I didn't, I didn't do, I didn't do the old dirty up yourself. Uh, I think we kind of, some of us learned after Rambo did it and that he, you know, best practices. So Rambo go down there and listen to, he said, fed told him, but then he realized that he didn't have to make himself look like a bum because it was really about your financial needs. Right. So yeah, I did utilize that. I didn't get nothing for, um, you know, because I'm a Jamaican that, uh, such strong rec, right, uh, work ethics and have full jobs. Like I actually had three jobs. I worked at the bite. I was all PSA. And so that bit me in the ass because that shows as income. And so all they gave me was a little bit of money for the, for it to support my gas bill. I didn't get no food camp like the rest of the people. And I think it was back then it was probably around 425 an hour and you can only do like 20 hours or something like that. Right. Yeah. Cause then, yeah. If it's going to impede on your studies, they, they use big words like that, but yeah, but it makes, it makes sense though, because you're, you're there to study and not to, to, to really do anything other than that, but I guess you needed anything other than that. So on, on, on another note, I, I want to kind of, you mentioned this before that you roomed with, um, Tennyson, um, and, you know, um, our brother transitioned last year. Right. And I really want to see, you know, do you, do you have any, you know, outside of you blaming him for, you know, taking the honey to, you know, move and stuff like that. Do you have any other memories you want to share about, you know, our, our, our dear friend, you know, Tennyson? How did we get to blaming him for that? I'm not saying blame. I just say, I just know how to subtract. You said it wasn't this person. It wasn't that person. And you said it was only three people working there. So I'm in one, two, three, subtract two from three gives you one. Right. So. Okay. Let's move on. Um, the, so memories. Okay. Um, just a really kind brother, man, like, um, knew everybody. So for example, I'll share this story. It came up in one of the Saturday meetings. So even though Tennyson had a different roommate, me and it was still tight and we used to just crawl around Perry hall was our favorite place. It seemed like everybody was going towards Perry. What was so you know, what was Perry all about? For me, there was a lady named Cheryl over there, a Bayesian girl that I like, but, um, anyway, and then also our friend Patsy, I think that's where Patsy lived. And so that's the story about how me and Tennyson, um, we went to go visit Patsy and then our friend Claudel, you know, I'm a football friend from the, from the lobby after me and Claudel and we got tight. Right. And so, yeah, we do just be hanging out. Like we just, me, Claudel and tennis was just walking across the quad and it was like, yo, let's go check in on Patsy. And so we go check in and she didn't even know who this guy was. So she's all greeting us. And yeah. And then the conversation, conversation, you know, Patsy is a very studious girl that lived in England. So, you know, serious about her work, not to say other people that don't live in England, don't care about their work. So Patsy is from England. Yeah. Patsy grew up in England, Jamaican, but grew up in England, her and her brothers and sisters. Okay. Sorry. Continue. So we went over there and then we left and we were going to the union. And then as soon as we come out, the union, Claudel was like, yo, fellas. We're like, yo, what's up, see? And he's like, yo, that's the kind of lady I would marry. Like no bullshit. The first, I mean, the virgin, lay him on the woman and just like, and he, he can, I'm sure when Claudel get interviewed, it'll come up. But me and, me and Tennyson introduced him to Patsy. And then, then after Claudel went off somewhere, me and Tennyson, you know, cause sometimes we act like beavers and butthead. We was like joking around, like, yo man, that guy was wrong. We just got remaining, we start making jokes. Right. Cause I, even though Claudel's our friend, he's like big, you know, buff dude. So you don't want to make too many jokes. So we was just laughing like, yo man, you ever seen nothing like that before? Yo, like no joke. That was like, he wrote. So like, then it became like, you know, make yourself presence. You, you like somebody. So it happened. And then that, that I'm getting, I'm, you know, intertwining the Tennyson relationship. So then Claudel and Tennyson move off campus. And I forgot, I think it was Hoyt street that they moved to. And at that time, Claudel and Patsy was already dated, like dating each other. But yeah, Tennyson was like a little addition. Like every time I saw them, I thought Tennyson was like their kid, bro. Like every time they took care of him. And Patsy was cooking all the time, right? Like just throwing down and she could cook. So me and Victor live across the street from them. And we just like a bunch of stray cats, just wander over like cooking. And then Claudel was cooking. Claudel would make a lot of like Italian stuff, chicken wings, like Claudel totally just jumped into like Jamaican culture. Like a couple of times, I think he had some parties over there and I was like, yo, what you cooking? And he said, I'm like, I'm going to eat a curry chicken. I was like, what? But yeah, like that happened, man. Like we'd go get like big ass bags of frozen chicken wings as if we weren't getting enough from the bite and from the mood hall. Like it was crazy. Like what was going on. Listen, you're students, man. So you'll kind of eat whatever you get, right? Yeah. Yeah. And so like, isn't that how it works? Yeah. Yeah. So back to Tennyson, like you, I think you heard last time about these buses that Claudel was very entrepreneurial and a couple of times he convinced me to take some classes. He was taking even though I wasn't a business major. So I took retailing with him and macroeconomics. And then it's almost like the brother took the exact shit that they taught him. And then he was like, he ran those buses down to Florida during spring break, you know, uh, Tennyson and me. And, um, we were on, so on student government. So Claudel was the treasurer. And then we would, me and Tennyson. Tennyson was on the student government as well? No, it was just me and Claudel at this point. Tennyson just came to the meetings. And you know, like he's the ambassador. So he'd just be talking to everybody up in there. You know, how Tennyson was, he'd come to the meeting. I just chained up everybody. And, um, me and Tennyson helped Claudel put up all the flyers and we had to fill up the bus with people. So we did that the first year. And then the second year, Joe Johnson and Cleveland and then went on the bus with us to Florida. But yeah, Tennyson was infused into all of that space. When we went to Carabana, Tennyson was there. Um, man. And then another thing I want to say, the dude has such strong work ethics. Tennyson rode a bicycle. This is when Claudel was working at RPS, Rojay Packaging Systems. I still remember the acronym. Um, this UPS, right? And, um, you know, he got me and Tennyson jobs out there. I ended up branching off and went and work at Avis with Victor, because it made sense. Victor's my roommate. He has a car on his schedule. But, um, I remember a couple of times Tennyson didn't have no ride and yo, no bullshit. The dude put on like scarf. Where, where, sorry, where, where was RPS? You know, cause you're, you're saying you guys were on. Out in Cheek, Tiwaga. So Danny, you remember those old, um, map? I forgot what they're called. When you like trip, trip map, map take or whatever, trip take or something. I forgot what it's called. We used to use them when we were going downstate. Like you already figure out your trip. Tennyson sat on the table. He sat there and figured out routes he could take. Cause you know, the freeway, but he figured out a route he could take. And I was like, this is pure madness. And he put on, bundled up and rode the bicycle to the work. Cause the Bridgen don't want to miss the work. I think it's called trip. Yeah. Okay. The Bridgen sat at the table and yo, of course me and Claudio and them was worried about him, you know? And then we, so we were always like, when he, anybody that know when Tennyson done with work today, let somebody know. And then guess what? That man was done and the man dated a bunch of times. And then after that, I don't remember if you guys remember the white, um, I wouldn't know it was in Toyota. It was a, a Chevy Cavalier that he bought at the buy here, pay here place, because we kept telling them like, yo, we understand you could join the Olympics, um, cycling team now that you'd ride from buff state to white street all the way out to, I mean, now even thinking about it, awesome. Not crazy. That is hella dedicated on work ethic stuff. That, that brother, it builds character, right? I mean, I mean, there's, there's just so many, so many stories to be told about Tennyson, you know, when you look back at it, you know, it's. Another thing too, it's just, go ahead. You know, above state, we had to take that one PE or whatever, the physical education to graduate. It was one of the few. Mm-hmm . In college. Yeah. So I took jogging. I mean, Tennyson took jogging, but for some reason, I don't know, he missed a bunch of the thing and he, he had to do it incomplete. So then the brother, he took swimming, right? And then he would be like, man, I come from the islands. I know, you know, when people say, oh, y'all can't swim. He's like, I'm from the islands. I can swim. So he would go, he would go and do the crazy life. Okay. So there's another thing that nobody has talked about. Tennyson would purposely do the, you say one thing, he'd go against the grain, but a lot of time it was like positive stuff. Like, so when the people was like in the union talking about how black people can't swim, that dude was in over in the sporting facility. He can't do the jogging no more. So he would go swimming and do like 30 something laps and then come in there with a hat, the thing on his head, like kind of trying to shove it in their face. Right. It's like, yeah, if I, if we can't swim, while I was over there swimming 30 something laps and I smell like chlorine or like something like that was like, call it, I'll be like, dude, serious. You know, but it was a, it was a, it was a very strong will person that like love to prove people wrong. Show, you know, it was very smart, dude. Very, very smart brother. But yeah, I want to share about him. Like, that's good. I'm glad, I'm glad you're able to share, you know, some of those stories about him because he, he, he was, he was everywhere. I'm with everyone, you know, so it was really, really a good thing. So I'm glad, glad you're able to share such positive story about him. And the, the, you know, the other, the other guys who went off earlier did share some stories as well, you know, and, and everybody. Remember creative studies? Yes. With the dang paper airplane. So we had this thing, we just kind of undercover talk about the recipe for 4.0. Right. And I think Trevor, Trevor had a list of classes. All of us did, but I think Trevor was a JBS major communications and Trevor would be like, Yeah, it was a communications major. Yeah. Yeah. I think Trevor was the one that told me about the creative studies. And I was, I was like, I don't believe that. So what's the, what's the midterm? Oh, you make a paper airplane and you do that. You know, like, seriously, I said, that's stupid. But then, um, walking to our Buffalo was one of them. Claudel took that with me, I think, because there was a bunch of summers that we were just up there. But yeah, that was, those are also the things that like, we, you, you have doing your friends, taking classes together and you do better in the class. Cause then we're like sharing our notes. We're talking about like, what, um, you know, what, what are best practices on how to study things like that? Me and Vic did. It's, it's, it is, it is supporting each other, right? Because it was, you know, um, for, for, for us, right. I'm going to say for you guys, it w it's a small community. Cause again, I can, in, you know, 86, 87, 88 for you guys, I came in 89. Um, the, the, the population of, of black students in, in the school wasn't that, wasn't that big. So you kind of find that niche, right. And you support each other, you know, so that, that definitely was, was something that you kind of, you know, geared towards is to, is to find some common things that you can do with, with the people that are like you, you know, as, as Trev said, like-minded people, you know, so it seems as if, you know, there, there was this, this bond with the group and, and still is right. Because I can see it in our, in our Saturday conversations, you know, the, the bond is really strong. We, we support each other. We just, we just come in and talk, right. We, we will have these conversations that initially started out, you know, Hey, let's do this for 30 minutes. And I think that, you know, we said one of them went for a few hours. I think the last one we were on probably went six, close to seven hours. So that tells you something, right. That you have a group of, of, you know, friends, you know, that have these, these common interests, the bond that, you know, that something that, that bonds, you know, us together. And it is really, you know, something that you don't see among large groups of friends, right. You might find a friend here or there, you know, that are close, but to see, you know, all of these friends who come and support each other, you know, started back in Buffalo and is still doing the same thing today. You know, it's, it's really something to talk about, you know, so I, I, I want to thank you for, you know, coming on and sharing your story, you know, to our audience, sorry for, you know, for any delay, you know, that we had, we had some technical issues that we, yeah, yeah, we worked that out and I'm actually glad that we figured it out. It's funny that how it turned out, I had to just come sit in front of the house and I'm in the sunshine, like no joke. I'm on, I'm on a sitting chair, Elm tree, Buffalo Elm, no. Buffalo Elm. Okay. No, no, Elmwood, Elm tree. You get it? Yeah. But, but you know, it's, it's really, you know, good catching up, you know, with you again, we knew each other for almost, you know, 40 years or more, you know, I'm going to say close to, okay. I don't want to say it. I keep saying to everyone on this podcast, I'm in my forties, but I've known you for almost 50 years. Right. So it's, it's a long time, you know, back in those church days. So, and we're still, we're still going strong. Yeah, man. It's interesting because I think about a year ago, I called Trevor and I was like, Hey man, I just want to like, let you, I said, I've known you longer than any of these guys. I think it was before Tennyson passed because it was, I think it was right before Trevor got married. And I was just like, I want to just, I want to just thank him for the interactions that we've had as friends. Cause I think as we, we should always do this. We should always show gratitude and we should always thank people for like helping us get ahead and we should do the pay it forward thing where as we learn something, we try to have other people, if it's a good experience, like learn that and be the best version of themselves. And I feel like all of the brothers on here, that's their wish for everybody is that we live the best lives and as the best version of ourselves and interactions that we have with each other is all, it all comes from love. Like, cause I know like even on the third, the Saturday thing, I think sometimes like, um, people like wonder how me and you like joke a lot with each other, but then we come back and it's never like, I'm not trying to throw shade or any, just realistically, like there's folks that like, if you, the more, you know, somebody yes, joke with them. And like, I don't take what you say to me personal. I just come back not to say that I'm a better comedian than other people that do the same thing, but yeah, we can all take like a, a script from everybody's page, right? Cause everybody that's on here brings something to the table for real. Yes. Oh yes. I definitely agree. You know, um, everybody brings something unique to this group, everybody, you know, I, I cannot think of one person, you know, in our, in our Saturday conversations that, you know, are not supporting each other. We have one of our brothers, Tito, who's, you know, um, in the hospital right now, getting some treatment for, you know, stuff that he will talk about, you know, he's, he's getting cancer treatment, you know, and stuff like that. So, you know, we, we, we, we all, you know, we all, you know, we all support each other, you know, um, in so many ways, you know, that, you know, it's, it's hard to, hard to even, you know, quantify that because again, we will have somebody going through something, you know, we're, we're there to support them. Um, Hey, I got support from, you know, from our brother, uncle Vell on, um, on, you know, on the floor, you know, when I wanted to start something, you know, that's the type of, you know, that's the type of, you know, individuals we are, right. It doesn't matter what you need help and what the support is, you know, um, you get something, you pass it forward, right. That's what helped build a bond. And I think it's a, it's a really strong bond. We, we reignited this after Tennyson passed and it's unfortunate, you know, it was, you know, something like that, that brought us back together to start this. And it was like, go ahead. I want to say something real quick. Yes. Just, um, the interesting thing is I talked to Tennyson, I was talking to Tennyson up to two weeks before he passed. There was a, there was a, we, we, we already, okay. As a group, we did this before. Remember Claudel's birthday party, we zoomed and then Tennyson was talking about says redoing this, right? Yes. This is why it's so powerful. Tennyson kept saying we should do this again. And then we were like, oh yeah. And we never got to it. Right. And then he transitioned and I'm thanking God that we are doing this because like, I just want to share this. And I think Danny did this in his message last week is that like, I need you guys. And I'm not a very, I'm not open about a lot of stuff that's going on with me. And I think a lot of us aren't. Yes. But I think I need you guys. I need this space. There's people doing this in Portland, but I'm not friends with them and I don't want to share. I don't want to, you see what I'm saying? Yes. Yes. I'm, I'm, it's very vulnerable things that happen to people and you don't share those with strangers. And so Saturday, even though, and I think we're good at being comedic with each other and we love each other and we understand, but like I'm on the West coast and you know, like I'll jump on because I'm in the middle of work day and everybody's and people are cool. They're like, yo, P is going to come on. And then, or, are y'all about to jump off? And then I get on there and they're like, Oh Lord, here comes Pedro. And then it's another two hours, right? Yeah. So like another two hours. And then like one last quick joke, the last time we were on there, I was in the car and then somebody was like, where the hell are you going? And I'm coming out to Eastern, Eastern Oregon. And then I get there safe. And then I jumped back on and I was like, I messaged somebody. I was like, y'all still on there. And they're like, come on now, are we on here? And I jumped back on, but I told my brother-in-law was driving with me. He was driving. I wasn't driving and yes. And then I go in the house and he's like, those guys are still on there. I said, yeah, man, it's nothing but love. And then, you know, he kind of just like, yo, I wish I had friends that I could do that stuff with. So every time there's people that are like envious of our relationship and what we do, because what we're doing is great. It is, it is a support system, right? Even if it wasn't made, it wasn't created for that. It is a safe space where we come in and talk about different things. Again, I mentioned Tito, we talk about health, we talk about family, we talk about finances every now and then. We talk about different things in that space. It's a safe space for us to, you know, to communicate those things, you know, ask a question of someone who may know more than another person, you know, in on a certain subject, you know, those type of things. And it's, you know, if it wasn't for that Saturday conversation, we probably wouldn't ask some of those questions of certain people because we're not comfortable with them. Right. But because of the journey that we have taken, you know, from Buffalo and again, with us from Jamaica, right? Not Jamaica, Queens, but Jamaica, West Indies, right? Thank you for clarifying that. I wanted to make sure that, you know, the folks who are listening, you know, know that we're talking about that. We, you know, we knew each other for a long time and we can come to each other and, and, you know, ask a question or talk to each other or say something or say, Hey, you know, that thing that you were talking about, I don't think so. You know, and because, and that's what that safe space is, right? We're not going to go out, we're not going to go out there and, and, and just, you know, do that with just anybody. It's, it's like, it's just very therapeutic. Let me put it that way. I look forward to those Saturdays. On the last Saturday, the wife kind of, I was, I was napping on the couch and I'm going to put this out there. I slept before Trev or Tito because they're normally the ones sleeping. And I got, I got nudged and say, Hey, your Saturday conversation. I was like, thank you, hon. And I headed off to my conversation. Right. My wife makes sure I get all my stuff, chores and stuff done. She's like, Hey, those guys, you need to jump on the call. Like she, she like, Hey, get on the call. Like you ain't got no excuse for, you're not going to Costco, go to Costco tomorrow. You know what I'm saying? Like just, just understanding like what that space provides. Yeah. And that's still. No, that's definitely a good thing because, um, um, some people have nowhere to go. Right. We have this space and it is, it is a wonderful space. You know, um, if I must say, that is, uh, Pedro, it made me think about moving back to New York, like all the time. Cause I'm like, if I'm on here with them this long, like, let's say I was out in like Long Island or somewhere. I'm like, dang, I could just link up with these brothers and go have some lunch or something or go hang out, go hang out with Rambo and get 400 million oysters. Or go bird watching. Yeah. Yeah. Well I'm a, I'm unspoken for man. So I ain't going bird watching with him. Listen, the man's talking about the canaries and stuff like that. That's what he's talking about. The bird, you know, the parakeets that are in the trees. That's what he's talking about. You're not forgetting that he lived in London and birth watching over there is something different, but yeah, anyway, man, um, bless her. Yeah. I respect. So yeah. Pedro, I definitely want to thank you for, you know, for taking the time out to, you know, to join, you know, the conversation as we have some, you know, we're taking a short break, but the conversation doesn't have to stop here. We invite you to join our guests for some casual chat and banter, share your thoughts, ask questions, or just enjoy the moment. Let's make this a lively and engaging exchange. See you in a few. You left, you left PSA. Yeah. And work for grounds and work for grounds. You were getting better. It was more flexible and I had more money. I was like, I'm good. And I didn't read no, read nobody out. And they wanted me to tell everybody that was doing that. There wasn't, yo, it was a lot of stuff. They wouldn't have had no PSA. For real. So you're saying, you're saying uncle Velt, everybody was doing that. It was a systematic thing. There was more than that. That was being done. PSA had keys to rooms, bro. Wow. Things, things, I guess after 30 years, statute of limitation is, you know, is, is kind of gone. So. Hey, I thought, I thought for sure Tennyson was going to be like long, like end up like Joe. And law enforcement. For sure. Oh man. That is crazy. So, so basically you're telling me that everybody was doing the same thing except for somebody caught one person. And then they wanted us to tell them about everybody else. And we did not, they wanted me to. And I was like, I don't know what you're talking about. Cause I think they, I think they were, uh, somebody must've said like, these kids are going, are using the van. Like it's a personal moving like U-Haul. Oh, so they didn't want, they didn't want you all doing anything with their, with their vehicle. Let's okay. This is one thing I used to do. I never moved nobody with the van, but I used to give people personal, like ride off the route to their house because it was only supposed to go around the campus. Right. Yep. But if it was, it was like somebody from CSO or any of these brothers that I know, I would drive them straight up to Hoist Street. No, they, they go to tops, everything now. So now, now legally they go to tops now. We, we, we were, so we were just ahead of the curve, right? We were just telling them what, that they need to be more flexible with student route. They wouldn't listen to us. Wow. But hey, they see that other schools are doing the same thing. So they realize, you're right. You're ahead of the curve because I'm, I worked at, we took the kids to the trains on a Thanksgiving. They could go, we would drop them off. Not me, the shuttle drivers, the train station, the airport, like all over the place. Free. I mean, UB does the same thing, right? They, they have, they have, um, rides that take them to the mall and, you know, tell them what time they're going to pick them back up, you know, all of that stuff. So they're either late to the party or, you know, the last place I worked at, there was an app that tells you where the shuttle was at. Okay. So you're over there eating and you're like, oh, the shuttle is coming. Just run. They go to Wegmans now, everything. Well, I think I need to go back to school now. They, they, they have it easy. Why don't you go teach a class? You can teach a class. No, thank you. That, that, that means work, right? Or take creative studies, 205, learn how to fly to fly a plastic airplane or something. Or, or, or, that was the biggest joke. AED, AED 100. Which one was that? At the, the, watching movies. Oh yeah. Oh, that was the art history. Um, um, I think I did the 200 or something like that. Um, where, where, where I learned about Warhol and all of, um, those type of art. And then there was one somebody told me about, but I think I got Duke. Uh, it was Jazz Rock Foundation and that was not easy. That was not easy. I mean, I got a good grade in it, but it was not easy. Like I literally had to study. So Shev, Shev is laughing because it was, you know, it was an introductory stuff for him when he, you know, he knew more than what was going on. So Jazz Rock Foundation, you had to listen to, I guess it taught me something though. You had to like, listen to a piece and then you had to, you had to say who was the composer. Yeah. Like all this stuff. And I was like, this is hard. But then I was like learning about good music. I, I, I did that back in high school. Like you would list to Chopin, you know, um, different, you know, classical music, you know, Beethoven, Bach, you know, they, they were, the, the person would actually play a piece on the piano and you kind of have to identify it. You know, um, but I lost all of that now. I think it, I think it's in the back of my head because, um, when I, when I, I forgot which, which building I was in where the engineering building, right. I was actually going to my, when I, to a class and they shared it with, um, with an art, like, um, they were doing pottery or whatever they were doing. Right. I know what that is. I can't remember what it's called. And I was passing the hallway. Right. I told somebody this before I was passing the hallway. So there, there, the hallway was, was here. Right. And I was going this way and they were playing something. It was so powerful. I swear to you, it could have been, I don't know if it's for five seconds or whatever, but I felt like I was in a trance. I, I stopped and I couldn't move for a few minutes. That music was so powerful. And I was like, up to this day, um, I don't think I can remember what it is, but I knew it, it kind of stopped me in my tracks. And I think it was from, you know, me, you know, learning about that back in high school and that piece just came back and hit me because it was just a powerful piece. It wasn't, it wasn't, there were no words. It was just something piece was playing, you know? So I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if that will happen again, or if I, if I hear it again, if I can, you know, identify it or something, but it was, it was kind of an out of body experience at that point. Yeah. Anyway, fellows, I got to jump off. Yeah.
