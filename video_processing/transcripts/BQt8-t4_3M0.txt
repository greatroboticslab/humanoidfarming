 Hi, my name is Marion Kalmer and I'm a farmer from Western Illinois. Today we've been cutting wheat and so I want to bring to you some of our thoughts and what we've done to make wheat harvest a lot more fun and a lot more successful. The main concept that it's taken me, I'm 66, taken me all these years to understand is that before we start harvesting any crop we need to make sure that we've matched the size of the openings of the concave to the crop that we're going to harvest and so that's always been a problem for me in the past because I tried to go with this one size fits all and what would happen was that a concave that's somewhere in between what should be used for corn or soybeans or wheat is that when I would harvest corn the openings were too small and then I would get rotor loss because it just didn't allow the shell corn to drop vice versa if you put in a different concave for wheat or soybeans then it doesn't work for corn so what we've done is we've gone to an enhanced flow round bar that we're using in the red the green combines and therefore it works great for corn we can get the shell corn out we don't get rotor loss everything's great and we didn't open it too much just a little bit now when we go to soybeans or like today when we're cutting wheat then we put in some inserts because we have to hold that material up into the rotor chamber because it doesn't need to come down into the cleaning system so by closing up the openings and we can keep the coarse fresh material up in the rotor we just let the grain drop down and everything works so much better so that's our solution we've invented these what we call half wrap inserts and one concave and then we just add inserts as we change crops so let's stop we'll get a close-up view here of me taking one of those inserts out for you so in today's scenario for wheat we're running a solid uh insert on the right front corner and the purpose of the solid insert is to hold the wheat so that it'll rub against itself to get the grain to drop out then in all the other chambers uh we're running the inserts that that narrow up the gap between the round bar and the uh insert so then all we're going to do is just let uh grain only fall so here's what one of our quarter wrap half wrap uh inserts look like and uh it just goes right up in between the round bar and closes up that opening keeps the straw keeps the chaff up here in the rotor area sends it right on out the back so yesterday uh they're lightweight they're easy to put in so yesterday uh in the afternoon we were getting a great sample we were really happy with it and we've got a little video here that we're going to show you uh so you can see the grain loss monitor we're getting about one bar on rotor loss one bar on sib loss uh real real tickled with it uh you can see where we were at on uh rotor speed fan speed and sib settings as well so uh yesterday was one of those days where everything seemed to go quite well but the key is is it starts right here in the thrashing area these first three round bars we use the enhanced flow and then we pop in and out inserts and we can mix and match these inserts if they're thrashing tough say we're cutting beans uh we can run two or three cover plates and the rest of them inserts or whatever so anyway uh that's our system uh as always if you have any questions call me on my cell phone or you can send me a text um i don't always answer because there's so many random calls nowadays uh but i'll be happy to visit with you i hope you set your combine whatever you may have out there um also uh you can go to our website at calmercornheads.com for information my cell phone number phone number 309-368-1182 and last but not least if you're getting ready for corn harvest and you want to chew those uh tough corn stalks up into confetti uh our award-winning bt choppers will do a great job for you uh you can call our front office to get an estimate and that number is 309-629-9000 so with that hey thanks for taking time to watch this video i hope some part of it helps you make your harvesting of wheat uh easier than it's been in the past and i hope that you stay safe and have a great harvest thanks for watching have a great day
