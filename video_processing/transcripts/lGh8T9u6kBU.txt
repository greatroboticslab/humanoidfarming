Howto & Style
 Did you know if you got some cherry tomatoes, you can grab a pot with soil, then grab a tomato and smush it. The seeds will squirt out of the tomato. Loosely cover it with fresh soil. Water it. Grab a cup or a bag and put it over the pot to make it nice and humid. Take good care of it, make sure the soil doesn't dry out. And pretty soon, you'll have little tomato seedlings growing. When they grow, at least four sets of lean, transplant them outside or in bigger pots. You can grow your own tomato. Each of those tiny seeds in the tomato comes up to 20 to 30 tomatoes. Don't just eat tomatoes, grow something.
