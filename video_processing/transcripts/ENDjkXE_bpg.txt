 all right everyone so this is where we're at right now so this is the part two so basically I got this from Amazon I will have the link in the description and my neighbor actually set this up for me so I could have done it but it probably would have taken me hours to figure it out it would have taken me a month we have mr. grant green thumb yes yes he's back he's back he's back so definitely so we are getting that together so there's some leaves over here as you can see there's a rake here so we're gonna use some of that and put it here and I have the gardening soils as well as some of the potting soil that we use last time so I actually have that here so if you all remember this is the one that we use last time and then there's cow manure at the bottom in here so all of the stuff I got from Amazon and as you can see we are at this point we're all the way at this point and I actually don't know what is what look at this do you remember what is what's planted where this is a tomato the one that's the highest all right okay so tomato bell peppers I know I have to sell those over should we just sold them in there because I do have those little plastic those look plastic things okay but those I can't use those little seed in the little the plastic seeding yeah oh okay all right so yeah so some of them never really catch right but we have these here they're coming up a little bit so you just never know so yeah we are going to be transplanting some of these and and we're gonna go and check on our watermelon our lemon tree so as you can see this is the watermelon so funny story behind this one is actually the first one this is actually not the first one so the first one actually get cut down so by the lawnmower I know but green thumb came to our rescue and replanted one from his garden so you know say it as a good good good and then our lemon tree is doing so much better so if you guys saw the first video you will see this was struggling so it is doing a lot better it looks green green green Florida has been getting a lot of water so and as you can see it's overcast so a lot of the heat has not come back as harsh at it as it was before so this is also helping with the water retention so I'm really happy about that the only thing is making the grass grow a lot faster so you know we have to keep up with mowing the lawn that's the only downside but aside from that this is where we're at and my neighbors are gonna continue helping me build up the gardening bed and I will check in with you guys once we get that together all right guys stay tuned we're gonna get the soil leaves right we're gonna get the soil with the trash mix it up together only sorry that we did not some grass but we can use the trash we can use the can we can we use the grass later I can cut some grass now if you want yeah we can use you know how much we're gonna need if we cook whatever I need to rake again and the rake is not here this right there it's a stronger it's not like your rake this is more for like to dig up dirt but I'll pick up you need any trash bags okay all right guys so as you can see we've got down boxes so there was actually this is like one big box that was cut up is it one or you just opened it up one big box that was cut up and just like opened up completely and he cut around it to make it fit so this is where we're starting all right so we're gonna get some grass we just want to put everything in there and mix it up together and spread it out okay perfect all right so they're gonna get started with that we have all of our soil ready everything we're just waiting for the grass to mix in with the leaves that we have all right guys so like higher all right so green thumb told us that we have to get this topsoil in here so that's what we're gonna be doing so we're starting off with the topsoil and then we're obviously gonna mix them in with the guarding soil as well as that potting mix that I had from last time the manure and then there's some grass too that we have so got that mixture and the leaves as well so that's what we're gonna be doing right now okay guys so we're putting the leaves on top of the soil so we're trying to build this up our own soil that's why we cannot plant in the ground here why if we're going to plant in the ground we'd have to dig out the sand so unless you were to dig out the sand and actually treat the soil yeah so that's what we're doing hooks and what you're going to do now you're going to get the other one and which one you say you're going to get one more of these of the yes yes yes right you're going to get the other one we set it up like this it stayed here until next year with all these things to wrap it inside of it just like interesting okay so next year now as you sow your seeds there and the suckers there come up you need to transplant into it okay so you mean I should probably have one for just compost I should have one for just like a compost right like like something like this one just for that there those suckers we're going to plant how much can hold inside right exactly what you're saying for the next round so you're going to need you're going to buy another one then we're going to set it up for next year and what I do with my new you don't come up by the house inside no it's not since yeah I do the motor was the one by the roadside and that's what you do I never plant anything on it into it until January oh by the next then okay I see what you're saying by March you ready to go in okay should we spread this out? now Brian what do you think? no no no do you like that? we pour in everything and then we mix it up man alright so building it up I have another layer of the top soil four more is there this is actually the gardening soil now right? yes okay so here we go I saw it cut that one too cut that one too huh? cut that one too yeah I'm going to leave it home just not making sure that the spider won home the spider you don't pay no spider no mind when you finish working you look for the spider now no don't want the spider spider not green a jack oh yeah no you want to do now hose no you want to use the lawnmower get more grass all the ham chock and go from the front where the top soil they are and pick up all the top soil that is around here and carry them here okay more top soil? yes we need more this thing has to come up underneath the rim there okay that's fine I have to come up underneath the rim yeah alright the one by any now green thumb green thumb in alright guys so we just went to get some more of the top soil and as you can hear the lawnmower behind me I'm going to be cutting up the grass so we can have a little bit more of that as well to add to our mountain that we're trying to build alright Mr. Grant so what are we doing on this side? trying to get some more oh okay so over that side is a little bit more sandy is that does that matter or no? yeah there's more sand on this side does that matter or? no no no okay not planting anything on the right okay guys so as you saw that not all of them sprouted I used to do when I make it in my garden mm-hmm and you see it go like over there mm-hmm the woods there with the big garbage bag them and fill them oh okay and take them on and just dump them on okay right so you see it guys these are the ones that are catching more so these are the ones that we're going to use the rest we just kind of use to put into the garden bed and then I can reseed those so okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay now now okay now I trust you're Jang now use vakul now watch me now you want to break it come this way wake up everything come this way Everything come this way. Everything. Break up everything. From the bottom come right up. I got you. You have the cardboard though right? No you're not going to go to the cardboard. Don't let me work you too hard and just to say why you do. You going to load yourself over there? I thought I was going to have time to cut the grass but I don't think so. No probably not. Not too much time left. Sunlight. You got tomorrow. Hold on. Let me do something. Look at that. Beautiful. A little. The grass. The rest of the grass. Alright. You can get the grass to put on there. To mix that in as well. What I'm doing here. This is exactly what I'm doing right now. Alright. So that's good. Everything is set up good. But at the same time. I would love if you could get another one. And put it there. Yes. Then we set it up. For next year we will have this plant. This to be. Right. We just keep on wetting it. And let all these things get wrapped in inside. Make all the mulch. You know. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Now I'm going to do some spreading now. Okay. So we just put the top soil. Some more. On the top. We're going to work that in evenly. So yes. Thankfully guys. We are. Looks like we're probably going to get some rain. So as you can see. Look at those clouds coming in. So. Look at all of that right up there. Yeah. And it's very humid. And it's not hot out here. Which is great. So. We're giving a little start before the rain comes. So. I'm going to do some rain. You can see. So. I'm going to do some rain. And I'm going to go ahead and get a little bit of rain. And then we got it. I'm going to do some rain. And I'm going to do some rain. And I'm going to do some rain. And then we're going to get the rain on the top. We're going to work that in evenly. So. Yes. Thankfully guys. We are. Looks like we're probably going to get some rain. So. As you can see. start before the rain comes. Trying to catch up with the rain. Right. And then so we have a bag of leaves that were raked up from back here in the tree. And then those are my little grow bags that were going to transplant. The leaves will make more compost. You got it here. You want me to evenly put it? So you just need just enough to cover it. Like an even layer. The roll bags? Okay. Yeah because we have two soil topsoil bags here. I'm going to turn it off. I'll cool something. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
