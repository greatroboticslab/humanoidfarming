 Hi guys. So it's been raining. We've gotten quite a bit of rain the last few days, which is actually really good because we haven't had to water anything. And this last round of storms last night pushed out a lot of the hot and humid weather. So we're actually sitting at 69 degrees. We are at like 70% humidity, but it feels so nice out here. Since we're in a little bit of a cool down period for the next couple of days, I thought it would be a good time to come out here and start transitioning our raised beds from our spring crops to our summer crops. Because once the weather starts to heat up and that humidity rolls in, it is not fun planting in that weather. We're going to be focusing primarily on these two three by six beds and one of the three by four beds on the side of the house. We have our spring crops in here now, our cool season crops that we planted, I want to say mid-March. We've got our lettuces, our carrots, and you can see I have been harvesting the lettuce and it is so good. It's so nice to make a fresh salad right from your garden. But now that the weather's warming up, these are going to bolt. And once the lettuce starts to bolt from the heat, it changes the flavor. So I want to get these harvested. This whole bed cleared out, minus the carrots and the pepper. But you can see right there the stumps from the lettuce that I previously harvested. I need to be a little careful when I remove them because they are planted a little close to the carrot. So I don't want to disturb the carrots because they're just looking beautiful. And I didn't come in here and thin them because I forgot. But I just want to be a little delicate when we're harvesting everything. And we're going to do the same thing in that bed. Then we're going to prep the soil. I want to get our peppers on this side, maybe a couple over here. I can see I've got a few random carrots that popped up over here. So I think I'm just going to kind of dot some peppers in here for the time being. And then this bed, this is our tomato bed. You can see we've got the tomato trellis already installed. So we need to regenerate or rejuvenate this soil. I've got some compost over here, the Espoma Land and Sea compost, and some garden tone. We're going to just fluff this all up, add some more compost because you can see the soil level has gone way down in this bed. But it's still looking good. It just needs, it needs some nourishment added to it. And then we're going to plant some tomatoes here. And then over in this little three by four bed, same thing. We're just going to clean out, clean out some straggling little herbs and plants over here. We've got two rows of celery. So I think I'm going to come in right in the center and plant some carrots, maybe along the sides too. As for the other two three by four beds, one is filled with our onions, one is filled with our garlic. I think the garlic should be ready to harvest around first or second week of July, right around July 4th. So this bed will be cleared out so we can start planting maybe some squash, some cucumbers. In these two two by three beds, we have our onions, our basil, our cantaloupe seeds have germinated. Two of the three germinated, so I'm just leaving them be. And this bed we have a pepper plant. I might plant a couple more pepper plants. I'm not sure yet. I don't know what I want to plant here. But you can see we're slowly getting closer to harvest and freeing up some more beds. These will probably be late summer. But everything is just moving along beautifully. We also got the tomato trellis set up along the side of the house. Mo came out here yesterday and got it all set up. So we're going to be planting more tomatoes right behind all of the raised beds. So this is the trellising system that Mo put up yesterday. It mirrors the tomato bed trellising system, which basically consists of a T post, a PVC tea, a piece of electrical conduit, another PVC tea, and another T post. And that's all there is to it. And then we'll just take some shower hooks and string, string them down and get our plants all planted. I'm glad Mo was able to put that trellising system up because I'm trying to utilize all of our space and get more tomatoes planted because I really want to get into canning this year. I want to can tomatoes and salsas and pasta sauces. So I'm trying to grow as much produce as I can so we can can it. So if you guys have any tips on canning, drop them in the comments section below because I am no expert when it comes to canning and any information would be greatly appreciated. We've got quite the selection of tomato plants to choose from. We've got seven different varieties here and we started all of them from seed and they are just looking so good. Look at that root system coming out the bottom. Some of them are probably needing to get out of their containers. They're showing a little bit of stress. But this is going to be fun. Look at all that. Real quick let me show you everything I'm going to be using today and then we'll jump right into harvesting and cleaning out these beds. I brought out a couple bags of the land and sea compost. We've got our garden toned fertilizer. Everything in here that we're going to need for staking our tomatoes. I'll show you all that once we get everything planted. I've got my pruners. I'm wearing my gloves. We've got our pitchfork. I brought out the three inch auger to help us get these tomatoes planted along the side of the house here. And some four foot garden stakes which I'm going to be using to support our pepper plants. All right so I'm just going to start harvesting and cleaning out these beds first. I'm going to start by removing our insect netting. And all this is is just insect netting with a couple garden stakes and everything is just being held together with binder clips. Inexpensive yet effective. Customizing out and filming methods if they're about to remove this broadcast. Electric identifications are tooよし. Bluecer Isn't that beautiful? So the beds have been harvested and cleaned out. You can see all of the old lettuce stumps have been removed. I harvested our green onions and the lettuce. Now we are ready to replenish the soil with some nutrients. I'm going to be adding a little bit of our land and sea compost and garden tone to all of these beds before we plant. It's a great idea whenever you're transitioning your beds from spring to summer crops to replenish the soil because a lot of those spring crops are heavy feeders and the summer crops need something to feed on so they can produce. So adding some compost, some fertilizer in there before we plant just kind of recharges that soil and gets our summer crop plants ready to go. So Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I'm going to try, these are the new variety, the super sauce from Burpee. These apparently are supposed to be excellent for sauces. Apparently the fruit gets about two and a half pounds per tomato and it's supposed to fill like a jar. I don't know what size jar because it doesn't say, but this will be one to keep an eye on. Then we have our sunrise bumblebee. This is an amazing cherry tomato. It is a orange and yellow cherry tomato, super sweet. And we have our harvest moon. This is like a yellow slicer tomato. Really pretty, really flavorful. And then we'll take, let's grab, let's grab a brandywine classic heirloom beef steak. And a San Marzano, another one, good for sauces. One, two, three, four, five, six. Okay. Perfect. Steady as she goes. I'm just going to put this right on the ground. Okay. Let's get them placed. Okay. We're going to do four peppers on this side. And then our tomatoes. Pineapple. Okay. So for our pepper plants, I just make a hole. About as deep as the nursery container. I don't plant it any higher than the soil line. You can see the root ball. The root ball looks beautiful. We've got a lot of white roots. It is not root bound. So I'm not going to mess with it. I usually don't mess with when I'm planting vegetables. I don't mess with the root balls too much because they will self-correct. They're not winding around. There's still a lot of soil in here. They look beautiful. So what I like to do is just take it, put it down into the planting hole, backfill. Make sure it's all nice and snug. And then what I like to do is take one of our garden stakes. This is a four foot garden stake. And just place it right up against the plant. And just drive it right into the bed. And this is going to be our support system. As the plant grows, I'll just use some plant tape and just tie it around the garden stake as it grows. And it will hopefully produce a whole bunch of peppers for us. Now I'm going to bring you in close and show you how I plant tomatoes. So the thing to know about tomato plants is they like to be planted deep. So we've got the stem of the tomato plant here. And if you look really closely, there's little tiny hairs here. Anywhere that these hairs make contact with soil, they will produce roots. So if we plant the tomato plant deep, all of these hairs will turn into roots. And we'll have a stronger root system and foundation for this plant to grow bigger and beautiful and produce a lot more fruit. So what I like to do is come in and remove the bottom leaves. And then we just dig our hole. And I'm going to go pretty deep. Take our plant. Make sure we keep our tag so we have it labeled. And then I just plant it all the way down right to about here. And then we just backfill. Let me move that. We just backfill with soil. Get it all nice and packed in there. And there we are. We've got our label right here. This is ready to go. I'm going to get the other five planted real quick. We'll see you later. Thank you. All right. These beds are done and ready to grow. They've been harvested, cleaned out, amended with compost and fertilizer. I planted four Jalafuego peppers on this side and one basil plant here. We still have our carrots from the spring, an Armageddon pepper right in the center, and a parsley right in the corner. And then in this bed, we have our six tomato plants in our tomato trellising system, which I will show you once we are done with the other plantings right over here. So in this three by four bed, we have two rows of celery right here and a couple herbs in the corner. I've got a parsley in each corner opposite each other. So I'm thinking I might come in in the center and just plant a row of carrots there or maybe right along the edge of both sides. I'm not sure. I think I'm just going to do one row down here. And then when we're done with that, we are going to plant our tomato plants right in the ground behind the raised beds in our new trellising system. And I'm really excited about that. So I'm going to be planting Danvers carrots today. And I think I decided just to put a row right down the middle. I'm going to amend this little section right here with some compost and then fertilize the entire bed with some more garden tone. And then right back here where we're going to plant our tomatoes, I'm probably just going to sprinkle. Probably. I am. I'm going to sprinkle some compost and fertilizer right in here. All right, guys, let's get these planted. Let's get these planted. Let's get these planted. And I know it's a little hard to see against the foliage of the garlic, but I alternated with the super sauce and the pineapple, super sauce, pineapple, all the way down to the end of the row. Here's a look from the middle section. You can see I've got them spaced probably about 16 inches apart from each other, give or take. I kind of just eyeballed the whole thing. But I planted one tomato on the outside of each tea post. And then we've got five tomato plants on the interior. And then right over here in our three by four raised bed came in with some compost, some fertilizer, and just kind of gave the celery and herbs a little bit of a feeding. And then I planted our Danvers carrots right along the center right here. Got everything watered in. So we should be good to go in this whole section. Before we wrap up for today, I do want to show you on one tomato plant how I attach it to our tomato trellising system. I'm not going to attach the rest of them today because they're still fairly small. But once they start putting on a little bit more growth, then I'll come back around and get them all hooked up into our system. So to recap our trellising system, we've got two T-posts on each side of the bed. At the top of each T-post, we've got two PVC Ts. And then running through each PVC T, we have a piece of electrical conduit. Once I have the shower hook fastened to the electrical conduit, I take this little contraption, which is a metal spool of twine, and I hook one end to the shower hook. The other end I tie to a landscape staple, and I just unwind however much twine I need for the landscape staple to reach the bottom of the bed and be fastened right in there. I got the ladder out, so I can show you exactly how I do it. So this is the electrical conduit. I take our shower hook, fasten it to the electrical conduit, then I take our twine, hook it to the shower hook, and then I unwind however much twine I need for the landscape staple to make it all the way down to the tomato plant. Then I just take our landscape staple, fasten it into the ground close to the trunk of the plant, and then slowly begin to just start winding the string around the plant. And as the plant grows, we just unwind more twine and just continuously keep wrapping, keep wrapping the tomato all the way up. And this holds really well in storms, windstorms, rainstorms. It's a really, really easy, inexpensive, and effective trellising system for tomatoes. And again, I use one spool per plant, so we'll have six spools in this bed. If I let them just kind of grow and get wild and bushy and don't trim them up, I will have to come out and add more hooks and twine because they get wider and I'll need more support as some of their arms and suckers start reaching sideways. But for now, we're all good to go. And you guys, that is it for our video today. So glad I was able to start our summer crops now. And again, I still left some spots open in some of the raised beds because I don't know exactly what I want to put specifically in each slot. Do I want to put a cucumber at the end or do I want sweet potatoes? Oh, I totally forgot about sweet potatoes. See, it's a good thing not to rush and try to get everything done all in one day. It doesn't have to be like that. Don't stress. Have fun. It's gardening. It's meant to be peaceful and enjoyable. And you guys, thank you so much for watching this video. I hope you enjoyed it and we will see you in the next one. Bye.
