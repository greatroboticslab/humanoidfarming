 All new at 530, Tropical Storm Henri was a headache for a lot of people with two days of heavy rain and some strong winds. But one local business says the tropical storm was actually a blessing. Meteorologist Connor Lewis is live at Bishop's Orchards in Guilford. And Connor, it sounds like this rain was really good for the crops there. Yeah, that's absolutely right, especially for the apples, which you can see growing behind me as we speak. The rain that we've gotten this year is particularly wonderful for the farmers, especially when you compare to the drought conditions that we were at the same time in 2020. July was one of the wettest months on record, but August was starting off in a rain deficit. Four inches of rain from Henri brought the totals back to average. We were extremely dry. We needed that rain. What we didn't need was the wind, which we didn't get, so it's absolutely a good thing. The rain from July and August means even more fruit. I've been here 30 years, not seeing such a large crop over all the varieties since I've been here. Between the drought and the frosts, last year was the opposite situation. The slower year may have given the trees a boost for this season. My worry now is that it's so good this year, the trees will be a little tired for next year. If the winds from Henri were stronger, this would have been a catastrophe for Bishop's Orchards. The limbs are already drooping from the weight of the big fruit. They've sized extremely well, considering normally you have such a heavy crop, you end up with smaller apples. I've been stunned. And like a lot of the apples that are growing right now, they're all big in size compared to last year. This one is called a Zest Star. Super delicious. And by the way, we're still in that heat advisory. Super hot outside. 88 degrees. Nothing but sunshine. And it's humid. Can't wait for the sun to go down and get some cooler weather this weekend. I'm reporting live in Guilford. Connor Lewis, Channel 3 Outwitness News. All right, Connor, thank you very much.
