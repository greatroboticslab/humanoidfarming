 Fun facts about my girls. The picture right here of the Rhode Island Red is also named the Rhode Island State Bird in 1954. The Buff Orpington is actually known as the Golden Retriever in the chicken world. And then the gray bird in the back is known as the Lavender Orpington. There's actually no lavender, blue-gray only, but they do have a lavender gene. Thank you for following. Have a great day!
