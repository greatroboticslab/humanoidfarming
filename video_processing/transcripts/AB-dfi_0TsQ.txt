 The Pumpkin Grows Ah, pumpkins. They are so big and orange and round. And they make great jack-o'-lanterns. How do they grow, anyway? Pumpkins start from a little pumpkin seed. You plant the seed in the soil. Soon, with water and sunshine, the seed sprouts. It grows bigger, and then... A yellow blossom grows on the plant. Blossom is another word for flower. The bottom of the blossom swells up. This is the part that will turn into a pumpkin. The petals fall off the blossom, and a tiny green pumpkin begins to grow. And grow... And grow some more! But by now, it's not green anymore. It's orange! The pumpkin has lots of seeds inside. Some pumpkins have hundreds of them. People can cut open the pumpkin, take out the seeds, and plant them to start the whole cycle all over again. Or... The pumpkin just sits in the dirt and rots. Sooner or later, the seeds sink into the soil, and then new pumpkin plants can grow. Lots of pumpkins grow on a pumpkin vine. A vine is a kind of plant that has a long stem, and grows along the ground. In October, pumpkins are ripe and ready to pick!
