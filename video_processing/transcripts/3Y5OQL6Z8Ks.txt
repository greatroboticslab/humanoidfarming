 Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think I'm in the bathroom looking at me Facing the mirror is all I need Waiting to the reaper takes my life Never gonna get me out alive I will live a thousand million lives My patience is waning Is this entertaining? My patience is waning Is this entertaining? I, I, I Got this feeling Yeah, you know that I'm losing all control Cause there's magic in my bones I, I, I, I Got this feeling in my soul Go ahead and throw your stalls Cause there's magic in my bones Playing with the stick with dynamite There was never gray and black and white There was never wrong till there was right Feeling like a ball to hurtle in Seeing all the vultures circling Burning in the flames I'm working in Turning into bad, it's dark And you need my patience is waning
