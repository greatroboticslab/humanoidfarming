 This Alice Chalmer 7000 is a 106 PTO horsepower tractor and it was made in 1976. So yes, you heard that right. This tractor is 48 years old when this video was made and it does a really good job for us mowing. This is our Massey Ferguson 1372 mower conditioner. It is a center pivot machine, works out well. You can cut on either side of the tractor. Now the downside of this mower is, sometimes it doesn't fit through a gate well. The tractor itself mowing cost me $24.12. The mower mowing cost me $20.98. When you add all that together though, you get $45.10 to mow one acre of ground.
