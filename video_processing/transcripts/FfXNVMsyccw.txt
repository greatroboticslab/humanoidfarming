 So Grow a Garden just released their biggest update ever. First, they removed all the old seeds and replaced them with summer seeds. Second, there's a new summer event where you and your server work together to place fruits into this basket at the top of every hour. All the fruits have to be the new summer ones, though. And as you place more fruits, you get more harvest points. Now, after the time runs out, you can get any of these cool rewards. Like and subscribe, and it'll help you with the summer event.
