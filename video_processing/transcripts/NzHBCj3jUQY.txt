Howto & Style
 Let's build a super easy raised garden bed. For the side panels, I'm just stacking two 1x6s and adding braces to keep the panels together. The long sides get three braces each, and I'm pre-drilling and then using construction screws. I cut a furring strip down the middle to use as support for the slats, screwed it to the bottom of each side panel, and then I assembled the whole box together. I cut the legs to size, sanded them down, along with the whole box, and then attached them with four screws on each leg. Next, I cut some cheap fence pickets down to make the slats, notched out the corners, and installed them. I mitered out this frame to add to the top and just installed it with brad nails since it's curly aesthetic. I filled all the holes and seams, sanded that down, and now it's time to make this waterproof. I've used Real Milk Paint products a ton and always loved them. This is their outdoor defense oil, which is amazing for outdoor projects, and it's completely non-toxic. It's the easiest thing ever to apply. You just brush it on like this. I did three coats total, and just look at how the water beats up on the surface now. I stappled this landscaping fabric all around, added my soil, and finally got my new plants in. Now, this ain't my first build, but this is my first veggie garden, so drop all your tips and let me know what you think of this project.
