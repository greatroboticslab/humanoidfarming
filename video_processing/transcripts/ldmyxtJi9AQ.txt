 Agriculture is the key to the development of human civilization and the nerve of economic well-being of any country. Irrigation systems are a major process aiding agriculture for centuries. Ancient civilization in many parts of the world practiced irrigation. Civilization would probably not be possible without some form of irrigation. Hi, my name is Yoshu and you are watching me on Freedom Farming English Channel. The earliest form of irrigation probably involved people carrying buckets of water from wells or rivers to pour on their crops. As better techniques developed, societies in Egypt and China built irrigation canals, dams, dikes and water storage facilities. Ancient Rome built structures called aqueducts to carry water from snow melt in the Alps to cities and towns in the valleys below. This water was used for drinking, washing and irrigation. Let's talk a little more about the irrigation system. Irrigation system is the artificial application of water to the soil or agriculture field. It is like supplementing rainwater with another source of water. It is mostly used in dry areas and during periods of insufficient rainfall. The main idea behind these systems is to assist the growth of crops and plants by maintaining the minimum amount of water required. Also suppressing weed, growth in fields and preventing soil consideration. It is considered a basic infrastructure and vital input required for agriculture production. The main aim is to maintain the agriculture output with the minimum amount of water, maintenance of landscape and revegetation of distributed soils. These systems are also used for dust repression, removal of sewage and mining. Irrigation is often studied together with drainage, which is natural or artificial removal of surface and subsurface water from a given region. It also has effects of crop production, which includes protecting plants against frost, suppressing wheat growth in the grain field, preventing soil consideration, for dust and suppression, and disposal of sewage and mining. Now let's talk about the types of irrigation. The three basic and broad classification of irrigation methods are 1. Surface, 2. Sprinkler and 3. Subsurface. Surface irrigation, this technique is when water flows and spreads over the surface of land. Varied quantities of water are allowed on the fields at different times. Surface irrigation technique is broadly classified as basin irrigation, border irrigation and furrow irrigation and uncontrolled flooding. Let's talk about basin irrigation. The basin system is suitable for many field crops. So, basin irrigation is the best method for this crop. It is generally not suited for crops that cannot stand in wet or waterlogged conditions for periods longer than 24 hours. These are usually root and tuber crops, such as potatoes, cassava, beet and carrots, which require loose, well-drained soils. Let's move on and talk about furrow irrigation. In this furrow technique, trenches of furrows are dug between crops, rows in a field. Farmers flow water down the furrows often using only gravity and it seeps vertically and horizontally to refill the soil reservoir. Flow to each furrow is individually controlled, the furrow technique suitable for row crops and tree crops. And because water does not directly contact the plants, crops that would be damaged directly by water such as tomatoes, vegetables, potatoes and beans. It is one of the oldest systems of irrigation. Moving ahead, let's talk about border irrigation. Border irrigation is a type of surface irrigation where the field is divided into strips, separated by borders, rigid running down the gradient of the field. The area between the rigid is flooded during irrigation. It can be viewed as an extension of basin irrigation to include long rectangular or contoured field shapes. Moving ahead, let's talk about Uncontrolled flooding. In uncontrolled flooding, the water is spread or flooded into the field without control of water and preparation of land. It is also called wild flooding. The efficiency of this method depends upon the depth of flooding, the size of the steam, the rate of the intake of water into the soil and the topography of the field. This method is suitable for inundation, irrigation systems, pastures and forage crop and is inexpensive. Now let's talk about the second type of irrigation and that is sprinkler irrigation. Sprinkler irrigation. In this method, water is sprayed into the air and allowed to fall on the ground surface, somewhat resembling rainfall. The flow of water develops the spray under pressure through small nozzles. The sprinkler irrigation system is very suitable method for irrigation or uneven lands and shallow soils. Nearly all crops are suitable for sprinkler irrigation systems except crops like paddy, jute etc. The dry crops, vegetables, flowering crops, orchids and plantation crops like tea and coffee are all suitable and can be irrigated through sprinklers. Third and the last type of irrigation is sub-irrigation. Also known as seepage irrigation is a system where water is allowed to the plant root zone from below the soil surface and absorbed upwards. The excess may be collected for reuse. Sub-irrigation is used in growing fields crops such as tomatoes, peppers and sugarcane in areas with high water tables. The major benefits of this system are water, nutrient conservation and labour saving. The outfitting cost is comparatively high and the main problem include the possibility of the increased presence of disease-causing organisms in recycled water. Well, those were the three main types of irrigations that are mainly used in agriculture.
