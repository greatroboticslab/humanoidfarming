 Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music We're doing three more wrenches. This is an antique wrench for an older metal lathe. Early 1900s, mid 1900s. It's for these square headed bolts. Kind of like these guys here. No marks on it that I can tell. I know it is four. And I'm going to clean it up and see if we get any other marks. This one is really neat. This is an 11 16ths and a 1 1 16ths I believe. And it's got a ruler that's actually built into the wrench here. It's actually part of the casting. Part of the casting or stamping when they make this. Can't really make out what it says. I'll figure that out after I clean off the rust and we'll see. Okay. The last one we got is a DuraSpeed Quartzzoid Sprinkler Head Wrench. This is an oldie. Another antique. Don't know what type of sprinkler it goes to. It's found in an old farm so I'm assuming an old farming equipment. I'll clean her up and make her look nice. And then put her in the toolbox. Okay, so we're going to use a bigger bin. Put these three guys in. Probably going to use all the stuff I have. To cover it. And then put it in. I'm going to cover it. I'm going to cover it. I'm going to cover it just fine. We're going to add this other stuff in though too. This is this nasty stuff here. I'm going to use more than once. Maybe a little deeper. All right. So we'll give that 24 hours and we'll see how they come out. All right. I went a little long in the soak here. It's been over a week so we're going to grab those wrenches out. I got some other things in here too. Okay. Okay. This is the wrench that's got the inch and plus signs on it. It had some rust on it. It wasn't too bad. 11 16ths and I can't read that side. I'll have to measure it normally. All right. That one. I'll wipe that one down. I'll rinse her off here in a minute. I'll get the other ones done. Okay. This is my quartzoid spring for a little bit. I'll get the other ones done. Okay. Okay. This is my quartzoid sprinkler wrench. That one cleaned up really nice. Okay. I'll get the other ones done. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and put this one in here. Yeah. It came out real nice. I got one more in here. That's this guy. That's a lathe lantern. Or a lathe tool post. For square nuts. That's a lathe lantern. Or a lathe tool post. For square nuts. See that says 5 8ths. I'm assuming that's gonna be half. If it's half. Right in there. 1 5 3 4. Oh. Oh. That's a lathe lantern. That's a lathe lantern. I'll lay the tool post. For square nuts. So that says 5 8ths. I'm assuming that's gonna be half. It's half. Right in there. the Tef writing there. 1534. That was not visible before. There appears to be a little triangle there too, so I don't know what that is. I'll go clean this up and I'll be back. Alright, it's time to, these are dry and not oil these up. This one I'm worried about the most because it's starting to have a little bit of flash rust. So we're going to go in here and generously start wiping oil on it. Get every piece of it covered. Here's where the investor goes. The only pain with these older ones and these raised letters is getting all the oil in it and getting it to seep in and dry. Alright, I'm going to put it over here in this cloth and let it dry and set it up. So I took out this one here. Do this and it says, oh that's 1116th and this is 1116th. I just noticed that one there now. So that has now been figured out. That seems about right. Alright. So... Never found a maker's mark on this one but this one is interesting that it's got a ruler on it. I've never seen that. That's just kind of a cool idea to do with kind of, you know, wasted space. Put a company logo on there or something or you can make something useful. And this came from a estate sale from a farm. But I'm pretty sure that was probably sold by an implement company and that was just a... marketing gimmick but still... kind of unique. Alright, last is this guy. When it says... 1334 there. I don't know if I'll focus or not. And that's... The other side is 5 eighths and half inch. And for someone that's got an antique or an older... A either mill that uses those and wants a period correct tool. When it goes with their machine, this will be for them. I don't like to just collect tools. I like to make sure they're used because... When you hang them up like at Applebee's or something like that or a T-Drive Friday's, it's not a tool anymore. It's a decoration or a trophy. It's not what tools are for. They have to be used. Anyways, that's all of them cleaned up. They look pretty good. I think it'll take a little bit of extra just to get the extra... out of it. But... cleaned up nicely. Until next time. Well, you'll find more about it. Yeah, I mean, you're not as an example... yeah, I think it will get a little better. Is there anything wrong? I think today, oh, my baby 25 miles different years ago... I don't even know. Yeah, to be able to see it in their way. Either, you can tune for me. Or anything at all?
