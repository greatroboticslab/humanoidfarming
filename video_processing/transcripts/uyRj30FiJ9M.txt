 Hello friends I am Ashok Sanodiyya and I welcome you back in your own organic gardening channel. Friends in today's video we will tell you a very simple method by which you can make a powerful organic fertilizer at your home which will work like DAP fertilizer and before we tell you how to make it you must know that DAP is a very popular chemical fertilizer whose full name is dimonium phosphate and it contains about 80% of nitrogen and 46% of phosphoracinic but when we use it on plants then only 30 to 35% of it used by our plants and the rest amount get stable in the soil as a salt or in some cases it get mixed with natural resources of water which can increase the risk of soil and water pollution but in the homemade organic fertilizer that we are going to make will contain about 5% of nitrogen and about 10% of phosphorus in it and when we use it in our plants then it will 100% used by them in completely organic form. So let us know how we can make it easily at our home.

So after taking it as per our requirement we will put it in a container like this. After this the next thing that we have to take is rock phosphate and it is also easily available worldwide in very cheap price. We just have to remember that we have to take the rock phosphate in the same quantity as we have taken vermicompost. And after taking it now we have to keep it on the top of the vermicompost as we are doing here. After this now we will mix both the things properly as we are doing here. After mixing it properly we will take a cotton cloth and cover it properly with a like this. After this we will take a water spray bottle and spray water on it as we are doing here. After this we will take a water spray bottle and spray water on it as we are doing here. And when it become moist then we will leave this mixture in a shaded area for 10 to 12 days and keep it moist from time to time.
