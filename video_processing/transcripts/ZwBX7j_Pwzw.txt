 Hey everybody welcome to the Fat Vegan. I am he, your emcee of all things. No beef, no pork, no fish, no poultry, no dairy, no eggs, no kittens. Today my beautiful wife Lori is on camera running that thing. Lori how you doing? I'm great thank you. Hello everyone. Yes it's a great day to be alive or to be vegan or whatever you are. Non-vegan. We're so pleased that you're watching today's video which is about vegan vegan veganic veganic. This is about veganics. Now you say Johnny veganic that that sounds that sounds familiar. You may know the term organic. Lori what is organic? No pesticides, no chemicals. Nothing synthetic instead of using natural things. Typically though for the fertilizer they use what Lori? Poop. Yeah they use poop. Cow poop, pig flop, all of that. So we want to practice the idea of veganic farming. This my friends, the humble beginnings of our first veganic farm plot. Tilled this yesterday. It's about 20 by 12. Threw down some seeds. Sweet corn is in there Lori. What else did I plant? Carrots, onions, cilantro. Carrots, onions, cilantro. And field corn. I think I may have accidentally planted my shoe. So we will farm this veganically. No pesticides, no herbicides, nothing chemical and no animal manure. So the idea is to take these fruits and vegetables that we get out of this garden and then use them to make fat vegan food. We're going to call this badass garden. How do you garden? Do you use organic methods? Do you use a combination with some herbicides, fertilizer? We'd love to hear it in the comment section from you. Whether you're vegan or non-vegan, there are no judgments about how you live in it. This is how we're living it. You can decide if this might be something for you. In the meantime, from Lori the Vegan, Johnny the Vegan, the Fat Vegans, we say thank you so much for saving the animals and screwing the calories.
