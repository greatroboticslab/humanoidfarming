 Hi, I'm Ben. If I could be anything, I'd be a farmer. Hi, I'm Ben. If I could be anything, I would be a farmer. I'd have my own farm where I would grow fresh fruits and vegetables. I'd wear overalls and big rubber boots for walking in the mud. I'd wear sunscreen and a hat to protect me from getting sunburned. Because farmers are outside most of the day. I would have a red tractor that I would use to drive around my farm. Whoa, this is a bumpy ride. Bumpity, bumpity, bump, bump. I would plant lots of my favorite vegetables. I like carrots, tomatoes, and zucchini. So I would plant lots. In one field, I would grow corn. And in another, jack-o'-lanterns. So they would be all ready for Halloween. I would have a special treat that grows both bananas and apples. Yum, yum. I'd drive my tractor to town and sell my vegetables at the market. Everyone would want to buy from me. There would be a lineup of a bazillion people. I'd also have lots of animals on my farm. I'd have one, two, three, four pigs. All right, you can go play now, little piggies. My pigs would love to roll around in the mud. Pee-ew. Smelly. But I love them. In my barn, I would have a cow and a horse. My cow would be named Spot, because she would have spots. Spot would make me fresh milk every day. My cow would even make chocolate milk. Delicious. My horse would be called Lucky. He'd be brown with a white diamond on his face. Kitty-up, Lucky. That means go in horse language. Lucky would be really fast. Faster even than a train. Yeehaw! I love being a farmer. Woo! Woo! Yeah! Keep seeing! Sp lifting! Thank you. Nice.囪 I'm Ben and I'm a farmer. Imagine that! I'm Ben and I'm a farmer.
