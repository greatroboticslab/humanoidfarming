 Exposing the secret behind our meals? Crop diversity is the true hero. One plant can't feed the world. Let's dig in. Crop diversity means growing many different kinds of plants. If we only relied on one or two crops, a single bug or disease could wipe out entire food supplies but with lots of varieties we have backup plans like having extra players on a team. More diversity means more food, healthier soil, and better chances for everyone to eat. That's how diverse crops are set to feed the future.
