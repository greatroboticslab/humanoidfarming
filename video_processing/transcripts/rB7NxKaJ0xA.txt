 Hey everyone, Brandon here from Truck Safe. One area of federal and state safety regulations that tends to cause a lot of confusion among regulated carriers is agricultural-related exemptions. For those involved in the transportation of livestock, food products, and farm supplies, whether and to what extent you're subject to the safety regulations, like driver qualification, hours of service, drug and alcohol testing, and others, is something you really need to wrap your mind around. But it can be difficult given the various commodity-specific exemptions that could apply. We're going to try and unwind all of that today, so stay tuned. Do us a favor, hit the like and subscribe button below if you find this type of content helpful. At the end of 2020, the FMCSA, which is charged with regulating highway safety, published a rule purportedly clarifying the regulatory definitions of agricultural commodity, livestock, and non-processed foods, as those terms are used for the purposes of the agency's hours of service exemption for certain agricultural operations. Now, although the federal safety regulations have long contained agricultural related exemptions, this rule change highlighted some of the ambiguity surrounding those exemptions that has persisted over the years. So let's take a look at various agricultural related exemptions contained within the federal rules, including to whom they apply and what specific relief they afford. All right, first up is the so-called covered farm vehicle exemption, which is a relatively broad one. Now, generally speaking, the federal safety regulations apply to the operation of commercial motor vehicles, or CMVs for short, in interstate commerce. In other videos, we've explored the significance of that term, commercial motor vehicle, in this context and the extent to which carriers who operate commercial vehicles are subject to the federal rules. But to summarize, a commercial vehicle is generally defined to mean a self-propelled or towed motor vehicle used on a highway in interstate commerce to transport property when the vehicle has a gross vehicle weight rating or gross combination weight rating of 10,001 pounds or more. That said, the federal rules contain a number of fairly broad exemptions, including one for operators of covered farm vehicles. This exemption is found in 49 CFR section 390.39. And it says that a covered farm vehicle is exempt from the CDL requirements, driver qualification rules, hours of service rules, and vehicle maintenance requirements. So it's clearly an expansive exemption. But what exactly qualifies as a quote unquote covered farm vehicle? Well, that term is defined in 49 CFR section 390.5 to include a straight truck or articulated vehicle that number one is registered as a farm vehicle and operated with state issued farm plates. Number two is operated by the owner of a farm or an employee or family member of the owner. Number three is used to haul agricultural commodities, livestock, or machinery to or from the farm. And number four is not used in for higher motor carrier operations unless such operations are by a tenant pursuant to a crop share farm lease agreement. If any one of these four conditions are not met, then the vehicle does not qualify as a covered farm vehicle and its operations would be subject to the federal rules unless some other exemption applies. Now, if a particular vehicle otherwise qualifies as a covered farm vehicle, it may still be subject to certain mileage restrictions listed in the second half of that regulation, depending on its weight. For example, if the vehicle or combination exceeds 26,000 pounds, then it can only be operated within a 150 air mile radius of the farm in order to still qualify for the exemption. So even though the covered farm vehicle exemption is broad in scope, the universe of operations that fall under that exemption is fairly narrow. Ultimately, it's going to be farmers who are transporting their farm commodities to and from their farms using their own equipment. All right. Next up is a more limited exemption that applies to so-called farm vehicle operators. In particular, farm vehicle operators may be, if the state which they are domiciled in allows for such an exemption, exempt from the CDL requirement when operating a farm vehicle that is number one, controlled and operated by a farmer, including operation by employees or family members. Number two, used to transport either agricultural products, farm machinery, farm supplies, or both to or from a farm. Number three, not used in the operation of a for hire motor carrier. Number four, used within 150 miles of the farmer's farm. This exemption is contained in 49 CFR section 383.3. Now, farm vehicle operators meeting this criteria may be exempt from the federal drug and alcohol testing regulations as well in 49 CFR part 382, if the state in which they are domiciled has chosen to recognize the CDL exemption that we just discussed. In addition, farm vehicle drivers who don't operate articulated commercial vehicles are exempt from most aspects of the driver qualification requirements in 49 CFR part 391, as long as the vehicles aren't being used to haul placatable quantities of hazmat. On the other hand, farm vehicle drivers who operate articulated commercial vehicles and are 18 years of age or older are exempt from a smaller subset of the driver qualification requirements, including certain general qualifications, background checks, road tests, and maintenance of files and records. So, in short, the farm vehicle operator exemption is more narrow in scope than the covered farm vehicle exemption, and it depends on whether the states in which the farm vehicle operators are domiciled acknowledge the exemption or not. Okay, next up is an even more narrow exemption known as the agricultural operations exemption. This one is more narrow in the sense that it only exempts qualifying operations from the hours of service rules, not driver qualification, CDL, drug and alcohol testing, or other requirements, just hours of service. Now, this agricultural operations exemption is found in the hours of service rules themselves, 49 CFR part 395. It states that the hours of service rules shall not apply during the planting and harvesting periods as determined by each state to drivers transporting the following. Number one, agricultural commodities from the source of agricultural commodity to a location within a 150 air mile radius from that source. Number two, farm supplies for agricultural purposes from a wholesale or retail distribution point of the farm supplies to a farm or other location where the farm supplies are intended to be used within a 150 air mile radius from the distribution point. Or number three, farm supplies for agricultural purposes from a wholesale distribution point of the farm supplies to a retail distribution point of the farm supplies within a 150 air mile radius from the wholesale distribution point. So in sum, a driver who hauls agricultural commodities or farm supplies within a 150 air mile radius of their source or wholesale or retail distribution point are exempt from the federal hours of service rules during the planting and harvesting periods as set by the states. As I mentioned at the start of this video, the FMCSA recently issued a new rule that clarifies the definitions of agricultural commodity and some of its internal terms for purposes of this exemption. The term agricultural commodity now means horticultural products at risk of perishing or degrading in quality during transport by commercial motor vehicle, including plants, sod, flowers, shrubs, ornamentals, seedlings, live trees, and Christmas trees, and also encompasses non-processed food, feed, fiber, or livestock. Now it's also important to understand that the FMCSA has clarified that drivers who fall under this agricultural exemption are completely exempt from the hours of service rules while operating within that 150 air mile radius of the source of the commodities, including when the vehicle is unladen. This means that any hours incurred within that air mile radius are completely excluded from the driver's calculation of available hours under part 395 of the regulations. By way of example, say a driver spends 10 hours driving agricultural commodities within a 150 air mile radius of their source and then drives another three hours outside of that radius. This driver would only be required to log that three hours of time spent driving outside the 150 air mile radius for that day, meaning that the driver would technically have eight additional hours of driving time left on his or her 11 hour clock. Additionally, once the driver reenters the 150 air mile radius, he or she is once again exempt. Okay, so the last exemption I want to discuss is a bit distinct from the others in that it's an exemption from the FMCSA's operating authority requirements rather than its safety related rules. So aside from its safety related regulations, the FMCSA also promulgates and enforces certain commercial regulations. This includes the requirement that four higher motor carriers obtain four higher motor carrier operating authority in order to provide those types of services in interstate commerce. And just as there are safety related exemptions for agricultural operations, there are similar exemptions from the agency's operating authority requirements. Generally speaking, federal law requires that any person that performs motor vehicle transportation for compensation in interstate commerce to obtain four higher operating authority from the FMCSA. Now such authority is separate and distinct from a USDOT number and is instead designated by an MC number. As I mentioned, there are a number of exemptions from this federal operating authority requirement, including one that applies to the transportation of certain quote unquote exempt commodities. Those persons or businesses that haul exempt commodities in interstate commerce are not required to obtain the federal operating authority to do so. This is true even when the commodities are being transported for compensation or for hire. In such cases, the carrier is considered to be an exempt for hire motor carrier. This means that it's hauling exempt commodities for compensation. The FMCSA maintains a list of these so-called exempt commodities in its administrative ruling number 119, which is available online. Just search FMCSA administrative ruling number 119 and you'll find it. Included on the list are several agricultural products, things like fruits and vegetables, milk, trees, timber, and even pet food. So in sum, carriers hauling products that are listed in this administrative ruling in interstate commerce are exempt from the federal motor carrier operating authority requirement. Okay, that's going to wrap things up for this video. The FMCSA's various agriculture-related exemptions can be confusing, particularly when there is overlap among them. It's important that those seeking to take advantage of one or more of these exemptions understand precisely when and to whom they apply.
