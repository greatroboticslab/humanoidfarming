Howto & Style
 So you're interested in planting older. This is what it looks like as a cell-grown plant. I'll now show you how to plant it. First choose a suitable spade. Something like this is ideal, it's very narrow. Pop it into the ground, put your foot on it and wiggle it back into to ensure you've got a nice wide hole to put the cell-grown plant in. Pop the older cell into the ground. The top of the cell with the root should be slightly covered with soil. Plant it reasonably straight and firm it round with your feet. Older does well in damp soils. Space them about three metres apart. Olders can put on two to three foot of growth quite easily in most sites. Remember these can also be planted as a hedge. A couple more tips for you, especially when you're planting when they're in leaf, is to make sure that you keep them watered. Give them at least the watering once or twice a week depending on what the weather's doing and also protect them from rabbits for at least two to three years.
