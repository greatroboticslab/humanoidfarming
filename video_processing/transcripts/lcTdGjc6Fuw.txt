 Day one of my chinchillas rating every brand of Timothy hay we can find, starting off with Small Pet Select. The hay looks very green and consistent with very few brown pieces, and it smells great. We've ordered the value boxes before from Small Pet Select, which have tended to be a hit or miss, but this looks much more high quality. Now to get the most important opinion from our little fluffy judges. I'm going to give them the same amount of hay at the same time daily and check to see how it looks every morning for about a week. They'll either love it, like it, snub it, or hate it. Their initial thoughts for this brand were pretty positive, so let's see how they did throughout the week. Our first morning, it seems like they really enjoyed it. Part of foraging is making a huge mess, which it looks like they did while eating a lot of it as well. Morning number two seems like they ate even more of it, which is amazing. Very little hay wasted this time around. Morning three, however, it seemed like the newness of the hay was wearing off, and they barely picked through it and wasted a lot. All in all, though, I think we'd give this hay a 9.5 out of 10 and highly recommend.
