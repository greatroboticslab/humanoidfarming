 Music Alright, I'm Clint Dauterer, lead strategic marketing for Trimble Ag's software division here at Farm Progress 2018. Super excited to be talking about some of the new things we're bringing out. One of the things that we're doing here is launching here at the Farm Progress show a new software bundle called Farmer Fit. It's the software that fits your farm. So it's a mid-price point but very feature rich online mobile and desktop software that gives farmers the capability to manage their data in lots of different ways. So as data gets generated out in the field on displays and application control, that data can flow right back into Farmer Fit. We can also generate field activities either online or just on my phone with a mobile app. Then we can take those field activities and we can assign cost to them, manage all my ag input inventory, and then transition to analyzing profitability and ROI once my yield maps and my yield data gets into the system. Lots of other little pieces like weather data that flows in. We can tap into moisture sensors and help track where my assets are, where my people are, where my equipment is, and really do it in a way that is color blind. Trimble works with all kinds of different equipment out there. We can pull data from just about every display that exists. We can visualize that data on pretty much any device anywhere that you happen to be with connectivity. And really help you to drive better decisions and more efficiency on farming operations. So finish that time. It doesn't result since there is an individual that comes out of the solution. It also rides the algorithm to ПослеStand and it's self-recieging and everything that changes through data line.
