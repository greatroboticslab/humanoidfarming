 For me, I really like corn. What do you like about corn? It's corn! A big, big knob. It has the juice. I can't remember a little beautiful thing. It's corn! I can tell you all about it. I mean, look at this thing. When I try to, but I don't anything change. What a bad thing about corn. There's degrees. The corn bike can restore your energy. You really appreciate that whole world when you love something. If you or anyone loves corn, if you come to me, I can tell you all about it. If I swung the bike, I would love it. You're big and strong. Look at this. Take the lump with the knob. Spread that arm. For years and to secret degrees, battle spreads out. It has a good taste. But this corn is disgusting. But anything is. It's corn. A big, big knob. It has the juice. I can't remember a beautiful thing. Woo! It's corn. I can't remember a beautiful thing. I can tell you all about it. I mean, look at this thing. When I try to, but I don't anything change. I hope you have a corn-tastic day. A corn-tastic day. But it's just a part of a crunch. Okay? Woo! It's corn! Burns like negative in the world. Take the corn break. Corn break. Take the corn break. Corn dance. Mmm. Corn. Corn dance. Corn dance. Mmm. Anything else you want to say about corn before we go? Yeah. What? It's corn. A big, big knob. It has the juice. It's corn. I can't remember a beautiful thing. Woo! It's corn. I can tell you all about it. I mean, look at this thing. When I try to, but I don't anything change. It's corn. A big, big knob. It has the juice. It's corn. I can't remember a beautiful thing. It's corn. I can tell you all about it. I mean, look at this thing. When I try to, but I don't anything change. It's corn. Smoke yo, ho. Smoke yo, accent on the yo. On the yo. Your life is better as a musical. Musical. Woo! Stream this song and watch the original with Tariq on recess therapy. And most importantly, have a corn-tastic day and a corn-tastic life.
