Howto & Style
 What happens if you put logs in the bottom of a raised bed garden? So some raised beds like this one here are pretty tall. It's about 30 inches. And if you filled the whole thing up with high quality soil, you'd be spending a ton of money, especially for a garden of this size. What if you took a big log and put it in the bottom to fill up space? Well, you might've heard that logs or wood shouldn't be below the soil. The reason is because if you put something like wood chips in the soil like this, and then you cover it up, it'll tie up nitrogen, which plants like this need to grow. And without nitrogen, you wouldn't get crazy healthy beets like this. So what are you supposed to do? It saves a lot of money to add some logs or debris to the bottom of a bed, but maybe it's harmful to your plants. Every single one of my tall beds has a bunch of nonsense at the bottom, wood, sticks, twigs, whatever. And for years, I harvest incredible produce just like this. There are a couple of things you actually don't want to put at the bottom of your bed. So I'll put that down in the comments.
