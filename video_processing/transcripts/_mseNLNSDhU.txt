 The reasons that climate change impacts on agriculture matters to you. Marshall Shepard's column on Forbes.com details the reason in a very understandable and impactful way. I just love his opening, where he says he often uses the analogy that weather is your mood and climate is your personality. Here are the four reasons. Number one, we need to eat. Irrespective of where you live, ag sustains life, but is one of the most climate-sensitive activities. The USDA issued a report in 2013 called Climate Change in Agriculture in the United States, which found that increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide, rising temperatures, and altered precipitation patterns will affect agriculture productivity. Increases in temperature, coupled with more variable precipitation, will reduce the productivity of crops. And these effects will outweigh the benefits of increasing carbon dioxide. Number two, we feel the economic impact. Farming is a key pillar of the U.S. economy. U.S. farms accounted for a $136.7 billion contribution to the overall economy and 1.4% of employment. Number three, rural communities are particularly vulnerable. According to the National Climate Assessment Report, 444 counties in the U.S. were identified as farming dependent during the period 2010 to 2012. 391 of them were rural. And lastly, there's hope, he writes. In the United States, bioenergy cropping is increasing and remains a major focus of research to develop appropriate dedicated feedstocks for different regions of the U.S. Technological advancements through concerted public and private efforts and the increasing availability of inputs, such as fertilizer, pesticides, and feed additives, have led to significant improvements in productivity, while reducing agriculture's environmental footprint.
