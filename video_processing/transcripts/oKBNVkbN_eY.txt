 Welcome everybody. I'd like to please that you can come to us at this point for an important session. Thank you. That's better. Welcome to the session which is organized by the Army, which is a network of rich institutions promoting sustainable agriculture. If you listen to Richard Cali this morning, she said that her key topic, part of the men's day, was in agriculture. And that's why this is of course very simple. And we know that to feed the current population, we double the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in cycles naturally. And of course there are a number of environmental factors that are degraded regarding pollution. Sorry, I can't give you a job. Regarding pollution and phosphorus in nitrogen, nitrogen, green house gas, a number of negative consequences. And of course in parts of the world we use too little and in parts of the world we use too much. And that of course was mentioned by one of the representatives in the panel this morning. First, I surprised it's almost doubled. Sorry, it had increased by about five times since 2007. And you hear a bit more about that. There's kind of a very heated debate about pink phosphorus. And some argue that they will run out of phosphorus that can be mined in about the 2030s. The National Fertilizing Development Center now argues that it can go on for a number of hundreds of years. So whatever the result is, we need to manage nitrogen and phosphorus much more sustainably. This relates directly to the millennium development targets. And of course the first millennium development target is to haul by 2050 with proportional people in Saffaq and Hynqaq. We are not doing very well and we are not going to reach that target by 2050. MTG 7 target includes having a proportion of the population that's having access to safe water and sanitation. And with half the population in developing countries lacking sanitation, the target is certainly after reach. We have got three presentations for the session. And see how we can use pure sterile of nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients between the field and before and back to the field. We have got three presenters. The first one who will set the stage is Maribuja from Sian, the Sweden. And she will introduce the topics. We then have Maribuja Darnou. He is an agricultural engineer in Niger in Miami. With the project, the project for the promotion of local development initiatives in Agri in Niger. And then we brought a presentation from a robotologist. He is the director from the East and Southeast Asia of the World Vegetable Center, HBRDC. He has a PhD in North Calacenous Springs and the research director at San Diego University College of Agriculture. So we will take those presentations. And then Madeline will also summarize what we've heard. And then we will provide questions from the audience. Thank you. So now over to you Madeline. Yes, introduction. So first I would like to say that to thank everybody who will be giving the possibility to organize a new part of the organization of this journey. This, what you will see in this event is actually on basis of very long in existence of the Swedish International Development Agency. We're looking at closing numbers of nutrients and combining sanitation and living up to agriculture. This is something that is a great concern for the International Development Agency. And we are now coming to a phase where we actually can see results of the research and how it's turning to data and how the research is now spread into the research center all over. And, but to contextualize it, more of this . So after almost 20 years of research all over the globe, we have a common understanding that productive and ecological sanitation systems are safely recycled, and are well done in waste products to crop production in such a way that the use of the non-renewable resources is . This is a common understanding now. And so, we can . This is also understanding that right now we can see that there are also missing units between humans and the soils. And there is, the soils are depleted through the erosions and other causes. And the nutrients from the soils are brought into animal feed or for feeding the families in the rural communities as well as in the cities. And so, nutrients are taking out the soils and it's hard to compensate. But we are trying to do so and having done so for the last 50 years by adding fertilizers. But this is, as you say, fertilized prices are increasing and it's increasingly expensive. And for the smallholder farmers it's impossible. We lack our countries in the national area of the nation likewise. So, what we would like to see is less efficient and return of the nutrients in form of manure from the animals. But also, we know and we have the research here available in package and we know that we can safely use the nutrients in the universe to reduce and bring it back to the soils. That would decrease our dependence and decrease our dependence of chemical fertilizers. And in the same way we would have health-based soils which could then cause production. So, the soil was severely depleted especially in the densely populated areas. The Sub-Saharan in terms of the small uses of fertilizers and there is unequal access to fertilizers. And you can see the disparity and it was already mentioned by Thomas. This is also linked to the rising and hiking food prices. In 2008 we could all note that this was one of the highest high increasing food prices. And it is linked to also the use of fertilizers. I would clearly look at a little bit of phosphorus because it's something that we have also been doing research on for a long time. But up to 1950 we were basically depending on using our manure, also of human being sweeter. And then the green revolution was basically thanks to access to cheap fertilizers. The situation is not like this anymore. If you look at 2007, 2008 there was a hike in the fertilizers crisis which also contributed to the food crisis. Even though there are other factors for the food crisis. And after that we have actually reached a stage where the prices are increasing. And we can then debate when the need will occur. But it's of course really dependent on what kind of use of fertilizers we are foreseeing. And what kind of agricultural practices we are planning for. So we really need to look for how to be less dependent on these prices. So what does that implicate for sanitation? Well instead of actually looking at this as a hazard waste, which it is, if it's not in the right place, it's not sanitized. It can be a very valuable resource. And this is traditionally accepted. This is how farmers in Egypt describe it. They know they are using open defecation and they know that's where they will have the best yields, the best production. However, this is a practice we really want to come away from. And that's why we try to combine this nuclear cycle with the same sanitation. So we can, we shouldn't say which rain or recovery of the nutrients would be the most efficient in this kind of product, because of the agricultural sanitation, there are many possibilities. Composting is one. Dury diversion, sludge cessation, biogas, agar ponds, sludge burial, microforestation. There are so many. But we are, we know that the nutrients are there and they can be covered. And we are now looking to what can actually governments do and to unlock the potential in human waste. Well, they can start to improve regulations. They can educate. They can simulate. We know that this will all take time. We have already started. We are on more than 20 years of this promotion. And it has started. We can see the industries in Niger. We can see the industries in South Africa. They are on the track. But doing so, we hope that in the future they can then rest and the market factors actually will take over. Because this waste has value and we can unlock it. And in the meantime, we need to brand the mind shift. Because we know that sanitation and the products, as I mentioned now, urine and feces, is not acceptable. It's a taboo. It's very difficult. We have to work with it. And we also have to really show that we are not promoting urine use but sanitized urine. So we need to call it something else, like liquid fertilizer. We are not promoting feed use of feces but sanitized feces, the solid fertilizer. The names are the West African names and how they use it and how they can also promote certain marketing numbers for farmers that are in need of fertilizers. So, waiting for the governments, waiting for research, but at the same time, for our field we have to go to the local schools. We are also promoting this knowledge and it contributes to better nutrition, to increased yields and also to vegetables and products that are that taste better for the poor farmers that have been experiencing these experiences. So, we are in this learning event. We will show two cases, totally different. One rural from Niger, where this is now scaling up in the whole country. And we will also look at how this has been introduced in urban farming in, no, urban farming, in South East Asia and how they are scaling up in the whole country. Thank you very much, Madeleine. And we will now turn to Ramane. And thank you very much for offering to make this presentation in English. I know that it is not very easy always to speak in a foreign language. We are very appreciative to you. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome ladies and gentlemen to this learning event. My name is Mahaman Adam from P-Builder in Niger. And I have come to speak to you today about productive sanitation. I will talk about the EFAD and P-Builder project in the IJ region. First, I will give a short presentation of P-Builder. Then I will introduce the person approach to our pilot project. I will then show you the result and how we are scaling up. Finally, I will talk about the lessons we have learned. P-Builder is the theme for the promotion of local development initiative in the IJ region. It has been around for eight years from 2005 and hosted by the Niger Ministry of Agriculture. Finding what obtained from EFAD, the Virgin Civil War Fund and the Niger Government as well as technical and capacity support from KRIPA, P-Builder and the Sdokono and the Reminder Institute. The P-Builder aim is to improve the livelihoods of the poor, which particularly focus on vulnerable groups, women and children. We work in 265 villages, split into 35 across over six municipalities. P-Builder is working in over 30,005 villages. Five major components of our work are identify and test local innovation, reinforce local institution and organization, take funds, make funds available to support local initiative and innovation, reinforce local service, project management. Productive sanitation also now as a person fits into component one. Between 2008 and 2010 our pilot program was the first introduction of productive sanitation in the region. We started with a small group of small small home farms. We wanted to get productive sanitation practices accepted and also to show that this will increase productivity. We also wanted to act as a model for all the actors in the agricultural sector. The agriculture challenge in Niger is that more than 80% of the population is engaged with average for size of less than 1.58. There is variable rainfall and large nutrient deficit. For example, here we can see that only 0.9 kg of chemical NPK are added per hectare per year, whereas 56 kg per hectare per year are lost. The sanitation challenge is that 91% of the rural population practiced open defecation. This practice contributed to 26,000 children each year due to jail. Human X beta is a plant-spoot in nutrient-sick. The nutrients consumed by a person each year are released in the same quantities in urine and feces. Urine and feces from 2 people contain the equivalent of 50 kg of urea and 50 kg of NPK worth 80 US dollars. The way to capture these valuable nutrients is to change from linear to circular nutrients flows. In the linear model, waste is discarded and forget about. We have the effect of spree diseases, petrification and loss of nutrients. Sanitization and reuse make the waste safe, reduce nutrient loss and enhance productivity. This is productive ecological sanitation. The further project started with 300 households in 7 villages. We used research from our brown-wine sanitation as well as economic, social and technical paper. Our outreach extended from the local to international. Paper dust and intervention zone is shown in green. Before we started there were very few ladders in the area. The pilot project began in 7 villages and the year after we added 6 more. The year after we scanned up. This is a very high-pitched and the last year after we added 8 villages. Here are some examples for the unit handling and managing the tank and the funnel. Here are examples of the composting and dry toilet we used in the village. This is the testing of our liquid fertilizer. We used in the irrigation system and by hand to grow tomatoes for example. These photos were taken at one of our former schools. The results. The process was accepted by all the communities. Increased harvest approximately 150 bit laden sponsored jets. Increased awareness of sanitation and heaters. The areas in the area of the area where the project has been adopted. We have seen this consolidated and are now scattered up. Which I will speak about shortly. From the scattered up we have seen the following effect. Yield increase from 425 kilogram per hectare to 600 kilogram per hectare. Average increase between 7 and 25%. 90% acceptance and use of urine. Reduction in cuts from using urine specially accessible for women. More interest in using local fertilizer in composting. The sanitation infrastructure has improved by a building of 330 laden. Over 2,000 sample urine. Prozone has led to improved sanitary conditions through access to their laden and reduce of open defecation. Gender resistance. Gender resistance. Gender resistance. Gender resistance. Gender resistance. Gender resistance has been an important factor in our work. As I said at the start, our focus on vulnerable groups as well as women and youth has been a large factor in our former field school. The former field school hosts between 20 to 20 people at a time. An agricultural technician lists the cultivation of an earth-hackered plot which has been split to three parts. Each part is cultivated in the same traditional manner but with different use of the local fertilizer products from urine and the other. The school takes three years to complete. We grow millet, sourpom tomatoes, onion and each of the parts and let the participants see the result. Each participant brings their unique knowledge to the school. Pharma brings practical knowledge, scientists and science knowledge, technicians and communication and diffuse skills. Discretion is encouraged between the participants. Once accepted, the participants will diffuse their knowledge back to their village. Since 2010, we have had female facilitators running the workshop to speed the approach among women. Women in particular appreciate the composting latin as it helps for them to manage and reach mass duration. In summary, from the Scala app, we have shown in many ways how the benefits have been transferred to the communities who participate in our work. We still have challenges in this area. Communities need to see the change to believe that some time plants can be damaged if they don't get enough water. Our work means the technology doesn't get communicated as well as the good work. We have managed to overcome the religious and social targets. We have empowered awareness. We have increased audio Țlair put in charge with 화자는 and the largest type ofよろしく. In 2020, Polson will be introduced into more villages with support from our previous local champions and pilot farmers. We aim to increase to 500 vulnerable post-hotsol over 2050 hectares. We will take the solid fertilizer in our first school on various soil problems. We will continue to co-compose, use solid and liquid fertilizer. And we will continue to consult at the end of the world to help the urine and to improve sanitation and hygiene. The builder will move into an additional fast and work in 18 municipalities in Niger reaching 65,000 households as part of increased funding by EFED. Predictive sanitation is a key part of their approach bringing both health and productive benefit. Thank you very much for your attention and the opportunity to speak at the agriculture and rural development here in New York. Thank you very much for that excellent presentation on a win-win situation that reaches out to the small, older, poor farmers in the rural parts of Niger. I think that is very impressive. Good luck with scaling up because that is going to be crucial. We now turn to the second of the major presentations and Robert is going to talk about vegetable gardens as one example. Good afternoon to everybody, my name is Robert Holmer and I work for EDBC World Vegetables Center vegetable gardens and eggs for agriculture, nutrition and health. Let me start with our imbalanced food systems that we have and talk especially about the Philippines now. With this so-called double burden of disease, with about 26% of children being underweight, about 30% with vitamin A and micronutrient deficiencies. At the same time, almost one third of adults are overweight or obese, rapidly increasing, mostly because of unsustainable diets with focus on nutrient poor but energy-based foods. Philippines is also one of the fastest urbanizing countries in Asia, and in urban areas access to healthy food choices is very often limited, and the access to energy-based food is rather easy. And if you look at the global scale, we have about 2 billion people malnourished, undernourished, but at the same time more than 1 billion people overnourished, with dramatic effects on health costs, non-communicable diseases, diabetes type 2, cardiovascular diseases. I just got the numbers from Germany, with 10 million out of 80 million having diabetes type 2. And here we plot the data from FAO stat on the vegetable availability from a person and day, with WHO data on child mortality below 5 years and underweight. And every dog is a country, and I highlighted three from Bolliviet, NAM, NAM, NAM. Here you have the actual data. Vegetable availability is not necessarily the number that the amount of vegetables consume, but the amount of vegetables produced in the country. And you can see here a close correlation when vegetable availability is below 100 grams a day, child mortality increases, and also children underweight. So this is a very clear indicator. However, there are some countries which do not necessarily fit this correlation, and if you look now at the next slide, there is a very close relationship between malnutrition and infection. You saw the earlier number of the Philippines. and then the next slide, the more this sofa moins unbearable but to make use that
