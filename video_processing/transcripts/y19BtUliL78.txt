 ADA is Agribusiness Development Agency, an entity that is tasked by Guazulu Natal provincial government to look at the development of emerging farmers. Our special focus is on commercialization of black farmers and also we are looking at post-farmer resettlement, wherein we look at programs that are aimed at capacitating, assisting and supporting those farms that have been resettled through the land reform programs. Part of the support that we do is around provision of infrastructure, infrastructure development for those resettled farms. In terms of that we looked at activities like your tunnels, hydroponics, irrigation schemes and other related activities to infrastructure. And also as part of our intervention we looked at, we normally look at the elements of agroprocessing, wherein we assist emerging farmers to ensure that we tap into the entire value chain from growing those crops right up to processing. The other critical issue that ADA is assisting emerging farmers with is access to market. Fortunately, Guazulu Natal government and its cabinet has endorsed and implemented a program called RASED. RASED program is aimed at assisting emerging farmers with the market to sell their produce. you Roc Analoo Como You 0 Speaker 2 predators Not Those Because Besides � 들려 Odoo You São You You You You Slow Way從 Fridays z
