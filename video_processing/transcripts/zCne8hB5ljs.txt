 Here are three signs of healthy soil. Number one, texture and structure. Healthy soil should be crumbly and loose, not compacted. If it's healthy, it should fall apart easily and have a rich, earthy smell. Number two, organic matter. Decomposed leaves, roots and plant material feed the soil like natural fertiliser. Number three, living organisms like earthworms, insects and even tiny fungi indicate healthy soil. Healthy soil is the foundation of everything. If a farmer has nothing else, he has soil.
