 GMO, or genetically modified organism, food has become a hot topic in recent years, but what exactly is it? GMO foods are crops or animals whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. This process allows scientists to introduce specific traits, such as resistance to pests or increased nutritional value. Proponents argue that GMOs can increase crop yields, reduce pesticide use, and help feed a growing global population. However, critics raise concerns about potential long-term health effects and environmental impact of GMO crops. Today, GMO crops are grown in many countries, with corn, soybeans, cotton, and canola being among the most common. As research continues, the debate over GMO foods remains a complex and evolving issue in agriculture and food science.
