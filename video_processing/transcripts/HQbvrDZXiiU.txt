 This cow's shorter than your pet dog, but she produces enough milk to stock your whole fridge. Meet the Punganur cow from India, the world's shortest full-grown cow, standing at just 70 centimeters tall. She thrives in dry climates, eats very little, and still manages to give up to 5 liters of high-fat milk a day. Honestly, she might just be my next pet.
