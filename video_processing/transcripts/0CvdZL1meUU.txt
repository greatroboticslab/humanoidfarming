 The idea of Grazing Lands was building a scaled regenerative grazing business and the livestock is the fly product of that business. We quickly realized that the demand was increasing so rapidly demand's not going to be our issue. Let's crack the code on supply chains. You have to think way beyond a farmer's market and that scale into something much bigger. The reality is we need supply chain all over the United States for it, right? And we have yet to prove it out here in South Texas or anybody has really as far as from birth to finish regenerative beef supply chain. People that become vegans and vegetarians because they think, well, I can't eat animals because of the way that they're raised. Well, what if we raise them in a way that actually heals the planet? All of a sudden we have a win-win for everybody.
