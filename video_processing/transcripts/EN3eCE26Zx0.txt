 So behind me, we are growing Brussels sprouts, which is getting pretty tall right about now. You're able to see the little immature Brussels start to come on in the nooks. So one important thing that you want to do if you're a gardener is snap off the bottom leaves. This is healthy pruning for the plant to help allow that plant to pump energy into the Brussels sprouts so they get bigger. If you don't take the leaves off, they'll stay tiny as marbles.
