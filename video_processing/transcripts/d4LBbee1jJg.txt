 Indonesians use sharp tools to cut tobacco leaves into small pieces. The tobacco leaves we usually see are dried yellow, but these people cut fresh green leaves. This is the difference between natural drying tobacco and smoke drying tobacco. Naturally drying tobacco is made by cutting the leaves into small pieces and drying them in the sun for four to eight weeks to mature. It has a high nicotine content and a strong flavor, so it is usually made into cigars. On the other hand, smoke drying tobacco is made by smoking the leaves for about a week, so it has a high sugar content and a mild flavor and accounts for 90% of the total tobacco.
