 Hey friends and neighbors, this is Chuck out of Sheraton Park Farm. Welcome back to the farm. I want to do a real quick video today. This is going to be short. I'm going to show a single cow move and how we can graze these cattle on small acreage using some portable, electric, easily movable infrastructure that will make your life easy. So if you've got small acreage and you're wanting to graze some cattle, we're going to show you today how we do it. This is not the right way. This is not the end all be all way. This is what works for us. Keep in mind, this is our very first season of trying to rotationally graze some cattle. And I think we counted this morning. This is only about our 37th, 35th day of having them on farm. So let me show you what we're doing. Please leave me a comment down below if you think I'm crazy, think I've hit my head, I've been sniffing too much glue, probably picked the wrong day, stopped doing quaaludes. Some of you older folks will get that joke, but hang around with us. Let me show you how we graze these cattle on small acreage. we don't get a link, but listen from Mark's house. Just support the rekest, we don't even know how we can... But learn some of you soon. When I even spent my life, I have effλη konsolors, Iль knew thatrence cultivates some cows, but I can give them an extra slack. so what we've done on this paddock is the cows were over here and this is a small fenced in area probably two acres acre and a half and we had the area back here closed off with the gate and so we don't have fence on this side there's a spring branch down here on the right hand side that's coming from up here on top of the hill so what i did was went in and just took a couple of t posts and i set about four t posts all along this side over here and then finished them off with just some little blue step ends to keep my lines even and keep the height correct because there's some indulations there's some up and downs so we've got this wire running all the way around the one side of this now the back side of the property this is the this is the property line up there along those trees good barbed wire fence up there good five strand barb and it's nice and tight comes all the way down over here and ends at this post so except for this side over here where the spring branch is it's pretty it's pretty secure so put these four posts in with the blue step ends and i ran a roll of wire and put two strands in and then i put an energizer on it so now i've got a hot wire all the way around the edge of this paddock and when i'm ready to pull a fence through the middle and break it up into sections i can just tie on to this wire that i'm running off this little portable energizer right here so we were able to bring power back here to this paddock that doesn't have power because my high tensile is behind me and it about i don't know it ends about 75 80 yards behind me so i don't have power up here on a hot fence so we just created a hot fence now eventually we'll come in and we'll put a high tensile hot wire in here that stays hot all the time but for just grazing on small acreage if you need to put in something quick and something that's portable and something that's easy um this works out really good it's a roll of that speed right wire that we use some blue o'brien step in post a couple of uh green t posts with some insulators on it and a solar energizer and that's going to keep them in here and there's jw and i were talking earlier he thinks there's about three or four days in here this is a big area i think there's probably and and they're on a bigger area right now than they were yesterday right here which was just half of this they're on a much bigger area right now just by eyeballing it i think so i believe we're going to have gosh we may have six days up here i don't know we'll see how it ends up breaking out because it keeps going i mean there's a great big poplar tree right there there's a little bit of grass even over in behind it and then like i said the tree line is kind of the kind of the edge so we'll see what they do with it um they moved over really quick they were ready to go we've even got old cinnamon here she's integrated with them now hanging out so we'll see how long that lasts you know she's kind of kind of crazy but anyway we got them over here and they're going right to work in terms of water managing water for them we've got if you go right down here to the end of the this gate will stay open we're not putting the back fence back up either right down here right around this corner is our uh temporary water uh that little 55 gallon drum that we cut in half that we got that job valve on that thing is fantastic and then it's ran via hose back down to the shop off of uh off the spring box so anyway real quick small acreage move if you're trying to graze cows on small acreage it can be done um got to keep them moving keep those paddocks and you know about the right size we're still figuring that out but i think we're getting close all right like we always say please keep us in your prayers may god bless you and your families and we'll see you on the next video thanks
