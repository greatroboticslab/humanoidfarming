 The challenge is not just Africa being able to feed itself, but also being able to contribute to feeding the 9 billion people. But to do that, African farmers will have to be treated as entrepreneurs in the same way we treat industrialists as entrepreneurs. That means that the incentives we give industrialists to be able to contribute the global industrial system should also be extended to farmers so that they can also contribute the global food system. The fact that there is a very large body of scientific and technological knowledge available today makes it possible for young people to start creating new agribusinesses and enterprises using these technologies and therefore becoming players in the global economy. And the whole area of building new businesses, to me, is going to become the next frontier of expanding African agriculture. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
