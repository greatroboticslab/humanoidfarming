 Hi Machinery Pete. This is Dale Jones with Sullivan Auctioneers. I'm here today with Joanne Murdock, wife of the late Randy Murdock of Reynolds, Illinois. We would like to introduce you to Randy and Joanne's outstanding line of machinery that we are selling at no reserve online only auction. Randy passed away unexpectedly in early 2020, so Joanne has decided to sell the machinery and rent out their family farm. Bidding is now open on two rings of farm machinery, trucks, construction machinery, recreational vehicles, lawn equipment, tools, and so much more. Bidding begins closing on both rings at 9 a.m. Monday, February 15th, President's Day. Randy farmed for 40 years and took great pride in his equipment to make sure that it was clean and serviced in a time and manner. We're standing in front of Randy and Joanne's 2016 John Deere 8370R with only 1,385 actual hours, which is a prime example of the quality machinery Randy's estate has to offer. We'd like for you to sit back, relax, and enjoy this preview slideshow of just a small portion of the auction. Then, log on to SullivanAuctioneers.com to view this outstanding offering and place your bids. Once again, this fantastic online-only auction ends Monday, February 15th. Thank you for watching and thank you for participating in this great auction. The しmanoyersMr. isn't Mr. alive and my prowad, and the soggy then lets go Quando im towel it www.machinerepeat.com
