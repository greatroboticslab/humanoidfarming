 I'm coming buddy you see them ducks out. So this won't be a long video here. I just wanted to answer some questions. By the way I'm your boy Maniac y'all. Thank you for watching Maniac Nation. My son is chasing a duck at the moment as you can see here and he enjoys that. But I just wanted to come on here. I have had some messages, questions. Do you have a tractor? No. I do have a tiller. I don't have all these fancy contraptions that most people have. I definitely don't. Well it's because I can't afford it. Life took a turn. Changed me and my family's life a little bit. We're just making the best of what we got. But life goes on and we're making the best out of it y'all. As we grow you know you'll be able to watch us grow. And sometimes life throws you curves. And check this out. But yes I don't have all those fancy contraptions. And I am actually on my way to the creek right now. To go use these hand tools. A hoe, a shovel, a rake. And I'm going to clear out around my elderberries. And you know that's just what you have to do. I'm not afraid to work. I'm not afraid of very much of anything. He just petted that duck. Look at him. Ain't that cute? The duck let him pet it. Holy smokes. That is amazing. Wow. I've never seen a duck let anybody just sit there and pet it. Son you've got the touch. You've got the touch. Daddy. I know it baby. That's pretty as you can be right there. She's letting you touch her. Yeah. Y'all that's what it's all about right there. That just made my day. Yes I could put this duck in the pen. But I mean she's got another one out here running with her. And even if I put her up she gets out y'all. Her wings are clipped too. So I don't understand how this keeps happening. But I will be going to the creek to do some rough net work. Moving stuff. Hoeing up. Raking up. Shoveling up. I mean that's just the way it is. But you know what? It's a journey. It's a fun journey. My kids love every minute of it as you see behind me. He can't wait. But yeah. So there you have it. I don't have the fancy tractors and all this other stuff. So I mean there's the answer to that. And you know I made a lot of mistakes in life. Things I wish I could take back. But I can't do that. And we just keep moving on. God is good. And he's opened more and more doors for us. We actually just had our stove mess up. So we had to go into more debt. We had to purchase a stove just a while ago. And luckily Home Depot offered a really nice payment plan. So we're going to have a new stove here before too long. Smooth top surfaces y'all are not good stoves. Plus you can't can on them. So I was able to get the coil type stove. I do want a gas stove. But right now it's not in our budget. It's not in our our our it's just not the right timing for us to get that. Because we'll have to get a tank. And we'll have to get the lines run through the house. But eventually I will have you know gas in the house. I do plan on having that. I better go check on my Kyle. This duck is letting him pet it again. How is that even possible y'all? I swear. I swear. I swear. Kids have a special touch. Do they not? But yeah. I know this is a crazy ramble video. But I've had quite a few people ask me already. How come you don't have this? How come you don't have that? I don't have it y'all. Oh my lord. He's got this duck by the neck y'all. I've got to do something about this. Look at this. Oh my Jesus. Let me put him down. Put him down. You don't hold a duck like that. Oh gee. And y'all. The duck is not harmed. It's just he's a child. That was an accident. But it was freaking hilarious. So hey. Y'all keep your head up. No matter how bad the times get. No matter how bad. Keep your faith. Love your family. Read your bible. And try to spend as much time with your kids as you can. Because I definitely look forward to that every day. Till next time. I am your boy Maniac y'all. This is Maniac Nation y'all. We out.
