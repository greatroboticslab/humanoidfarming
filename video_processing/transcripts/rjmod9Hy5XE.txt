 Hi friends. The poultry industry is constantly looking for ways to improve efficiency and reduce costs. The Spoutnik NAV, a new product from Tybot Technologies, is a device that is set to revolutionize the broiler production process. Designed to aerate litter and stimulate bird movement, this device is not only smart, but it's also programmable, it can navigate its way around the farm or follow a set route, turning bedding as it goes to prevent litter capping. According to Tybot Technologies, this innovative approach can help to prevent common health issues in poultry, such as foot pad dermatitis, cock burns, and breast blisters. But that's not all. The Spoutnik NAV also promotes movement in birds, breaking up dominance and improving performance. The company claims that trials with the robot have shown that it can pay for itself within just six flocks if used in a 1200 Ski-on house. The TEXA cage-free Baltica system is a revolutionary advancement in poultry farming technology that prioritizes animal welfare while improving efficiency and productivity. Unlike traditional chicken coops, the Baltica system recreates the natural habitat of chickens, allowing them to live in an environment that is similar to the wild. This is achieved through a unique design that includes secluded nests and perches that enable chickens to fulfill their natural instincts. The system also includes advanced technology such as automated feed and water dispensers and an automatic ventilation system. The automatic egg collection feature eliminates the need for manual collection, saving time and reducing the risk of damage to the eggs. Additionally, sensors in the system can detect sick birds and separate them from the flock for speedy treatment. The Wopaklaw is the ideal solution for those who care about the health of their large horned animals. This mechanism for fixing the body position allows you to handle hooves, cut and carry out medical manipulations on both dairy and meat animals. The internal space of Wopaklaw is wide, which ensures maximum comfort for the animals. No matter if your cattle are large or small, the 180km headroom allows for easy and comfortable handling of their hooves. The design consists of beams and partitions, which provide a good overview, and a reliable fixation system with a hydraulic drive on the control panel allow you to easily fix the limb of the animal for manipulation. The weight of the structure is only 750 kg, which allows you not to worry about the dimensions of your cow or other cattle. This reliable and convenient device will allow you to care for your animals quickly and easily. Sylvan Pier is a rotary hoe that will help to improve the quality of litter, which directly affects the health of the birds. This is a reliable and compact device from Sylvan that easily handles the mass and removes large lumps, leaving a smooth and soft surface. Snap-on covers with rubber inserts minimize the noise level, allowing you to work even in a full cope without stress for the birds. The special design of the device allows you to change the direction of its movement on the go, improving maneuverability. The Sylvan PR rotary hoe has 32 sharp drum blades with a working width of 162 centimeters, which is more than enough to handle spacious utility rooms. At the same time, the low weight of 260 kg exerts only a slight pressure on the floor covering and the bedding itself. The GEA Monobox is a modern and high-tech robotic cow milking system that makes it possible to significantly simplify the maintenance of a herd of up to 70 cows. The smart unit consists of a comfortable system of clamps, an automatically fastened milking cluster, and numerous sensors that monitor milk quality and the condition of the animal. The unit is easily integrated into any barn design and can be combined with other units to form a carousel unit. Top-notch software manages the entire process, preventing hitches and controlling the flow of cows. An ergonomic workspace with a user-friendly console display and clear menu navigation enhances operating comfort. The GEA Monobox is the ideal solution for today's farmers looking to increase their herd's productivity and provide them with maximum comfort. This robotic cow milking system can significantly reduce personnel costs and ensure high-quality milk. I hope you enjoyed the video. Good luck, friend!
