 Today we're planting more tomatoes sideways. Today we're going to plant some tomatoes sideways. The first thing we're going to do is we're going to cut off some of these side shoots. Next thing we're going to do is we're going to dig us a little trench. All right. We're going to take some Nelson's Organic Tomato Food. We're going to do a little salt bay action into the hole. We're going to turn our tomato upside down, squeeze it, pop it out. We're going to lay it down into the trench just like this. Just like that. Go easy on it. Don't snap it in half. Everywhere the dirt touches the stem, it's going to grow roots. A little more Nelson's Plant Food around the sides and throw our label back in here. All right, so now we're going to water them in really well. We've got our sprinkler system going. We'll be updating all the tomatoes and be on the lookout for more vegetables and fruit gardening videos this summer.
