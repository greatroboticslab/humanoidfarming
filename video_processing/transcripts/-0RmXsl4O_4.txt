Science & Technology
 Farmed animal breeding programs consist of many animals with different genetics and characteristics. A breeding program for any farmed animal species involves making breeding decisions based on a balanced and responsible combination of these characteristics. Modern animal breeding is a strong cornerstone to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. FAB animal breeders are highly engaged in combining multiple traits, or characteristics, for a more sustainable animal farming. Examples of these traits are a better use of resources, improved animal health and welfare, reduction of environmental impact, a better production and quality of the products, and ensuring food security, whilst keeping genetic diversity. Code EFABAR, the code of good practices for responsible and balanced animal breeding, recognizes the central role of sustainability in animal breeding programs and shows the strong commitments of FAB members for responsible breeding.
