 This is our continuous flow worm bay here and we got apples on it that we're feeding them and it is full of worms. We also have oats that we throw in there every week, let them grow a little bit and then we cover it with compost. That is to help build mycorrhizal fungal spores. Our compost that we will cut off the bottom with our winch there. See how it dropped along there. We will refill this.
