 Hey Vinay, your father had brought a new tractor last season. Has it been a good investment? Yes, certainly. Mechanization has increased productivity of the crops. Now my father can easily rotate crops on the same line. Wow, that sounds promising. I wonder why more farmers don't opt for mechanization in India if it is so beneficial. That's an interesting observation. The reason for this includes small size of farms along with hilly and rolling topography. Plus, shortage of power and availability of surplus agricultural workers is also a reason. Oh, is this the reason why India ranks last in Asia Pacific for average farm power availability? That's true. However, the government has been taking steps like submission on agricultural mechanization and Rastriya Krishivikas Yojana to promote farm mechanization. That's good to hear. I think these efforts can be further supplemented by agricultural machine banks and indigenous research. Even the use of technologies like robotics and artificial intelligence is needed. Right. Thanks Vinay. To start a Ils�ope a huge number of other chemicals actually want Subscribe to the an Assembly honored. For all of us, we can see what food changes.
