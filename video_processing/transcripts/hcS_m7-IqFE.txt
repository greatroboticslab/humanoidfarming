Howto & Style
 Music There's this philosophy and this idea that Bob started with of preserving an ancient variety of grain that he didn't quite understand what was happening with it in the beginning, but he knew that it was special. And he saw the nutritional and the health properties and the possibilities for that. As well at the same time he really believed in organic agriculture. And so he decided to marry those two under this idea of a name, of a brand. Families have come into my restaurant and they, they, the father, I had one father literally cry because he'd never been able to eat something that his daughter had eaten or she'd never been able to eat something the same thing he was eating. And he thanked me and that makes this special, you know, it's changing lives. Music If you were really to imagine and count all the different products that we have throughout the world, it would number in the thousands. And so it's quite amazing to think that this all came from 36 kernels of grain. Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music 20 miles from our farm and Bobby LaSalle is a good friend of mine and I've been putting together ideas for food sovereignty where the reservation could raise more of its own food and we're starting with Kamut. I'm Bobby LaSalle I am the manager for the Dry Fork Farms which is owned by the Chippewa Cree tribe and here in north central Montana and I was kind of motivated to change over to try this organic stuff by Mr. Bob Quinn so I decided we'd try a field of it here the two big motivations for me to try it was price of the commodity is way better than any commercial grains we can raise and it's it's it is a lot of work but I'm kind of excited about it I'm liking it Who I am is I'm John Tester I farm this land which my grandfather and grandmother homesteaded over a hundred years ago. We've been now working together with the Khmut project for almost 30 years almost as long as you've been going organic how has that worked out for you has that been satisfactory for? No the Khmut's a great grain in the rotation it is it has worked out incredibly well for us and the Khmut is very resistant because it's a strong stem plant to that the other thing is is that it's it's good I mean it's it's different when I when I go around the country and I do a fair amount of traveling and folks know I farm oftentimes they ask me do you know anything about this Khmut stuff oh yeah and so it's fun because I say yeah my neighbor down the road about 25 miles away developed it and he's really developed a great market for it and it's good stuff and it's it's good my wife when my wife had wheat allergies real bad we and I'm not saying this works for everybody it would have worked for us we got off the regular wheat that you make bread off of and she started making bread out of Khmut and and she got over the allergies now she's able to eat that white flour again what we really want people to eventually understand is that it's not just a grain there's this whole program that's behind it this philosophy in these ideals of promoting healthy food nutritious food not just volume but good nutritious food it's not it's a quality over quantity thing and at the same time promoting a healthy environment and and just a holistic sense of doing good things while you have to eat anyway the story of the Pacifica Felicetti started in 1908 in Predazzo in Val di Fiemme in the heart of Dolomiti in 2000 we arrived and we got in contact with the Khorasan Amakio Kamut already in 2000 we started to do the first production tests and the first test was a pretty secret test that I didn't know my father and my cousin Paolo I told him that it was a special product and that it had to be very much in production because it was something really special and it was so particularly that my father when he saw the fatture that he accompanied me in my office in an extremely aggressive sventolating this fatture saying but you are crazy but who believe that we will be able to sell this product and he said and then he said to me for a couple of days after the breakfast of the third or fourth day he returned in the office he closed the door and he said to me but he said to me he said to me a little bit of this Kamut he said to me because you have already talked a lot about you interested in the question of the price and he said to me I have just put it in the box and it was 50 years ago that I didn't hear these smells. It doesn't matter the price, it doesn't matter the cost. It's good, it's smelled and it was years ago that I didn't hear these smells. So go ahead. It has been over 30 years since we first experimented with organic agriculture on our farm and introduced giant ancient wheat to the marketplace. This has come together in a way which has completely changed the direction of my life's work and the passion that drives it. In the mid-1980s I had no real appreciation for the significance or the potential of organic agriculture. Today I believe it's the only system which really makes sense and it is the future. In those days I had also no idea about the connection between food and health. Now I see them as inseparable. Food really should be our medicine and medicine should be our food.
