 It's so hard to be profitable right now on the cow business. You have to have a diversified operation or you just won't make it in agriculture. And you have to think outside of the box a little bit. You know, just because your neighbor runs a cow-calf operation and it works for them, their land may be paid for. But us, we're trying to pay for our land and at the end of the day when we were weaning calves and selling calves it was like, hey, we're just breaking even. It's not generating any income. So we went to what I knew running yearlands. We'd buy truckloads of what we call cut bulls, you know, castrate them, get them healed up and then ship them to the feed yard. We did that for a little while then we started doing what we do now where we trade some replacement females. So like right now we've got a handful of replacement heifers out here that are caving and we're just going to sell them as pairs. We're going to roll them up a few hundred dollars a head and make a little money and move on down the road. When now our grass is starting to go dormant, we'll just let it sit fallow for the rest of the winter and then when in the spring we'll heavy stock it and take advantage of the grass then.
