 Companies that make agricultural machinery in East China's Zhejiang province are ramping up production to accommodate growing demand from overseas markets. At a firm based in Taijou, workers are loading hundreds of sprayers onto flatbed trucks that are destined for European clients. Its manager says in January they shipped about 12 containers of products a day for a monthly export value of around 13 million U.S. dollars.
