 When Glenn Rash gets to work, the hay really flies. Behind the wheel of his discbine, he's mowing a field of orchard grass, one of several hay varieties he grows on 150 acres in Carroll County. Well, I was born up all my life with farming, and I always loved to make hay. He's farmed a lot of different crops over the years, but nowadays he focuses only on the green stuff. My brothers wanted to retire, so they retired in 1988. We had public sale, and I continued with the hay business from then until now. And that business has won him a load of blue ribbons, both at the Howard County and Maryland State Fairs. At 89 years old, he knows a thing or two about prize-winning hay. It takes patience to make good hay. If you don't have patience to wait until it's ready to bale, ready to mow, or not mow it, that's all in the quality you get in the bale. Another key? Having the right tools for the job. The disk vine doesn't just cut the hay. It sends it through these rubber rolls that crush the stems, so water can escape as it dries in the sun. Today, Glenn is making second cutting hay, meaning this field has already been harvested once this summer and grown back. Orchard grass goes six weeks, and every six weeks we cut it again. And I'll get three cuttings of orchard grass in a season. It takes about three days for hay to cure in the sun, or else it'll get moldy in storage. To help speed the process, Glenn brings out his next piece of equipment, the tedder. It fluffs it up, and that's what you want it to do, to set up in the field so the air can get through it to dry it better. He'll ted it at least twice, flipping the hay over after one side dries. Meanwhile, he's also keeping an eye out... One little cloud. ...for rain. It's the hay farmer's worst enemy, and during our visit, it came out of nowhere, drenching the freshly cut field. If it's top-quality hay, you'll get $7, $8, $10 a bale for it. But if you get drained on, you'll get $2, $1.50 a bale, just because of the weather. But thankfully, this brief shower didn't cause too much damage. After two sunny days and another go with the tedder, the orchard grass has dried out. A lot of people think, you know, this hot, humid weather is good haymaking, but humidity is not good for making hay. Hay is only as dry as the air that's going into it. A day like today is perfect. Next, from the air-conditioned comfort of his tractor cab, Glenn uses a rotary rake to gather the hay into rows for the baler, all while listening to his favorite music, bluegrass. With the field ready, neighbors Greg Will and Mark McTheney come to lend a helping hand. Both Mark and Glenn are running balers today, which are fascinating to watch in action. First, the baler picks up the hay and moves it into a chamber, where a plunger forcefully compacts it. Once there's enough hay inside, the machine quickly loops twine around it, ties a set of knots, and creates a bale. All in a fraction of a second. Then, the bale drops onto the ground, and the machine starts making the next one. The hardest part about baling hay, getting them the exact right size. And Glenn don't want them real long, and he don't want them real heavy. Consistency is key, not just to please the customers, but to make Greg's job easier. He's driving the stack wagon, which collects up to 160 bales into a neat stack, a job that used to be done by hand. You know, it's harder and harder to get help these days, so the more automated it is, the faster and the more you can get in from what used to be a very manual process. Finally, Greg carefully unloads the stacks so they won't tip over in the barn. Admiring the day's work with his wife, Mary Sue, Glenn starts planning which fields to mow next. He takes great pride in everything that he does, and he's been an inspiration to me and like a second father to me. So, I really have enjoyed working with him, and I do every day. He makes between 25 and 30,000 bales every year, most of which go to some very lucky horses. I have a whole book full of wonderful customers. They all tell me, Glenn, this smells so sweet I can put some milk on it and eat it myself. I said, go right ahead. Glenn says he might retire from farming after this season, but according to his friends, he's been saying that since 1998. And did you know, hay is usually green, and is usually used for animal feed. Straw is usually made from leftover grain stalks, which is why it's yellow. And it's mostly used as animal bedding. And it's a classic diet every day. Dylan Silknik.
