 Grow fresh greens anytime indoors. To start, I germinated seeds using coco coor and when they developed 2-4 true leaves, I gently washed the roots with water to transplant into our hydroponic setup. And by the way, the tomatoes and herb cuttings that we propagated in the Spider Farmer Smart G12 hydroponic grow system all rooted well. In our earlier videos, we showed you how we set up our indoor hydroponic system using the Spider Farmer plant stand. We've already added the liquid nutrients and all we're doing is transplanting the seedlings and we're using leka clay pebble to hold the plants. Every two weeks or so, we top off the reservoir with additional nutrients and water mixed to feed the plants. We did end up growing root vegetables in hydroponic like turnip, radish, along with leafy greens like mizuna, spinach, lettuce, and bok choy. Our setup uses the SF600 grow lights and it's perfect for the plants stand. After two weeks, the plants grew fast and we're really happy that it worked and we'll be able to grow more greens anytime even during winter season. So if the outdoor weather isn't ideal, consider growing indoors.
