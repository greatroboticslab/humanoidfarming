 Thank you for coming today. It's so wonderful to have you all here. So awesome to see so many new faces and so wonderful to see all the incredible beautiful gifts that everybody has brought for the giveaway table. There's certainly a lot of activity over there so if you haven't been there yet, please don't leave today without checking out the giveaway table. Now, we have an awesome presentation for us this morning. This beautiful young man, Isaac Oldfield. Isaac lives at Merillion. Isaac has been home schooled his whole life and he has prepared a presentation for us on the philosophy and method of natural farming. So there will be time for questions at the end of his presentation. You might want to take notes as he goes. That's up to you. But I have no doubt that this is going to be an amazing presentation. Thanks so much, Isaac. Thank you. Thank you. Before I start, I'd just like to thank Maria and Ula and Pidev and George and his lovely wife for supplying this venue and organizing everything. At Merillion, I live on a natural farm with my parents and sister, Ara and David and Jocelyn over here. What I'm about to read about is basically what the principles that we follow and this is our life, our life of philosophy. Sorry. I'll start. I would like to talk with you about my thoughts on the philosophy and basic method of natural farming. To lead into the subject, I will briefly outline the history of agriculture as I see it. The farming has existed as a way of life for tens of thousands of years. It probably began when the hunter-gatherer brought fruits and edible plants back to his shelter after eating them and deposited any uneaten or undigested seed material just beyond the edge of camp. Thus, a ring of edible vegetation developed around early man, encouraging him to deliberately scatter seeds on the ground with hopes of them growing. This habit slowly developed into a highly productive pattern of planting and harvesting, which provided food for almost every human on earth, excluding those who still hunted and gathered up to a few centuries ago. Up until then, farming was essentially a means of providing the farmer, his family, his friends and then his district with sustenance in that order. Then, industrialisation appeared and farms began to grow bigger with the help of mechanisation. This was necessary in order to feed the masses of factory employees, occupied with the task of building and repairing the trucks, cars, tractors, farm implements and aeroplanes that were needed by the farmers in order to feed the factory workers. All this cost money, requiring the farmer to make his fields all the more vast, in order to sustain the economics of his industry. People left the country for the city to fill the employment gaps in the factories and offices in banks, which were required to run the vastly costly industries that farming, carpentry, blacksmithing, animal husbandry and craftsmanship had so suddenly become. This all meant more work for the farmers, whose fields continued to get bigger and bigger. The load was becoming excessive, so to assist farmers in producing more, the Green Revolution was rolled out, trapping the farmer into a treadmill of debt and work, and not to mention the effects on the soil and environment, which I will explain in the following chapters. Eventually, steps were taken to heal the wound of industrialised farming by the man Masanoba Fukuoka. He started out as an agricultural scientist and eventually realised that the key to the problem was a regression to peasantry. But to make it possible for farmers to provide for the strain placed upon them while reverting to a natural way of farming, the workload of traditional peasantry had to be drastically downsized. After years of experiments, natural or do-nothing farming emerged from the traditional Japanese agriculture. This name is misleading. The method still requires plenty of work, but it makes it possible for just one man to manage several acres on his own. The name is derived from the natural farming principle of questioning every procedure until the whole is reduced to a minimum. The four main ethics of this farming method are no cultivation, no chemical fertilisers or prepared compost, no weeding by tillage or herbicides, and no dependence on chemicals. The problems that the farmer may perceive if these practices are discontinued are remedied in the labour-saving measures which I will proceed to describe. Here are four basic principles of natural farming that should be held as law by every agriculturalist. Once again, no cultivation, no chemical fertilisers or prepared compost, no weeding by tillage or herbicides, and no dependence on chemicals. It's common knowledge that cultivation is a fundamental part of all conventional agriculture. When the hunter-gatherer scattered seeds of food-bearing plants upon the ground, he found that they were often eaten by birds and rodents. He would dig a hole and bury the seeds so that they would not get disturbed. This is the main reason why cultivation is such an important part of traditional and modern farming. It does, however, have two major drawbacks. Firstly, it takes considerable effort to dig the ground up. Even with the help of draft animals or machinery, it still takes a lot of time and costs a lot of money. Secondly, turning the soil stimulates the germination of seeds which would never have come up otherwise. The number of unwanted seeds per cubic foot of soil is enough to choke the entire crop unless you spend days on the back-breaking task of weeding by hand. If you don't do that, the only other option is to use expensive herbicides which burn the soil and destroy all manner of essential microorganisms and poison important waterways of the district. We now see that cultivation is an extremely destructive element of traditional as well as modern methods of farming. When farming naturally, one must leave the task of cultivation to nature by allowing plant roots, worms and microbic organisms to keep the soil soft and well aerated. We ourselves can confirm the effectiveness of this principle as our orchards over several years have turned the soil, which was once a heavy grey clay, into a rich brown soft soil full of humus. However, there is the problem of protecting the grain from the animals as they sit prone on the ground as they would naturally fall from the mother plant. The hunter-gatherer buried the seed with his own hands. That was the mistake that led to the worldwide folly known as cultivation. The hunter-gatherer buried the seed with the soil. In nature, poor germination rates don't matter. Production is not the object here, but on a farm it is. This problem is solved by creating soil pellets which encase the seeds. This method imitates the high germination rates of seeds deposited in animal and human castings. This method can be used anywhere just as castings all over the world germinate all manner of seeds. It also deals with the shock factor which affects newly transplanted seedlings by cutting off up to two weeks of their growth rate. Chemical fertilisers and prepared composts such as commercial potting mix, mill mud and even material from the conventional compost heat or bin are all products to be avoided. The main reason for not using these common crop enhancers is that they are an upset to the natural balance of things. Chemical fertilisers are artificial and bleach the soil by killing all the microorganisms and other invertebrates which are essential inhabitants of the soil. The pampering of the crop by applying prepared compost which quickly modifies conditions so that the plant actually comes and needs the chemicals in order to survive. Prepared compost has the same effect on plant health. They get used to the sterile environment and quickly grow weak. However natural farming methods still recommend that the grain grower should mulch his crops but only using the dry straw from the previous crop with a little green manure to boost bacterial activity. Special emphasis is put on scattering the plant stalks in a chaotic crisscross pattern. If the stalks all lay in the same direction there would be no room for the crops to grow up through the straw. This points towards the importance of allowing materials to decompose around the crop in a natural way, i.e. complete stalks and no uniform pattern. This allows the soil microbial to feed on the slowly decaying material and breed up in the soil as the crop grows. In reference to no weeding by tillage or herbicides, a major principle of natural farming points out that weeds should be controlled but not exterminated. Many important organisms and predators of insect pests live on and amongst weeds. Herbicides totally exterminate the weeds and the important organisms which live on them as well as leach the soil of nutrients. Weeding by tillage only encourages weed growth as cultivation of the soil exposes more and more seeds that would never have germinated otherwise. Instead of using these methods, control over the weed population of fields and orchards can be achieved with the use of ground covers such as wide clover or pinto peanut. These are thick and greatly hamper the growth of weeds. They are leguminous and need no more maintenance than a re-sowing every few years. In order to grow crops through a carpet of ground cover, one simply slashes it with a scythe before scattering seed pellets. A week later repeat the slashing. The seeds will have germinated by then and before a third slashing is required, they will be above the ground cover. This method can be used for all manner of vegetable crops but must be practiced with strong, original, non-hybrid seeds planted in an established and healthy soil for water retention purposes unless you intend to use irrigation. Dependence on chemicals is a destabilizing and destructive disposition for any farm. The chemicals weaken the plants resistance to pests and disease by annihilating the need to resist. Like a human on drugs, the plant quickly becomes to need the chemicals very greatly and when the appliances are discontinued, the plant gets deprivation symptoms. As pests and pests and pests suddenly come back and attack the weakened plants, often causing extreme damage to total ruination of the crop. The soil also undergoes a total extermination of microfauna and flora. After several years, the farm often becomes a sterile dust bulb causing abandonment when the soil degenerates to a point where all the farmer is left with is dead soil too compact to work. This is why it is so important to avoid all use of chemicals. However, it has been proven that hard compact soil can be revived to full agricultural productivity within 15 years of natural farming principles. Here are some additional natural farming principles. The ground cover is an important part of natural farming. First, it competes with the weeds, excluding the need for hours of work with hand weeding, which is a major deterrent for anybody looking to begin natural farming. Leguminous ground covers are especially useful for their nutritional values. They create nitrogen and produce just as much if not more humus than regular applications of straw with a fraction of the effort. The only difficulty is that they may outgrow and smother delicate vegetable seedlings. In this case, they have to be slashed on the location of the intended vegetable patch. Seed pellets are then scattered and by the time they sprout a second slashing is required. But it will not be as severe as the first so that the young plants are not damaged. Soon after, the vegetables will be strong enough to grow through the clover. Two extremely effective soil rehabilitation tools are Acacia deal barter and Inga, commonly known as ice cream bean. Acacia deal barter is a useful field and orchard tree for a number of reasons. Firstly, its strong roots break up the soil and naturally cultivate it while providing fertiliser through Rhizobia bacteria nodules. growing at seven to eight meters in five years and supplies excessive quantities of firewood as well as making an excellent windbreak. Reportedly six to ten trees are enough to adequately cultivate and fertilize a whole acre. Inga or ice cream bean is its tropical equivalent although there is nothing to say that Acacia d'Ilebarth will not grow here as well. It grows at roughly the same rate and produces a constant stream of firewood. It produces an edible fruit whereas d'Ilebarth does not. It has an expansive root system but it is not very wind resistant falling easily in wet ground and powerful wind gusts. D'Ilebarth is definitely a stronger rooted tree while the Inga's advantage over it is that it produces an edible fruit. A good spread of orchard trees is a vital component for any self-sustaining farm. However, in traditional Japanese farming orchard trees are meticulously pruned for appearance and easy harvesting of fruit. But this means hours of difficult work in the orchard, definitely an activity worth trying to avoid. Furthermore, the trees that have already undergone pruning cannot be left to grow independently. Because if you did, the damage done would cause the tree to grow ugly and twisted. Disease will then set in and the tree will most likely die. This demonstrates the destructiveness of human meddling and the importance of leaving trees to grow naturally. This is why I myself prefer to let trees grow their own way and only prune them if it is absolutely essential. Diseases and pests are extremely common among trees, but in natural environments they never cause death or total annihilation of the crop. Natural farming mimics this balance by growing ground cover which houses spiders. The main predator of the biggest insect pests that trouble orchard trees. Spraying chemicals over orchards to get rid of pests only creates further imbalance as previously explained, making the crop prone to attack. Growing an abundance of vegetables is also very important for self-sufficiency. With enough sunlight, these may be grown in orchards as well as gardens with very little assistance. Root vegetables such as daikon radish help to naturally cultivate the soil with its large roots. Vegetable seeds should be planted by moulding them into earth pellets before scattering them over the appointed spot and carrying out the same slashing procedure mentioned earlier. Everything is left to grow naturally with no irrigation or trellises. Tomatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins and lentils are all left to grow rambling across the ground. Water is preserved even through the dry season by thick canopy and ground cover. To conclude my thoughts so far, here is my summary on the natural way. I think that the most important natural farming principle of all is that whatever you must do to assist your crops, think carefully about how you are about to do this and how it would happen naturally and follow that reasoning. Seeds in animal castings have high germination rates and therefore we should make soil castings. Lay straw in your fields in a chaotic crisscross pattern, for that is how grass falls when it is cut, and so on. When you follow the natural way, benefits and good fortune arise without effort. You cannot separate one part from the whole. You must see each aspect of the world as a part of one existence. Otherwise you end up with all sorts of screwball ideas and problem creating solutions. Science is the practice that professes to forever expand human knowledge. But if you have a scientist come to the forest, you will realize that he is only able to totally comprehend the workings of one facet of it. Perhaps a species of tree. He will point one out and give it a Latin name. Then he will proceed to tell you about it and how it sustains itself, its nutritional requirements, the physics of the osmosis up and down the trunks, the photosynthesis and the creation of starch, and the intake of carbon dioxide and expelling of oxygen may also be described. But now ask him about the nutrition of the soil, the trees that stand in it, and the frogs, snakes, birds and epiphytes in the canopy of the trees. Already you will have to invite a crowd of specialists in to answer your questions. And even these extensive explanations of the workings of forest plants and animals have some huge missing parts. For instance, the scientist who appears to know so much about the guinea fowl may show an extreme lack of common sense and practicality in his not knowing how to cook it. It is the very thing that proves the boundaries of human knowledge and not some extraordinary means of expanding it. We can't ever hope to completely understand nature, but we can become part of it again by following the natural way back to a natural balance. So far, all I have spoken of has been concerned with basic methods. So I will now express my thoughts on the philosophy of natural farming. There are a multitude of different philosophies and religions that have moulded the way people think and act for thousands of years. But it is the culture of nature that encompasses and exceeds all others in purity, principle and simplicity. Real farming is more than an activity. It has been degraded over the last century to a form of commerce and a desecration to the land instead of the sacred practice it used to be. Farming is the cultivation of humankind, not the soil. Horticulture is farming that has been shamefully mutated into an industry. True culture incites that the farmer should feed himself and his family first and to make the serving of the land his number one priority in front of selling off any excessive products. In early Japanese culture, there were priests, farmers, soldiers, craftsmen and merchants. Farmers were considered servants of the gods. People who in one way or another would always get by and have something to eat. They practised a form of agriculture beyond all alternative lifestyles of the modern world. And lived by the culture of nature, which was simple and humble and required no great scriptures, as do most religious structures which are the product of human discrimination and ego. In following this path, the true farmer was strong of mind and body, peaceful, happy and with time to spend on the pleasures of life. Such good health and joy are dissolved by horticulture, which instead drives the farmer into a vortex of death, sickness and despair, which sends him rushing about every hour of the day and night in a futile attempt to make money. Such people are looked upon as fools by the natural farmer. Here is some food for thought. We live in a world where every individual has caused to harbour a great deal of uncertainty as to the virtues of what they put in their mouths. The farmer of old lived simply. His diet changed according to the season and he did not indulge in the extravagances of the rich, except on days of celebration and feasting. But even then, one could be assured of the quality of what one ate. Today we are instead flooded with an enormous spectrum of synthetic food grown and marketed by horticultural methods. Even certified organic and natural foods are commercialised and created unnaturally. Nobody can be totally sure of anything to do with the food industry, emphasis on industry. Hence confusion about food. To take the matter further, if food that grows without human interference, i.e. wild, is to be considered natural, then crops that are grown in a tendered field but not subjected to horticultural practices may be considered unnatural. So where do you draw the line between natural and unnatural? The root of this problem is that people actually have to worry about whether or not their diet is natural. Firstly, people began to succumb to their own human desire for fancy dishes and extravagant meals, striving to indulge in them more often. The trend grew as such foods became more commonly available until modern agriculture emerged, allowing people to indulge in their favourite foods all year round. Soon many people forgot what foods grew in which seasons and stopped gathering foods from the wild and could no longer feel the joy of each fruit and vegetable coming into season and quickly became tired of it. In an attempt to be able to enjoy a fruit all year round, people lost all the happiness that was held in the ripening of the first of that crop. In the meantime, large agricultural companies took advantage of people's tendencies and began producing food products faster and cheaper by means of horticulture, and in the process further estranged people from natural food and destroyed society health and wellbeing. The society has been infected with dozens of nonsensical terms, methods and diets, all of which completely missed the mark. What people have forgotten is that if you consciously try to do something, you will never achieve the desired effect. The solution to confusion over food is to stop looking for the natural diet and allow nature itself to provide it for you. Here is a word on how to regain natural diet. In this world there are four main classes of diet. The self-indulgent one, guided by personal tastes. Second, the scientific diet, consisting of a list of food products containing the nutrition necessary for life. Third, the diet of principle based on spiritual doctrines and idealistic philosophies. Most natural diets fall into this class. And fourth, the diet of non-discrimination, discarding all human knowledge and following the will of nature. First, people must draw away from self-indulgence. Countless diseases sprout from this diet due to its detachment from nature. Next, becoming disenchanted with the scientific diet, which only attempts to sustain biological life, many people then proceed to the diet of principle. Finally, one must transcend this to arrive at the non-discriminating diet of a natural person. This final transition is achieved only by allowing nature to speak through your toxic aura of human knowledge and by listening to its instructions. You will find yourself being provided every requirement of life and happiness and joy will return to you. One must realize that human life is not sustained by its own power. It is provided for by the natural cycles of the world around you. The natural diet will be provided for you by the change of the seasons. Whether you obtain food from the wild or tend to a field of vegetables, as long as the food you eat is attuned to nature's cycles, it's provided by nature and it is a natural diet. The best food for oneself lies at one's feet. Do not eat food with your head. That is to say, get rid of the discriminating mind and never consciously try to do anything or the desired effect will never be achieved. To conclude, I will now address some issues concerning relativity and the human enigma. This world is made of wise men and fools. There is a vast difference between being knowledgeable and actually being wise. A scholar may study every book existing on botany and still not understand a single plant. The fact is that understanding anything is quite beyond human capabilities. We think we understand things because we become familiar with them. The astrologist knows the stars and a botanist is adept in the functionality of plants. But all these two are really doing is grasping an impression with science and interpreting it into something that makes sense or accommodates their own personal views. The more involved two scientists become in intellect, the more strange and distorted views they get and the more they set themselves apart from the world and each other, and the harder it becomes to live harmoniously and naturally. The problem here is that science is rigid, nature is not. Discrimination is a fragmented and incomplete understanding, yet it forms the starting point for all human knowledge. With unfounded arrogance, humans create an incomplete model of nature and tell themselves that they understand the essence of it. To truly know nature, one must realize that he knows nothing, that he does not have the capacity to know anything. It is then that he must lose all interest in discriminating knowledge. Once this transition takes place, non-discriminating knowledge arises naturally within oneself. One must not think about knowing. One must not care about understanding. There is no other way than through the destruction of ego, through the banishment of the thought that man can sustain life from his own power, that anybody can be truly wise. This means being foolish instead of smart. Then we see foolishness comes out of being smart. We know there is a difference between being foolish and smart, but we don't know if we are the former or the latter. Therefore you can't become foolish and you can't become smart. You are stuck simply because you actually care about being either. There is nothing wiser than remaining totally silent. No thing is the interpretation of the Japanese word mu, which incites that there is no such thing as an individual or entity. Mu is the language of nature. A cat snatches a bird from its perch to devour it. A man sees the act and he decides it is cruel and shoots the cat. What did he achieve? One sees the cat kill the bird and calls it bad because one should not kill. But does that make the cat any less of a being than the bird? If so, then somebody should have killed the man too. Then that act of cruelty would have been punished in its own turn. And eventually everyone and everything would end up dead. This demonstrates the futility of right and wrong. Survival of the fittest is a ridiculous phrase which is totally incorrect. The world never asks itself if it is based on a principle of competition or cooperation. It is only through human intellect that right and wrong, strong and weak are perceived. The fact is that humans spend most of their time clapping their hands and arguing about which hand made the noise. Or observing that the coin has two sides and contemplating which is the most important. Quite forgetting about the coin itself. In nature the world of relativity does not exist. The coin is simply the coin. Dark is light and light is dark. Juxtaposed they create a whole day. But then days don't exist as an individual time frame in nature. Nor does anything else. Nature is everything. There are no different names for different parts. Nature is no thing. Humans do not have the capacity to understand. Instead they discriminate and in doing so they desecrate. Humans discriminate between themselves and others. As light gives substance to darkness, segregation of people builds upon itself. Giving rise to argument, hate and war. Humans are the only creatures capable of intellect. And in that we have discovered a million ways to kill and lay waste to ourselves and others. To be honest, smart comes out looking foolish. Foolish comes out looking smart. And we stagnate in an ever escalating clamor of contradiction. Simply because we care about knowing. Simply because we want to be the best or the worst. Never somewhere in between. Simply because of our ego. Because we think we are apart from others. Because we are discriminating thinkers. Around and around I go saying the same things again and again. Everything is nothing. Nothing is everything. I write because I know it's important. Even when I know that the only thing worth writing about is the stupidity of writing. So I write about the stupidity of writing. Because we are the only creatures capable of discrimination. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So. Before you give vent to your discriminations. I would just like to point out that if anybody is interested in this essay. Yes write down your email address give it to me and I will send you a copy of the script. which you can read at your leisure and re-read again and throw in the bin if you wish. Because you're discriminatory. So, our term for school is jail. You sit in jail every morning and you take them out in the evening so they don't kick the bucket. Some of them do. Now, the modern pedagogy is a complete farce. It's a sausage machine and it's designed to destroy your sense of creativity and independent thinking. Also, another point is, look at the family structure of a peasant family. You have the two parents and any number of children. It's not going to be a ridiculous number. The attention of those two parents is focused on their own children. They have the maternal interest to make sure that those children are raised properly and that they are always healthy and always happy and always creative and independent. Whereas in the classroom, you have one authoritarian telling the whole class of 20, 50, 100 children what to do, what to think, what to say. It's a gross imbalance. So, I'd say schools are an abomination. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All we can do is assist the, assist the role, the progression of nature coming out of the forests and re-inhabiting land. And we do that through, like I mentioned, Ingers, Acacia Dillbata, like what you and your friends do. You rehabilitate the land. You grow trees and allow nature to come back out of the forests into desecrated lands and regrow. Yeah. That's basically my opinion on that. Well, small scale natural farming can provide for itself. It can provide for the nutritional needs of the whole population of the world. Really, like I said, natural farming is rehabilitation. We don't have to discriminate between growing eucalyptus trees and expanding the eucalyptus forest or forest trees and tropical plants, growing them and growing crops. There's no difference. You can grow crops anywhere if you follow the natural balances. Talking about productivity, if you look up the organisation called La Via Campasina, which has got 250 million members, they're all peasant farmers and they can prove to you how peasant farmers produce 2,000 million of them, that's 2 billion, produce food for another 2 billion. So they're providing food for 4 billion people, where as the modern farmers are only producing food for 30%, the peasants of the world are producing food for 70% of the world, and most of that 30% that the chemical farmers are producing is produced for animals, not for humans. So if we get the facts right, industrial farming is a farce too, as far as feeding the world. Thank you. солнcee Cor origine It's at the root of the birds. My tongue They're expectant You're to love if there righteous there's some 50% Very very and SO I'm not as as as
