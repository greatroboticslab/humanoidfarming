Howto & Style
 Next time you're eating an apple and you slice it open, make sure to save the seed from it. You can take the seed, wet a paper towel, drop the seed on top, wrap it up, and place it in a plastic bag. Then toss it in the fridge. Apple seeds need to go through a cold period to sprout. The fridge will trick them into sprouting. Check on your seed and in a short time it will sprout. Check it out. Grab a cup, make sure there's some holes at the bottom, then fill it with soil. Drop on your seed root side down and cover it with soil. Then give it some water. Soon it will grow into a young tree. And before you know it, you'll be harvesting fresh apples.
