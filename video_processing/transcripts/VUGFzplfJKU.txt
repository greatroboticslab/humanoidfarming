AgroStar AgroStar is a blend of a social network, educational platform and e-commerce storefront. 5 million farmers in India uses its platform to chat with one another, access educational content to improve their farming methods, find innovative data tools to help monitor crops and shop for new products. The platform is multilingual, so all the farmers can read and watch educational agronomy content in their particular dialect and post pictures of crop problems to get advice from agro colleagues. The company has a commerce platform where it sells its own brand products like seeds and insecticides. It has also integrated voice recognition so that farmers with limited literacy can still search for and purchase products.
