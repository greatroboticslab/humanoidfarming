 My name is Kaitlyn Stoltis. I'm the Somerset County Dairy Princess. I grew up on this farm, Pennwood Farms, here in Berlin. The hardest part is probably all of the misconceptions about the dairy industry and the farming community. The one that I personally know most about is that ag isn't sustainable when actually it's very sustainable and we actually have a manure digester on our farm and this is one of the things that I like talking about when people ask me like what do you do to recycle on your farm? Well we take the methane from the cows and we turn it into energy and that runs the whole farm, the two houses on the property and at least 30 houses off the property. So what I have behind me is the manure digester that we have on my farm. There's about three in Somerset County and what happens is the all of the manure from the cows are pushed down to there's a little hole in the barn at the very end and that is scraped down and then it's pushed into the manure digester and then it is separated into solids liquids and gases and the gas is turned, the methane is turned into energy which runs the farm. The liquid goes into the big pit behind the digester and that is what we use to spread on the fields and then the solid is recycled into bedding.
