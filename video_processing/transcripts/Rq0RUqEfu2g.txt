Howto & Style
 When you're done with a plastic bottle, don't throw it out. Instead, what you want to do is poke a hole in the cap and put a Q-tip through it. Then grab a chopstick or any kind of stick and tape it to the bottle. This is what you want it to look like. Then fill the bottle with some water, close it, grab a plant, turn the bottle upside down and stick it into the soil. What you have right now is a homemade drip system that's going to keep watering your plants slowly while you're away for a few days. This is how I kept my pineapple alive while I was away for a week.
