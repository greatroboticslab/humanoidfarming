 Some farms grow wheat, corn or cotton. Others grow fruit or vegetables. All farms need special machines and farm equipment operators to control them. Many farm machines, including planters and tillers, are pulled or powered by tractors. Others, such as harvesters and combines, are self-contained. In general, the equipment tends to be rugged and relatively easy to run and repair. But even with air-conditioned operator cabs and built-in stereo sound, plowing or harvesting hundreds of acres of farmland can be tedious. Though work can also be dangerous, since the same machines that chop or cut crops can just as easily slice off a finger or a hand. Today, there are still family members who work the land of their forefathers. But many farm equipment operators are employed full-time by large agribusiness companies. Still others are independent business people who own harvesters and other equipment and contract their services directly to farmers.
