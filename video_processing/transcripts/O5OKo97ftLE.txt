 Get ready for the Dinosaur Omelette, the fabulous homesteading channel that puts your knowledge first with our hosts, Christopher and Angela. Join us each week where we invite the audience at home to enjoy an informational session on a multitude of topics pertaining to the duties of homesteading. Chickens, ducks, quail, feed and nutrition, and many other skills that come in handy on that homestead are all attended to on our weekly educational sessions. Be sure to ask a question down in the comments, we sure do love them. So stop on in to our weekly live broadcast here on YouTube and let's learn together.
