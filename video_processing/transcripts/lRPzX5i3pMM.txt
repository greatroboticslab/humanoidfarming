 Today we are headed to the exotic bird and small animal swap in Waverly, Iowa. These swaps usually have chickens and other small birds as well as a bunch of small farm animals such as goats, pigs, and mini horses. You will usually see a lot of interesting animals too though, like descended skunks. I did bring some money and we brought our homemade farm animal hauling box in case we find anything we can't live without. Let's see what we can find at this swap. Okay, we're finally here so we're gonna walk around and check everything out. I'm excited to see what they have here. We've never been to this exact swap before. So this exact swap has 53 acres of vendors and people trying to sell their animals and we saw some crazy things right away. Oh my gosh. There were skunks, but you can't tell me that they're not cute. So fat and cute. Will they pee on us? Will they pee on us? I don't think so. My mom was not very into them, but this is definitely a very interesting side hustle. Then I saw a pen of some Nigerian dwarf goats, which is the breed that I raised. Probably someone just making some cuts to their herd. They did all have horns though, and I'm not going to buy goats with horns. I have had so many goats almost kill themselves because of them. So I passed on those ones. Oh my gosh. It's so fluffy. I did notice right away that there are a bunch of bunnies here. I thought the fluffy one was so cute. The tiny little rooster noise. That rooster noise. I can't. It is so funny. Look at the little puppies. Hi. They are tiny. These little puppies were the first of many that we saw today. They were so friendly and excited. My brother Eli has been wanting quail for a while, and I actually thought the colors on these ones were really neat. There were a bunch of different varieties of chickens here today. I would not be able to tell you which is which. I'm not a chicken expert, but there were definitely a lot of ducks too. And we even saw a goose. It's a goose. He was so cute. I'm not exactly sure what someone would want a goose for. Maybe to protect their animals. But he had definitely taken some bites out of his price tag. This is what a majority of the seller's setups looked like. Very simple. And because all the stuff here was brand new, I knew it would probably be pretty expensive, but I still checked it out. They had a lot of nice stuff here. But the whole time I was looking in there, I got to hear this obnoxious sound. Oh my gosh. That's not annoying. Oh my goodness. Oh. Oh. Oh. The little baboon is so fluffy. Hi. Hi. Are you from me? They're a little shy. They're so cute. Yeah. There were some really pretty peacocks here. Just gorgeous. We had some a long time ago. There were also some people handing away free cats. I think because they had way too many. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. These people were selling a lot of really cool animals. So I took some time to look at these ones. Unfortunately, the goats they were selling are not Nigerian dwarves. So I am open to buying today, but only if I find the right thing. And it has to be some kind of investment that I can make more money out of later. So we'll see if anything comes along. I saw this adorable kitten. Looking back on this footage, I kind of wish I would have gotten her. She was the cutest thing ever. Every time I go to one of these things, I always find myself really wanting some bunnies. We don't have any experience with them, but I don't think they'll do much to benefit our farm. So my parents always say no. We saw some sheep in somebody's trunk. Doesn't look like that would be very fun to clean out. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. This was definitely a more exotic animal that they had here. A bearded dragon. Oh my gosh. What are those? Emus. Oh. Huh. So because this is an exotic bird and small animal swap, there are definitely some interesting and very pretty birds there. I saw these little bucklings and then I saw this big buck. I'm so glad that my buck does not have horns because those horns would get caught in everything. Hi. Hello. So over here I saw a ton of goats, probably around 30 or 40. They were all different breeds, ages, and genders. So you have no idea which breed and buck that these girls would be exposed to. It was pretty insane. I'm not interested in buying from here because I want registered goats. And I also don't want anything from a mixed herd like this. It was very cool to see though. Who knows how many goats they have at home. Then I saw this very pretty blue-eyed doe. She was registered and exposed to a registered buck. But they were asking $300 for her. I still kept her in mine though. Hello. Hi sweetie. Hello. I did see a milking stand for sale. I think it would be nice to have one of those. I don't have one yet. But I do think it would be really good for trimming hooves. These people here had just arrived and were setting up. And I wanted to see what they brought. And a couple of goats stepped out. The first one had really short ears. Which meant that it was a La Mancha or a La Mancha mix. The other one had normal ears. But I didn't know what breed it was. So I decided to pass on them. They're so cute. It's a corgi. They're one of my favorites. These corgis were so stinking cute. I have always loved corgis. I was so tempted to buy some. There were a bunch more bunnies over here. And they were so fluffy. The little fluffy one in the corner is so cute. It is really hot out today. So I hope that all the animals are staying nice and cool. Because I was definitely sweating. I saw a couple of barn kittens and some Kuni Kuni cross piglets. There were so many of them. And they were so little and cute. They were being sold for $40 each. Which I think is a pretty good price. I did see some more Nigerian dwarfs back here. Two out of the three had blue eyes. And they were black. And I just love that combination for some reason. There was only one that didn't have horns. But unfortunately they were not registered. We then saw some adorable Aussie mixes. And they were just too adorable. I had to pick one up. They were so cute. I saw some more goats over here. But they were not Nigerian dwarfs. Here's a bunch of goats. And then I was in heaven when I saw all of these goats. They were all Nigerian dwarfs. There were a bunch of does in here. And they were a pretty good price. And I did ask the lady about them. And unfortunately none of them are registered. But we also saw the cutest little pen of puppies over here. These ones are the same breed as our dog Tucker. And there's some little poodles here too. These are some Katahdin sheep or hair sheep. They shed all of their hair so that you don't need to shear them. These ones are gorgeous. I saw these stunning does. All of them were disbudded. But I was so sad when I figured out they weren't registered. It is really hard to hit my requirements I guess. Let's go there. Oh my. For the puppies. No. Mom look it. There's square� twelve. M packet eating. Why? That's okay. Look it how cute. They're brave and amazing. But I love talking. so these people were selling a ton of ducks these weren't even half of them and then my heart melted when i saw these little donkeys oh my goodness they are mini donkeys and the lady told us that they were jacks i thought they were so cute she was selling them for 1500 which is definitely out of my price range right now but i just fell in love with them they're so cute i know we also couldn't have something like that because we don't need them to breed america at her age oh no i saw this dog trying to jump out of its pen i hope it didn't escape mini philly pony and then i saw this cute little pony or mini horse not exactly sure because the board said mini pony which isn't actually a thing she was so cute they were asking 750 for her which i don't think is a very reasonable price because she definitely was not built very well she looked like she needed a lot of nutrition and handling you can see it a little bit better here but she doesn't appear to be in super great condition saw some chunky little cooney cooney pigs and then i saw the cutest little mini horse oh my gosh look at how pretty that mane is so he was a little gelding and unfortunately he had already sold for 2500 dollars which is a really good amount of money for a mini as we're going through these animals try and see which ones that you would buy if you were there i saw this huge buck and he smelled so bad you guys it was pretty gross then i saw some cute little pyrenees puppies they made me miss the ones that we had this spring they were so cute but when i pet this one i felt a lot of scabs on his head didn't seem to be in the best condition i hope they found a really good home and behind the corgis these little poodles might take the cutest puppies we saw today they were so cute these people were also selling some great pyrenees puppies this little puppy sleeping here is so precious i saw this nigerian dwarf doling and she was super sweet the lady was really trying to sell her to me but she wasn't registered i saw some more cooney cooney pigs and i think they are so cute and chunky we have some of these at home we saw a bunch of peahens and i saw another pen of nigerian dwarf goats but unfortunately there was only one buck left out of all of them the last thing we saw was this adorable mini horse she looked a lot like america in color she was just adorable so little and sweet they're asking 1500 for her and she had a little plate with her information written on it hi goats hi girls is there a kitten in here there is come on out how are the pigs doing hi hello okay so we did not end up buying anything which is totally okay i was definitely open to buying something but the right thing just didn't come along out of everything there i was pretty drawn to the mini horses and the goats the dogs want to say hi but there was only one registered goat there and i'm not gonna buy anything unregistered and the one registered one was a little bit out of my price range i wasn't about to pay 300 for a goat that i don't even need and the mini horses were mostly over a thousand dollars and they weren't really projects if i were to get something like that would be cheaper as a project and then i would resell it for more money to a good home but there wasn't anything there like that except the one little filly that definitely was not built right it was not in good condition and it was still pretty expensive it just wasn't a good fit but i might do something like that eventually we'll have to see what happens my mom was also really interested in getting some turkeys but we didn't end up getting any we don't really have a need for turkeys right now and when we did raise turkeys one year it didn't go bad they were just really stupid i don't know how else to say it they are not very intelligent creatures but it was still really fun to go there and see everything see our options i loved all the cute puppies that were there let me know down in the comments what your favorite animal was there and what you would have bought
