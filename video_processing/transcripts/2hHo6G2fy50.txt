Did you know that the U.S. trucking industry is the backbone of our economy? With over 3.5 million truck drivers, the open road is home to so many of you. But let's turn off the main highway for a second and head down the countryside. Farms, as it turns out, have a special place in the world of trucking. First stop, what exactly is a farm exemption? In simple terms, a farm exemption relieves certain commercial driving rules for agricultural purposes. That means, if you are driving for farming, you might not have to follow the same guidelines as, say, someone transporting electronics across state lines. For starters, many states in the U.S. offer exemptions for farm vehicles from certain commercial driver's license requirements. So if you are re-driving that truck for farming purposes within your state, you might not need that commercial license. Cool, right? But wait, there's more. Have you ever heard of the 150 air mile radius? Drivers transporting agricultural commodities or farm supplies for agricultural purposes within this radius don't have to maintain a record of duty status. Yes, you heard that right. It's awesome. Now, how big is this 150 air mile radius? Imagine the distance from Boston to New York City. That's roughly how far we are talking about. Here's another juicy tidbit. In the U.S., over 2 million farms dot the landscape, and a significant portion of these farms rely on the trucking industry to move their goods. That's a whole lot of potential for commercial drivers to enjoy these exemptions. But of course, with great exemptions come great responsibilities. Always remember to double check the specific guidelines in your state. Federal regulations might have their own set of rules. FMCSAregistration.com.
