 What's the difference between hay and straw? Despite the way that they're packaged, these round bales are hay and this is straw. Straw is a byproduct of the wheat growing process. You can see that all the wheat has been taken out of the head. So you're just left with the stalks and organic matter. In hay production, we're certain to leave the seeds on because that's where the nutrients is really stored. The rest is all just filler material for the cows. But the protein in the seeds is what we want when we're cutting hay.
