 So you want to know what makes a good seed starting mix. Healthy plants out in the garden come from strong starts and the soil that you use to start your seedlings can make all the difference. Your seedlings need a medium that is light, airy, fluffy, holds moisture well in order to give the seeds the perfect conditions that they need to germinate. And a professionally curated mixture of peat moss, perlite, fertilizer, and microorganisms can make all the difference. So give your seedlings what they need and the results will speak for themselves.
