 Y'all, phase two is about to be a reality. Hoping he will listen to me. Something else is broke, y'all. Drive shack. Now, the fun part. It's a big day. It's a big week. Totally giving us a show. Hey, buddy. All right, we're over at the site. Austin put this together for me today. It's a huge box. Again, I'm not good with, like, proportions or whatever, so it's really big. It's, like, 170. That's big. So, I got a lot of room. A lot of room to add more stuff. This is, like, the toy box. Just going to put stuff in. I got the pudgy pie makers in there and she's blowing up some little balls and stuff. I don't know. I think eventually maybe we'll have some kids here. Haven't had any yet. You might hear something. Y'all, phase two. It's about to be a reality. It's happening. We're getting there. Here we go. So, this week, he's going to work on tearing the other house down. I'm going out of town. Austin and I are going back down to the river for a couple days because I've got some things going on down there. The bulkhead's being worked on and I want to be down there for that. So, we got things going on everywhere. But, he's borrowing this from our friend Larry. Thank you, Larry. And this is an older one that he doesn't have to use on a regular, but he's not been using. Lawrence said it doesn't have any air conditioning, but it has new tracks. So, that's good. Oh, Lawrence did this. Oh, yeah. This is going to be our dumpster site. I know that's exciting, but he graded that out today. And he said, I spelled dumpster wrong. He put dumpster. He forgot the S. Anyway, so that's there. And he, um, he got this scraped a little bit better for coming around. So, anyway, wow. He's going to need to get some air protection because that thing is loud. It's squeaky. I really, really, really, really want him to keep this crape myrtle because it's beautiful. And I don't want it to come down, so I'm hoping, I'm hoping he will listen to me. Just a swingin'. This is funny. We're on our way home from town, and our first monthly renter is right here in front of us. We're going to follow him in. Yay! Just proof. There's just plenty of room to back into these spots, no matter how big the rig. Because this is another long one. Well, something else is broke, y'all. Driveshaft. He's got the driveshaft out something. Something. I can't remember what. Anyway. And Wesley, something's wrong with his ignition. Wouldn't cut off. And I know nobody is surprised to have so many vehicles. We're actually running out at this point because there's so many that are not working. To clarify, it's the center bearing on the driveshaft that went out. What type of does that went out? And Wesley's, did Wesley do anything on this truck? He got the ignition key to switch out. He got the ignition key to switch out. He got the ignition key to switch out. He got the ignition key to switch out. He got the ignition key to switch on it. He ordered one, waiting on it to get here. Hoping that, hoping that does the trick. He said the driveshaft on this truck was proving to be tricky. He said his other truck, it was super easy to drop and just fix really easy. But this one is stuck, I believe is what he said. Which is not surprising at all. Alright, our renter is moving in. Super nice guy. He's a contract worker. Working about 20 miles or so from here. So, yeah. I saw a little dog. A little gray dog of mine. A little blue dog. Over here digging the china. No need to yell. She can't hear me. Hey, you. Hey. Hey. What? What? Oh. Wait. What? What's the matter, Mom? Yeah. What? Oh, gosh. Did you do that one, too? Wow. That's really not good, actually. You thought it was, huh? Come on, bud. What'd you say? That's something that he didn't throw away, and now it's coming in handy someday. Mm-hmm. Now, the fun part, getting it back up on there. I said what we need is a Wesley. We need a Wesley. And, like you said, the truck could be a little higher. You couldn't have put the truck higher, could you? Yeah, I could have jacked it. Oh, jacked it up. So, this is really fine. It's getting there. Slowly and surely. Super fine working on travel. And bad back. And bad shoulders. But it does have good knees. Okay, well, I got on here. I did that. I jacked it up. Yeah. Oh, gosh. Hello, Duke. Do you need to be a part of this? We got here in time for the last load. The back gypsies are in front. Do what? Gypsies. Oh. I know. That would be nice. We got a little fishing boat. We'll get it down here this summer. And the last load. All the rock is in. Last load of fill. Go from one place. Rocking it to this place. Rocking it. Rocking it. You can really tell from here. So, what they did was... A rock had just like really deteriorated and... I mean... Washed away over the years. And, um... Storms. And so... I wasn't here yesterday to get to see it. All my aunt was. And she just said it was really neat to watch. But they... Took the excavator and... Got... Got... Um... I think they kind of pushed the rock out. And then they put this black felt stuff. Like... Really thick felt type material. And laid that down. And then pulled the rocks back over it. And they were able to pull up more than we realized it was there. And then brought in... Um... Four dump truck loads of granite. Which is gold. Disguised as granite. Anyway. And then had to bring in two loads of dirt to backfill the yard some. And still a little slope there. But we're just gonna... We're gonna see how this does. And I hope that it's good for... Several years. Hopefully. Hopefully. Hopefully. And our pier is... Needs repairing. Badly. The whole end is... Needing replacing. Which is... A lot. So we're gonna... See what we can do. If we can do it ourselves this summer. I don't know. Anyway. We do the best we can with what we have. Right? I just hung that. I love that. I love this little... I got this wind sock. We had it up last time. And I just love it so much. So I just came and put it there. Fish are jumping. It's beautiful. Some rain came through right before we got here. And now it's just like... It looks like a lake. For those of you that don't know, this is not a lake. And some of you might try to argue with me. But I promise you it's not. It's the Pamlico River. And over there. Turns into the Pamlico Sound. And then goes on out into... And to the Intracoastal Waterway. And due east is the Outer Banks, Ocracoke area. As the crow flies. As the fish swims. Anyway. My little piece of heaven on earth. The other piece of heaven on earth. Waterfront. If you're new here. I'll just go ahead and give you a little backstory. While I'm here. Talking about it. Because I haven't done this in a while. So it's very bright. I want you to really see me. But anyway. Our neighbor's beautiful red boat. So this is the Pamlico River. The town is Aurora, North Carolina. Little dot on the map. That is... If it's famous for anything. It's famous for the phosphate mine that's here. When I was growing up. It was Texas Gulf. Then it changed to PCS. And now it's... What is it? Nutrien. Nutrien Ag. Anyway. So phosphorus that's used in fertilizer. There's a lot of it down here. So they mine it here. Anyway. My granddad was a potato farmer here. My mom and her two sisters grew up here. Five miles from here was the farm. And then they spent their summers down here. What started as... I got the whole story last time I was here. My aunt was telling me they started in a tent. A little tent. With no power, electricity, water, anything. And then built a little shack. And then a little house. And then my parents got the house. My mom's two sisters live out of state. And so my parents got the house when they were... I don't know if they were in their 40s. I can't remember. And then we... You know, I lost my mom the year I graduated college. That was 2001. June 13th. Coming up on our anniversary. I'm actually going to be down here for the anniversary of her death. With my aunt. Which is really sweet. But anyway... So I lost her. And then... Several years later we lost our house down here to Hurricane Irene. It wiped out this entire area down here. I think it was like 25 or 27 homes that were lost. So we lost our home. We were not able to rebuild. We got no insurance money. It was really like insult to injury. We had to pay to get the house cleaned up. So anyway... That's a little back story. So this place is very, very, very special to me. I grew up down here. Summers down here. It was my mom's favorite place on earth. And I'm just... Very grateful to be able to have it. And try to preserve it. And this was a big step in that. Trying to preserve it. Because we were losing it. We were losing the land. So this was... It's a big day. It's a big week. To get this done. And to be down here. And to hopefully be working towards restoring it. And hopefully... Lord willing one day having some type of permanent structure here again for our family to enjoy. So... That's that story. Just taking Duke for a stroll. Or... He's taking me for a stroll. It's a beautiful morning. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Put on a show. Oh, there's some way out there. Oh, there's one. Oh, okay. I saw that one. Oh my gosh. Hey, Mr. Bear. Oh my gosh. I thought I was videoing and I wasn't. Oh my God. Mama. I got it. I got it now. We're just... This is amazing. He's just totally giving us a show. Hey, buddy. He's like, are you... Are you... Are you seeing me? I'm totally showing off for y'all. He's got his little mouth open. I mean, I'm saying he. I don't know. It's a great day. Oh my gosh. Look at that. He's not in a hurry. No, he's not. Wow. Look, he's totally... I can't... Oh my... Oh my... Oh my... That was better than the zoo. Where was he? He's right... Somebody's been very busy while we were gone. I'm gonna bust him up and build a roof. Oh, okay. I'll help them in. The block you're gonna put in the road? Yeah, I'm gonna put in the road and bust it up. House number two is gone, gone, gone. Look what he did. He just drove me around what's gonna be the drive. So that over there, he's already got the... The first site over here leveled. He's got the house gone. And the shed and everything. Gone. He's gonna bust up the concrete. Put it further to help with the road. A lot of dirt. He said it was a lot of dirt. A lot of dirt. Let's look. So these are all gonna... So that drive's gonna come... The other sites are over there. And the drive will come around here. That's a lot of drives. And then these three sites will be pulled through. And we're gonna try to save... Save that crepe myrtle. We'll see. He says he thinks he's gonna have to take it up. But then we'll put it right back in. We'll see, y'all. I'm a little worried about the crepe myrtle. But... That is what it is. He's built that up. And it, like, dishes down over there. But that's... That's the pad. Looks good, babe. Wow. It's been busy, busy, busy. But he makes short... Short work out of this kind of stuff. When he's got the equipment... That works. So you can't really tell when that slips off. So anyway, he built this up. And he got him a little level. A little level. Thingamajiggy. Move your hands on Tita. Like it's both foot sim. Sit it on top of the septic tank. Over there. On the other side of the septic tank. Yeah. Septic right there. Up there where the house was. So they'll all be tiered a little bit. Huh? They'll all be tiered a little bit. Yeah. That'll look cool. Great fall this way. Great fall to the tank. All I have to do is take one ditch coming down. Oh, I see what you're saying. For the sewer. Okay. Connect them two. Uh-huh. Come to this one. Then one to the... Oh, good. Right. Nothing... Nothing's got to run uphill. There ain't nothing going to run uphill. I know. Don't have to worry about it not being downhill. Yeah. Okay. Okay. We are home. If you haven't gotten that. We're back. We're back. We had a great trip. The girls did a lot of kayaking. Lots and lots of kayaking. And, um... We went a couple places. We went... Well, we went to Oriental, which is like a sailing village. We like going there and getting ice cream and just walking around. And, um... We did that yesterday. And, just did some projects. And, um... It was a good few days. It was a good productive few days. So, we're back at it now. So, today... We missed. We missed the fun. Uh... Wesley... I was about to say Austin. Wesley and Peyton and Lawrence worked the rest of the cows. Um... They used their horses. And... They worked them. And, evidently, the bull... Bebe. Y'all know Bebe. Bebe's been around forever. He did not want to go in the shoot. It's thundering all around. He did not want to go in. So, they had the, um... The horses... Between the horses and the mule. The electric mule. Not electric. The motorized mule. Um... They got him in there. But, Lawrence said he really didn't want to go. But, anyway. So, they got that done. So, that's done. Lawrence has got everything rolling over there. I think there's no reason we shouldn't be able to have those up and going in the next couple weeks. Um... Just checking things off, y'all. Just checking things off. Duke is the only dog I took with us. And, he did good. But, I know he's glad to be home. It's like, I just... I miss my buddies. I miss being able to run, run, run. Yes. Yes. So, that's good. Alright. Y'all hungry for supper? Where's your feed? Out here. Nope. Not that. Nope. Not that. Oh. Here's the buckets. Who's hungry? Who's hungry? You hungry? Yeah. We love our food. We love it so much. I looked at the radar and it's all... It's all... Around us. But, I don't think it's... I don't... I really don't think it's... It doesn't look like it was coming this way, but... From here it kind of does, but on the radar it didn't. He said we didn't have any rain while we were gone. Just a... A few sprinkles. So... I could really use a little bit. He's pretty much... We were just talking about the barley. He's just gonna call it a loss. Insurance is coming to look at it and see if we can get anything for it. He said he thinks we got enough corn from last year that we can feed the... The ones that we feed out. And then we might just have to buy some barley. Oh well. That's how she goes. Run Duke! Go buddy! Go! Cooked up in the truck all day. Four hours. Okay. I think the next thing on the agenda, since I think we're gonna miss the rain, is to mow this little weed jungle. So, let's do that deep. Let's mow. It's actually nice. It's not 100 degrees. It's a good time of day to do it. My lace cap hydrangeas are looking good. They didn't... They didn't do as good as they normally do. But, there was some overgrowth there. Some like volunteer plants that I cut. I think they were stealing. I think they were stealing. Some sunshine and... Sunshine and such. Sunshine and such. Sunshine. Such. Well, we got it done. But, she's smoking a little bit. She's smoking up in there a little bit. You see it? Yeah. I don't know. She's not on fire though. So, we're winning. Okay, y'all. I did the best I could. I have to get down. I have to get down on the... I have to get down on the ground. To, um... Clean under that thing. But, um... It's... It's a little tricky. If I did the best I could. I can't pick this one up. Like, I used to pick that one up. This one, no. Mm-mm. My back is definitely not made for this. Back, leg, arms. All legs, arms. All things. Anyway. I'm glad that's done. Oh, it's not my favorite time of day. Right before sunset. I love it. Sissy has still got to work on this. Yep. Maybe that can be a project this week. If they want to swim. Because I'm not doing it. I figure if they want it bad enough, they can do it. Um... Man, it was... Woo! We got some... We got some... I don't know what we got. We got some mowed grass. That's what we got. Hey, Duke. Uh... He's just all out of sorts. Because, um... Or because of Dixie, I guess. It's lovely, y'all. It's a lovely evening. Alright. I don't really know where we're at with this one. Because I went out of town. And I don't remember what I got before I went out of town. If I got anything. So, I might just be wrapping this one up here. And then we'll get back on track this week. And see what's... What's happening. Yeah. Um... Not really sure. But we'll find out together. Take care.
