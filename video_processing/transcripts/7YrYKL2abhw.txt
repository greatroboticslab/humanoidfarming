 You need a strong backbone behind you trying to change the face of what farming looks like. Front 40 does that for us. Hello and welcome to this edition of the State of Soy. I'm here today with Lucy and Levi Sheriff, farmers in Sheffield, Iowa and also conservation champions through the Iowa Front 40 program. Levi and Lucy, tell us a little bit about the Front 40 program and what it is. Well the Front 40 program for us is giving us a dedicated and confident source that we can turn to that we know is like-minded in the same efforts and endeavors that we are making today and for the future. Levi, talk about how as a conservation champion through the Front 40 you're getting benefits and being able to amplify your experiences as a conservation leader. So when you go against the grain of what everybody else is doing, generally you need a strong backbone behind you as an aid to help you with troubleshooting, with being brave just out there in the public, trying to change the face of what farming looks like and Front 40 does that for us. We can consult with other individuals and it gives us the bravery but not just that, the technical ability to be able to make those changes and what that will do for our operation and for just the general public in what we want things to be perceived as. That group of Front 40 champions are individuals who were selected due to their efforts in conservation and being leaders within their community. What practices are you guys currently implementing on your farm? Well we are moving away from ripping and turning the soil over just because that was the way grandpa did it. We are moving into a minimum till and a no-till in some cases and so we are moving more into vertical tillage, in-line ripping, sometimes if there is a plow pan to be taken care of, and then we are also reducing the amount of dry fertilizer by increasing the amount of fertilizer we use that is low salt. So it's a systems approach while not reducing our yield. These systems approaches I'm sure have shown a lot of benefits on your farm so far. Looking towards the future, are there practices that you're hoping to implement or benefits that you're hoping to see through your use of conservation? Because of the money that we've saved over the years in diesel fuel and in increasing the yields, we are able to move into irrigation. So now, you know, farmers have always complained about well we can't control mother nature. Well let's control what we can and we'll control the water to our crops. So we have introduced irrigation into the farm and will continue to introduce more irrigation across. And instead of front loading your fertilizer, we distribute and spoon feed that fertilizer throughout the crop year. Lucy, let's take a moment to touch on how you're trying to expand those practices by being a leader within your community. Levi touched on how Front 40 has given you a backbone to kind of be a leader within your community. What do you plan to do with that platform? Growing agriculture doesn't mean growing our ground because Iowa is great at producing corn, pork, poultry, but we're not producing any more ground. We're not producing any more farmland. So for me, growing Iowa future is showing and reminding our next generation farmer whether today they're 25 years old or they're 12 years old. It's showing them that there can be a future in agriculture for them. I was not a farm kid myself, but in our farming operation, I have found my place and I'm conserving, not our land, but I'm conserving the legacy of Iowa farming. You can't be afraid to think, well, nobody's doing this in my area. What are they going to say? You just have to be bold enough to step out of what you understand and what you know and say, I can do this. The Front 40 champions are about preserving the land and preserving the legacy of agriculture. Thank you to Levi and Lucy Scherr for joining us today. Reporting for this edition of the State of Soy, I'm Michaela Jordan. You know, everything starts with the land. We really respect farmers. There's nothing that we cannot help a client with. The brokerage, the management, the appraisal, and the investment are four pillars that really go so well together. We work with a lot of really great people working incredibly hard to provide for their families, their community, and the country.
