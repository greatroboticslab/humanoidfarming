 I needed a tillage tractor bad. I went and leased one and it was a fancy new John Deere. It was only a couple years old. Well, because of inflation and the shortage in the tractor market, I ran it all year, put a bunch of hours on it and made 20 grand on it. After running it for a year, I made 20 grand and I was just in the right place at the right time and tractor markets went up in value. I could have never planned that. So you sometimes like you're gonna have happy accidents. Like you can't plan on that happening because it shouldn't. I should have lost 50 grand on that deal. There's a lot of that people that have some success. There's a lot of that that happens. Like you just happen to be in the right place at the right time. Yup.
