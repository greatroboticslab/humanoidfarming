It's the finished product. Well, supposedly there's a trailer in here somewhere. I gotta find it. Oh. Yeah, I see the back of it. Oh my gosh. Let's see. This is my job. Stomp it down. Stomp it down there. Snakey, snakey. Here, snakey, snakey. I mean, leave snakey, snakey. If you're in here, please. Snake, snakey. I wonder how many ticks this will get me. Well, maybe in this tall grass it won't be bad. Yeah, right. They're so bad, y'all. They're so bad this year. Okay. See how this goes. Got it. Got it. Got it. Hello, Gustafur. It's sure enough feeling like summer today. I'm gonna tell you. I'm gonna tell you about it. It's hot. But, it's time. It's time. It's time for it to be hot. We're gonna take a few things. We got some projects to do. I'm gonna get the mower and take it over to the RV site. We're taking a swing. I'll show you that. And, I don't know. Gotta do a few things. Here we go. Wal, I havesama. And, we are gonna snow. We are gonna put these clothes on the house. It's damn dying which we knew it would but I don't know what plan B is it needs fescue mow our weed, woe our meat that's looking better all right we're gonna stain this pretty orange but I wanted it to kind of max the chair so hopefully it'll be all right bottoms up get it bottoms up try it out y'all try it out yeah y'all you can miss it on it it holds like what did I say it held swing till it breaks okay I love it it's fine good job it sits like a swing Lawrence put it together for me this morning I'm actually very impressed with it I think it's beautiful it's cedar it's like got polyurethane on it it came I mean he had to put it together uh Walmart it was a really good price I feel like a lot less than some others that were like straight and it's got the curved seat and everything it's so pretty thank you thank you both for your help okay we got a swing it's hard there's no true shade here except for the morning and then the sun goes there and then it sets over there so we're gonna try it right here we can always move it we got our table done definitely got to put the mower in there do not um do not love the color it's oh look at there and the wow and the screen on the screen here it looks really orange it looks oranger than orange I was trying to get something more red to match the chairs I failed I failed at that I'm actually very bad at picking any kind of paint color so um might end up just painting it a solid color here in a little while we'll see okay come on back next Lawrence is going over here into the horse pasture to bush hog he's been getting some good bush hogging done this week it has definitely dried up I will say that it has definitely dried up I think he's waiting I heard him say he's waiting for the rye to completely dry up before he does sees what he can get out of the barley so that's that's just kind of what it is I think we will try to work the rest of our cows and calves tomorrow getting that done and then um oh he's gotta go turn around and then I guess we gotta really think about uh getting the rest of the hay planted I'm assuming that'll be next get the hay planted we gotta get the hay planted maybe we'll drive down there tomorrow and see um that's what we should do or maybe tonight a little sunset cruise I don't know see how wet it is down there um yeah sorry my mind was going like a lot of places oh oh oh turn it tight that's a tight fit right there you got it you got it you're so good with that we gotta fix that fence folks I think every time I drive by it okay y'all I'm here with our trusty electric e-bike that we have come to love in a very short time in the last six weeks or so that we've had this it's our new best friend I came over to get it so I could run over to the barn and get something and I want to thank electric e-bikes for sponsoring today's video so if you missed the first time that I introduced this bike I want to tell you about it this is the x peak model and as you can tell it has some airy sturdy wide all-terrain tires that has made this just an amazing addition to our farm fleet I mean I'm adding it to adding it to the family this is the step three version with the bike rack here the suspension seat the headlight and the cool thing about these bikes is that they have over 75 unique accessories that you can add to make the bike your own to fit your own needs all right I just turned it on that's all you got to do we're gonna get out of the barn here and because I'm doing this one-handed I want to be want to be extra careful I prefer to stay at like one or two um but this thing will go it goes all the way up to five and it will go 28 miles per hour but I'm not that brave so like right now I'm pedaling you can pedal on your own if you want or you can just hit the little button here and cruise along without pedaling at all we took it with us um down to our camper at the Pamlico river a few weeks ago and the kids had a blast they actually followed over it a little bit well they didn't fight but they both wanted to use it at the same time a lot um I think one of the great things about it too so now I'm just cruising is that uh it's not only for us it's suitable for farm use it truly is like it'll go in the pastures the fields but it's also fun so you know anytime we can make farm chores fun I'm here for it another awesome thing about electric ebites is the battery life it'll go about 60 miles on one charge if you're ready to join over 500 000 happy riders you can go to the link in my description or click on the qr code on the screen use code meredith at checkout to get your free bike cover and and happy riding y'all well he made short order of that he just did this in like 15 minutes and on to the next one drug a little bit right
