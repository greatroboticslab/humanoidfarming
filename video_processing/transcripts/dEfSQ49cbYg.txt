 Bees love flowers. They're attracted by their bright colours and interesting smells. The bees land on the flower and use a long tongue called a proboscis to suck up a sweet liquid called nectar. As the bees feed on the nectar, their legs rub against the flower, covering them in pollen. The bees then carry that pollen to the next flower they're attracted to, and the pollen stuck to their legs rubs off onto that flower. This process is called pollination, and is how flowers produce seeds, which fall to the ground and make new flowers grow. When the bees have collected the nectar, they go back to their hive and do a waggle dance. This tells the other bees that they found lots of tasty nectar and how far their friends need to go to find it.
