 First thing, twist off the top. When you get your pineapple twist off the top, they come off super easy. This pineapple is going to sit upside down, and that's going to help all the sugars get through the whole pineapple. Ah! Sorry, my back is a little bit sore. So, next step, remove all the bottom leaves. We just kind of want to get about... I'm doing it a little faster than I normally would. I'm trying to get this video done in a minute. So, there we go. We removed the bottom. You'll see the little rootlets down here. That's what you want to see. Next, you can let this sit and cure for 24 hours, or you can plant this right away. I like to plant them right away, just because I'm not really that patient. So, I stick them in the ground, make a hole. Ah! Make a hole that you can see. Make a little hole, stick in the ground. That's it. Ah! We're going to water that from the top, and after a couple days, it's on its own. I don't do anything else.
