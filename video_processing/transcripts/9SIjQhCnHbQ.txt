Education
 One thing about raising cattle, with the cattle, they're as close to real-world life and death as far as nature that we do in production and agriculture. At least in my frame of reference, they're on pasture. And so that tends to help teach kids more about life and death and outside influences and even a business approach to it. I want that for my kids.
