 Oh my gosh guys, I was at the chicken coop and I just heard something over at the cats. I have to see what's going on. Hey kitties, everything okay? What's going on? Hey, what's going on? Oh, it must be inside the coop. Oh man, I hope everyone's okay. What is going on? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. This orange cat, Tony, has tried to get inside of the coop because he is a male and every single cat in here is a female. That crazy cat, Tony.
