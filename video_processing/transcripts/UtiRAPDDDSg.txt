Howto & Style
 I built this beautiful and durable raised bed for less than 50 bucks. Raised beds can be expensive, but they don't have to be. With a little ingenuity, I found that cedar fence pickets make a fantastic option for creating rot-resistant raised beds on a budget. For this two-foot by six-foot raised bed, I started off by making the corner braces to the depth of my raised bed with treated two-by-fours for added durability. None of the treated lumber physically touches the soil, and modern treated lumber is pressurized with copper rather than harmful chemicals. I attach the fence pickets to the corner braces with deck screws and add a center brace on the long sides for more support. I cut more pickets down for the short two-foot edges and finalize the design with a top ledge that's beautiful and perfect for sitting and working.
