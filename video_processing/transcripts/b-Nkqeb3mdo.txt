 Ever wonder how we decide what to grow each season? We check what thrives in our zone, what the soil needs, and what the season allows. Cool versus warm crops. We never grow the same thing in the same spot. It keeps the soil healthy and pests under control. We grow what our family, customers, or animals actually eat. No wasted space equals smarter farming. We track what thrived, what flopped, and adjust based on real results. Good planning equals strong harvests. Follow Rogue Farmstead to see what we're planting this season.
