Nonprofits & Activism
 Hi, my name is Wintinta Muvita. Earth University was like a stepping stone for me, and it will always be. It's like why I based my foundation in agricultural science. It's really helped me to also adapt to IITA, especially during the busy period. At IITA, they conduct research that focuses on breaching the production gap, climate impact, as well as trying to combat the inconsistencies in the seed systems. They mainly focus on cassava and soybean crops. I work closely with the scientists here. I go to fields and carry out demo plots for their trials at different stages, and they also empower young people through their youth agropreneurship program. I have the opportunity to actually work with these young people, not only teach them about growing crops, but also value addition of cassava, like the making of cassava chips, the making of soya cakes, and things like that. Looking at the different things that are happening around the world, especially with climate change, and specifically for Zambia, two years back, we experienced the phenomenon of the La Nina effect, and then now we're experiencing the La Nina effect. All these are phenomenons that are very impactful on our climate in Zambia. It is important to be part of such an organization, because I'm able to solve some of these problems, or help in a way to solve some of these problems that our farmers are going through. It has really been a great opportunity for me to actually scout through the agricultural industry and see where best I can put myself. I'm interested in quite a few areas in the future, hopefully to become a scientist either in nutrition, soil science, or wheat science. There are things that we have foregone in the agricultural sector, and I feel like being in research, that's the reason why I'm there, to actually bridge those gaps that we have there, and be able to make a difference in the future. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Take you.
