Howto & Style
 Hey guys, how's it going? This morning we are down at the Garden Center just to take a stroll around to see what is out here in July. We are facing a heat wave. We've got a hundred plus temperatures for the next 10 days, upwards of 111. And what does my mom do? What do you do? You bring in a brand new load of perennials for the heat wave. Well because you gotta, you know, people love to plant. They do. Yeah, I do. Like it's so cool this morning. It's like 72. You know that's... No, it's cooler than that. Right now? Yeah. I don't know. That's the one saving grace of living in high desert. Our heat is one dry heat. It's not humid. And then also it cools down at night like significantly. 40 degrees. 40 degrees. 45 degrees. And so it it takes a long time in the day to heat up. Like it doesn't get a hundred until about four. Right. And then it tips over a hundred and then about seven o'clock at night is when it starts cooling down again. That's what I always tell people is like, you know what? It takes all day long to get hot. So it's it's like a comfort. Yeah. Yeah. We just had to take a real quick break so mom could mark some hydrangeas to take home. Which we will show you in just a minute. Yeah. So we're just gonna walk through and you know where all the new stuff is. Pretty much, yeah. And then just show you the things that are still here and looking beautiful. Yes. And we do typically still plant even when it's hot. Maybe not at the clip we do in the spring. No. But the mornings are so beautiful. If you plant in the morning and do the steps that we tell you to do, things don't shock. Yeah. It's just a matter of keeping things consistently moist this time of year. And things are better off in the ground than in a nursery container any day of the year. So anyway, let's start right here at the front. So right now we're in the process of getting everything opened up. So all these carts are gonna come out here in a moment. We're early birds. Early birds. Yes. But you can see over here to the left the beautiful fountain. Isn't that gorgeous? The horse fountain. It makes such a beautiful noise in here. And do you remember mom what kind of wisteria this is? Because it seems like it blooms forever. It does. It repeats blooms. It's just a really nice aggressive. But look at this Laura. Look at this. Beautiful. Oh yeah. I mean look at that looks like a braided hair. It does. It's just and I you know this wouldn't be something that I would do now. But really? Well I mean I would make sure that this structure is way more. Well it probably was when you planted it. It was. But these 1x4s probably aren't what I would use. I'd be like 2x6s. It's a pretty large structure and I think there's what two. There's a trunk here. There was only one. And it needed itself. Oh my. And yeah. And then there's like a huge. I think that's. This is like the mother trunk. That's the original. My word. But it is really pretty. It creates such a beautiful feel over here. I guess we should just go through the shade house. Yeah. Since we're here. I'll show you when we come to what I had to have. The hydrant is. Yeah. Boston Ivy right here which you guys there used to be a big pond. I don't know if we have any pictures of it. You know what? I think we have a video from way back. Oh really? When I put on the waders and I got in to maintain like there was a rock in the center or something. There was an island. An island with a wood. Well it was a piece of petrified wood. Okay. Anyway I think we have video from that showing the pond that was here. And this Boston Ivy was crawling around behind the waterfall portion. It is so pretty and such a vibrant red color in the fall. I want some of this somewhere. Well I do have. I do have it. It's climbing up our locust tree by the kitchen but that'll go when the locust goes. Look at how pretty these leaves are though. They're huge. Huge leaves. And glossy. That's what I love because when it gets so dry and hot in the summer this still looks so fresh. Well and you know what? This only gets watered because we water plants that are by it. So it suppresses its growth probably. It does and also it can tolerate some drought because it gets really hot south sun. Uh huh. Which you wouldn't think to put it in the south. No. But it does stay moist but only because it's you know getting watered by these. Yeah. So right here this usually ends up being well it was full. Full full full in the spring. And it usually ends up being like just kind of a nice spot if you've got something that really needs a lot of shade. But most everything needs a little bit more sun. Well and also this is where we store like pottery and things in the winter so that people can still come out and shop. It's covered. It's covered all the way. Yeah. So the snow and things. This stays free of that. Do you know what? Did you guys put this up or was it originally? We did. You did. We did. And what year do you remember? Like 1970? No no no. It was 19 like 85. Okay. Yeah. Right after I was born. Yeah. Oh. The structure is about as old as I am. And it's still prime. It is. It is prime. It is prime. It's at peak right now. It's at the peak. Yeah. Yeah. Um and this was really full last week but we had a sale. Yeah. And it we had benches everywhere and all over. I remember that. Yeah. And yeah it cleared out a bunch of stuff. You know I'm gonna run to the front of the shade house and let's walk this way. I think lighting wise. Yeah. Uh oh on our way we can take a look at these hostas. Well this is some of the new stuff. Honeybell's hosta. Oh. Oh there's Monica's. Hey. We're looking at these pretty hostas. Are they pretty? 20 by 24. These are pretty. There's also some Patriot hostas that have the nice variegation there but look at this one. This is the loyalist hosta right there. Ooh and Hakana Kloa just the all green Japanese forest grass. It's a beautiful grass. Okay. There's also some beautiful Japanese maple. This is a blood good right here. There is a what is this a viridus. Viridus. Isn't that pretty? Yes. And bamboo. Is this a type that's invasive or does it stay? No. These are all clumping. Uh-huh. Yeah. So they don't run. They're not supposed to. Uh-huh. And you know we've sold them for years and I've never had anybody come in and say thanks a lot. I've got bamboo in my neighbor's yard. It reminds me of the tiger eye zoom act. You know what? Maybe if it didn't have such a lot of freedom it wouldn't do that. Maybe. But you know what? I have to say we've got such great staff. I mean look how healthy and pretty these are. Everything's spaced nicely. Yes. It looks very tidy and beautiful. I'm so pleased with how things are kept. It's not me doing all this. It's a lot of them. We both have to have good teams. Yes. That's for sure. Good teams. I just love this maple right here. I know we looked at this. I think this was here last time. These bigger ones are a little bit usually a little slower to go out because they're you know. Well they're expensive. And expensive. Yeah. And also people don't want to handle them. Right. Like they're worried about the investment. Yeah. And kind of get a shock. Yeah. I also like these Laura. Look at this. That texture. That is a feeling blue. That is beautiful. Deodora cedar. That's gorgeous. Isn't it pretty? Look at all the new growth. Yeah. Look at this. Laura this would be really pretty by your pond. Oh it really would be. But it is a deodor. What zone is it? Well I think it's a zone six. Or seven. Six. Six? Yep. Six to nine. We did have one deodor. The upright one. Yeah. It's survived by the pond. Really? Yeah. Okay now I have to say that doesn't look like it's going to get very tall does it? No. But it says that it'll get four to five feet tall. Oh. Oh look at the Brennera. Isn't that pretty? And ferns. This is called looking glass. Yes. So it's got like I mean it just looks silver. Yeah. It's so beautiful. Ladies mantle did you just get that in? We just got it. Oh okay. I add that to my list. Oh I like this one too. Is that a firelight? That is a oh gosh Laura you're so good. It is a firelight. Is it? Yes. Oh it's so pretty. Look at that. Isn't it pretty? I love that kind of open bloom panicle. It looks more sparkly. It does. Somehow. Yeah it does. So pretty. Oh but then you have these. Those are gorgeous. They have red tags on them. I wonder why. Let's take a look. So we just spotted these through the slats in the shade house and mom was like oh I've got to have these for the new area right where we planted the SK. SK. Right where we planted the birch tree. So along right along the walkway there on the deck. Yeah. And those get four to five I think. Yes. This is going to be great by our deck. Three to five? It says two and a half to three feet tall. Oh. Three to four wide. Oh. Is that tall enough for that spot? Maybe not. But you got another good spot for those. I do. Yeah. I've got lots of good spots. Those are so pretty. There's a third one there. Yeah. Oh another firelight right there. Now I love those. Yeah. What do you think about those? Well how big do those get? What's the difference? Well let's see here. Because if those get a little bigger they might. Yeah they might be better. Now this one will get three to five tall and wide. See that's about the right scale I would think. So you've got one. There's two. If there's three. We're on a scout. Come on. Yeah one more. You know mom you could always just put two in and put a third one in later. Do you have one in your stash? I might. It'll be smaller than those though. Let's see. Well if we look at the vines while we're over here there's a whole bunch of beautiful things. Climbing hydrangeas. Yes. Yes. The star showers Virginia creeper which is not invasive in our area so nobody would freak out. Somebody bought two of these yesterday and then they bought two ever blooming repeat blooming clematis to grow up in them. Oh pretty. And I said it'll it'll go perfect. It'll just look like these are in bloom. Right. You won't really notice the clematis foliage. Right. But the blooms will be all over. Yeah. How pretty will that be? And around this side are there's some purple fountain beach. Oh look. Uh-huh. Aren't they beautiful? Oh I don't even want to try to pronounce that name. Yeah they do that too. There we go. They do that. Oh this is a beaut too. Look at that. Oh I love that right. Yeah. I love that. That's an Arabella. Arabella. Now we can say that. Yeah. Kind of. Two tries. You know I love these downturned facing. Yeah. Once Pamela Jackman. I think those are so pretty. Oh there's another one. They look like little ballerinas. Yeah. Oh Prince Philip. That's a pretty one. Oh we got a steak that needs some correction. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that pretty? Yeah. That is super pretty. Yeah. It's pretty. Oop. So is this one. This is a star of India. Oh look at that. Yeah. Isn't that pretty? Oh ho. Yeah. It's got like magenta. Yeah. That picture's pretty good on what it is. Yeah. It is. You know and I tell people too that their flowers might be a certain different color because of their soil pH. Yeah. That's true. I'm not just hydrangeas are affected by that. You know how you can grow things sometimes they turn pink. Yeah. In in your past garden. Yeah. And they would be like coral in mine. Yeah. They'd be coral in yours and like fuchsia in mine. Yeah. It was weird. Yeah. So it's not always that they were miss marked. It could be your soil. Yeah. Ooh. You guys look. Barbara Dibley. That's so pretty. That's awesome. I don't see another firelight mom. No I know it. What do you think? I'm gonna get those though. Yeah. I think they're so pretty. That is a pretty Japanese maple right there. Yes it is. And what about this one? That's a beauty. Ooh. What is this? So pretty. Sumika. Tamukiyama. Yeah. I got one of these this spring. Isn't that beautiful? What is this one? A Tamukiyama. Oh yeah. I am a sucker for my Burnhams. Oh that's a pretty one. Yeah. But look at these. Look at these. I like this thick leathery leaf. But it looks kind of like soft. Almost like a lamb's ear. What's it? What are these called? Mojave or something? Or Mohican? Mohican? Let's see. Oh here's a tag. Oh geez. Yeah. Mohican. Mohican. Yeah. These look um more almost not furry but kind of. I know. Yeah. But I love that texture. Mm-hmm. That is a beauty. That is really. But I love my Burnhams. Yeah. Love them. Oh this is a little quick fire mom. Not a firelight. I need. Yes. I need a couple of those. Okay. Let's head toward the pink. Flower carpet roses. Oh mom. Is that them? We walked. We were right here. Yeah. Yeah. These are little quick fires right here. Okay. Okay. Then I'm gonna have to switch my tags. Yeah. Let's do that quick. Okay. Okay. Well mom grabs the tags. I'm gonna run in here. See they've kind of cleared this out a little bit. Still some of those ivy topiaries we made earlier on. But it gets pretty hot in here in the afternoon. So kind of just like gradually move things out of here and then move things back in here for fall. But this has been such a really fun little greenhouse to have out here. And they've got some pots planted up with pretty. This is the same. I think a combination of flowers that my mom put downtown. Which is the Supertunia persimmon. Supertunia really red. And Supertunia honey back in there. It's a real warm mix. Look at this magnolia right here. This is a Leonard Nestle magnolia. It's really pretty. I like the growth habit of these. Oh we're just gonna keep on going here for a minute. There are some Russian sage right here. I think several different varieties. There's the Caspian blue. Which is a smaller growing one. It's traditional Russian sage. Grows three to four feet tall. Crazy blue which is 14 to 18 inches. These are the sesky dwarf gold birch right here. There's some more coral berries right in there or snow berries. And then there are still some David Austin roses. Far fewer than there were to begin with but they are looking really good. And they always put the little placards in the front so you can see what kinds are still here. I love this one. Oh that's so pretty. That's such a pretty color. All of the David Austin's. Yeah. I don't think there's one that I don't like and I'm not even like a huge like fuchsia pink or But I love them all. Yeah. They are so pretty. Yeah. In the old day you have seen any of the color you<|he|> you have. Oh look at Haine Oh yeah. I love중 affect the history blue and obviously they are built in this size of your different colors. Maybe there are so many different roses and I love them all. I don't think there's one that I don't like and I'm not even like a huge like fuchsia pink or but I love them all. Yeah they are so pretty. And they all just seem to marry well and I just love it. Did you get your hydrangeas marked? Okay good. I'm seeing some dianthus over here and some penstemon. It's kind of a smattering of perennials and there are umbrellas up in strategic locations to keep things a little bit cooler in their plans. And clean our customers. Yes. Purplicious Veronica right in here. The dark towers penstemon. Oh I like the white flower carpets with the smoke bush. Isn't that pretty? That's a really is that like a grace or what is this? This is. Yes it is. It's a grace smoke tree. Yep. They've got more of a gray tone which I really like. I think I might need to have one of these. Yeah. 15 by 15. I've got the traditional like the royal purple or whatever but isn't that a pretty texture. That's so pretty. It's silvery. Yeah. Yeah. And looks kind of soft in a way. It does. But it looks beautiful with the white. Yeah. I want to see which David Austen's are right here. Princess Anne. There's a little bit of color. Ooh look. Well they're starting to do their second round of bloom. See all the buds? Oh yeah. Yeah they're getting ready to go for it again. Do you uh have any Vanessa Bells? I don't think so. You need to have some at home. You would love them. Well you know what? There's three of them here. Mm-hmm. You would love them. I've got three too. Wouldn't it be fun to plant these by those? Yes. Hydrangeas? Mm-hmm. Can I tell dad? Yeah. Killing me. Yep. He's a good sport though. Yes he is. He likes it. He loves it. Yeah. He loves plants just as much as you and I. Yeah he does. But he's just funny. He likes to throw fit. Now this is an emerald spire crab apple. I like the size of the crabs. Do you know what I like? How columnar it is. Yeah it's very columnar. You could tuck that in almost anywhere. Yes you could. We're queens tucking things in. Ooh look at the echinacea. Whoa. Look at tables of it. Oh my my my. Oh look at these. Sunny days. They're just kind of starting. Just opening up. Ooh look at this. Ooh rainbow marcella. Isn't that pretty? Yeah I wish that one was open. Yeah. There's the caramia. I love yellow. I love yellow. Yeah. And Kim's knee high right here. But we have prima ruby. I can tell it's you Monica by your walk. Oh really? Yeah I'm like here comes Monica. I can hear it. Oh can I have a drink? I'm on my way to water in the back. Oh nice. Whenever I have to come out here and help water they always let me go back there. Because I know in the morning I'm cranky and I want coffee. Just tuck Monica in the back. You just put me in the back. Nice. We like to water though. Yeah we do. It's relaxing. Oh look at that. Oh that's the molyneux. Isn't that a beauty? That is gorgeous. I have this in shrub form but not tree form. Oh my gosh. It's so pretty. You know what's so fun when we do this? I notice things differently. Yeah. I buy all this. Right. And display a lot of it. Right. And yet I'm like ooh that's a pretty one. That's a dandy. I love it. Ooh there's some sedum over here. Ooh and some a hibiscus a blue one. That's a Chateau of Versailles. Isn't that so pretty? You know what these remind me of? I know they're just like a hen and chicks but they look like little rosettes. Yeah they do. You know and I think they're a cute texture. They really are pretty. I've been tucking some in around our pond. One? Some. What? Just one. Like a whole bunch. Have you not noticed? I do notice there is this cute little mugo pine that you have. She makes endless fun of me for planting a mugo pine in my garden. But there's just one. Well it's going to get four feet wide. Is it? Seriously? Yes. Well it's like for a couple of years it's looked like this. Look at all these sedums. There's the coral carpet. I think you're so funny. I am kind of pretty funny. The green ice. There's mountain dew ice plant. Erin needs a pot full of those. Does he? Oh. Does he like ice plant? No he likes mountain dew. Oh. Diet mountain dew. I was going to say I didn't know he liked. I like this one though. The blue elf. Isn't that pretty? I've always loved that one. So pretty. It is gorgeous. Mint julep junipers. Those make great topiaries actually. You wouldn't know it from the growth habit it's taken on right now. It looks like a bad hair day. It does but I kind of love that. It looks a little bit like coastal-ish for some reason. I don't know. It does. A whole bunch of beautiful roses over here. And these are more like floribundas right? Yes. I'll have to say we're pretty low on roses. All the tables every one of the tables that have perennials they were full of roses. Right. And then they were empty and looking sad. So I thought oh I better get another load in here. Yeah it's gonna be 111 but no big deal. We had no sad tables. No. Should be here. Okay we've got a whole bunch of monarda. Yeah. There's the sugar buzz cherry pops. That's cranberry lace bee. Ooh fireball. Pink lace. Yeah. Dwarf marshals. My goodness there's a whole bunch. Yeah. This is balmy pink. This is balmy purple. Ooh let me see the balmy purple. Oh that's pretty. There's the grand. Oh I like this one. The grand mom bee balm. Yeah. That looks like it has a massive. Yeah. Isn't that a pretty texture? Soft almost shaggy appearance mid to late summer. Da da da. Powder resistant to powdery mildew. Tolerates moist soil. Yeah. Yeah that's a really pretty one. I think that's the one thing that people struggle with with monarda is powdery mildew. Yeah. So you need to get varieties that are more resistant. It doesn't mean they won't get it. Right. But it probably means that they can fight it. But put it in full sun. Yes. Make sure there's airflow around it. Yes. And then get resistant varieties. Yes. Yes. And then if you do have a problem there's some really good like organic fungicides. If you you know go that route which that's usually what we do. And you just put them on like a preventative measure. Sure. Don't let them get it. Right. Yeah. Because then you want to enjoy it. The plant. Yeah. And we just have it like in a little pump-up sprayer and you can do it like spray them once a week. Mm-hmm. For like three weeks. Right. And it kills pretty much all the spores and yeah. Yeah. It's not big deal. Not bad. Mm-mm. Oh my goodness. The pumpkin patch rose. I was looking at this. I have bought six orange roses in the past couple of weeks. Uh-huh. But I was looking at the pumpkin patch. It's so pretty. I wish it was in bloom right now. In more full bloom. But it's just yeah. Yeah. So gorgeous. Look at this one. Isn't this cute with its little. Oh yeah. Yeah. The flame maple. Yes. But it's it's kind of a multi-branch. Uh-huh. And I just think it's cute. I love the texture of it. Now that one has these little helicopters or samaras right. They um are bright pink in the spring. Yeah. And I like them. Uh-huh. You know I like them because it looks like it's in bloom in the spring. Yeah. And then it looks like it's got something going on. I don't know. I think they're cute. Oh we got a salvia table. Oh look. What? Oh. If any of you need tiger eye sumacs we got you. We got you covered. Look at these beautiful plants. Maybe you should run a special. You know what Laura? Wouldn't that be wonderful in a pot? Buy one get one free? Oh. You know I think it'd be wonderful. I've been thinking about planting some of these in our pasture. Oh dad would lose his mind. He probably would. Yeah. Yeah. But you know where it's a little bit drier? You know you see these up in like in in the mountains. Yeah. They're like in the little valleys. Yeah. And they're so pretty. They are. Yep. So they can grow with just rainfall. Moving on. I'm a little bitter about that right now. Okay we've got the sun rose. Ben Nevis. Nevis. Some orange. And there's some asters right here. I like this one. Look at that. Professor Kippenberg. It's 12 to 16 tall. Two feet wide. Zone three. Also tolerates moist soil. And some beautiful salvia right in here. I've always liked the caradonna. It's got really slender spires that are deep purple. Oh a whole bunch more iris. And you know what? Iris are really pretty just the texture after they're blooming. Yeah. They kind of look like a cattel. Yes they do. Okay this is one of my favorite trees. Cobblestone. You keep mentioning that. That's what you should put in the corner. Look at the bark. This is what it looks like. It's got the most gorgeous bark. They call it a cobblestone oak because of the way it looks. Yes. But this can take harsh conditions. It's a zone three. And we sell these to people up going north of us that live on a ranch. And it's harsh. It's up by Midvale. Yeah. And it is just the most wonderful tree up there. They buy one after the other. It'd be pretty pressed leaves too. You should put one of these in the pasture. I need to because I just love this tree. Yeah. You keep saying that. Yeah. It'd be better than a sumac. I gotta say. I could put sumacs under this. Fall color is yellow. Yeah. Really pretty. Yeah. Over in this area. See this one has been cleared up just because of the heat. Look at this. Oh the golden rain tree. This is like the one over our brick patio you guys. Yeah. So you can see it gets these little lanterns on it. But doesn't that look almost like when it's blooming it looks like a yellow wisteria. Yes it does. Yeah. 30 by 30. Yep. Zone five. Ours is a multi trunk. This is a single but boy. We really like ours. I mean even though yes for a moment it drops the yellow and then yes it drops the lanterns. But it provides so much interest in our garden. Yeah. That we wouldn't trade it for anything else. Well you know and gardening is messy. Yeah. There's there's less messy trees than others. But most every tree. I know there's some folks that want just a tree that doesn't drop leaf doesn't drop anything. Yeah. Including leaves. And I said then you need a silk plant. And they want it to bloom all year round. All year round. Yeah. Some of it blooms all year round and isn't messy. And I'm like it just doesn't exist. No. Not to get really interesting unique things anyway. Yeah. Okay so over here in the corner. Oh there's some daylilies. This is a pretty one. Look at that. Isn't that gorgeous? That is called daring deception. Oh. I don't know about that. That is a beautiful color. Isn't that a gorgeous color? There's a red one right there. And then in this corner usually the corners and the back areas kind of get the empty things first. Yeah because we move things forward. Right. But I don't like empty tables. Well you could move it out. I could. But they're propping up all those nice armoviders. It's true. They're a good tree rack. Yeah. Now look at this. Oh dogwoods. Are these the yellow? Arctic fire yellow? Isn't that pretty? Yes. Yes. You know they say that their blooms are insignificant. I beg to differ. Isn't that pretty? Yeah. I think they're so pretty. Look at this. Not everybody puts burlap on the top. What's that for? But it keeps the sun off of the soil. Oh. And some an employee here decided to do that. And it's been really nice. Oh. The June snow. I have one of these. Yeah. I love their growth habit. They kind of do like that outward kind of base thing. Yeah. Layering. They kind of do a layering thing. I love ours. I just noticed that there's burlap on the soil. Yep. I see that. And I thought you know what? They're thinking. Is this an aronia? This is. This is a low scape. Oh a low scape hedger aronia. I like the glossy leaves. I do too. And the berries. Yeah. They get blueberries on them. I don't think people realize. You know they just look at them. And they think it's just a green shrub. But they do interesting things. Yeah. Okay. You want to know what I noticed standing right here? What? This is what I see. I see the rose hip. Oh. And you do not get as awesome of rose hips on any other rose. But on like the rugoses. Yes. Orange. This is an alba. Yeah. And it grows medium bushy. So what do you think? Four to five feet or so? Yeah. But they create these massive orange to red rose hips. Yeah. And it's got a neat look. I also like the like crinkly. Yeah. And they have seven leaves. Rugoses usually have seven leaves. Instead of five. Instead of five. Nice. Well it's really pretty. I could see the sun glinting off of that rose hip right down there. Just caught your eye. Yeah it did. Pick some tea. Yes. Yes. Okay. So I saw some more perennials right over here. Yep. Of course there's a little gazebo. And there's some more roses. These are usually hybrid teas right in there. But on this table there's more salvia. These are smaller things. Well some smaller things. Now these are things that we can't find from any other growers. So we buy them like in these trays and we cut them apart. Artemisia. Yeah. This is a sun fern. Oh. Blood Brothers Panicum. That's cool. This is his favorite. You know this is his favorite. It is. He loves heliopsis. He needs to try a bit of honey. Well this one is sunstruck. Sunstruck. Dad's order. It's his plants. These are his plants. Always look spindly and sad. You know what? And this is mom's plants. Like robust and gloomy. Yeah. That's so true. Yeah. He has fun. But he yeah he's so proud of his plants. Oh he is. These are pretty. The blue clips companion. And he always says you've got to have some of this. Yeah. Well you know what? I bought some last year. He had Blackhawk. Well this is Blood Brothers. Yeah. I planted some of the Blackhawk around our pond and I love it. Well he's right. Yeah. I mean these are wonderful. And my heliopsis I love that we have. But I would never. We're not growers. So we don't buy things like this. Right. Yeah. There's some Fama. White and Fama deep blue pink cushion flowers which in my mind are the two best pink cushion flowers pretty much. Do you want to know something that you can get? I just picked these up. They were like this. Yeah. Cats get in this cat mitt at night. Oh they never. Yeah. And then they just have a heyday with it. Yeah. They mess up our cat mitt every night. I see some Gaara. Let's take a look. Oh. This is a Gaara called So White. There's White Evolution. What else? There's Whirling Butterflies. This is a Pink Cloud. Pink Cloud. This is all Pink Fountain. Pink Fountain. So each one of them will grow a little bit different. Like this one gets 30 inches tall. 24 to 30 inches wide. So pretty. There's one in bloom. Whew. Okay. Swinging around to this table right here. Oh I love the foliage on this burnet. And I don't think I've ever grown it. Isn't that pretty? Yeah. It looks like one of those sensitive plants kind of. Oh it does actually. Like it would close up. I wonder if it's in the same family. I don't know but this is called Red Thunder Burnet. Yeah. I need to try some of that. So beautiful. There's some Hardy Geranium. Oh. Ooh. Lots of Geraniums. Oh yes. Well they do well here. People love them. Lawrence Flatman Geranium. Ah. Look at that. Lawrence Flatman. Yeah. Six inches tall. Twelve inches wide. Drought tolerant. Longer repeat blooming. Might have to try some of the Flatman. I love the foliage on this one. This is black and white. That is so pretty. Yeah. There's Tiny Monster. The Johnson's Blue is a really good one always. Yeah. I just love those. Yeah. I do too. Oh. Okay. There's just so much you guys. There's another table of Echinacea right here. Ooh. There's a real pretty pink one. Look at this. Isn't that a beauty? Yeah. The Sunny Days Ruby. Is this one of the ones Monica got? She bought three of those. Yes it is. But I love this one. But you know we like this color. This Prima Ginger. Yeah. And of course it's just starting to open. But it's so pretty. And a whole bunch of Redbeckia here. Yeah. There's a little Goldstrum. Or a little Gold Star rather. Yeah. And Goldsturm glitters like gold. Black Eyed Susan. Oh hey. Where's it? Hey. We were just taking a look at your plants that you ordered. Which ones? The Heliopsis and the Tannicum. Arnecia. In the little. In the little. Oh yeah. Where's that? Oh. They're over there. They're looking good. They're looking great. Prime. The Heliopsis are just fabulous. They are. We just said how much you like those. They behave. They flower all summer long. Gee. Christmas. I can't go wrong with it. That's why I like to buy those plugs. Yeah. Yeah. Unusual varieties. Get stuff that we can't get through our normal towns. Well that's true. Yeah. That's true. Yep. Lots of pretty Echinacea and Geraniums and all kinds of pretty things. I'm going to have a cart full when I leave. I am too. And Monica had to have some raspberry ones. These right here. Yeah. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. She likes those. Yeah. They're really pretty. We're just looking at the Coreopsis here. What's variety is this? The Bengal Tiger. Mm-hmm. So red and yellow. Mm-hmm. Ooh. That's pretty. Star cluster. Isn't that pretty? I like this foliage better. I do too than this. Yeah. This looks a little more dryish. Yeah. This looks. I like the boldness. You know this is also called tick seed. And do you have any of these? CITF? Yeah. It's a variety called on this. Little Henry or something? Well, it's. This is Crystallina. Crystallina. Sugartina. Sugartina. I have had those before. And? I did not have super great luck. Do they need to have. They need shade. You know, and I don't even remember. It could have been a user error issue. They look really good here. Because it's good afternoon shade. Uh-huh. Morning scent. Yeah. But look at this. Laura, look at this. Yeah, that's really pretty. They've got a really nice scent, don't they? Well, I don't know. No? No? Oh, okay. Of course I have allergies, so I can't smell much right now. I'm plugged up. Yeah. Those do look really nice. Yeah. But I was distracted by this right here. Look at this Campanula. Isn't that? It's like boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. Up to the top. Isn't that so pretty? Yeah. Freya. That's really pretty. I like that a lot. Now, if we had a third one here, it could go home. You could have two. It's true. I know. That's a little tough. The lemon zest. Yeah. Yours have more color than mine right now. Mine are in their lull. Are they? Yeah. Well, and these get a lot of shade. Yeah. They look really pretty. I just, I like the delicate. They look a little bit more delicate. Uh-huh. Little sprays of yellow flowers. Yeah. But aren't they pretty? Like, all through here. They're just beautiful. Well, especially with the purple. Yes. It's a good mix. Yeah. Got some lavender here, some head coat, and some white French. And these are the poet's wife. Yeah. Do you know I took two of those home to start our new landscape around our new patio? And they probably doubled in size. Really? And they're just blooming their heads off. They love it. Yeah. That's always a nice, a nice thing to have happen. I know. There's a lot of pretty evergreens. And I'm kind of focused in on some of those. Look at the eastern white pines right here. They just look so delicate. Aren't they something? They are something. You just want to pet them. You do, because they're not pokey at all. And I don't think I've ever seen one customer not go like this. When they come up, they go like that. Yeah. They're just like, oh, yeah. Do you see them do that to these? No. Well, I see them go like this. Like, they know they're pokey. Yeah. But they always grab these. Yeah. Here's a chicken coop that I built many years ago. Well, the guys just kind of re-bolstered. Had to bolster it. It was listing to the right. But, you know, it's still a little bit listing, but they've got it girded up. And what we're going to do. Ooh. Yeah. Could use a little more, maybe. Well, they've got it, though. Maybe some poles. It's not going to fall. Okay, good. But what we're going to do here is we're going to put a little picket fence around. And we're going to make a little Mr. McGregor garden. Oh, nice. So that the chickens have a little run down below. It's a four-by-four thing. There's a run with a little ladder that goes up into their house. Yeah. And they love it. Yeah. We usually do two chickens in here, and that's it. Like banny chickens. Banny chickens. Yeah. And people, little kids love it. Yeah. But we have it kind of like in the front here blocked because there's no chickens in here. And so. People would be like, where's your. Where is it? Yeah. Spent a lot of time looking. Ooh, there's a whole table of lavender over here and a beautiful puffy eastern white pine. That texture. I mean. See? You want to just do this. I know. I want to do that. Yeah. Oh. Okay. Look at this table right here. There's Levant's English lavender. Big time blue. Premier. Oh, this is gross blue. Betty's blue. This is Mila Intrigue. Grosso. Super blue. Purple bouquet. More gross blue. Hidko pink. Provence. Fred Bouton. Bouton? Bouton? Bouton? I think it's Bouton. Fred Bouton. Bouton. I don't know. I don't know either. And then sentivia blue. Well, you've got a selection. Yeah. It just came in. Yeah. But look at this. Does this look like a hummingbird should just come over while there's a bee? Yep. Isn't that pretty? Yes. These are Princess Anne. Oh, I love those. I need to figure out a swatch for this. Isn't that a beautiful color? Yes. There's enough like apricot in there or something. Look at that one. Yeah. Look at how big that bloom is. And don't you find like these roses often, David, well, a lot of roses, but David Austen's in particular, they change colors dramatically. Yeah. From bud to open blossom. Yeah. So it looks like they're always doing something interesting. Yeah, they do. I just came down and bought some of these Montbrunos for the pots flanking the benches in the Fortier Garden. I love. This is my favorite boxwood. I think that we have like, how many do you think we have? A lot. And they stay three by three is their max size. They've got a really slender leaf. They keep their color really well during the wintertime. And you know what? I've never lost one to winter kill. Not ever. When we had snowmageddon and it was piled this high with ice and snow and they were way down there just buried. When it thawed, I thought I probably lost all of them. Not one. Wow. They were all just like tucked in there. Yeah. You know, just happy as can be. In the greenhouse here, there's some herbs. There's some of the galaxy, right? Galaxy. Snow. Magnolia. Magnolia. These are Blanchard. Yeah. I love them. So these are the evergreen magnolias. Yep. This is the ballerina. I like ballerinas pretty. But there's some ivy and herbs. You know, right now it's a little bit less. They're a little bit less sought after. Well, look at this tub of raspberries. Whoa. These are heritage. Yep. And there's berries on them. I bet you kids are loving that when they come through. Yes. Tarragon, fennel, oregano, mint. So the greenhouse is pretty low right now. Look at this. Yeah, that's pretty. That's the blue suede juice, Sylvia. It is. With the same mix as downtown. So persimmon, really red, and honey like we looked at before up front. Aren't they so pretty? Yeah. It's very vibrant and punchy. You know what it looks like to me? It looks like melon. Yeah? Like melon or a sunset. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. But I love this combination. It's really pretty. Okay, moving toward the back. And you know, all throughout, and we don't really look at it when we're up front because there's so many little pretty things, there are trees just everywhere. Different kinds all over. Still some fruit trees on the racks back there. Some beautiful maples. Yep. All kinds of things. Are those plain trees? Yeah. Oh. Aren't they pretty? Yes. They look so good. You'll see that there's saucers under them. Yep. Keep them happy and moist. Yeah. In the heat, we saucer things. Some beautiful nine barks. I know that sounds crazy, but when it's 111 degrees, they need to have more time to drink. Right. And then we water twice a day. The second watering, even if it's still kind of wet, we cool them down with some water. Yep. I don't think we're going to go through every single tree rack here because we still want to go inside because there's some beautiful houseplants. But we'll just swing through here really. I have to show you the grass. Oh, that's pretty. Is that a dyskantia? Isn't that beautiful? This is Northern Lights, tufted hair. Oh, yep. Now, doesn't that look sparkly? Yes, it does. You should have some of this by your pond. Yeah. Yes. Isn't it just so like... That is so pretty. Maybe I'll grab those. What does this? Like if there's a bug, like an insect. What? That kind of... Is it a firefly? Firefly? Or there's something. Or there's those little optic grass. That's what it looks like. We're good at the words. We're good at describing things. Yeah, we are. It's our talent and our skill. Yeah. These are pretty. The Pure Energy Golden Fountain Grass. There's Indian Steel Grass. Oh, my goodness. It is bright. It's getting bright back here. I have to show you these, though. Oh, those are pretty. This is the Lavender Chiffon. Oh. So you've got the beautiful double. They're just starting to bloom. Gorgeous. You know what I love about Rosa Sharon is... I think Rosa Sharon and some of the Caryopterus, it's when things are tired and they're just like, oh, it's too hot. These things say, oh, I love the heat. Right. Bring it on. Oh, here's some more Dad's grasses. They're going to pot these up. They're going to put them up in a bigger can. Gotcha. Yeah. So that's why they're back here. They're going to repot them. But that's pretty, isn't it? That's the one I planted by the pond. Isn't that pretty? There's so much red in it, and I love it. Yeah. That's pretty. Yeah. If you come in here looking for grasses, look for those. They're so nice. And back here, there's birches, poplar, lindens, crab apples, oak, honey locust. What else? There's service berry and zelkovas, coffee trees. What am I missing? Mom dogwoods, purple rain. Yeah. Or purple robe locust. Yeah. A lot of crab apples. Different kinds of crab apples. Ooh, mom and I both have casserole trees, the red fox, in our gardens. Mm-hmm. And they're so awesome. Yes, they are. And I know in the nursery, you're kind of looking at them like, well, I don't know. When they get out and established. Yeah. Oh, they're so pretty. They're beautiful. There's a twisty. Is this twisty baby? That is. Twisty baby locust. Yeah. Look at the way the trunk grows. Yep. Kind of. Oh, and there's plum trees back here, ornamental plums. That looks like it should go in Africa. It does. Yep. Is this a giant service berry right here? It is. Ooh. Now that's pretty. This looks like it's half grown. It does look half grown. This is an autumn brilliance. Oh, that's a beauty. And boy, it will be brilliant in the autumn. Yeah. There's a lot of pretty things. More shrubs. A lot of sprinter boxwoods. There's some ninebarks back in here. Pines. There's a weeping crab right here. Louisa, probably. I love the Louisa. Yep. Yep. Blue and this pink and has these beautiful little crab apples. I always want to call them berries. Yeah. Well, they kind of look like berries. They do. Oh, there's some fruit trees that are starting to get. Oh, look at this. This is a Stanley prune right here. I wonder if some of these are ripe. Oh, that's a pluary. Oh. Sweet treat. They're getting a little bit soft. A little bit soft. Yeah, that's going to be a sweet treat. Nectarines? Yeah. Yes. Or nec de plum. Nec de plum. Have an early break and go have some toast. Serious? I'm so hungry. I didn't need breakfast. Monica's not a morning person. And then back here in the stumpery. Now, this bench is really neat. The kids think we should have this somewhere. I think it's pretty. Yeah. Have you sat in it? Yes. It looks and feels very ergonomic or whatever. It's contoured. Yeah, it's contoured. So you have like, it's up underneath your knees. It's so comfortable. It is. It's really pretty. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I always think that people should have places to go sit in their garden. Yeah. Even if you're going to like break your back for two or three hours, you've got to have a place to come and just sit. Yeah. Come sit. This isn't an apple espalier right here. Mm-hmm. Look at the apples on it. That is really pretty. Yeah. A Norway spruce. Now, isn't that a nice one? Yeah. I just noticed the size of it and I'm looking for a third to make a trio. My camera just shut off. So I think we were right here when it did. Anyway, Arctic Fire Dogwood's in here looking amazing. Mom, where'd you go? Oh, I'm over here. Oh. This is pretty. What kind of viburnum is this? Is it a Wentworth or is it a? I love, love the leaves on this one. Yeah, it's a Wentworth. Yeah. Oh, and then you can see the berries forming up here. Yeah. I can't remember what size these get. If these 12 by 7. So like a small tree. But there again, it's the viburnums. Yeah. I just love them. Beautiful fall color on these two. Yeah. Usually a really deep red. Yeah. Around here, more Wentworth viburnums. You can make yourself a hedge. Yes. Ooh, is this a blueberry muffin? Looks like it. Yeah. Or blue muffin, rather. Blue muffin. Yep. And these are beautiful. I have mine out in full sun. Do you? Full sun. And it's doing great. I think that sometimes when they're in cans above ground and they get so hot, they do better just with a little bit of shade. Oh, yeah. For sure. For sure. I was surprised because I always thought viburnums couldn't handle full sun here. Yeah. So when we tossed it out in the south garden, I thought, oh, we'll see. This is going to be an experiment. But it's been a good one so far. Look at this cool stump. Oh, that is a cool stump. I thought it looked like a crown. Yeah, it does. And I thought somebody needs to have like a place to sit. And then they can have their hands on the... Very queenly. I know. I know. When I saw that, though, that just looked so much like a crown. Yeah, that's cool. And that's a petrified wood. Oh. That was one of the pieces that was in the old pond. Okay. Right here. Yes. There's several pieces of petrified wood out here. Look at this neat stump. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. That's really cool. Yeah. Okay. So I think we've made it through pretty much the whole nursery at this point. Look at this. Right? Oh. Oh, that's pretty. What kind is that? Wow. This is just an eastern white pine. Eastern white pine. You know, all of them are just straight field run, you know what I mean? And they can vary wildly. They vary, but isn't that a beautiful color? Colorado spruce are the same way. They can be icy blue to like a deep green. Yes, that's right. The Colorado blues can be not blue, but green. We could spend forever going variety by variety, but I think we should head in just so we could take a quick spin around the store and show you some of the new things. They've been getting in some really fun gift things. Oh, I like that bench. Yeah. Isn't that pretty? Yeah, that is really pretty. So it's the same as that. I can tell. Yeah. Only in bench form. And it's a rocker. Okay. Let's beeline for the door. Otherwise, we're going to keep getting distracted. We're going in, but look. I know. SK. SK. All right. Right away. The ferns. Oh, the ferns. Aren't those pretty? Yes. And you guys, I don't know what variety this is, but I already bought two of these. Yeah. Did you get any ideas? I didn't take one yet, but I'm going to. Do you know what kind that is? Well. Are these labeled with variety? Sometimes they are and sometimes they aren't. You know what? There's not a label on that. They're just so magnificent. Yes, they are. And the prices are so good. They're really good. Like, okay. So for this huge fern, $10. Like, what? I know. It's awesome. They had the best prices and we could have probably priced them more, but I thought, oh, man. Yeah. Let's keep them low. But, yeah. Pretty corner, though. Isn't that pretty? Yeah. There's a lot of pretty things in all the plants. Oh, look at these little lit globes with flowers and dragonflies. Yeah, aren't those sweet? So you just recently got in a load with, like, these little sweet birds. Also, you were showing me over here. Sorry. I'm going to try to not swing the camera super fast, guys. Sorry if I get excited. Look at these coasters. Yeah. Those are so pretty. I think they're just beautiful. Yeah. Monica loves those. Yeah, she does. And we are a coaster family. We are. If anybody sets a glass down on our wood, we're like, would you like a coaster? Yeah. But we don't require shoes off. No. Or a shoes in the house family, but a coaster. You must have a coaster. You must have a coaster. Yes. Well, you know, floors, I think, are easier to clean than a marred piece of wood. These are just so pretty. Aren't they gorgeous? Look at this. Like, the huge. Yeah. There we go. Yeah. God. But there's just, like, really cute little. And these, of course, they have a magnet you can actually put in. Oh, sure. But they have a hole in the back. So you can rest that in there. But for us, for ease, we just keep it on the outside. And there's a timer, so it goes off for only a certain amount of time. There's a bumblebee right up here. Yeah. All lit. This is pretty. Aren't those fun? Mm-hmm. And just, you know, you could do those seasonally just so easy. And the little lit churches. Mm-hmm. And I love the trays. I love these copper and, like, verdigree kind of looking. Yeah. They're really pretty. Oh, see. Look at the size of that. Yes. But, okay. This is our gnome. These are gnome stakes that you put out in your yard. Oh, yes, they are. Oh, my goodness. Yeah. But aren't they funny? Yeah, there's just all kinds of things. Yeah, look at this. This tree of life bench. Oh, yeah. Isn't that something else? Some pretty spider plants variegated. Lots of spider plants. They seem to be in demand these days. In demand right now. Yeah. Yeah, I was talking to a checker at the grocery store. Yeah. And she was like, when are you going to get more of those? You know, because she said she was having a hard time finding them. The spider plants? Yeah. And so, yeah. Yeah. Well, we've got all sizes. Yeah, I see some little ones. Two inch, four inch. Right there. Yeah, a six inch. Look at this wall. Look at these. Full of fun things. I love those baskets. Those are so handy for eggs. I love those too. Berries. Berries. They're lined. So they're awesome. Solar glass toadstools. Oh, those are cool. I think so. Mm-hmm. I like the colors here. I do too. It's very peaceful looking. It's that periwinkle color blue that I love that color. These are rain gauges. Gnome rain gauges. Nice. Here's the main entrance. So a little compost. Ode to compost right here. And some little tumblers and things. These look really good. Look at that. Aren't they beautiful? Yes. And these fettle leaves are really healthy. Yeah, those are really pretty. Gorgeous. Putting on new growth. Mm-hmm. And those ferns are gorgeous too. Look at that. Aren't they different? Yeah. Is that a fern? It is. Blue star fern. Ooh. And they are blue. They are. They're really pretty. Yeah. I just like the menagerie. You know, like this is really pretty. I think I got one of these. Yeah. Two. Yeah, that's a beauty. The flamingos. Yeah, the flamingos are really fun. Okay, and I'm going to cruise toward the back here in a second. There's some fun plants right in here. A lot of violets in the back. Yeah. Lots of violets just low. Yeah. Okay, so you started clearing this wall because you're going to paint it, right? I'm going to paint it. And I'll surprise you with the color. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, so this is, we did have a lot of red pottering things just last night. So as of this morning, Dana's been busy getting the red area. And it looks so good. I can't wait for you to see it. She's just cherry picking stuff off here, redistributing it. And then I'll clear it out and I'll paint it. Nice. A surprise color. Oh, look at these. There's some begonias that are beautiful. Look at this. Look at the variegation on them. Yes, isn't that pretty? Yeah. That is really nice. And more ferns. Yep. Oh, I love these wooden bowls. They look like antique dough bowls. They do. They do. I just love them. I like all of these. These are neat. Yeah. Yeah. So to make a really straight line, a roll, you know, I think a lot of folks don't know what this is, but you just take this out and you string it along. Well, you take this out and you, you know. String it along and then you can get a straight roll in your garden. And my dad used to have one of these. I think I still might have his. Oh, really? He used it every single time we planted. Wow. So. Maybe I should. Mine are willy-nilly. Most people's are. Yeah. We eyeball it. Yeah. We eyeball it. Yeah. But if you're a very much of a type A person, which I like that look for sure. I do too. Yeah. Okay. Into the main part of the back sunroom here. Look at these. Look at these ferns. Isn't that gorgeous? Yes. Oh. Just give a kind of overall view here. So much back here. So much stuff. Oh my goodness. So I like these. Is that the white butterfly? Um, let's see here if that one's got a name. Golden. Golden. Arrowhead. But I like the whole arrowhead family. I don't think there's one of them that I don't like. But I really like them just, just, um, trimmed up. Yes. Not trailing. Right. Because these want to trail. Right. They look nice. Yeah. Now, so look at this one. Ooh, that's a pretty one. Isn't that a pretty one? Yeah. I think I like them because they're so full. Yes. This one is Robusta. That's really pretty. And it certainly is. Yes. Oh, that's beautiful. My goodness. Yeah. Yeah. There's just everything you can think of. Look at this plant. Little pitty pitty peperomias. Yeah, isn't that cute? Look at these little two inch. But they're big. Yes. This is a ficus, an umbrella ficus. Ooh, that's pretty. Yeah. Mm-hmm. It almost looks hibiscus. Ooh, I like this one. With the red. Yeah. Ooh, and I like this one too. I like these fiddleheads. Oh, yeah. Look at that. And these are plant stakes. And you've got every size you need. Oh, yeah. And you can just, they're meant to be plant stakes. More artistic. Yeah. A delphinium. Instead of like this kind of thing. Yeah. These very practical stakes. Yes. There's pretty stakes. Yeah, those are really neat. Yeah. I think they're beautiful. Okay, moving this way. I spent a lot of time looking over here the other day. There are some absolutely gorgeous little begonias. Look at these. They are so cute and so full and healthy looking. My word. And same with these ferns. Yeah. If you want to do a terrarium. Oh. Little two inchers. How did I miss these? Look at that. Isn't that gorgeous? Whoa. A little black begonia. It looks like an escargot-esque. It does. Woo. That is so pretty. Look at this one. I think these are pretty. Oh, those are pretty. Yeah. And, you know, sometimes people would think the slugs have been after that. Yeah. But it's meant to look like that. Yeah. They're supposed to look like that. Whoa. Whoa. Look at the color. Isn't that a pretty color? Yes. Wouldn't that be a really pretty combination with that blue fern? Yeah. And this. Mm-hmm. And this. That would make a really good mixed planter. Yeah, it would be very pretty. What is this variety? This is a philodendron, a statum, silver sword. It's nice if you can actually find the name of what they are. Yes. I always appreciate that. We have a really neat lady that works, her name Brittany, and she's so into houseplants. Mm-hmm. And she'll just say, oh, yeah, that's a such and such one. Yeah. Oh, really? That's like her realm. Yeah. Uh-huh. She knows the exact variety. Yeah. So she's the one that'll come in here and write the names of them. Nice. Yeah. And look at all the African violets. Aren't they just gorgeous? Yes, I picked up six new ones. You did? Yes. Yeah. Yes, I did. There's just something about violets. I love stuff that looks like that. Yes. Little violet that's like this. And then the little ruffly pink. Yeah. So cute. Love this one. Oh. Yeah. Oh, isn't that a pretty one? Yeah. It's beautiful. Yeah. And there's just a ton of succulents in here. We rarely go, you know, plant by plant. But there are some pepperonias, too. Some of this in here, this gets really hot this time of year. So we keep primarily all of this kind of thing out here. Yeah. And the more leafy things in here. More tender things. Because it can taste. Even though this is the right kind of glass, it still gets hot. Look at all the cacti. These are little Mickey Mouse's. Yeah. They love it in here. They're like, hello. Yep. These look like they're waving like little fingers. Watermelon, pepperonias. Yeah. The pepperonias love it out here. That's a beauty. Yeah. Look at the color on these. Yeah. And silver. So many varieties. Yeah. My goodness. Yep. And I think these are pretty. Mm-hmm. This is a ficus. This is Audrey. Audrey ficus. Miss Audrey. Yep. These look good. That's really pretty. Oh, and then there's some of the whale fin sansevierias. Aren't those interesting? Yeah. They are intense. They totally look like a whale fin. Yep. That's a great name for them. Tadaskantia. Yeah. Oh, yeah. See, look at this. Look at that color. Yes, isn't that gorgeous. That plum color. Look at this. This is a solar light pumpkin. Oh, that is neat. Wouldn't that look really fun outside just a cluster of them? Yes. We had a lot of them. I think this might be the last one. The only one left? Yeah, this was full of them. Oh, look at this. This is a monstera, Stanleyana cobra. And it looks like, look at that. Look at that. Yeah, it's going for it. Yes. Really cool. And here is a wall of fun things. Pots and wood mushrooms over there. I love this pottery. All of them are different. Uh-huh. Isn't that pretty? Yeah, that is super pretty. And I like the ones that have the green. Mm-hmm. But it's just, I don't know. Oh, the birds are loving us. It's morning. Yeah. They love it. Look at the mushroom. Look at that mushroom. I love the peperomia in bloom right there. Yeah. Look at how giant these leaves are. Yeah, those are gorgeous. Look at these mushrooms. They're wooden. Yeah, that's really cool. Pop those in. Yeah. A little whimsical. I love these pots. I was just looking at them the other day. Yeah. How long have you had these? Um, not very long. I was going to say because I haven't noticed them. Yeah. But I love, they have saucers. They have a square saucer. Yeah. I mean, that is what should be with every pot. Every pot should have a saucer. You should have the option to buy a matching saucer. Exactly. We've got some nice orchid pots. Orchid pots, yeah. And bonsai pots. Oh, look at these. A little itty-bitty. Ooh, golden moss. Variegated. I love that golden moss. Yeah, that is super pretty. It's so spongy looking. Oh, look at these variegated albino lineata ferns right here. And for the last little bit back here, this is pretty dark back in this area. There's not a lot of natural light. So it's a lot of containers, terracotta, all the terracotta selection back in here. Oh, we fly through the terracotta. The glazed saucers, which are the best right here. Yeah. And then we just call this the pot wall. It is the pot wall. Yeah. There's a bunch of pots. And I like the big vases with the- With the netting. With the netting. That's wire netting. Yeah, those are really pretty. And some random things as well. Well, you know what? I love that. It's just like a pot for whatever color theme, whatever size you need. The gray clay right here. Yeah, the gray clay. That gray and white clay has been a real big thing. And the white has become- Yeah, very kind of clean. More popular. Yeah. Yeah. Very fun. Lots of owls. Mm-hmm. And these are little bird feeders. Oh, very fun. Nice, bright pop. Well, yes. I think our birds would probably wipe that out in two seconds flat. Yeah. Mm-hmm. There are so many of them. And you guys, I think that is going to be it for our walk around this morning. Just wanted to give you state of affairs at the garden center in the middle of summer during a heat wave. Yes. This is what it looks like. We didn't miss anything, did we? We probably did. There's just so much to see. And it's just so fun. I love it when we go places where it's still full and it looks alive and full of activity in the middle of summer. Well, there's a lot of folks that still love to garden year-round. It doesn't matter. They're okay. Yep. They can tolerate the heat. We're two of those such people. Yeah, we are. So anyway, thank you guys so much for watching. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you saw some things that just made you feel excited and inspired to get out and garden and do it in the early morning. It's still comfortable. Well, till like noon. Yep. You're fine. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, here anyway. Yeah. Anyway, see you guys in the next video. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
