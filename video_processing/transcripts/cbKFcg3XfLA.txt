 My name is Chad Hutzbeth, founder of EndlessFoodSystems.com. I'm super excited to introduce to you today our desktop aquaponic system. Not only is it a beautiful little fountain that grows food, but it's a self-cleaning fish tank using one of the most powerful techniques of growing that we know of in the world, aquaponics. Aquaponics is the combination of fish and plants together. This is a true aquaponics system. It's not hydroponics. There's no chemicals that you have to add to the system, and you don't have to change the water out. It's completely natural and organic. These are perfect for a window, or you could put a grow bulb on them if you'd rather. You can grow any kind of leafy green herbs. It could be a complete herb garden if you like. What I have in here, I have some stevia, parsley. This is cinnamon basil, and it smells really pretty too. Back here we've got some lemon basil. It tastes really good. You can just put a leaf in your water and create like a lemon water with it. These desktop units are available in black and white, and you can combine them together to get a cool effect. You can grow betta fish or goldfish. It really doesn't matter what kind of fish you put in there. We're just using their waste to power the plants. These little desktop units are going to be a huge hit. They're super easy to maintain. They're attractive. You can put one in your kitchen and get fresh basil anytime you want. Grow with us today and visit us at EndlessFoodSystems.com really don't have the best during the day.
