Howto & Style
 Today I want to show you how I mix up my homemade chicken feed so your chickens will lay lots of eggs. Let's go! Welcome to Becky's Homestead. What you feed your chickens is very important because when they're in the first year of life they usually lay pretty good no matter what you feed them. Like if you're a greenie you'll be like oh they're going good but it's after that you'll be like scratching your head like what's going on they're not laying eggs anymore and the key is in the nutrition you're feeding them. So I have chickens that are five years old still laying eggs regularly. So that is the key that you have to feed them really good food and I'm here to tell you this works. Okay I'm going to show you step by step too. Black oiled sunflower seeds. I get the big bag. It's awesome. They're very small. People might be like well how can they swallow them? Let me just show up close just so people can see this. These aren't as big as the other sunflower seeds. Black ones are smaller and very skinny but they have a lot of oil in them. So that's fat for the birds which is very good for them. Okay so that's that. The next thing is whole corn. I get a lot of questions about the whole corn. It's funny how that's very confusing to people. I think they're confused if it's people corn or animal corn. First I want to say this. When they plant corn in like the Midwest Illinois you know Indiana all those states there's two different kinds of corn they plant. There are animal corn and then there's human corn. You wouldn't want to eat animal corn if you just saw corn on a cob. You just picked it out of the field and you ate it. It's different. It's not as sweet. It's not as good. So just so people know there's two different kinds of corn that the farmers plant and then harvest and then sell. So this I'm talking about animal corn of course when I'm talking about feeding my animals. And yes it looks the same. It just says corn on the cob. It grows the same and all that. Okay so people ask can their chickens swallow this? They easily swallow it. I've raised little chicks and when they're little like the size of a grapefruit they're already swallowing this. They just gulp it down and mama shows them what to eat and they just gulp it down. So if you buy your chickens from a feed store or like a big name brand tractor supply or whatever just start offering a few like this. You know you don't have to dump a whole dump in there and go and you know you're going to dump a corn on a corn. So if you're not eating it give them a chance. Just let them you know look at these for a while and then they'll start eating them. Especially when they get older and they start laying eggs they will need the nutrition and they'll be looking for the corn. Then you can increase it. Okay the next thing is premium cleaned oats. And these I'm going to show a handful of these. Now it's not doesn't look like oatmeal. There's lots of different kinds of oats and you could probably do it. But this is what I buy just because it's economical and it serves the purpose just fine. It's just not rolled. It's not doesn't look like oatmeal. It's just that's what oats look like when they're just unprocessed. They're skinny. Again the chickens love this. This will kind of grow grass. It's oat grass too. If there's just some on the ground it'll start sprouting up and he'll be like oh it's growing into oat grass. Which is awesome because then they eat that and it's really good for them. The next thing is for animal protein I add this especially in the winter when there's not bugs. Okay and it's just puppy food. So it could be lamb. You know some of them have buffalo in there. There's different kinds. You can just whatever kind has meat as the number one ingredient. Diatomaceous earth. You have to keep your chickens dewormed if you want them to like lay a lot of eggs and not get sickly. Worms make them sickly, weak. It just they're in there eating up their food, their body, laying eggs. Those little worms crawl all over the larvae through their body. It's really gross if you do a lot of research about worms. So you want to keep them dewormed and you'll just have healthier poofy beautiful chickens. And I use the diatomaceous earth and I'll show you how I put it in the tub. Last but not least is the oyster shells. Which is you know you could call that grit. It's crushed oyster shells. They have to have that because the way a chicken digests their food is they have this gizzard. And then this rocks end up in the gizzard and that's like a muscle. And it grinds the food up. That's how it does it. And then it moves on through the digestive system and then they extract the food and the nutrients and so on and so forth. I'm going to show you how I mix it up in the tub. I use this garbage can. This garbage can works perfect. And I love to take a black sharpie and I just write chicken on there which I also write pig and duck because they all eat the same thing. And the reason I do this is in case somebody is pet sitting for me or a family member runs out. It's just so easy you know. Just so you know that. And then I use this can. I don't know the size of this can but anyway I don't know. I think like kidney beans came in here or something like that. And I have 13 birds. And I say birds because I have Bubby who's a guinea. So I feed this twice a day. Morning and night. That's how much they get. 13 birds. So I'm going to show you how I mix it up in the tub now. I always start with the oats as the base. That's just the base of the whole mixture. And then Scott's going to hold the camera so you can see how many I put in there. Just to give you an idea. It doesn't have to be perfect. You can just get an idea and then you can just mix it up at home. Alright I just want to let you see how high the you know little garbage can is. And then how many oats are in there. And I'd say that's probably about 6 or 7 inches of oats for the base start. Alright next is corn. You put a little bit less corn because corn is very heavy. I guess you could say. Okay. So that's probably. Because you don't want to waste any of the food. You want to give them all the nutrients they need. But you don't want to waste it. Next I'm going to do the sunflower seeds. Whoa. That went fast. And if you make a mistake like that it's fine. Alright next is going to be the diatomaceous earth. And I just dump it in here because it's easier to scoop it. Now this is a little quarter cup scooper. This doesn't have to be perfect either. So I'm going to do two heaping. Now I'm going to like churn this all up and mix it. So it's all everywhere. Okay so basically what I'm trying to do is get the diatomaceous earth mixed through all the food and of course mix it up a bit. Okay so now what I'm going to do. I'm going to start the process all over again. I'm going to start with the oats, corn, sunflower seeds and I'm going to do another layer of that and then it'll be done. So Some people might like wonder or ask like why are you bothering to mix up your own? Why not just buy like an already made chicken feed? The reason is I want to feed my animals whole food. I try not to feed processed food. Yes from time to time I might have to buy a bag of that for convenience and I will but overall I try to feed my animals whole food. That's why I mix up my own animal food and they love it and they all look good and they act happy and I never ever ever have any health problems with them and it just works out so good. I want to mention that I always buy oyster shell crushed oyster shell for grit. The store was out it was picked clean and this is all they had. The reason I like the oyster shell is it does add a little bit of calcium to their diet and chickens need a high calcium diet because the muscles back there that push out the egg need calcium. If your chickens don't get enough calcium and they'll start getting egg bound because those muscles will be weak and they can't push the eggs out which is a huge gross problem like you don't even want to go there. So that's the reason I like to feed you know as grit the crushed oyster shell. Another thing I didn't tell you which I do want to mention. I feed my horses alfalfa cubes and this right here I don't know if Scott can get a shot of this is what's left in the bottom of the can you know after I use all the cubes. This is just crushed up alfalfa that they make the cubes out of and you know it kind of falls apart over using the bag. Using the bag and I dump all this in the chicken coop because it's just little bits of alfalfa which also adds calcium to their diet. If I didn't have horses and I didn't use the cubes I would just purchase a bale of alfalfa hay and then I would just keep it under cover and just throw hay in there you know whenever and let them eat it. That also adds calcium to their diet and they love that stuff. So that's just a little added bonus just so you know. I want to dump that in there in a minute. Okay so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to show you how I do the grit for my chickens. I'll just get like I can't find my scoop so I'm just using this. Okay so this is how I do the grit. It's so simple because the chickens are perfectly capable of getting the grit themselves. So I'll just like throw a little bit in there and they'll find that and get that. My tree lost some moss. I'm going to put it in the burn pile. Okay so now I'm going to let the chickens out and I have to clip the door shut at night and feed my cute little darlings. Come on little chicky chicks. See they're eating the grit because they need it. Come on my little poopies. Chicky chicky chicky chick chick chick chick. Chicky chicky chick chick. Chick chick chick chick chick. Look at them. They're all running for the woods. They're like they're like we're free. They want nothing to do with me. They want to go run over there in the woods. I already fed them this morning so look at where they're heading over there. They're so funny. They're brats. They're dissing me. They're so funny.
