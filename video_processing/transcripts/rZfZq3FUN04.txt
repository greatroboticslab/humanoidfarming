 You want some bird noises? Woohoo! Oh yes! Oh you f***ing! How do you think you'd get on in the modern game? Yep! How you doing? How great was that? Thanks for having us on your land. Don't thank me yet. What do you want? Just have a bit of, I don't know, a slice of your life for the day. What are you lad bible? Yeah lad bible. So you're proper geezers are you? You're lad, you're the geezers. Are you? Yeah yeah. What the f***ing say about her? They're snow geese, they mother f***ers. Here look, here look, goldfinches see them? There's a jay going up there, look. Another jay there. There's a beautiful pheasant there, look. That one, look at that boy. Look at that boy there. Look at that buzzard there, look at the size of that. Look at that buzzard sitting there, look. See it down there? Look at the part of this f***ing cormorant there. Killing my fish, see it? There he goes. Here grab that for me, can ya? Oh you f***ing f***ing f***ing get on with it. Right lovely job. Oh I nearly went in there. Want some bird noises? I'll do it, you guess it. What sits on top of a f***ing croc? Well I wanted to say it was an owl. Oh a cuckoo for f***ing sake. Jesus Christ I'm f***ing cuckoo. What am I doing with it? Owl. Barn owl. F***ing barn owl. Oh that's good. Grebe. Yes, sounds like that. Is it a f***ing grebe? Yeah, great crested grebe. Come on! Would you come out here and chat to him? What's the f***ing s***ing? What's the point of it? That's the point of it right? Have a little chat. Oh f***ing talk to a f***ing talk to do little. Yeah, come on and chat to a grebe. Right mate. Can you swim? Not a little. I was just going to swim. You should stop f***ing asking these stupid questions. It's a f***ing creeper from the lake. Right, come on. How do you think you'd get on in the modern game if you were 25 now? I'd probably approach it a lot differently. You know what I mean? You don't really see players like you in the Premier League now do you? You can't though, they've stamped it out. Do you think you'd have been able to play the modern way? No. Adaptive, play at the top level or was that your game? No. When we played football, you'd finish training at half one, two o'clock. Most of us go to snooker hall, go and play golf. I had no interest in either. Go fly fishing. None of the lads did that. I did that. Better fly fishing. Or go to the f***ing pub. We drank most days. Really? Oh f*** me, yeah. Would you ever be there hungover at training? I'm over in the f***ing game. I f*** off. Hello. It's the star of the show. You've been grabbing? Oh look at that. Oh! If you're wondering whether Vinny hit it, that just landed on the foot. Right, get up here. If you close one eye, you go like that and the clay disappears. Do you know what I mean? Right. Whereas if you have both open, it can come there and you can go through it and see it. Alright. Right. Right. You look a bit scared mate. Put your chin on there. Yeah, yeah. Pull. Oh, in front of it. Alright. Give us a f***ing gun, man. Pull. You went early. Pull. Pull. You went early. Pull. Midgen. Just been clay shooting. Didn't do too bad. No. No. Yeah, yeah. I'm, that's the way. I'm not too old. I need to get up. No, no. Pull. Oh, in front of it. I can't do it. It's not too bad. It's not too bad. You've got a gun. I've got a gun. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can do it. Pigeon. Just been clay shooting. Didn't do too bad. Right here, f*** off. Nice one. Does anyone know the way to Manchester?
