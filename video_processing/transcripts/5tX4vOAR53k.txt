Science & Technology
 Look, in terms of agriculture, the Chinese are becoming dangerous day by day. They are now growing rice in ponds by placing the crops on floating rubber platforms. In addition, they release fish babies into this water, which eat the worms that infest the rice. This way, the fish grow alongside the rice at no extra cost. Then, the fish are sold, and the rice is harvested, allowing these farmers to earn thousands of dollars from a single plot using this double farming technique.
