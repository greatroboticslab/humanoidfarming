Travel & Events
 I love the kind of traction. The water suits on, those are mostly to keep you warm. They will keep you cloaked if you fall in the water, but don't try to touch the water. This boat's too high and I don't want to pick up anybody in the water. It's a lot of paperwork, not worth it. So, other water jackets, they're right below Rocky in the back of the boat, under the floor. They look like this. They're the keyhole type jacket, so you want to put the straps up over your head. There's a chin strap to redo. That one goes around you and then back into the jacket. Like all good self-respecting jackets, they got the whistle. You know what that's for, you've all seen the movie. And we also have a life raft up at the front. So, we're fully equipped for everything. A life raft that could be deployed under my command. Or it deploys itself if the boat goes the wrong way. But that's not going to happen anyways. Otherwise, when we're underway, I ask that you stay seated down. But when we're stopped and watching whales or looking for whales or wildlife, you can stand up and walk around. But stay on the deck. Don't climb on the surfaces. Don't climb on the life raft to see through the tubes. The boat can move in an unpredictable way, so I don't want anybody to fall. But otherwise, you can walk around with a problem. If we're underway and you see something interesting, you can point at it. If you want me to stop, you can look back and wave at me or stand up and I'll stop the boat. We do have a washroom on board. It's in that little cubby hole below. But let me know if you're going to use it. For one thing, you don't want to be in there when I start accelerating and I don't know you're in there. So, you know, it's just not a good thing. So, for the rest, well, we're ready to go. And we'll see what we can find there. My mother is trying there. Here's where you can find the Dollbas big. When he's going to get back. Now, we have taken a lei of funding. Call me up and take a look.
