 Hey, welcome back to my channel, Money from the Soil. There was no rain yesterday, so it's a good day to head out to the farm. Today, I want to share one of the mistakes I made in my farming journey. So, here we are now. Take a look at this land. It looks beautiful and is all set for the next crop. But if you look at my land, you'll see it's not ready yet. Here's what the other farmers did. After harvesting, they first plowed the field using a moldboard plow. Then, after about a month, they used a cultivator. A few days later, they used a rotavator. This process breaks down the leftover wood and stalks into small pieces, which then decompose and enrich the soil as compost. It helps improve soil health and crop growth. Unfortunately, I skipped this process. And now that it's time to sow the seeds, my land still isn't prepared. This was a big lesson for Mia, and I'll make sure not to repeat the same mistake next time. All right, that's it for today. See you in the next video. Thank you.
