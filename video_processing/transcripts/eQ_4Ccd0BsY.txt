Howto & Style
 The difference between straw and hay is straw is grown just for the grain. So they're not going to spray the same stuff they spray when they put it on a hay field. And even that grazon, I've done a little research on that, and it's got a half-life, and it takes several months for that to dissipate out. Unlike your straw that may have a light herbicide, it's got a pretty fast half-life. We're going to go ahead and get some straw here pretty quick. I'm going to leave them out in the sun, let them get rained on, and that should dissipate any herbicide that may be in there.
