 No, you can't grow them, and no, you can't rustle them up into a farm. So remember keyword stuffing? Yeah, this is that but with links. A link farm is a website consisting of nothing but links to other websites. It's not the same as creating doorway pages. Link farming is something a shady SEO company will create to artificially inflate a website's link popularity.

Link farming was a lot like pay to play.
