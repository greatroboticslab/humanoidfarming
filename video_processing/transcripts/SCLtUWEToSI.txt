Howto & Style
 Hey gardeners welcome back to the backyard gardener man what an intense weather we've been having with this intense pounding rain this scorching heat wave that we had and I want to show you in this very short video the secrets that I use to make my plants healthy and strong to withstand some of this crazy weather my plants are not just surviving they're actually thriving and my garden is looking really good and strong so I want to show you what's working for me right now what I did to front my plants to withstand this weather and it will work for you so let's go ahead and let's grow so these beautiful flowers actually withstand a lot of the the heat a lot of them like to heat but they don't like intense rain because these are wildflowers so they're actually made to withstand um somewhat drought conditions but they did get hit um they're looking really bad they were nice and full before but look at these pretty pretty pretty colors it's unbelievable how pretty these colors are look at these colors it's like so gorgeous and then this one here is going to be a nice beautiful like this one here is going to be a nice beautiful blue like violet blue you know that nice little pink color and the whites just amazing um it's I think it's amazing how God created all these different colors and stuff like that but they are so beautiful I just love looking at these I put these uh wildflowers here so when we look out our kitchen window this is what we see and then even look at this beautiful little sunflower just sitting here just loving the sun most likely it's going to be eaten by a bird or something he's beautiful beautiful beautiful this one's about to just pop open too be a nice beautiful sunflower I did make a video about these wildflowers it's like one of my first videos I made on this channel um out of this ugly box and I was telling you guys that it's going to be popping with some beautiful colors and they were actually gorgeous very beautiful colors and a lot of them honestly I put them out here so we could look at them but I also put them out here so the birds could eat them I love when you come out here and you just see the uh yellow finches out here or the hummingbirds out here just eating away it's I love it look at these two it almost looks fake beautiful there's a fly on that one I don't know why get out of here anyway these are beautiful look at this look at how big this is going to pop open and be really really beautiful oh man almost like I said almost looks like it's fake even this little this little one down here is like a dark orange can't really see it I wish the camera would be I had to get a better camera someday but but look at these colors this purple little this was a nice white white and blue but look at the blue here unbelievable I love this you could actually like take these and cut them and make a beautiful like bouquet you put these flowers here with a couple of these guys here and then you just add in you I have some more up front and I have like tiger lilies and stuff like that and then like even you grab like a hand let me get around here get a handful of these together just make a nice beautiful bouquet it's so amazing that's why I always say grow wildflowers because you get the element of the the beauty to look out your window and then you also get you know like I said you could go to someone's house and bring a nice bouquet and just throw it right on the table and they're so impressed you know usually this is what it looks like after the heat it did survive very well but it looks really bad right now because I do have my dog the one of the predators right here this is chipmunk aka quicksilver nice little rooster here just jumping in and out of here but also rabbits they like to nest so if you notice I'm going to show you in here it's all matted down because of the animals that come in here and nest which is fine whatever it's part of the garden but anyway um I just wanted to show you the section of some of the flowers actually let me skip over to here and let me just show you look at this nice white italian uh sunflower beautiful it almost looks like it's not even real it's like a picture this one's so beautiful it's kind of pressed because of fence but man look how beautiful these are and this is going to be a beauty beauty beauty look all these heads on here holy smokes this one was actually bitten off by a squirrel chew the top off and look at what we got in return you can see in the middle here where it was bitten off but look at the return and this right here this is actually some of the cucumbers man these look really good so let's just hop over here into the cucumber section but look at this look at these trendles remember is the one the video just a couple days ago we were planting these now look how tall they are they're I would say about a little more than four foot tall yeah nice beautiful that's a oh let me see if I get a little focus in there that's a pickling cucumber that's going to be a beautiful thing but look at this little trendle kind of tendle tendle I never could say right it's looking for somewheres to climb and I use this nylon trellis I got it it was like 16 bucks I think for this huge amount and I did like if you go and watch the cucumber I have three trellises set up and it covered them on I have actually extra and let's look down here look at these guys here these are the katrinas I get this fence I can't get in here because I made it for the rabbits I can't even get my own hand in here but anyway look at this little baby oops sorry with the camera this little baby uh katrina those are the snacking ones these are delicious these are so good and I think uh I see some mix in here this one here is a pickling cucumber um but this is what it looks like when it's starting off right there uh yeah this is so exciting so yeah if you notice I have my drip line system if you could see that brown piping right in there that's actually oh look there's a cucumber right next to it that's actually how I'm watering my plant if you notice one of the big tricks that I used was um putting this straw down I didn't use hay because hay there's a lot of seeds in hay and then next you know it looks like a hay field um so straw is just a little bit better but straw could give you some seeds too where you could get some crazy looking grass coming up which turns into straw um so let's get back to this trellis here so um actually even like right down here I put on like you can see this brown going across that's the drip line and there's an emitter every 12 inches so I'll put a plant on each emitter and that's where it gets its water this straw will hold down the moisture and when this intense heat comes there's no way for it to dry out because it's nice and moist but at the same time when it rains it just it doesn't puddle up it actually um it it will go into the ground it filters very good it's like a very good filter like a coffee filter you know a coffee filter doesn't catch all the coffee it filters it through and that's its job but anyway what I want to show you when I put together this system myself um I put a little cap on the end of there so I could always add to it and go into another bed uh let me well actually you can't even see it there is a line that goes this way and goes straight across this way my little bird feeder it's empty I gotta feed feed the birds they're yelling at me but anyway this is a great investment I got it from some guy he builds these little things for 12 bucks some old retired guy and put on a pole man what a beautiful feeder it's been anyway I put it underground and it's a little pipe that comes through right into that section there you could actually see the black part of the pipe to the left that's the main line coming in and splitting off with a drip emitter so I highly recommend getting a drip system because of the fact that it just waters your plants so much better than just spraying over the top man look at this chamomile it's so beautiful let me do like a little swoop video here man it's so beautiful look at that blown in the wind I just want to make a quick video for you but at the same time I want to show you my backyard and how it survived look at these zucchini look at they look really good and that is a characteristic of that plant that's actually not the mildew some plants do that like the uh romanescus and uh I think it's the uh the custard squash and I was just actually looking here before I have a one that's huge it's actually it's like I gotta pick this thing this thing's over I would say there's about I can't you can't see on the camera it's about 14 inch zucchini I'm gonna pick that tonight and we're gonna cook that I'm gonna grill tonight I'm making hamburgers and uh that's going on with it anyway so this is look at this the way this is thriving coming out here just stretching I think this one is actually to be honest with you I think it's either I don't know what it is it's it was a volunteer it kind of just got it added in and I think it's either a pumpkin or watermelon it to me this looks like a watermelon you see that right there I think that's a watermelon I think it's just funny how it just got added in there I get a lot of volunteers but that just shows you having a strong compost you're gonna have good germination no matter what seed you put down which includes weeds but if you just stay on if you mulch everything look at this chamomile beautiful I know it looks like ghetto around my garden here I have to do that because the chickens will get in here you know it looks like I just threw stuff all over the place but I just do that so the actual chickens can't get in here because they will come through and just help themselves there's all zucchini look at that oh we had a golden zucchini coming up I got some more over here so basically the trick is here is watering it properly not spraying the tops because if you have this intense heat and you get all these leaves wet it just adds just um a chance for it just to start rotting and making all kinds of problems with your leaves and then next you know you get when when these plants get weak the bugs start coming over and say hey let's attack and also when it rains it doesn't like it splatters all over the place so that's why the drip system the drip system is underneath and doesn't splash everywhere so that's another thing about watering it incorrectly you could splash water all over the place all right so I'm gonna move over to the uh tomatoes actually you know what before we go over there since we're having such a good time we just show you those other cucumbers here these are the soyo longs they take a little longer uh to grow but look at let me see let me get in here get up close and personal with this thing here look at that baby right there see how they're funny looking and they're spiky and long but man here's another one right there they are so good and they do take a little longer and so this is like a small little garden tour but if you notice all the drip lines basically going across this way there's no dribble in there um very successful look at there's hardly any weeds with all that rain and heat there's hardly any weeds and then the zinnias are looking really really good just beautiful look at that I got those from hoss tools the uh binary or binet whatever it's supposed to be I forget um and then this is another garden this is another video I did nice little chipmunk coal there this is the one I had the um the different lettuces and stuff like that carrots and the beets actually the beets are still cooking these are actually looking really really nice these beets they're going to be ready to pick soon they're nice and big they're like and these the way they grow these drip lines I had to kind of move them around uh but the drip lines actually soak up enough of the soil that it actually reaches all the plants and actually threw some watermelon plants in there those are really doing good I'm a little behind on the watermelon plants but I'm not really worried about it because they always turn out excellent here's another watermelon plant right there and this is just like a little mini raised bed it's it's not and I also have a kind of a pvc half round over it where I could put a shade cloth over it or even in um february march I grow lettuce and cilantro in here and I put a piece of plastic over the top and man by the time april comes may uh so it's like the things are it looked like a beautiful beautiful garden um because I had the plastic over top of it and this is some of the carrots that are left these carrots are probably just about ready to be picked I don't want to pick them yet because I want them to grow a little bit longer but if you pre if you go to some of my previous videos you would see uh the carrot video but some of the lettuces and stuff like that um my chickens already took care of there's not much of the lettuce um so here's some more zinnias and then so another part of the trick is basically when or you want to call it a hack wow look at that color here beautiful hold on let me get some close-ups of these so beautiful then these are ready to burst another one there another one there you're this orange right there that's really beautiful even this color I like this salmon color I think the salmon color is really pretty and then you see over here hiding look at that oh that's beautiful look at that look at these little um they're like a blonde I forget the name of them um but it's like a blondie peach color and then look at all these look how healthy these are these are just so healthy and they're they're all fertilized and look at these pepper plants let me go ahead and hop in here this is garden it's not as easy as it looks to hop into the garden especially when it's in full swing like right now all right give me one sec sorry about the camera going over the place all right so now we're in the garden I just want to show you some of these beautiful pepper plants look at these peppers these things are look at cubanelles these are gorgeous unbelievable yeah like I just want to chop hop over here and show you this look at that sunflower that's so good looking little get little mini bell peppers here just bell peppers will be ready to go before you know it if you pop in everywhere what we got here oh look at that another bill pepper that's actually really nice looking another one up top right here all right what else we got oh poblanos look at these babies poblanos nice and shiny they always have that nice shine these are excellent salsa oh look at this this is my jimmy nardellos look at this look this is touching the ground it's so long holy smokes look at that look how long this thing is I leave them on there a little longer so they get red but they are delish another cubanelle oh that's the same one I showed you before these are so nice I guess I did put a jalapeno in here huh interesting another cubanelle but if you notice they're all once again right on this drip line right here so it's been kind of a trick I love these little bouquets these little bouquets are pretty they're unbelievable pretty they're like mini miniature flowers they're so nice I got a bug just loving it it's like a mini bee or something oh wow look at these tomatoes these tomatoes are really good I had to put a cage around there I don't really like putting cages because I think they're kind of like they just don't work for me because they don't get big enough but these are looking so healthy look at that all these little fruit flowers ready to go look at that all these little fruit flowers ready to go look at that all these little fruit flowers look at these guys here holy smokes I think these are Rutgers look at this cucumber thing here just I'm gonna help it find its way ugh sometimes you gotta you gotta train these up to gonna go the right way so what I'm doing here is I'm just gonna go like that and just kind of help it and that will make it so it will start going on to there all right I'll have to look back at my other video see what I find it but this one's actually falling over it's so big big this is barrage barrage is a beautiful flower it's this beautiful violet flower here it gets so pretty all these little flowers actually you can see on this plant right here a little bit better they're about to bloom there's a whole bunch of buds ready to bloom and I plant the barrage in there and that's just to kind of keep oh there's the bees for the pollinators I was about to say for the pollinators and it also keeps some of the bad bugs away so they can if that barrage is actually it's actually pink too I thought it was only purple wow interesting this video is a little longer than I thought it was going to be but hey and this is my New Jersey trellis for this tomato system this right here it's working out really well look at all these plum tomatoes all these plum tomatoes are looking really good soon I'm going to have a whole bunch of them just popping everywhere look at that so anyway I just wanted to give you guys a little garden tour of everything that's going on here because it's like everything's like I do watch some other videos and people's gardens are burning up and stuff like that but I'm telling you part of the trick is fertilizing with a slow release fertilizer and these are the hoss tomatoes these are gonna these are actually really big they're gonna get big and bushy so what you want to do is fertilize with a slow release fertilizer that's gonna keep going it's not gonna be just like one big blast look at all those tomatoes I can't get over this trellis to show you these tomatoes so I can just zoom in though they're looking really good sorry about this camera work just kind of just decided to jump in here real quick and show you the stuff all right I'm gonna go over to the cherry tomatoes real quick and show you those all right so this is another raised bed I have here and these are all my golden beets which are actually looking beautiful they're like really nice and big I kind of put it in an area that's not super sunny it's moderate sun um just because they don't super like the heat and then here's another squash plant that's going to be looking really good soon get some flowers in there there's another these are the cost of the romanescus um it's looking really nice here and once again I have my irrigation system pumping out water consistently all right so let me just show you some of these cherry tomatoes nice basil plant popping up man every time you touch it smells so good but yeah here is some of the cherry tomatoes I realize it's not really easy to grasp the aspect of how beautiful these are and how healthy they are but I if you notice I actually I did a lot of preening with these indeterminate tomatoes and just kind of cut the bottom just lay a a lot of air through the bottom and sunlight you know to get to these guys here yeah look at those beautiful tomatoes once again I have my little beautiful chipmunk friends over here they like to eat all the tomatoes but look at these are the sun gold cherries there's tons of them they're all over the place here's one that's getting there it's about right a couple here these are really really pretty come a companion to with a nice basil plant and nice uh look at these marigolds I don't know what people think about marigolds but I think they actually smell really good this is a buttercup and this is a tangerine I got that from m.i. Gardner the um tangerine and I think I got this one here from Baker's Creek the uh yeah that was Baker's Creek the uh buttercups and that's just regular regular uh orange um marigolds and these are so pretty they're almost like little mini um sunflowers and then on this side over here is another bed with some more basil doing real well and these are my super sweet 100s but look at these babies in here look at those wow those actually look really good they're almost ripe almost ready to go they are looking good and same thing here I uh went through and you notice the bottoms they don't look wild they did look wild but went through and pruned them all make sure there's good sunlight getting to the bottom trick too she wants to only get into the bottom of the plant too so it doesn't start to rot out down in this area here and then the bugs start coming in but look at these guys here they are so pretty they're looking really good I got a couple more back here look at that those are those clips that I was talking about the uh tomato clip the clamps right there and what I use I just use like a piece of steak um this is just a piece of vinyl someone was throwing it out so I took it and drilled a hole and strung it up right to the top and just tied it onto a 2x4 and the 2x4 is just shaped like a U and in my other video I did with cherry tomatoes um you'll see more about that look at these these I got to cut the tops of these you starting to flower so but yeah wow look at that so so good looking these are just about ready to be picked so many on this plant but anyway I think that's that does it that wraps up for the garden tour I mean got the watermelons I got the tomatoes the cucumbers um the zucchini the squash I got some of the carrots but you can't really see too much of it um let me see what else do we have anyway everything's looking really good and I am just very happy and I can't wait to start harvesting more stuff I already got a lot of peppers so got tons of peppers so the last but not least is the peppers the peppers oh look at that beautiful little zinnia there I planted a couple of these with the peppers usually I'll go on there anyway um these are the peppers that I planted in these pots if you remember and what I did was there was some soil in there I put compost the compost that is homemade and then I put in some uh fertilizer and then after that put a little bit more compost in and then I topped it off with some of the happy frog soil um man what these plants look amazing look at the color on these plants nice rich dark beautiful plant wow here's another zinnia I didn't even notice that but look at the coloring on this you don't see any uh purple or any like light colors and let's look at some of the fruit man oh man look at this this is beautiful look at that cubanel that is amazing no excuse me that's a poblano this is a cubanel right here these are the ones that I really like inside of um a greek salad now imagine just taking this chopping this up into little uh discs like little round uh rings and then throwing that in the greek salad oh it's amazing and then banana peppers wow look at how beautiful look at all the banana peppers in there and this is the other one there look at all the banana peppers in there wow this is doing good this one here is still working most likely this is probably a bell pepper bell peppers seem to always take a little longer there's another banana I plant a lot of the bananas because I get a lot of people that request uh banana peppers this one here is actually a habanero um I do plant usually all my plants inside of the red pots that are hot but I just ran out of red pots so I used it for something else but I have another habanero there and habaneros aren't easy to grow but they look excellent and look at this this is this is a nice jalapeno looking really good all the jalapenos in there look at this one here it's just loaded I have to pick these if we know these are going to start turning red and be red chilies look at these habaneros wow these things look so good this is going to turn red or orange oh man these are going to be bees they're going to wash my hands after touching them looking at these bananas again look how big this one is this one's absolutely huge look at compared to my hands like as long as my arm man I guess I planted a lot of this I planted a lot of banana peppers I'm going to can them this year usually I would say I'm going to can them but I don't always get around to canning them some more and then this right here this is a celebrity tomato if you notice I put the straw on here and look at the soil so nice and moist it looks really good I did put a cage around it because I forgot that I didn't plant any celebrities and I got these from Hoss Hoss has a really good tomatoes Hoss tools and the celebrities like those caprese tomatoes are they're absolutely delicious so all right here we are we're at the end and I just want to thank you
