 I'm in the process of prepping my new straw bales that I just purchased for my straw bale garden and this will be for planting fall tomatoes. I have the tomatoes that are maybe about two or three weeks away from being planted out in these straw bales so we're in the process of conditioning them right now. I have full instructions on how to do this on my YouTube channel underneath the straw bale gardening playlist. We are using urea nitrogen fertilizer to do this.
