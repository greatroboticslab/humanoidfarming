 Imagine a farmer who used to rely on the seasons to grow food for us. But now, climate change is unpredictable. Sometimes there's too much rain in terms of floods, and sometimes droughts. Crops fail, and the farmers face hunger. But there are solutions. Farmers can use special seeds that need less water, learn when to plant through weather updates, and store their harvests better. Carbon emits countries, and governments must help by giving them the tools they need. By working together, we can protect farmers, feed families, and fight climate change.
