 If someone were to describe my style of plant parent, it would be easy going because I'm so hands-off and I let the plants do their own thing. That's a lie, I'm a helicopter parent. I have an unhealthy obsession with this Monstera Albo and it hasn't put out a leaf in four months and I suspect that it's root-bound and something needs to be done about it. I also low-key hoard plastic containers. And this take-out soup container is going to work perfectly because it's only slightly larger than the original pot, but I need to make drainage holes. P.S. I'm so chill, I have a soil library. It's organized by the type of soil I need for each type of plant. And here's the satisfying part of making drainage holes, and the fact that this plastic container is clear is a bonus because I can observe the root growth. And don't worry, I always have my air purifier on the max setting whenever I do this. Look how chunky and delicious the soil is. It's well-draining, allows for air to circulate, and still holds moisture in. Everything came out in one nice piece, so I'm just going to plop it in and not mess with the roots. No idea what this green pokey thing is called, but it works really well in settling the soil and all the crevices. As soon as I put a moss pole on this plant, a fat area of root root into it immediately, so I have ho-hopes for it, but I need to fix this one wonky leaf that's off to the side, so I use flexible thread used to make bracelets. So here's the result of me being the chillest helicopter plant parent around. I love it so much, don't tell the others.
