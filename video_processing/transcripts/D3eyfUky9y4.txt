 Farm safety net programs were established to protect agricultural producers against production, price, and income risks. But payments for major federal programs like agricultural risk coverage, price loss coverage, and crop insurance overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest and largest farms. The top 10% of farms by total crop sales, which have an average net worth of $5.5 million, received 55,000 in payments per farm in 2015, totaling almost 3 billion or nearly two-thirds of all program payments. The other 90% of farms received just $4,000 on average. Two recent proposals attempt to limit the concentration in subsidies. A $40,000 cap on crop insurance subsidies would save an estimated $2 billion per year, while a $125,000 cap on per farm subsidies across all programs would save $670 million per year. Nearly all of these savings come from a reduction in payments to the largest 5% of farms, who are the least vulnerable to adverse market conditions. In order for these programs to provide an effective safety net, they need to be targeted at the most vulnerable.
