 Music Ok, you know the Hustler we find it pretty good, bloody good actually. This is probably about our fourth or fifth one and this one here supersedes the other one because of the other ones because of the latch system. The hook on you don't have the rope that goes on the back end now, as you can see you just get your top link in the right level and then lift it up and you're away. So it saves a lot of time over the winter. We feed about 500 to 600 bales a year. Another wee thing that we haven't had to use it yet, that must be because the contractors have done a good job of the bales this year. But these here are a wee clip that you don't clip because if you've got bales wrapped around there you used to have to try and pull the stuff out or pull it out from the bottom. Now you can just pull these down and then pull any bales that's wrapped around those out. Obviously just put it back on again and there you go. So that's another extra but we haven't needed it yet but hey it is there, it's a good option. It's well thought out. Bloody solid, really really solid machine. What weight? 800 kilos? Is it? Yeah. So this is only a 75 horsepower tractor but it's not a big tractor by any means. So you've got probably 700 bales of bales, you can see 800. So there's one and a half tonne there but hey, handles it with a breeze. No we've got no complaints with it, it's good. Certainly... Quickly... ...
