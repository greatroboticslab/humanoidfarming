Howto & Style
 Hey y'all this is Amanda and welcome back to my Texas Zone 8A garden and today we're going to be doing a number of things including fertilizing, shopping for fall bulbs at Costco, planting Bells of Ireland, and starting out a new planter for the shade garden. Okay as many of y'all know I have been looking for Bells of Ireland seeds forever and I didn't want to order them from a company and have to pay like up electric shipping for one packet of seeds and I was not looking to buy additional seeds because I'm good like I have what I need at this point in time. So I ended up getting them from Amazon from a company that I've used before let me locate that let's see seedneeds.com and I've ordered some flowers from them before. So I ordered Bells of Ireland it's about 400 seeds I forget the prices but I'll put that down below so y'all can see. Now there is some preparation involved with Bells of Ireland seeds so this time I put them in the freezer for two weeks and basically it's following the directions on the Cool Flowers book and basically it's following the directions on the Cool Flowers book by Lisa Mason Ziegler. And so I started a whole bunch of seeds in the I put the whole packet actually in there for two weeks and then I got them all out and I have been soaking them in this water for four days at this point which it sounds insane but I am following directions on there. They did not they sprouted for me my first year I tried them and then the second year I tried them they did not sprout for me so I really wanted to make sure that I was following the directions this next time around to make sure I was doing everything the way I needed to do it so that I could get good results because I love Bells of Ireland. I think they're such a cool fun flower. So we are at the point that now these have been soaking for quite a while four days and it is time to get them planted. So I'm starting with my favorite potting soil called BM7 that I get from let's see homegrown plants in Farmersville Texas and looks like I'm going to be starting four containers and I did soak a whole bunch of seeds because one thing the book says is that they heavily overseed this particular flower because germination is tough. So let's go ahead and get these popped into the soil. Okay so I have a towel right here and I'm going to go ahead and try to pull out a bunch of my seeds out onto the towel just so they can dry and they'll be a little bit easier to get seeded. Okay and then I'm just going to like pat them a little bit between just to dry them off a touch and these are only planted about a fourth of an inch deep so what I think I'm going to do is just go ahead and put several on the surface and then go over the top with additional soil and I'm putting like three four five in here y'all. I'm not holding back. I really want to make sure that I get some good plants going. I have been starting seeds like crazy and I'm literally running out of space so I don't have a million trays to do you know a single or even double seeds in each. So I think this will work. I hope this will work well. So once again two weeks in the freezer and up to five days soaking. Okay and now that I've got the seeds on there I'm just going to go over the top give them another push down and then clean it up. Okay and then the Vigo trays get these to go on top. And then as you know I start with dry soil so I'm going to fill up the tray with lots of water so it can begin sucking up the moisture. And then I'll be checking on these to make sure that they stay moist throughout the process. You definitely don't want to let these dry out. So you definitely want to check every day if possible. Okay and it says these take about 14 to 21 days to sprout. Now they suggest putting these outside in this book. I've always started mine inside and I intend on continuing to do that at this point. But just to give you you can start them directly outside from what this book actually says. The packet says they can germinate in as little as 7 to 14 days after sewing. Anyway so I'll keep you updated on these to see if they actually do germinate for me. And once they do germinate I'll be transplanting them outside probably late fall. So I'll be patched. I'll be identifying the other ones from them unnecessarily нашейыlands versus tossing them outside. So I'll try to fish with these away rolls and selling them outside. Now please prevent any problems with the other ones themselves that are for now. But I keep up my Deutschlands and I closed my банter when I whoa, and I just met my Road consumption to before it and again I'll find out everything that much Light Pen spreading in place. And I was worth it! See just before this bookmonth I believed in this one of you did. And then this book was published. music So okay so let's talk about the bulbs that I picked up from Costco I picked up four varieties they are all $13.99 per bag showed you guys a lot of the varieties that they have I ended up choosing Muscari and this one called Locojum I don't know they look like like snowdrops but I'm not sure what there's probably a common name for them and I'll put that down below but I picked up these two to go together and these are going to go planted in the ring directly in front of the Ruby Falls red bud that I have on the side of the house and I really enjoyed my Muscari that I had on the front of this house this year and I had it mixed with Mount Hood daffodils which are just a beautiful creamy white and I really like the look so I would like to do more Muscari on the side I'm going to mix it with some of these beautiful white blooms now I don't believe that any either of these need to be pre-chilled so that'll be good so I'll just keep you getting them directly into the ground we're going to be doing this at a later date it's a little bit too early for us a little bit too hot so I would like to get these planted sometime in October going into November I think would be a good time to get these in anyway I got 100 of the Muscari for $13.99 and I got 15 of the Leukogen Leukogen as well and that was $13.99 so it'll be really fun to see how these do next I picked up a standard bag of mixed daffodil bulbs this was $13.99 for 50 of them and it looks like it mixes three different types um or it might be more than that actually it might be more than that actually because some of them have orange throats some of them have pink some of them have white some have yellow I mean so it's a wide variety of them so I and I grew daffodils grow great here and um many of mine have naturalized and come back year after year this container was specifically purchased so that it can go in a container pots that I'm going to be working on in the backyard and so I think this would be really really good to get some of those pots filled in so I can have some early blooms but 50 bulbs for $13.99 and then finally I bought a bag of tulip bulbs now tulips in north Texas are a whole different ball game for most areas these need to be chilled at least 12 weeks tulips in our area if you plant them directly in the ground here without being pre-chilled you're not guaranteed that we're going to get 12 full weeks of really consistent cold temperatures and that's what tulips really need to be able to produce bulbs here I selected this particular variety because it has Darwin hybrid tulips in it and they're about 24 inches tall which was one of the goals and it looks like purpley pinks pinks yellows it looks really really pretty I'm going to be doing all of my tulip bulbs in crates this year which will be really fun I got the idea from Serena and Ian on you can't eat grass and so they do all of theirs in crates or they did a bunch of theirs in crates and they've been doing all their gladiolas in crates so they think it's super cool and it's going to really allow me to pack them in so I will have this at a later time I will be showing you how I'm planting my tulips but I needed to buy these now so I can get them into the refrigerator not the freezer the refrigerator they go outside in my drink refrigerator where we keep all our sodas and as well out in the garage and they'll just go up on the top and I'm probably going to go ahead and open this up because these are in a plastic bag so let's see what they look like so these are in a plastic bag it does have some holes in it but I don't want to put this entire container in here just like this like in this as well so I want to go ahead and pull them out it says these are both called sunset tulip mixes and it says the height's about 24 inches you plant them six inches deep they bloom mid-spring and the colors are red pinks and yellows full sun to full shade like I said these are going to be going in a container and I have ordered some other tulip bulbs that are going to be going in crates as well so it'll be a really fun project if you're in the north Texas area go ahead and purchase your bulbs and get them into the refrigerator so they can chill minimum eight weeks but I prefer to let mine chill 12 weeks okay I did want to show you that now that the temperatures are cooler and we're going to be receiving rain it was time for me to reset all my drip plants because I have them going off twice a day right now because it was so hot with the triple digits so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I've got them going off for 15 minutes I'm actually going to leave it at 15 minutes for now and then go to how often I have it going off every 12 hours so right now I'm going to have it going off once a day we'll see how everything adjusts to that and I should be good to go there's off we're back on at our auto position so once again my start time starts at 5 30 a.m how often or excuse me how long it's 15 minutes how often is every once a day so we are good to go okay and I'm going to be adjusting both of these over here as well these are my back ones so we're going to go how long we're probably going to go up to 15 minutes but we're only going to go once a day and we're good to go on that one and then the same for this one how long 20 minutes this goes to all the back gardens I think I'm going to go ahead maybe take it down to 18 minutes for now and we'll go once a day all right good to go okay so next on the agenda today is working with this container I actually got it on Facebook a marketplace it's this metal portion and then they had the pot that went on top I don't think that this is original pot I think this is originally like a wash stand like an antique wash stand where you would hang your towel on the front part you'd have a bowl and most likely you'd have a pitcher down low to pour the water in there's also space right here where you would probably have something that sat there as well but this pot and the metal part came together this pot is actually my pot that I have as well but I wanted to just go ahead and start planting this up for the shade garden so I have been collecting some shade plants let me show you okay I'm going to start with these ferns these are autumn brilliance ferns and I got them for a dollar each one dollar each at tractor supply and for a dollar I was pretty excited about that price so what I'm going to do is they're not in awesome shape so I'm just going to go through I'm going to trim off all the areas that don't look awesome to kind of just give it a fresh start now some of them I am going to leave some of them that don't look great I'm still going to leave them there and you're really just going to take off anything that seems like it's kind of struggling and taking off some of these tips and I'm just going to get the plant cleaned up okay so there's one here's the other one and I just I couldn't pass these up at a dollar each I'm not trying to collect too many plants right now on the shade garden because I'm not actually ready to plant too much in there I haven't finished the um the opening that's going to be casting a lot of shade over there and then once the opening is done I'll be installing some shade cloth and so I'm just not quite ready okay that looks a ton better okay so I've got those two autumn brilliance ferns and then I've also got this one my friend Kristen picked up for me it's called Nicholson it's from Nicholson and Hardy Nursery and it is a virginia let's see if I can find the variety hold on okay I have the variety somewhere so I'll put it down below this is a virginia and I was looking at ordering the Miss Piggy virginia um online and but my friend Kristen saw this and so she's like oh hey let me get this for you and get that taken care of so here's my thought I think up top I'm going to put the virginia in one of the ferns and then I'm going to also put one of the ferns down low now for shade plants I do like some pretty moist soil um but I still want it to be pretty uh well draining so there is a large hole in the bottom of this one and in this one so let's go ahead and add some potting soil and get these taken care of okay so I'm using my BM7 potting soil that I absolutely love I'm going to go ahead and start with one of the ferns and this has some really good like crumbly soil and let's get the virginia in here the virginia was pretty pricey at $19 it's kind of surprised my friend Kristen she wasn't familiar with the variety either but she knew I was looking for it but it does have flowers in the spring okay sweet let's do the bottom portion all right so I'm actually going to go ahead and move this back for now because I don't want it getting a ton of sun right now eventually it will get moved into the shade garden once the shade garden is ready okay definitely love its look I think it's going to be super fun in the shade garden I love these unique planters I bought this one for $21 forgot to tell y'all earlier that included the pot and the metal portion but not that container looks good all right I hope you enjoyed today's video I hope you enjoyed seeing the new shade planter I'm very excited I am very excited to do a lot more planting for the shade garden I'm just trying to hold myself off since I still have some work to do to make sure I have significant amount of shade over there and so that will be coming in the next few weeks as we are getting cooler weather and I hope you all enjoyed seeing the bulbs that I ended up purchasing and watching me finally start the bells of Ireland seeds all right you all as always make sure you hit
