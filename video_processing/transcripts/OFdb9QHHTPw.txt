 Hi everybody! Today I'm going to be doing my garden planning for the year and I thought I'd bring you along to show you how I do it and you can try doing it this way or you can maybe just pick up a couple tips that help you with your garden planning. Welcome back and if you're new here my name is Kayla and this is 5 Canadian Acres where I like to help us in the short season cold climate garden get as much as we can out of our season. When I start garden planning I just get any old notebook and a calendar. This is a two-part process. My first part of the process is to list everything I want to grow. If you saw my recent video about garden planning tips I noted about making garden goals so those garden goals will help me make this list. For example I want to grow more root and storage crops so I'm going to be listing things like carrots, beets, rutabaga, radishes on my list. So I'm just going to go ahead and write those all down. If I know the varieties of the things I want to grow I'll also note that beside there for example carrots. I'm going to be growing scarlet nantes, nance I'm not sure pronunciation and I'm also growing little fingers and etc. I'm just going to list those on my sheet. So I'm going to go ahead and list those all now and thanks to the power of editing you're not going to have to sit through it all. Now that I have everything listed out this is what I call my master list for the year. Of course things will change I'm sure I'll buy more seeds and find new things I want to go but for the most part this is the bulk of what I want. So I'm going to use this list now for two things. First I'm going to look at my seed inventory and check off the things that I have. If there's something on my list that I don't have in my seed inventory I'll usually just make a little star beside it so then I can go back and see what I need to order because we're getting into the middle of January now is the time to order your seeds. So that will help me with ordering my seeds. Now second I need to know when I need to plant my seeds or start them. Do I need to start them inside and then transplant? Do I need to direct sow them and when? So this is where my calendar comes in handy. What you want to find is your average last frost date. A quick google search just write average last frost date and then the town or city you're in and it's going to come up with the day the average day that you have the last frost of the year. Of course this is going to change every year but this is just an outline and I'll watch the weather as it goes. So for me my average last frost date is May 14th. So I'm going to go onto my calendar and find May 14th which is here and I'm going to write last frost date. Yay I hope so. Last frost date. So now most things that we plant are going to be you know two weeks before six weeks before your average last frost. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to count backwards and I'm going to write on my calendar each week before last frost. I usually actually do every two weeks so I'm going to count. Okay May 7th it's going to be April 30th is going to be two weeks before my average last frost. So I write two weeks and then we'll count up April 16th is four weeks. April 2nd is six weeks. March 19th is eight weeks. I love eight weeks before the last frost because that's when I start a lot of my things. I'll actually go up to 12 weeks before my last frost because things like onions and some of your perennials and stuff, herbs can be started 12 weeks. As you start gardening you begin to learn when you need to start things and if you should direct sow them or not. But I even reference every year just to be sure especially for some of the things aren't as common. This is where I reference this book. That's The Year Round Gardener by Nikkie D'Bor. So now I'm going to go back to my master list and I'm going to look for carrots. When do I need to start carrots? Again this can be found on the back of your seed packets online or I like to reference this book and I'll find carrots. I really like this book because she talks about starting in cold frames and when to direct sew and I haven't really done many cold frames yet but it's definitely something I'm going to be getting into. So she's got two to four weeks before last frost you can direct sew your carrots. So beside my carrots I'm going to write two to four weeks and I put direct. And then I'm going to go down and do this for everything. For beets three to four weeks before you can direct sew. Most root vegetables, well actually all root vegetables I like to direct sew. For tomatoes we've got six to eight weeks. Now in our short seasons I tend to go towards the eight weeks starting them early just so we can get as much time as we can. But again depending on how much space you have inside will be how early you can start those. Go with peas. Five to six weeks. You didn't see my video last year about starting a spring garden. I'm going to be doing lots more content on that because five to six weeks before your last frost you could be putting peas in the ground. And unfortunately a lot of people say don't start anything to after May long weekend. That's kind of the thing up here. But we are missing out on a huge amount of days where we could be growing stuff that when we have only I only have 124 growing days every single day counts. And then peppers are eight to ten weeks. The hotter peppers you want to start a little bit earlier ten weeks. The sweeter peppers can be eight weeks. Make sure to note if you're direct sewing it. So things like tomatoes and peppers those are from transplant. So you're going to start them eight to ten weeks early indoors. And then I also note the transplant date. And most of the things you start indoors you transplant after your last frost. So I'm going to put transplant after last frost. Once I've gone through my master list and wrote down when I need to start my seeds I'm going to go back to my calendar and write down everything that I've done. So back to carrots. Direct sew two to four weeks. So I go to my calendar and I find four weeks. I like again I like to pick the earliest I can start them. So four weeks. So I'm going to write direct sew. And then below that I'm just going to list as things come. So carrots. What I'll do is once I've hit four weeks I like to write them on like just one or two days. But knowing that whole week basically I have open to direct sew or start those things. If we go down to tomatoes. Okay it's eight weeks before last frost I can start them. I will write indoors. And tomatoes. Because I'm starting those indoors that's only my planting date. I know that I need to transplant these after my last frost. So I'm going to go back to my calendar to where my last frost date is. And I'm going to write transplant. And I'm going to put tomatoes. So I'll have tomatoes on here twice. The first time is indoors meaning that's when I'm starting them indoors. And then when I say transplant that's when I know I can start them outside. Now as I mentioned before this is just a average date. So as the time comes near I'll be looking at the weather and if we can plant them a couple days early or there's going to be a frost still in the week after my average last frost date I won't be transplanting these out. This just gives me a general idea. I don't really plan out how much of certain things I'm going to be planting because everything depends on kind of the size of your garden. And there's so many variables even if they say you know the average family of four eats this much of this. It's very very subjective. So I just kind of know what I want to grow and I'm kind of a freestyle gardener. I'll just go when I have the space and it's time to plant them I'll just go and plant them there. So this I like to have just as a general outline to help me stay a little bit organized so I know what seeds I need to order and then as the season goes on when I need to be planting things. I hope this helped you a little with your garden planning and I look forward to growing all things with you this year. Thanks so much for watching. Bye!
