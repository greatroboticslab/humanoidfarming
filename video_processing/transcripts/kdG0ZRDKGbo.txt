Education
 To achieve high peanut yields, you must follow these two steps, which can lead to increased peanut production. First, about 30 to 40 days after the peanuts sprout, they will begin to flower. After flowering, each flower will produce a small branch that penetrates the soil, and after it grows, it becomes a peanut. If the plants grow too tall, the flowers will also be excessively high, making it difficult for the peanuts to root. Therefore, when the peanuts reach a height of about 12 to 16 inches, it's important to manage them promptly to prevent excessive growth, which can affect yield and increase the risk of disease. Secondly, before the peanuts flower, use a mixture of 30 grams of potassium dihydrogen phosphate and 15 milliliters of boron fluid, diluted in 30 pounds of water, and spray it on the peanut leaves. This can promote more flowering and rooting, resulting in plumper peanut seeds, reducing empty and underdeveloped pods, and significantly increasing peanut yields.
