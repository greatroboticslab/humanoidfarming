 It turns out that Alan speaks fluent Gerald. Gerald, that was the best ever version I've ever seen on this farm, mate. Yeah, it's Jake, boys, now we're in a bar. To the place, don't we? Don't put us a bar in the day, let's go. It's all right, Jake, you're fucking poor as they do it. Alan, copy? Yeah, I got you, Gerald, what's up? No, they were just asking me how long this is going to take to move all this rubble in. The same is, it's the stopping and waiting track down to the road here. All week the way it's going, ain't it? It'll be all right, once we get rolling a bit, you'll be surprised when something's going. It turns out that Alan speaks fluent Gerald.
