 The energy cycle of a perennial is opposite of an annual. An annual extracts energy from the soil to make this big ear of corn or barley head or seed head or squash or pumpkin or whatever. It extracts energy from the soil to make this big fruit. And the annual has faith in its big pretty seed that it will get planted somewhere for next year. The perennial, it takes energy and puts it in the root structure. It doesn't make seed necessarily to propagate. The perennial is going to be there. It's stationary there. And it needs to withstand floods and droughts and blizzards and cold and hot and all this stuff. It creates this huge carbohydrate bank account in the root structure so that come what may up above the ground, there's still enough energy in the root structure to send forth a new plant. That's the difference between a perennial and an annual.
