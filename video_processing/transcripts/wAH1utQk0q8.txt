Howto & Style
 Hey y'all this is Amanda and welcome back to my Texas Zone 8A garden and today I stopped by Lowe's to check out a few things and I noticed they had a bunch of their fall planting bulbs available so let's go through and see what they have okay so the first thing I noticed is there's not very many y'all they usually have a ton more than this and so either they just don't have as many as usual or maybe I missed the window I mean truthfully I'm at these big box stores like once a week so I'd be surprised if I missed it but let's go ahead and dig into what they have so these are all fall planted bulbs so we're gonna plant them now and then they will give us blooms in the spring so all fall planted so I'll talk to you a little bit about how I go about each of these varieties as we're going through and exploring what they have okay these giant sacks of daffodils are part of my favorite value at a big box store it is 40 bulbs for 20 dollars and look at the size of these bulbs they are absolutely amazing they look like potatoes they are so big and so beautiful and these are one of my favorite things to do for a friend I love to just pick up a big sack of these and go plant them in a friend's garden and then they have a beautiful surprise come spring I did that last year for a couple of friends and they were just delighted and the thing about daffodils is that they are perennial so they will come back every year so once you plant them they'll be around for a while you plant these about three to six inches deep and they're going to be between 14 and 20 inches tall they are great cut flowers and they're just like the first things that show up in the spring and it's just so delightful to see their sunny little faces pop up after a long winter now they do have some other specialty types of daffodils over here so I'm excited to kind of show you guys what the varieties can be this first one right here is called ice king and it is a double so in the center it's like double rows of trumpet blooms in the center and then it has its outside petals the inside is kind of a pale yellow tone mostly white actually and then the outside petals are white as well now these big box stores don't typically put a lot of information on the back that's relevant to the actual plant so you might want to google and look up if there's a particular depth or anything you need to know about that this other variety is called slim whitman six plants or six bulbs for five dollars and it is a double as well it's got an orange center with kind of a ruffled yellow trumpet and then white petals on the outside this one right here is called jet fire it's a little bit smaller and its trumpets turn downwards face downwards and it has kind of an orangey coral trumpet kind of center and then all yellow petals on the outside it is a much more petite daffodil now i love this variety down here and i've grown it before it is called replete and i've grown it straight from the big box store and it did beautiful it's kind of like a salmon coral center it's a double so it's coral mixed with white in the center and it has white petals on the outside so 12 bulbs for eight dollars really really pretty you definitely want to look at the bulbs every time you're buying like pull them out look at them squeeze them if they're spongy you don't want them if they're so brittle that they're like turning to dust you don't want them that so you really want to pay attention to the bulbs take the time feel each one of the bulbs make sure you're in good situation no molds all that stuff that's what you're looking for so if that's good then you're ready to go home with it now this is a dutch master daffodil this is a larger daffodil it is a traditional yellow trumpet and yellow petals on the outside and it's 12 bulbs for eight dollars absolutely beautiful a little bit taller this down here is a double mix of daffodils so all the center trumpets are doubles and it is a mix so you're not sure exactly what varieties you're going to be getting but i actually like that i think that's fun and i think they go well to with one another there is a single down here mix a trumpet and cups mix with the traditional trumpet and then petals on the outside another really fun mix to play with now ice follies are a classic daffodil and i have grown them as well and they are stunning beautiful delicate very very pale butter center with white petals on the outside of them so six plants for five dollars i mean six plants for five dollars is pretty good i think you can find some better deals everywhere but there is something to be said about convenience the tete ta daffodils are very tiny very sweet and these are really fun ones to force inside in early spring very tiny petite and kind of whimsical and fun looking now they did not have as many bearded iris as i've seen in the past they did have three varieties this one was called presby crown jewel and i know it looks blue but my guess is it's going to be more of a purple tone white with kind of purple margins really pretty it's one bulb or technically a rhizome for five dollars since that one box was empty i started going through the other boxes i mean maybe someone came and cleaned all of these out i mean i don't know maybe they did maybe they were like i have to have all of these and so yeah there wasn't as much information this one right here was called mother earth bearded iris it kind of had multiple colors in it now i will say i was checking out the rhizome it was so dry it was so dry that i felt like i could crush it and that is definitely something you don't want you want it to have a firmness to it you know like it still feels alive this guy was so dormant i i i don't know i i would hesitate to buy that particular rhizome because it just didn't feel right because it was so incredibly dry now this variety is called pagan dance and immediately made me think of outlander if any of y'all watch that show um i love the opening to outlander where all the girls are dancing around the stones and blah blah blah now this rhizome was in way better shape it felt alive it felt healthy it did not feel brittle it had a touch of weight to it compared to the other one that was light as a feather so i felt way more confident in that particular rhizome than i did on the other one now as a reminder i'm in zone 8a so tulips when planted in our area don't typically come back each year i have to go ahead and pre-chill my tulips so i put them in a refrigerator for typically around four to six weeks sometimes longer and then i plant them out in january so that they can get consistent cold for quite a while and then if i decide to leave them in the ground they will not come back however i can dig them up and pre-chill them again and utilize them next year so let's look at a few more tulip varieties now this variety is called daydream and it's yellow and has a little bit of kind of like reddish pink striations to it which i thought were really pretty sunny happy kind of feel it is six bulbs for five dollars once again you're wanting to look at the size these are 18 to 22 inches tall so you could utilize these as cut flowers tulips are great as a cut flower but i always check the back for the size of tulips because sometimes if they're super short they don't work as well as a cut flower i have recently been drawn to red and this was beautiful this is called world's favorite and it's red with kind of yellow margins to it which i thought was beautiful six plants again for five dollars i'm going to keep saying plants because that's what they have it's bulbs this one is 18 to 22 inches tall and would be excellent as a cut flower because of its height really pretty bold striking color so now this mix down here had 12 bulbs for eight dollars and it was called pride mix it was a really pretty color combination with deeper magenta reds kind of purple tones blushes absolutely beautiful really love that combination this would be beautiful planted in a drift these are a little bit taller 18 to to 24 inches tall and would be great as cut flowers as well but yeah that color combination was just absolutely stunning i loved it now down here was another mix these are called long stemmed mix so you had red with white pinks white yellows purples a bunch of just beautiful spring colors the bulbs were very healthy in the back i just thought they looked absolutely beautiful this one ranged in 16 to 24 inches so once again still good as a cut flower 30 bulbs for 13 so if you're wanting to try your hand at tulips that's the way to go now this variety angelique is very popular you've probably seen it grown by a lot of lot of youtube growers it's all over tick tock it's all over instagram so it's really fun to see this variety at a big box store it's a double tulip so you can see there's tons and tons of petals it's about 12 to 24 inches tall so sometimes it comes in shorter and i have heard quite a few gardeners say that it grows a little bit shorter so at 12 inches it's a little bit tough to utilize it as a cut flower but man it is absolutely stunning now think about mixing those angelic tulips with these these blue diamond diamond tulips absolutely beautiful kind of like a bluish purple tone really pretty with a little bit of light white you know kind of on the edges absolutely stunning it is also a double and it is 14 to 18 inches tall but mixing this variety with the angelique would be gorgeous look at the size so there's some really big bulbs in there but also some really small ones but you can dig through and find the absolute perfect package for yourself i also like these which were called claudia and so they were kind of a magenta purple pink with white margins along the edges of the petals a little bit of a spiky petal which i thought was unique and interesting a little bit different these are about 18 to 24 inches tall so great size for a cut flower and it was six bulbs for five dollars okay so those were some of my favorite tulip bulbs that they had but to show you a couple of different varieties one of the early spring bloomers that's kind of shorter and towards the front of a border is called fritillaria and this one is called uva vulpes i'm sure i just butchered that name because you'll know how terrible i am with pronunciations they're about eight to twelve inches tall and they're kind of beautiful bell-like flowers in that they kind of flop over and turn down and so they look like little bells and they look beautiful when the wind catches them but i love this combination of like purple maroon with kind of yellow inside really really pretty and really soft and such an early bloom they're really fun to have and here's one other variety called malangris and this one had almost like a checker kind of look almost animal skin um maybe like snake skin very cool look maroon blush white very pretty it's 12 bulbs for five dollars and these are super easy to plant because the bulbs are so tiny and petite now hyacinth are one of my favorite bulbs to force inside in early spring but you can also plant them out in their landscape in our area they do have to be pre-chilled for about six to eight weeks and then you plant them out at the end of december beginning of january where it's consistently cold and they do pretty well they do not come back as a perennial so if you do want to reuse these you'll have to lift these at the end of the season they have a very distinct distinctive scent and they just scream spring so not as many bulbs as they typically have in my opinion but still a wide variety and they were super fun to look at pricing was pretty good i do think you can find better pricing online more varieties online but like i said this is about convenience right here so you can just pop into your store and grab some and be done and not have to go through the hassle of getting everything online now they did have another kiosk at the back so i'm going to show you that as well but i caught my eye on this bulb auger right here for 20 the perfect size about three inches for planting bulbs this would be so fun as a gift you can give the auger and then you can give a big bag of those daffodil bulbs that would be such a fun present for someone to kind of add to their landscape and it was really cool that the auger was right here i love the bright green color and i thought the price was pretty good as well before i went to the other kiosk i did want to show you the dutch iris i grow a lot of dutch iris as cut flowers and they are beautiful so this is 12 bulbs for five dollars which is a pretty good price this was a mix but these are really fun bulb that'll come back year after year and that you can utilize for cut flowers now in the back they had a wide variety of lilies which was really fun to kind of look at um i've been paying attention a lot more to lilies as i've seen a lot of people growing them i have a couple of lily trees in my yard that they'll be going on to their second season this next spring i was drawn to this color forever susan because it's fall right now and so i loved all these fall tones thought it was super pretty the price was a seven bulbs for 12.98 which is an okay price about 24 to 36 inches tall i do find that lilies the longer you have them the more robust and beautiful they are you definitely want to push on the bulbs in the packages make sure everything feels strong and healthy this one purple dream was beautiful now i don't always believe the photos that you see on the packages so it's good to go ahead and google it and see what other photos pop up just so you can see the potential variations in the color just so you're not surprised or disappointed now this is a rose lily called eloni and i love watching nicole with flower hill farm and she grew a bunch of rose lilies this year and so they're kind of like a double lily absolutely beautiful you can see the aesthetic of them it's just very elegant whimsical romantic and this was seven bulbs for 12.98 now here's more of the single version of the pink lily this is rosella's dream and i thought it was pretty it's kind of a lighter pink in the center with darker pink on the margins which i thought was nice of course here's red and i've been drawn a lot to the red and i love this like fire engine color it's called red highland and it was seven plants for 12.98 this one was 24 to 40 inches tall you can see there's a wide variation in the lily height this guy was really pretty too a deeper version of the red i love the idea of like mixing the two um the last one and then this one which is called blacklist and kind of having a variation in red in one place i think would be really pretty and striking and finally this one right here kind of have like darker red center with white petals in the outside and it was called tribal kiss really pretty about 24 to 48 inches tall this one was actually the tallest variety and i do think they get taller the longer you grow them the more seasons that you have them but lilies are a fun bulb especially for cut flowers as well okay i'm back in the car it's so hot y'all um okay so bulbs bulbs are different for every zone right just because something works in this zone doesn't mean it's going to work in a different zone and vice versa so that's something to really think about before you go and invest money in bulbs however i do think it's fun to try so i think um the avenue to starting bulbs is daffodils i think daffodils are very easy bulb to grow um i think they give a lot of wow factor earlier in the spring they're going to be some of the first bulbs to actually bloom which is nice to you they're inexpensive and they don't take a lot of care a lot of times you can just leave them and they're just going to give you more and more every year you can divide them maybe every two to four years if you want split up the bulbs spread them out you can do that if you want or not totally up to you but daffodils are really great place to start when planting bulbs so all of the bulbs that i showed today are planted in the fall or winter and then they grow in the spring so like i said a lot of my daffodils those will all go in now but then like my tulips my hyacinth i will pre-chill those in my refrigerator for about 60 days and then i will plant them out in the landscape probably starting in december um and then that they'll do pretty well that way so i did um buy a lot of those online and if you haven't checked out um that particular video i'll drop that link below so you can see which ones i bought and where i bought them from but other than that bulbs are a really fun thing to add in your garden you can tuck them in between shrubs and between perennials and they just give you a burst of color when it's unexpected so definitely if you haven't considered adding bulbs please do so they are wonderful all right you guys hope you enjoyed today's video as always she's a mad gardener or decorator or anything else that she wants to be thanks y'all is is is
