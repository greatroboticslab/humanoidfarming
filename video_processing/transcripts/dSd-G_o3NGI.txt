 Before we start the video, there's a couple of really important things I need to tell you. The first is to make sure that you've made yourself a hot drink and you've got a notepad handy, because there's a lot of information here. And if you want to re-navigate and look back at certain sections of the video, I've made it as easy as possible. So head down into the comments section where I've written a comment with timestamps so you can easily re-watch particular sections. And secondly, I'd like to thank Squarespace for being today's sponsor. So whether you're looking at creating a website or a blog or even an online shop, Squarespace is an all-in-one platform to create a beautiful online presence to share your passion or hobby with the world. Hello and a very warm welcome back to the garden. Now something I've been seeing time and time again is people finding excuses to not start growing their own food or perhaps giving up after only trying for a year or two. And one of the main excuses is that people say growing food takes too much time, which is entirely possible if you approach it without a plan or a strategy or any kind of vision or goals. However, I believe and I know that growing food doesn't actually need to take as much time as possible and I've always been looking at ways to reduce how much time is needed in the garden. Even though I love it up here, there's a lot of other things that needs to happen. And one of the things which has been on the back of my mind the last few months is the whole idea of crop rotation. And so in this video, you're going to find out why I think crop rotation, especially traditional crop rotation, is actually a waste of time. Now don't get me wrong, I think that crop rotation has been an absolutely fantastic tool for gardeners to maintain healthy soils and to also make sure that you reduce pests and disease issues. And before we all get into it, let's just refresh on what crop rotation is. In a nutshell, crop rotation is where you have groups of vegetables and they rotate around the garden. So they always have a new patch of ground to grow in. And the idea behind it is that you're not going to get a build up of pestle diseases or you're not going to then get an imbalance of nutrients in the ground. So take these leeks for example, if you're using a four-year crop rotation, as you would most likely apply to a garden of this scale, these leeks say this is year one, won't be back in place until year five. So all of these groups tend to follow a pattern. So people disagree slightly with the ins and outs, but to keep it simple, it's something like potatoes and cucur bits are followed by roots and alliums, and roots and alliums are followed by legumes and salads, and then legumes and salads are followed by brassicas. And then year five, you go back into your potatoes and cucur bits. I just want to say that you may find this video a little bit controversial, but watch the whole way through because I hope you'll then understand your reasonings if you just think I am going backwards in progress. But what I feel as gardeners is that we're actually going forwards in progress and there's a lot more people now practicing low dig and no dig methods. So for example, we've adapted our own style of low dig method and now it's transitioning slightly into no dig. And when I say slightly, I mean 90% of the garden this year is no dig and the benefits are absolutely amazing. Now we started off with a different soil structure and transitioned from traditional into low dig over the last 15 years or so. But our gardening practices have adapted and as a result, we're we've also been learning a lot more about soil health and how digging, especially double digging soil, just destroys the structure. And you've got microorganisms in the soil which are there to help your plants grow if you have a balanced healthy soil structure. But when you destroy that, you're just inviting pests and diseases. And this is when crop rotation, traditional crop rotation every year was needed because you were not really looking after the more detailed health of the soil. And and you had to rotate crops to try and reduce pests and disease issues. I honestly believe that the style in which we grow our food has been adapting and very, very progressive. However, we've stayed with crop rotation and I feel that crop rotation, the traditional sense has got a bit old school and is now actually a waste of our time because we've been appreciating and respecting our soil a lot more. There isn't actually need for intensive rotation around the beds. Another key development in gardening is that quite often people would grow just one crop in a designated area and then once they harvested that crop, that would be it for the rest of the growing season. But I think we're all really trying to find ways on how we can maximise what we're growing in a single space and get more than one crop or one harvest per season. And one example is we've got another leek bed here because after all we are in Wales. And earlier this year, this is where all our first early potatoes were growing. But now the leeks have taken over and in effect we've already had a little bit of a rotation. And so if say 60, 70, 80% of your growing space has two or more crops a year, you've already done a bit of a crop rotation anyway. Now I think succession planting is something that is very overlooked when it comes to crop rotation because if you want to look at the charts on how to crop rotate, it's always put into years. So what that kind of does is that it just sticks with that traditional way of having something fallow or just one crop per bit of ground every year. And I think this is a huge waste of space because why on earth would you have a raised bed empty for four, five, six months up to half of a year when you could be growing productive food? So one of my favourite permaculture principles is observe and interact. And permaculture is where you just look at nature and use that to inspire you to create efficient systems whether that's in your household or in the garden or on a farm or anywhere. And something that is quite easy to observe in nature is succession and it's kind of split into two key sections. There's short-term succession where say if you have a bit of grass over the months you'll see different plants coming in and out of fruition depending on the season and it will happily stay like that for a few years without any kind of external inputs. Long-term succession is when you have a bit of grass but over the years it then turns into woodland. Now I think we can use nature as a framework to have a fresh approach on how we look at crop rotation to both be really beneficial to the soil but to also save us quite a bit of time. I just want to quickly tell you about today's sponsor Squarespace.

In all honesty having to create a new planting plan every year was such a pain because you didn't have much flexibility because you also had to look at where things were the last three years and then you have really confusing things like swedes and radish who are actually brassicas and should be with their brassicas but this is something I just completely overlook and stick in the root beds and they do absolutely fine. So my version of crop rotation is inspired by nature and that of succession and natural progression so I will happily grow a crop in the same place for three to four years now and that is far less extreme than having to rotate it every single year and the reason why is because I'm confident with how I treat the soil so I will talk more about how we personally maintain soil health with our own way of doing it because this was all kind of just clay topsoil put in and then just adding manure and compost now it's mainly just compost to be honest but I know by applying a top dressing of compost and not digging and just being patient as well patience is very important I will be confident with the health of the plant now I'm not going to be really silly and say if I had a really bad infestation of potato blight and continue trying to grow potatoes in the same soil every year I don't think that's a very good idea so what we do actually is we grow mainly first early and second early potatoes so we can miss out on that potato blight because if the tubers get blighted and you miss a tuber then it will just the spores will stay in the ground and come back to bite you next year if you grow potatoes in the same place but for club roots what I actually recommend you do is grow brassicas in pots of compost for as long as possible so they get super healthy developed root systems before putting them in the ground and you're guaranteed a much better success rate and going to have a much healthier crop so should you have a disease then rotate it but what I would recommend you do is rather than affecting the rest of your planting plan because you might stick to the same planting plan for three years before rotating is rather than shifting everything about just swap it with something else and it's really as simple as that so here's a real life example this is the second year of the squash bed and the second year of the runner beans and in all honesty they're doing absolutely amazingly now for me what I'll probably do is keep them in the same place for another year and then rotate them now if you even just do it for two years think about how much time you're going to save because not only are you going to save your time having to create a whole extra crop rotation plan it also means that you're used to where things are growing and because it's fresh in your memory for an extra year I know oh I already know that this space is designated and you don't have to relearn a planting plan which takes a lot of time and you always feel a bit out of sync and then you finally got used to it but it's already the end of the growing season so for me it's going to be really fresh in my memory next year another key benefit is for example the runner bean structure behind me I don't have to take that down and reassemble it somewhere else in the garden and that's easily going to save me half an hour so it's where you add up lots of different bits and pieces and very quickly you'll find that growing food can be really really efficient for me brassicas can be a real issue because when I start the seed brassica beds I usually end up with way too many seedlings and not enough space and I really want to make the most because I've got all those seedlings it'll be a shame to go to waste and sometimes there's a bit of free area where there are brassicas last year and it usually ends up replanting in the previous year's brassica beds if we need some extra space and it always does really well for us now if you want to see another example it's actually quite inspiring Charles Dowding has been doing some experiments and things like growing leeks for four years in a row in the same place and they're doing really well so if you want to see another working example I've got a link to a video in the video description something you should be aware of if you use a new crop rotation method is if say in year two or three the yield seems a lot lower than the previous year it's not just thinking about crop rotation and the soil structure and the health of that soil but to also think about the weather and compare how much rainfall and the temperatures to last year because that can have just as big of an impact I understand that in this video there was a lot to take in so you can head down into the comment section and I've actually written down all the different sections of the video with time stamps that you can click on so you can refresh and look over certain points and I don't want to get too detailed because it's so easy to get too extreme but what I feel is important is to give people choice and something that's really frustrated me is I feel in the gardening world too often people feel that there are rules which you have to follow but this can be further from the truth yes there are kind of vague general guidelines but the rest is just down to you and your intuition and what you want and gardening is very very creative so it's really down to you being the artist or being the gardener to choose how you want to grow things and what works for you and perhaps you think crop rotation this new method is a completely silly idea I'd love to hear your thoughts or maybe it's something which is going to help save you a lot of time so thank you very much for watching and I look forward to hearing your thoughts
