 that's a big one it's a big box i'm really looking forward to tearing into this one hey what's up garden friends jeff here i hope you're doing well i'm great what could be wrong sitting outside with some boxes from plant delights one of if not my favorite places to order plants online they have an amazing selection they put out their fall catalog just a week or two ago and now i hear i am with more plants all things i'm excited about particularly i was about to say what i have in this one i don't know for sure what's in either one of these i figured bring y'all along cut them open have a look at them and let's talk about them and full disclosure oops knocked something over don't like when this kind of thing happens but here we are when you get a plant in the mail you always want to open them up right away i think there's even like a sign on here that says like help me it's dark or something i don't know i'm not gonna look around the packages you might see my address i have them situated just right so i won't have to bore that out and i didn't have to tape it over oh yeah here it is life plants help let us out we need air light water and tail seat you get it um these showed up last night and it is now 5 p.m the next day they showed up at night so i wasn't rushing to open them up because i wanted to do it on camera and then this morning had a sewer blowout in the house so i was dealing with that you can't just ignore the smell of sewage flying out of your basement i don't know what happened it was something in a sewer line somewhere like burped and then there was just like it was more like pipe bile than anything we don't need to go into all that it was really gross uh but it could have been much worse it was on the concrete didn't get on any of the walls or any carpeting that was in the basement so i consider it to be a life and learning experience and right now i'm just using that to explain to y'all that these have been in the box a day longer than they really should have their shipping was very prompt i don't think them sitting in the package for an additional we'll say 19 hours that that is enough to really do any damage but thought i should let you all know sorry it's not a more pleasant story which could be something more fun and exciting but no it was the sewer under the house burped there's that packaging one of the other reasons not just the amazing selection of plants the way they package them it's just so good i mean look at that they're in a fortress all my papers out there's always a planting guide and an invoice and something else that i'll look at later i don't want to accidentally show my address again so i'm just going to keep that put away how is this okay got the air packs in there that's why it was wedged in more tightly than i figured it would be this is is this just one plant i thought there were going to be two in here but it looks like this is just one well that's exciting oh okay nice and big too okay all right get that out of the way you see what's in here okay i know it's not much to look at right now none of them will be they were just shipped this is a hedicium so hediciums are one of my favorite things to order from them one because they're pretty much the only place that sells them hediciums being the butterfly gingers that's this right here butterfly ginger awesome plant this time of year it's my favorite plant in the garden that is the hedicium flaming torch they sell them in nice big sizes i should take it out before i talk about it much more shouldn't i okay well here's the thing i spoiler alert there's i think two or three more hediciums in this box too maybe i should just get them all opened up before i start going on the specifics of the different ones that i've ordered but i will just highlight right now what a nice big plant this is you can feel the rhizome pushing on the sides of the container that's a plant that is ready to get in the ground and do some growing it's not some little stubby thing where i'm gonna have to grow it out for years before i see anything next year that should be a great big glorious plant they're not like that big and glorious but you get what i'm saying so that means there should be i believe two more hediciums in here and then there are a couple more really cool looking other plants in here yeah yeah okay that's good things are looking good already hediciums and i have a problem i have so many of the butterfly gingers and now i'm adding more and i'll keep adding more because they're awesome plants plant delights is a great source for hediciums these are well i was going to say they're all cocciniums but they're not one of them is a europhyllum let's start with this one right here this is the apple court i don't really know why i brought it closer to the camera there's not a ton to see all i can really tell you is that the pots are nice and full on these the rhizomes that are in here are super strong and ready to take off the apple court is a 7b to 10b goes about 72 inches tall they have one foot tall flower heads on them which have a very nice deep orange flower on them with a red throat they bloom mid-summer and again in early fall i don't know about fragrance with this one i've grown the apple court many many many years ago don't recall fragrance from when i grew it back then either so y'all let me know if you can remember the cocciniums in my experience have been the most cold hardy for my zone 6 now zone 7 garden flaming torch back there in the background one of my all-time favorites the fiesta polani elizabeth slim's orange there are tons i could i have grown so many hedikium flaming torch has been my go-to for the one that i always end up keeping around the apple court beautiful flower on it it's a more saturated orange flower than what you get or what i've ever noticed on my flaming torch hedikium that's in the background over there that's one of the reasons i got it was just maybe a more vibrant pop of color that's pretty much it it's just a really tall beautiful hedikium the next one is uh different and i don't know maybe you shouldn't even have gotten this one we'll talk about why you may notice that this one does look a little bit different than the other two that are over here mainly that there's a reddish to pinkish hint of color at the base of the stem this is a europhylum so it's a hedikium europhylum the other two are cocciniums europhylums aren't typically as cold hardy in my experience that's why i'm like man maybe i shouldn't have gotten it but the description of it was good and i really like the flowers on it so this one right here is called prayer flags it's a 7b to 10b 84 inches tall they have that beautiful red bay stem on them they have a fragrant flower from mid-august and on creamy white flowers with a soft yellow center the best way to describe that the europhylums they hold their flowers in tighter to that cone-like flower bracket that they put up and it just looks really cool and i just thought structurally this would be a neat plant to have around and to try just because it has a neat shape to it that was pretty much all that went into it and fragrance always nice there are lots of other options for fragrance the coronarium great one the gardenerianum or gardenerium great one for fragrance europhylum as well has a sweet honeysuckle like fragrance to it and then the last one this is a really great hedikium really fantastic you can even tell why i like this just from looking at this pot this pot is bulging you can see the rhizome up top as i spill dirt onto myself over here really it's just a vigorous hedikium this is the daniel weeks this has a lot going for it so the daniel weeks again 7b to 10b only goes 50 inches tall i like that about it a lot of hedikiums other than like the slim orange tend to be really big they're very large plants this one they say is the first one to establish as a large clump by they i'm talking about plant delights website they have great descriptions i have little post-its over here so everything i'm telling you the majority of it other than when i say from my experience is from their website so 50 inches tall it's about four feet tall with a one foot tall stock of flower stock on top of it from july to early august is when they start to flower and then they'll keep doing that until frost so that's partially because they're a vigorous fast to clump and fast to establish hedikium meaning that a lot of the others that you'll plant you get a few more stocks out of them every single year and then they flower and it's great and then it's over the flaming torch that's in the background over there love it but the flowers aren't all that long lasting until it becomes a large established clump and then it starts putting up new growth even as it's putting up flower stocks so you have a succession of flowers you get that with the danielle weeks they say that this one for them is the first to establish itself as a large clump which is fantastic like it's one of the reasons that i wanted to get it they have a creamy peach kind of flower on them with an orange throat and the flowers on them tend to be more kind of full i guess is how you would want to describe that that's one of the orange flaming torch it's over there the fiesta a lot of the cocciniums the flowers come up off of a very tall stalk and they're sometimes spread pretty far apart whereas on the danielle weeks they just have more of a plush look to them because they hold their flowers a little bit closer together because it's a smaller stock so they're just naturally closer together which makes them look more full they say that they have reports of these being hardy to zone six down to minus seven degrees fahrenheit which is pretty cool and i can tell you from my experience a lot of cocciniums hdicium cocciniums are hardy into zone six you just need to mulch them very heavily but i can't think of any coccinium ever actually that i planted not coming back for me unless we've had a really really really bad winter which is why some of these i have grown before because there was an occasion where we had a bad winter that knocked out a bunch of mine oh and they're saying that the daniel weeks is probably a hybrid of hdicium flavicins and the gardenerium which is good because that means that there should be a heavy fragrance oh it even says on their website says that they have a nice heavy fragrance in the evening i don't remember that from when i grew daniel but that was an awfully long time ago back in the day this garden used to get a lot of sunlight and this berm that's back here used to be crepe myrtles tuscaroo crepe myrtles and on each end i had the daniel weeks and i loved them they didn't come up super tall like the flaming torches did they just they fit into the garden space a little bit better i have narrow garden beds so as much as i love that flaming torch it's over there having something that's going to save more on the smaller side for a hdicium is the main reason that i want them and the fragrance anytime you can throw fragrance into the mix i'm on board i love having lots and lots and lots of nice smells out here in the garden so those are the gingers you know i love my gingers i'll always be getting more and playing around with them experimenting with them popping them into different places and dividing them up as time goes on the last two i just realized i've been rattling the tripod and the camera i'm sorry hopefully that wasn't too annoying the last two that were the ones that were wrapped up in paper these are ones that i am so excited about look at that there's another one i'll get the other one there we go there's two of them you might actually want to be able to see them bring you down so you can have a nice look at them aren't those beautiful these are agave they're despotianas the type is galactic traveler also called blue moon a very i don't know how to put this um internet popular agave is that how you would say it i made sure to play with my camera settings as much as possible i don't know what your screen settings are for what you're going to see but from what i'm looking at this is pretty true to what i'm seeing they might be just a hint that more silvery blue in person than what i'm seeing on my screen right now look at how big and full these guys are these are really nice sized plants so the desmontianas they're more of a tropical agave these are going to need to be treated as house plants here unless you're i want to say probably 9b and up maybe 9a they need to be brought inside during the winter the main thing is that they just they don't experience frost or freezing right maybe a very light and very brief frost but i don't even know about that because they're very good anytime you have the variation those yellow margins they're not going to be quite as cold tolerant these un-chlorophyll areas tend to suffer the most the quickest i should say when you have a cold spell they make good house plants though so that's why i got them because they can go inside they can be very drought tolerant if you have them in a well-drained soil then you can water them to your heart's desire as long as they're not sitting in that water they'll do fine so it's just versatile that's why i love agaves they're very versatile plants the desmatianas they don't typically have spines on them and you could i guess you could maybe call these spines but i would call that spineless it's not like gonna do any damage you can feel it maybe if your skin's really soft that might do something to you but for the most part it's pretty harmless you see like there's some ridges in there like they have fake spines but it's not something that's gonna hurt you which makes them another great candidate for a plant that i would be moving around some agaves i'm gonna bring over my lomkey over here my potato beautiful agave also from plant delights got this one last year i just love the variegation on this one it's a very mild variegation where you just have some green some silver and some blue in there this one it you touch those spines you're gonna bleed it'll get you so it's one that i have to move around with caution that's why i typically always try and pop my agaves up into containers that are much larger in diameter than the actual plant lomkey's just done some growing so now it's sticking out and it's hard to find a spot where you can safely grab the container which is that's a good thing you'll want your plants to grow but it's also you know dangerous don't have to worry about that with the desmatianas so this one right here the reason it's so popular is because of the variegation look at that variegation you have that nice lemony yellow margin on the outside with a silvery blue on the inside i believe they describe it i wrote it down what they said their description which is going to be much better than mine here's what they say spineless rubbery leaves with glistening silver blue centers highlighted with a lemon yellow margin yeah i'd say that's about right and i don't know how it's going to show on camera but they do have a glisten there's a shine almost that you can only see when you move them around or i'm only seeing when i move them around but the color combo in here i think it's just it's beautiful and these are going to get more vibrant too right these have been grown in a i don't want to call it a shade house but they grow everything undercover right that's how you do it when you're growing things in mass you don't want them exposed directly to the sun that just makes upkeep a lot more difficult so when i transition these to full or maybe part sun to full sun they should become even more vibrant they're a more vigorous agave too these max out at about 36 inches tall they have a nice more of an upright shape to them so with agaves you tend to have squat and fat like the ovettifoliums or a lot of other agaves or ones that come up just a little bit higher and then have that weepy appearance to them so these will come up taller and then the then the ends of the leaves will kind of arch down and sort of be like this kind of thing it's really cool looking it does also give me like yucca color guard vibes but more refined and elegant i suppose is how i would put that it's just a fun plant there's some really great variegated agaves out there there's one i think it's called joan hoek or joe hook maybe i can't remember i'll put up here on the screen that has some amazing variegation on it very colorful an awesome plant that's going to be on my list for the next time i order from plant delights because it's just such a beautiful plant and again a more friendly agave to have around move them outside when you don't have to about frost anymore and you move them back inside when you do have to worry about frost in the winter time i don't water my agaves very much when they're indoors outside water to my heart's desire and just making sure that they're not ever sitting in water really easy to care for if you're into variegated agaves plant delights that's your source they have the most i've ever seen anybody sell when it comes to different types of agaves period let alone variegated agaves and actually the same thing with hadichiums they tend to rotate their supply of which ones they're offering but at times they have a very good selection of the butterfly gingers that are back there and hostas hellebores they just have a very wide selection of plants in general their facilities are very very heavily focused on education and on conservation they sell a good amount of plants that are endangered in the wild which i love because it raises awareness for issues that are going on with plants and it helps to combat poaching right taking plants from the wild when we need to be leaving them alone and just raise awareness and education about what's going on with certain areas and certain plants and helping to keep those plants in circulation in people's gardens so that should they become extinct in their natural environment we've got some backup genes for things i don't know why i'm pointing to this this is not you don't there's aren't really variegated agaves in the wild that's not really a thing like cypripediums they have a great selection of cypripedium orchids and they are more pricey but it's because they grow them out properly they're not poached from the wild a lot of the times you order cypripediums online if you're just getting like the pubicens of one of the ones that is native that's probably been dug up not necessarily but something to look into yeah i don't have to wear that with plant delights that and their plant descriptions are just entertaining they're a fun place to shop very fun place to shop and okay that's gonna do it y'all seen the plants this is part one of probably two or three because i have a shade garden i'm working on behind me and i'm gonna be placing more orders from them to try and get some fun unique plants that don't ever or i should say often see at other nurseries or online another great thing about plant delights is a lot of plants hit the market they're one of the first places to start them out or have them or potentially with a good amount of plants the only place to sell them period okay yeah comment down below hope everybody's doing well i'm on a great day great life and everything's going absolutely beautifully for you look at that isn't that beautiful i loved soft variegation and the contrast i should have said all this when i was talking about it before i like that the stripe that you get with that yellow margin is distinct but also complementary does that make sense it doesn't contrast too strongly sometimes it's just a really intense yellow against green and that's just i don't know it doesn't really do it for me but this it's very soft you get like a lemon lime vibe with this i guess the galactic part is because they do have a sheen to them which you really like i said only notice when you move them around but i guess when you have plants you might be walking around them so it might become noticeable if that were the case and it's kind of blue it should get more blue as they get more so we've been through all that comment down below some of your favorite plants that you're dealing with right now do you have some favorite agaves that you like to grow your experience with the hiddikiums let us know all right as always and most importantly everybody keep on growing bye you
