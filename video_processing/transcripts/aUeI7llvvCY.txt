 okay this is my first stage nursery for this year it is a bag that a Walmart bed bed pack came in so the quilt and the pillow covers and all that fun stuff but anyway it's perfect first stage nursery okay so last night I created some soil blocks in this silicon ice mold and here we are ready to check them all right these were the two that held together and they are pretty dense you can see they're starting to collapse on the bottom because they were sitting in water this one is much more much less coherent I think the clay is going to hold them together the the trick here will be making them hold together when they're dry and when they're wet like this so where did I put my seeds I decided sort of that when I do this for real I need to do the seeds a little bit differently but now I can't find the seeds that I pulled out okay so there's two cucumber seeds and I'm doing the cucumber seeds for a couple of reasons oh there's the seeds that I picked okay they were on the other side so the cucumber seeds are going to germinate relatively quickly they are pointed so they will go in relatively easily there we go okay so I'm going to keep these damp and see what happens and then hopefully by the time they are big enough to have outgrown their blocks which should happen relatively quickly the greenhouse will be ready so that they can go out there and since cold tolerance is one of the things I am checking for I am just fine with that and if they die they die no big deal I have lots and lots and lots of cucumber seeds this year so I'm going to be doing cucumber work all right so there's two our soil blocks I think I'm getting a better idea of what needs to be done first of all the soil needs to be pre-wetted not not just water in the bottom of the containers or poured into the containers but it needs to be pre-wetted but only to a certain level the if it's too wet it's just gonna fall apart as soon as I too wet or too dry it's just gonna fall apart so we will watch these cucumbers and see what happens I will talk with you later
