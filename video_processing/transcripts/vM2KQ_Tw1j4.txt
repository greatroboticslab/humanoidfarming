Education
 Good evening. Good evening. I was in charge of the weather yesterday and the day before, but I'm not sure who took that today. As our school's name indicates, it is our mission to educate in both theology and ministry. Tonight's program is a prime example of the partnership of those two disciplines, with two members of our own faculty, one specializing in systematic theology and one in pastoral theology. It's my pleasure to introduce them to you this evening. First, Dr. Dominic Doyle serves the School of Theology Ministry as associate professor of systematic theology. Born in London, England, Dominic is a graduate of the University of Cambridge, of Harvard Divinity School, and also earned his doctorate in systematic theology here at Boston College. Dominic's theological interests include the theology of culture, grace, the doctrine of God, and theological anthropology, with a particular focus on Thomas Aquinas and Karl Rahner. The author of The Promise of Christian Humanism, Thomas Aquinas on Hope, published by Crossroad Herder in 2012, Dominic has also contributed numerous essays, which have appeared in such journals as theological studies, your Gorgorianum, Irish theological quarterly, and studies in spirituality. As well as he's written also, he's also written several chapters in books. His essay, A Future, Difficult Yet Possible Good, Defining Christian Hope, is included in a collection on Christian hope by STM faculty, which the bookstore is selling this evening. Dr. Doyle is the recipient of numerous awards, including the John Templeton Award for Theological Promise, the Catholic Theological Society of America's Catherine Lacuna Award for New Scholars, and an analytic theology course award from the University of Notre Dame's Center for Philosophy and Religion. Last year, Dominic won an award for his contribution to an international essay competition for reengaging science in seminary formation sponsored by John Carroll University. His prize-winning article is entitled Theological Virtue and the Psychology of Happiness. Most importantly, he's still number one in his mother's heart. Dr. William Rosenbaum is a pastoral theologian, pastoral counselor, and pastor. Ordained in the Reformed Church in America, Bill joined STM's faculty last fall as assistant professor of pastoral care and counseling. Prior to coming to Boston College, Bill taught as an adjunct professor of practical theology and pastoral and spiritual care and counseling. He served as a clinical staff member and as a congregational and community liaison for a community mental health agency, and also led a congregation as an interim pastor in Redlands, California. Do you miss Redlands right now, Bill? Bill has served the church in pastoral roles and has worked with clergy, congregations, and higher ecclesial adjudicating entities on conflict management, staff relations, crisis intervention, restoration and renewal processes, and ongoing health and wellness. Additionally, he has taught on various topics in churches, community-based organizations, hospitals, universities, and seminaries. Bill is also a certified pastoral counselor, and for over 12 years, he has provided pastoral counseling services to individuals, couples, and families in both clinical and parish settings. Dr. Rosenbaum's own research is in the area of clergy, wellness, and neuroplasticity. In his recently published book, Neuroplasticity, Performativity, and Clergy Wellness, Neighbor Love as Self-Care, published last year by Lexington, he provides a model of relational wellness and explores the potential for a person's practices to induce life-giving changes to the structure and function of the brain, leading to an expansive love of neighbor as oneself. Some copies of this volume are available at the bookstore table in the back. So it's my pleasure to present to you two accomplished faculty members who will explore for us theological virtues and psychological wellness, cultivating practices of well-being. I present to you Dominic Doyle and Bill Rosenbaum. Thank you very much, Tom, for the introduction, and thank you to Melinda. It was her idea to put Bill and I together today. And it was a great idea. And thank you to you all for making your way through the snow and the rain on a cold night. The structure of the talk is in two parts. The first part will be half an hour reflection from me on what the tradition has meant by the theological virtues. And then I'll just share a couple of suggestions on how these traditional virtues might connect with insights from established ideas in psychology. And for me, there's a handout. I don't know if you had a chance to pick it up. Maybe someone at the back, if you raise your hand, they could bring around extra copies if you don't have a copy of the handout, if you want to just follow some of the key points. Then in the second half hour, Bill will take these ideas further in light of more recent insights in neuroscience with an eye to how we practice and live out these virtues. So I'm just the warm up act, really, for Bill. So three points I'm going to make. First is what do we mean by the theological virtues? And then two reflections on how they could be connected to psychology. First off, the theological virtues are a big deal. Faith, hope, and charity are the heart of Christian identity. I was reliably informed by Tom when I prepared this part of the lecture two minutes ago. One Thessalonians opens with Paul reflecting on faith, hope, and love. The first writings we have from Paul in the opening paragraph, the first Christian writings we have, talk about faith, hope, and love. And his most famous writings, Paul's most famous writings in 1 Corinthians chapter 13, at their high point that you may have heard at numerous weddings, talk about faith, hope, and love remain. And the greatest of these is love. Subsequent theologians like Augustine's Enchiridion or his handbook are structured around faith, hope, and love. And Aquinas' compendium that he wrote for a friend who said, what's it all about in theology? And he wrote about faith, hope, and love. And even his Summa Theologiae, his main more systematic text, he structured the main central part of it around faith, hope, and love. And as you know, the recent papal encyclicals, Deus caritas est, spe salve, and lumen fide, are about the three theological virtues. So the church then is a community of faith, hope, and love. And we can think of the church as a school of these virtues, to train our desires and imaginations to live in faith, hope, and love. These virtues then are how we let our lives become part of God's life, how we let our stories get rewritten into the Bible's story of God's steadfast love. So that's the significance. What do we mean by these three theological virtues? Well, first of all, it's important to remember that they're a unity. Nicholas Lash, the former professor of theology at Cambridge University had a joke that he could never finish because he cracked himself up. And it began like there was a very devout couple who had three very pious daughters called Faith, Hope, and Gladys. But really, we have to think of these like these sisters as a unity. So that when we talk about these things, they're a unity. But we can distinguish them just for the sake of reflection. So what do they mean individually? Faith, as Hebrews 11 puts it, is the assurance of things hopeful, the conviction of things not seen. Faith involves a personal response to God's self-revelation in the person of Jesus Christ. It is the acceptance of the offer to share in God's own life by following Jesus as his disciple. And so faith involves some kind of assent to certain truths. It has a cognitive, if you like, aspect to it. Aquinas argues that these truths of faith that are contained in the Bible are summarized in the Creed. And anticipating Twitter by several centuries, he said you can boil down the Creed to two fundamental truths, God is and God cares. So at the heart of Christian faith, then, is the affirmation, the reassurance, of God's existence and providence. Moving to hope. Hope is the desire for a future difficult yet possible good. For Christians, hope, like faith, is twofold. In that one, it seeks to be united with God's eternal existence. And two, it relies upon God's help or God's providence to reach that goal. And so hope then relates to God as future goal and as present helper. In fact, hope is only a theological virtue when it relies upon God's help here and now to reach that future goal. Hope then is an attitude of trusting expectation that moves a person towards the goal that faith has shown. Hope is therefore the point at which the believer becomes a pilgrim. If faith gives the person conviction about the central Christian beliefs, then hope convinces others that that person really believes those claims because they are held despite the difficulties they entail. Charity is the culmination of the theological virtues, since it unites the person to God and to neighbor in friendship. What was previously separated, person from person and humanity from God, now share, and this is Virginia Woolf's phrase that I can't find, but I'm sure she said it, they share in overlapping pools of consciousness. It's a lovely phrase of what ripples in ourselves ripples over and affects our neighbor. In this relationship, which is made possible by God sharing divine happiness, the pilgrim can rest with God in mutual and benevolent friendship, in Aquinas' terms. In this union, the person is, in a way, transformed to the goal that was shown in faith and approached in hope. The pilgrim becomes, in the words of 2 Peter 1-4, participants in the divine nature, or sharers in God's life. So that's just a brief snapshot of each theological virtue. And this allows us to describe how they approach or relate to God in different ways. Faith encounters God in the basic terms of truth, not in the sense of certainty or proof, but rather in the sense of God's truthfulness or reliability. And we can quickly recognize the importance of truth when you recall the last time someone lied to you or evaded the truth or withheld it. We cannot have a serious relationship without truthful communication. And faith is the acceptance of God's self-communication as the ultimate truth. And so that's why, for Aquinas at least, faith is the first of the theological virtues. For it shows a meaningful awareness of God's purpose for humanity. If faith encounters God as truth, then hope approaches God in terms of mercy and power. For we need a compassionate and powerful helper to reach a difficult and distant goal. In hope, we realize that God has the motive and the means to save. Hope relies upon God's power and is awakened by God's mercy, a sense that God is present to human misery. What is mercy? Mercy is the heartfelt sorrow at another's suffering and the desire to remove the suffering. This loving kindness of chesed is recounted again and again in the Hebrew Bible and is embodied for Christians in Jesus Christ. Hope then involves encountering God's power and mercy simultaneously, a sense at once of God's exalted transcendence from and intimate presence in creation. Finally, since charity unites the person to God as friend, it relates to God in terms of God's goodness, not just self-referentially as the good for me, my hoped-for salvation. The person with charitable friendship loves God, not just for what God has done for me, but simply on account of God's goodness itself. Charity does not seek something else from God. It simply rests in God. God is no longer a means to an end, something useful to me. God is now the end itself, intrinsically good. As such, Aquinas says, charity makes us tend or move to God by uniting the longing of the person to God, so that we live not for ourselves, but for God. For Aquinas, then, charity is the form of the virtues, since it unites the person to God and thus gives shape and purpose to all of human life, all the other virtues. It gathers the whole person into God's enveloping love, and so makes the person a transparent agent of God's love in the world, an instrument of your peace, in the words of St. Francis of Assisi. And so, if through hope we receive God's power and mercy in our own difficulties, then in love, we are empowered to become agents of God's mercy to others in their difficulties. So that's the basic elements of the three theological virtues, as Aquinas lays them out. And we can see now why faith is foundational in Christian life. It ascends to the basics of God's existence and providence, especially as revealed in Christ. Hope then arises from this ascent as it moves the person towards a future difficult yet possible goal of eternal life with God, a journey pioneered by Christ, as Hebrew puts it. And finally, charity unites the person to God, a union that is modeled on Christ, so that we become by adoption through the Spirit, as Paul puts it, what Christ is by nature, namely a beloved child of God. In charity then, for Aquinas, the pilgrim can experience even now something of the peace and joy that will come with the journey's end. So these are the three theological virtues. And they're called theological because they are infused or given by God's grace, not achieved by our effort. But they're called virtues because they change the person. They heal and elevate our knowing and loving so that we can cooperate with God's grace to build the kingdom. And so, as theological virtues, they are divinely infused, yet humanly possessed. They lead the person to God and so perfect the person. Together these three key markers of Christian identity answer the three great questions of a Christian virtue ethics, as Jim Keenum puts it. Who are we, the church? We are people of faith. Who do we want to become? A people of love. How do we get there? By hope. So that's the first part that I wanted to mention, that what we mean, what does the tradition mean by theological virtues? And now just a couple of insights from psychology and how they could perhaps shed some deeper light on what we mean by these virtues. The first insight comes from Carl Rogers' notion of the three core therapeutic traits of a skilled counselor. That is acceptance, empathy, and congruence, or authenticity. So this is one of the foundational ideals of humanistic psychology. And I'm struck by a resemblance between the key traits of the therapeutic caregiver, acceptance, empathy, and congruence, or authenticity, and the three theological virtues of faith, hope, and love. Specifically, there seems to be an analogy between the client's psychological experience of the therapist as accepting, as empathetic, as congruent, or authentic. And the believer's spiritual experience of the divine as justified by faith, as compassionately supportive through hope, as authentically present in love. So the analogy lies then in the similar ways in which the receiver, that is the client or the believer, undergoes a profound healing of consciousness because of his or her experience of the attitude and gifts of the provider, the therapist, or God. In a nutshell, and this is on the handout if you want to see it sort of mapped out, Aquinas' account of the believer's differentiated experience of God as reassuring truth in faith, as empowering helper in hope, as a therapist's unwavering goodness in charity is analogous to the client's ideal experience of a therapist as accepting, empathetic, and congruent. So that's the claim. Let's spell it out in a bit more detail one by one. The first key trait of the therapeutic caregiver is acceptance. What does this mean? This unconditional positive regard involves a provider's full, warm, and non-possessive acceptance of the client, independent of her internalized conditions of worth. It is a non-judgmental and deep valuing of the humanity of the person in need, even in the face of that person's reluctance or hostility. As such, the client's experience of the therapist's attitude of acceptance resembles a believer's experience of God's justification by faith. For just as conditions of worth are irrelevant for how the therapist sees the client, so the achievement of works are irrelevant for how God sees the person. In both cases, the receiver finds herself accepted into a relationship without any judgmental reckoning of her prior worthiness. The key terms of acceptance and regard echo the cognitive emphasis of faith, which concerns a belief about how things are as distinct from a distinction about a decision about what needs to be done. Faith brings to awareness God's unmerited gift of grace, which cannot be earned by any works. Faith, then, is the recognition of a prior enveloping experience of God's unchanging, unconditional acceptance. It is a surfacing of a basic truth about God. As with the realization of acceptance in the therapeutic relationship, it is more personal than propositional. For at its heart is a recognition of the dignity of the person as accepted by God and is able to be accepted into eternal union with God. As faith reassures the person of her great worth, it establishes the relationship that itself constitutes the healing process. In this way, faith gives a theological horizon within which the therapeutic attempt to see and accept the client's worth comes into proper focus. So, if faith and acceptance regard the fundamental attitude that establishes relationship, then hope and empathy describe the process through which that relationship grows. Empathy is the ability to feel the experiences and grasp the meanings of the client as if one were the other person, but without ever losing the as-if condition. Precisely because of this compassionate presence that is not overwhelmed by suffering, the alienation of persons in need gradually recedes as they are accompanied by an effective helper through their difficulties. Self-esteem, therefore, grows, and uncomfortable truths can now be faced rather than denied or suppressed. Self-esteem, therefore, is a constant. Empathy thus involves being with the client through this painful process of healing past psychological damage and undoing neurotic bondage to conditions of worth. The parallels with theological hope become clear when one remembers that hope is not simply about the individual achievement of goals, but also and primarily about the help we receive from others to reach them. In this broader interpersonal understanding of hope, the believer relies upon divine mercy and power to overcome the many obvious difficulties that prevent the person achieving the goal of his or her dignity that was revealed in faith. In a word, in hope, the person now experiences the empathy of God. Just as the ideal therapist feels a deep somatic processing of the experience of the broken person beyond mere reflection on the client's words, so God, through Christ, is truly present to human suffering in the cross, and so grounds Christian hope. This redemptive, empathetic presence undoes human alienation from others and from God because it enables one to face and address the difficulties that are at the root of alienation. If faith establishes the relationship that reveals the transcendent dignity of the person, then hope names the effects of the dynamic empathetic interventions that support the believer through the cruciform way that that dignity is won. In this way, hope opens up a new and deeper relationship with God called charity. So, if acceptance and faith establishes relationship and empathy and hope enables it to grow, then congruence or charity accounts for its healthy flourishing as it draws upon the genuineness of the caregiver. A congruent therapist is one who is authentic, genuine, transparent. Her outward responses to her client consistently match the inner feelings and sensations which she has for the client. So, whereas acceptance names an attitude, and empathy names a process, congruence names a state of being. This threefold distinction mirrors the awareness of faith, which assents to the truth, the reassurance of God's unconditional acceptance, the motion of hope, which relies upon God's empowering empathy through life's difficulties, and the union of charity, which shares in God's own life. When the believer is united to God's love. For example, as wrathful for the unrepentant, as distant, for the indifferent, and so on. The therapeutic notion of congruence or authenticity, then, sheds light on the theological virtue of charity, which can now be seen as the basic experience of God as how God actually is, as loving. So, that's the first psychological comparison I wanted to mention. And now to move to the second and final comparison with insights from psychology. I explore how, and I had to look up on YouTube how to pronounce his name, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, how his influential notion of flow, enhanced by Jonathan Haidt's more recent and physiologically grounded notion of elevation, can enrich our understanding of what we mean by charity. I've already tried to show how the idea of congruence sheds light on this idea of charity. But as with all elements of that earlier correlation between therapeutic attitudes and theological virtues, the prime referent was the person's experience of God as accepting in faith, as empathetic in hope, and as congruent in charity. And so, that correlation gave psychological expression to how the person approaches God in the journey from faith to hope and love. But since we're dealing with virtues, we must also ask how these experiences of God transform the human. For although the theological virtues are divinely given without merit, they are also humanly possessed as excellences, hence the term virtue. The goal, then, is not just to describe how the person experiences God. We must also account for how the person experiences herself in that encounter with God and how she changes as a result. So, I propose to explore the hypothesis, which is on the handout, that if congruence names how the gift of charity allows the person to experience God, then elevation names how the person experiences herself in that encounter with God's love. And flow names how the person experiences the ongoing consequences of that love in her life. So, let's begin with elevation. Elevation refers to the heartfelt emotion of being lifted up in response to overwhelming and deeply impressive moral beauty. It combines the usually separate experiences of personal intimacy and hierarchical distance or awe. And so, it makes what is radically beyond feel personally close. As such, it combines our ordinary experiences on the horizontal level of familiar love and friendship and the hierarchical level of belonging to a big organization, a patriotic duty. Positively, elevation results in deeper attachments and more benevolent bonding with those who share in that experience. So, we can see elevation, then, as perhaps the subjective side of the encounter with divine love. As the person touches an encompassing sacred dimension, often through moral experience of moral beauty in the lives of the saints, their commitment to moral goodness now becomes, as Lonergan would put it, a spiritual holiness. That loves beyond the circle of personal friends and cares further than the boundaries and obligations of one's group. Human development thus grains a new vector that breaks out of the restrictions or the limits of a two-dimensional plane that's limited to the comfortable, narrow circle of personal intimacy and the group differentiating allegiance to an impersonal authority. Human development thus far, the person's life, the person's life, and the person's life, such that they are open upwards to new life with God and open outwards to new belonging in society. In the catchy phrase of Jonathan Haidt, it inspires and rewires from cynicism, resignation, and so on. It establishes a lasting disposition to grow in and pass on this love. So, let's move on now to the final point I want to make, the notion of flow that comes out of positive psychology. If congruence names how the person with charity experiences God, and elevation names how the person experiences herself in that encounter with God, then flow names how she experiences the ongoing results of that encounter with God, as a peak experience becomes a settled disposition. What does flow mean? For Csikszentmihalyi, flow is the joyful and often creative psychological experience of continual and total absorption in an activity that is its own reward. In such experiences, self-consciousness recedes as action and awareness merge. The sense of ordinary time alters as one is deeply immersed in a challenging task that matches one's skills. Clearly, this concept can apply to a broad spectrum of activities, many of which are not directly relevant to theology, such as gambling, unless you took Pascal's wager as a good theological point. To make it theological, one must therefore set it in the context of a prior experience of some kind of elevation, such that the flow we are now talking about is spiritually recognizable, and can extend the discussion beyond neighbor love to include the love of God. This notion that I am proposing of elevated flow can deepen our account of the Christian vocation to love, and even cast some light on some vexing issues. As an initial and general justification for this comparison between flow and charity, it comes from the verbal similarity between the root metaphors of flow and Aquinas' term for the gift of divine love, what he calls infusion, which is just flowing in, Romans 5.5. And what flows must come from a source. And for Christians, that's believed to be the source of infinite love. Now that the blockages of neurotic attachment to finite conditions of worth, a lack of faith, and of despairing recognition of new life, lack of hope, are overcome, the person may be elevated into union with the divine. As a result, unrestricted love can now flow into the world through the created instrumental agency of persons who cooperate with this love, and whose character, as a result, is gradually transformed over time. So this theological experience of flow gives personal resonance of the metaphysical notion of a non-competing relationship between God and humanity. For persons who live in charity are radically dependent on a source beyond themselves, yet they flourish in direct proportion to that dependence. We could also think of flow as helping us address certain problems in debates about charity. For example, since flow involves the loss of self-consciousness in meaningful activity, alongside significant development of the self in a challenging task, it helps address the problem of a misconceived opposition between self-love and other love, an especially important concern for many psychologists who rightly question unhealthy exhortations to self-sacrifice. Conceiving charity as flow suggests a vision of altruistic love that does not deplete the self, but rather elevates and strengthens it. Interpreted theologically, flow is not simply an end in itself, as it appears to be for positive psychology, but rather is instead part of the larger project of self-gift for the broadest possible common good. As such, this flow as libation, as Paul might put it, the pouring out of the self in 2 Timothy 4.6, allows us to see that self-sacrifice is not the primary goal, but rather a side effect of losing oneself in meaningful activity, precisely when that activity is defended non-violently in the face of opposition. That's what I have for you tonight. I'll hand over to Bill now, who can pursue these thoughts with more recent insights. Thank you. I thought I'd put a PowerPoint up there, because if I get too boring, at least you have something to look at. And also, as Dominic and I were sharing, we thought it would be nice to have a little contrast. And so we'll be going through the slides. We may have to move quickly, because you were good on time, so I'll try to do my best, because we want to save some time for discussion and questions and so on. And so hopefully these will dovetail well, especially as Dominic was sharing about this idea of elevated flow, because one of the passions that I have and why I wrote the book and why I'm doing the work that I'm doing is that I think that we're called to model a threefold love of God, or a threefold love in life. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love your neighbor, all of you who know it, as you love yourself. Although in my experience, a lot of us who grew up in the church stopped listening. We love God, we love neighbor, and somehow the self gets lost in the midst of that. And somehow we equate self-love to narcissism or unhealth or egoism. And I don't think that's what Christ was really calling us to do. And so that's what we're going to look at a little bit, is how practices of virtue might help increase our capacity to love our neighbor as ourself. And so the beginning point is to think about who we are as human beings. So Psalm 8, 3 through 5 asks God, you know, who or what are human beings or human persons that you're mindful of us? And this is an important question, because understanding who we are and who we might become is not just merely for our own self-understanding, but it's also for reflection on the ethical implications of living together with other human persons in a space of limited resources. So put simply, how one answers the question, who are we in forms and shapes, how we enact and how we embody the question of how then ought we live amongst one another. And these are deeply spiritual and theological questions. And what I was fascinated with is that neuroscience provides new ways of thinking about the human person and new lenses and layers for understanding who we are, who we are called to be, and then how ought we live together, loving our neighbor as ourselves. So we'll go through some of the slides. One of the starting points for me is looking at what do I mean by wellness? Because I think that's an important concept. And I intentionally use that term wellness rather than the more common term, although we're catching up nowadays. The more common term of wholeness. And I use that because wholeness kind of captures what Larry Kant Graham put in the dictionary of pastoral care and counseling back in 1990, that there was a sort of a fourfold aspect using the Hebrew term shalom. Graham said that there is a bodily wholeness. There's a mental and emotional functioning. There's interpersonal reconciliation. There's spiritual aliveness. And then ultimately it comes together in this dynamic wholeness of body, mind, spirit, society, and the world being in proper relation to God. And yet as I was thinking about this, I thought, well, I hear wholeness all the time, but what does it actually mean to be a whole person? In fact, I might say the term wholeness is pretty in vogue. It's just everywhere. And I thought, you know, there are things about the embodied self that maybe are more well, and there are things about the embodied self that maybe are less well. So for me, wellness means a more nuanced, multilayered, and embodied construction of well-being. So one is attuned with one's whole embodied self. We don't disconnect our embodied being. If I had more time, I would go in throughout Scripture where we see that God created us in these bodies, and it's not just a container for our soul or ourself. It's really who we are, that God created us out of the dust and breathed life into us. And so we are more connected with our embodied self, others, and God. We pay attention to what I would call the agentic performative practices, that this body can move. And based on some research we'll look at in neuroscience, that that constructs who we become. We're more aware of our embodied self. We also can increase the ability to regulate and integrate the communication of our embodied brain ecosystem. That's a term that I coined because no one else wanted it. It's too long. But my editor liked it, so we kept it in the book. So the embodied brain ecosystem, if you come up with a shorthand, that's better, because really it captures that our brain, which I'll talk about in a few minutes, is embodied. It's not the gray cabbage in our skulls. But it also pays attention to adequate sleep and rest and nourishment. It pays attention to meaningful connections and relationships. It pays attention to the capacity for empathic encounters with others, taking seriously, love your neighbor as yourself. And really, it's an ongoing pursuit of living abundantly, individually, communally, and globally. And in a sense, we could think about it theologically as there's an eschatological quality to being well, that we are already whole, and yet we in our world are not wholly well. And so we're in the process of living into that wholeness. And so then I started saying, well, how do we connect wellness to these understandings of virtue and practices of virtue? And so I pulled out a few of the definitions, and you see there that virtue is a habitual practice. It's a way of disposition towards the good. It allows a person to not only perform good acts, but to give the best of him or herself. Virtuous persons tend towards the good with all of his or her sensory and spiritual powers. He or she pursues the good and chooses it in concrete actions. And Dominic talked a lot about the theological virtues. And what I found is that we also have cardinal virtues or moral virtues. And we see the distinction is that the theological virtues are bestowed upon us by God's grace as a gift to us. And then the cardinal or moral virtues are ones that we are acquired, and I would say maybe perfected or performed in a way that increases our living into the calling that Christ has placed upon us, aided by God's grace. So we co-participate with grace. And so the virtue ethicists don't ask the question, what decision should I make? But they ask the question, what kind of person should I become? Which fits into the research and the interest that I have that our practices perform, essentially, have a performative quality and construct our identity. So I also draw on James Keenan's work. And his argument is that we should modify the cardinal virtues from prudence, justice, temperance, and fortitude to the one there on the right where we have justice, fidelity, self-care, and prudence. And I don't have time to go into all of the different facets, but I think his argument is done well, and he makes a valid point. And the research that I did was on clergy well-being, but it could be expanded to many people of faith, that we need to take seriously as yourself. Love the Lord your God. Love your neighbor. Love yourself. So what I'm going to argue for is, in addition to the bidirectional nature that I think our embodied brain ecosystem communicates, I think our practices of virtue could have a bidirectional nature. So we could have a top-down approach. And that mindset might be that the virtues and virtuous behaviors kind of flow out of our character. So the good person produces good acts and behaviors. And there's also a bottom-up approach where our good acts and behaviors create a good person. As Dominic and I were kind of talking about, this is sort of the chicken and the egg double helix of, is it behavior that constructs character, or then character enables us to behave and act in certain ways? And I would say it's both, but I want to pay particular attention to what I would call bottom-up performative practices and how those will then form and construct our identity. You see a quote there at the bottom, Stanley Haueros, basically saying that the virtues in the final living of our lives, shaped by prudence and anticipating and responding to the virtuous claims that make someone good. Again, it's that behavioral, ongoing practice quality. We could also expand the virtues to look more at spiritual practices. And again, if I had more time, we could go into some of these, but I'm drawing on my esteemed colleagues, Colleen Griffith and Tom Groom, and they've written about how spiritual practices have always been central to the Catholic identity in faith. And in fact, they would argue that if they're not sort of a lived daily experience, there's not much to the faith that we're professing. And they also identify in the book that they edit together practices of prayer, practices of care, and practices of growth. And what I'm highlighting is I think that the important thing to pay attention to is there's an embodied performative quality to our practices, our practices of virtue, our practices of self. So now we get to what I consider the fun stuff, fascinating stuff with neuroscience. And how do neuroscience and virtue come together? I've already said, I think that we perform ourself. And one of the things that fascinates me about neuroscience is that there's harmony in this vast complexity of our brains and how they communicate together and communicate with one another. And again, we could go on and on, but I will tell you that neuroscientists don't even have a number for the potential neural connections that we can have, the synapses, because they can connect in different ways and they can connect in different strengths. And so they just venture sort of a hypothetical number that has a digit and then a whole bunch of zeros behind it. Because it's so vast. And they said even the volume of the known universe is only a tiny fraction of the number of possibilities of neural connections in the human brain. And what astounds me is that most often it functions fairly well. But as we'll see, what is more exciting to me is that it's plastic. It's malleable. It changes. And so neuroplasticity is the scientific term to say that our brain responds to every experience, every moment, every action that we have changes the structure and function of the brain because the brain has to adapt to meet whatever the demand is of whatever the experience. And so this is how persons actually reshape and rewire their brains based on repetitive practice and experience. So if you didn't believe me, I'm sure you've seen some of these things. This is from pop culture. These are brain training games. So if you Google brain training neuroplasticity, you'll see these, we have brain games, brain schools, Sudoku, crossword puzzles, this Nintendo DS brain training. Do you notice there in the corner? Three plus. So already at age three, kids can be training their brain. And of course, there's a marketing component to this, et cetera. But the neuroscience is there. The evidence is there that our regular habitual experiences, our regular habitual practices will change the structure and function of our brains. Now, if we think about what does that mean for people of faith, well, if our regular habitual practices are practices of virtue, then we are going to become, what I would hope anyway, is people that reflect Christ a little bit more. That the brain will rewire itself in a way that maybe looks a little bit more like Christ, is a little bit more gracious, a little bit more understanding, a little bit more empathetic in relationships. And this is all based on Hebb's postulate. The phrase is neurons that fire together, wire together. And what that means, basically, and Hebb, this is fairly common. If you read anything in neuroscience, neurons that fire together, wire together, is stated over and over. But Hebb was the one who came up with it originally. And basically what he's saying is that as individuals learn a new skill, activity, movement, or practice, the neurons in their brain adapt and change to meet the requirement. Over time, the new skill becomes automatized in the long-term memory, and a new, increasingly efficient neural pathway is created. In other words, repetitive practice changes the brain. And some of the examples that the neuroscience literature highlight are London taxi cab drivers, violin players, and folks who are bilingual. And what they've noticed is London taxi cab drivers in the spaces and parts of their brain that need to know spatial awareness and getting from point A to point B, their brains are much more robust and efficient. There's larger gray matter and white matter in those taxi cab drivers because day after day, moment after moment, they're navigating and using those parts of their brain, and their brain is responding. The same with violin players. What they found is that the digits of the left hand that use that fine motor skills in violin players' brains, it's much more robust and efficient than in my brain. My digits to my left hand would not be quite as robust. And the same for folks who are bilingual, because, again, you're creating those new neural pathways as you learn new skills and new language. So now we get to what I'm trying to do in the work that I do on wellness and well-being is I think often we look at neuroscience and we look at the brain as skull-encased. And we have a sort of a cognitive approach that we look at top-down, and we don't pay attention to bottom-up. And top-down practices are particularly helpful. Prayer, meditation, silence, breathing exercises, body scans, and sorts of things where we're using sort of the prefrontal cortex of our brain to think about our experience and pay attention. That's why mindfulness practices are really popular and really helpful and so on. But what you see there is our brain, all of that. So it's not just the part in the skull, but the brain runs through all of our body through our central and peripheral nervous system. The other thing to think about is that there's no such thing as logical, removed, rational thought because we are embodied. And what neuroscience has showed us is even the, I would call them more of the executive functions of the command center that require our prefrontal cortex, so decision-making, problem-solving, etc., etc., is used through the whole brain. The whole brain works top-down and bottom-up. And so on the next slide, I'll give you more of a visual. So this is the autonomic nervous system, and if you follow the brain down the brainstem through the spine, there will be connections to all of our organs and out to our extremities. And what I'm arguing is all of that is the brain. The brain thinks ethically, spiritually, with all of it. And now we get to embodied neuroplasticity. And essentially what this means, you see the brain with a little weight there, and I won't read the quotes, but basically what the neuroscientist John Rady is one and Kolb is another one, is arguing that as we use this embodied brain, as we perform repeated practices and behaviors, it will change the brain. It's almost as if we're, you know, strengthening our brain. And Kolb does a nice job of saying the idea that activity might change the heart or muscles is seldom questioned. We're a little bit past January 1st, but, you know, I go to gyms a lot, and a lot of times that first two weeks after January, there's a lot of folks there because they know that if they go to the gym and they take care of themselves, they'll, you know, be healthier. But what I'm arguing is that our brain is no different, and that's what Kolb is also arguing. The possibility that behavior could change the brain, the structure and function of the brain is seldom considered. And so the way that we do that, and what I will argue is that technically, we perform our identity and we story ourselves. And I don't want to get too far into the philosophical weeds. So if you want more information, you can email me and we can talk further. But basically, we look at narrative theory, and then I'll look at a philosophical term called performativity of how I think the embodied brain stories ourselves neurophysiologically. So narrative theory basically shows that we as human beings are meaning makers. That experience in and of itself doesn't really mean much until we connect the dots into a coherent story or a coherent narrative. And so storying is not just what we say about ourselves, but it's the stories that we actually live into. And the quote down there is from two narrative theorists and therapists, and they say, we think that people's experience of the meaning of their lives and relationships changes through changes in their life narratives. As their narratives change, what they do and what they perceive changes as well. So to take that a step further, thinking about ourselves as embodied brain ecosystems, the performative quality that we perform virtues and practices of wellness will story ourselves physiologically. Performativity picks up on the work of Judith Butler and basically says that we perform our acts in acts of discord, and that constructs our identity. What this looks like in neuroscientific terms is that the capacity for the brain to story itself relies on different brain functions. David Hogue, who's a colleague and professor of pastoral theology, care and counseling at Garrett Evangelical Seminary, says it this way, that we are our memories. The events of life that we recall give us a sense of personal identity and movement through time. For better or worse, we are shaped and transformed by our experiences through the synaptic patterns with which our brain record those experiences. As we recall the stories that have brought us to any given moment in time, we are both rediscovering and proclaiming who we are. And I would add the embodied physical quality to that. It's not just sort of a cognitive linguistic story, but we perform our identity through our practices of virtue and well-being. And so the way that I argue that, using neuroscientific terms, is again, as I argue that virtues are bi-directional, I would say the way that we perform and story our identity is bi-directional. So from the top down, persons story themselves physiologically and unconsciously from the bottom up and from the top down. So linguistically, consciously, how we think about ourselves, how we story ourselves, but then also how we move ourselves, stories from the bottom up. And so the neuromotor system, more commonly called the central nervous system, is how we do this. So as we perform a different practice, say that that's going for a walk. Again, remember Hebb's postulate. As we're walking, our brain is being required to connect our synapses in a way that we can move our feet, et cetera, et cetera, and we get more efficient at that. So as we do things that are life-giving, our brain changes, and in a literal sense, we perform our identity. And in the research, which I won't go into all of that, I really argued why this was important for clergy members is because the statistics of clergy health and well-being lags behind the general population. And I won't go through all the things, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, et cetera, et cetera, but I think part of the reason is we often don't pay attention to the embodied quality of ourself. Does that make sense so far? If you don't agree, just pretend you agree for now, and then you can ask a really, really difficult question later on. And so based on this, I developed a wellness model, and I focused on clergy, but this can be expanded to most of us, many people of faith. We don't have time to go into dualism, but often we disconnect our embodied self, and we sort of have this lingering dualism in our theological constructions and so on. But basically what I tried to do is come up with a model of well-being or wellness that drew on theological understandings, exercise physiology, neuroscience, and so on. And what I came up with is this model. And so in the next few slides, because I want to keep track of our time, I might have to move a little bit quickly, but I provided the handout that you have is basically the wellness model, the different areas, and then potential practices that you might use individually and then corporately if you're part of a community of faith. And so the way that this model came up was in my research, my own experience, drawing on my previous degrees in exercise physiology and health and well-being and my theological degrees and my psychological degrees and conversations with clergy members and so on and so forth. I basically came up with this model, and if I was much more skilled in PowerPoint, which as you can see, I'm at the bare minimum, this model would be more fluid and it would move, you know, and it would adjust and shape because I don't think it needs to be in perfect balance that we can focus on some areas in a season of life and then it can shift and adjust, etc. But I think these are important areas and central to all of it is this sense of calling. That's kind of what integrates and holds these aspects of well-being. And I would say for most of us, people of faith, whether we are clergy members, lay leaders, etc., is that we feel a sense of calling from God in some way, some vocational, some charism, etc. And so that's a central piece of what it means to be well. And so basically what I did was identified these five areas. Attunement is the area where we connect with our self. It's kind of inwardly focused. That could be practices of prayer, journaling, silence, meditation, etc. And really we're paying attention to our whole self, our sensations, our embodied being, and so on. The next area is nourishment. And it's not just physical nourishment, but how are we nourishing ourselves spiritually, intellectually, relationally, etc. A fascinating study that I don't have time to go into is called the Nun Study, done by David Snowden and some of his colleagues with a group of sisters in the Mankato, Minnesota area of the Sisters of Notre Dame. And what they did was they studied the brains of these sisters because these sisters were living longer, healthier lives than the general population. They said, what is going on? I mean, do they have the fountain of youth? Do they have some secret formula that they're doing? And so the sisters allowed their brains to be studied after they had passed away. And based on that research and looking at their brains and hearing more about how they lived and what they did, etc., what they found was that they kept their brains and themselves fit and active. So they, of course, they had their regular spiritual rituals of prayer and so on and so forth, but they also had intellectual debates. They did Sudoku. They did crossword puzzles. They gardened. They were out in nature. They were moving themselves. They laughed. They related together, etc., etc. And so if you're at all interested, look up the Nunn study and see how these sisters' brains adapted and adjusted to their repeated experiences of what we might call practices of wellness or practices of virtue. So nourishment is one of those ways. Physical activity and movement, again, that's one of the most profound ways that our brain responds. That's why I think the bottom-up is so significant and why the embodied brain is so powerful because it's one of the most significant ways that we produce neuroplasticity that we allow the brain to respond to our behaviors. Rest and renewal, getting adequate sleep, taking Sabbath, being still long enough that God might connect with us rather than, sometimes I call it spiritual hyperactivity where we just keep going and going and going and we never just are still and allow God's grace to come and meet us. And then finally, having meaningful relationships, connecting at more than a superficial level in one-on-one, small group, corporate worship and things like that. So that's the model. And what I'm going to do now is kind of skip through the slides that you have that give suggestions because I want to come back to some of the implications and save time for some questions. So you have those slides. What I also was thinking about is a lot of those, even although they're love your neighbor as yourself and some of them are relational, I think there's things that we can do communally, particularly in communities of faith. And what's interesting is that ritual talks about collective performance. So rituals, again, are prescribed symbolics acts that must be performed in a certain way and in a certain order and may or may not be accompanied by verbal formulas. So what David Hogue, again, argues is that until a ritual is enacted, I would add, until a ritual is performed with our embodied brain ecosystem, it does not exist. It serves no personal or community function. Reading about a ritual is not the same as participating in. Words are surely not enough. We need to find ways for people to perform their faith. So in short, rituals are prescriptions, symbolism, performances, repetition can be optional, and a public context can be optional. You can have private rituals, but I think this is where communities of faith can think about performative practices of virtue. And some of those ways are practices of worship. We might connect them with, as Dominic was describing, virtues of faith, regular worship, communal practices, et cetera. There's practices of growth and development. Maybe that's tied to hope, accountability, retreats together, engaging in dialogue around difficult issues. Stations of the Cross, collective fasting. Again, these are in the handout, so I'll skip along. And practices of care and connection, hospitality, visitation, communal pastoral care, fellowship, eco-justice. You see a community garden there. And as we wrap up, what I think there are a couple of implications. So I have a couple more slides, so bear with me, and then we'll break into some questions. One of them is that there's a neural spiritual at-oneness. Andy Newberg calls it absolute unitary being. And what Newberg has argued is that persons who are engaging in spiritual practices, we might say practices of virtue, particularly those who are meditating, but we could expand that a little bit, perform practices of mindful awareness and attunement in the framework that I gave you. What happens in those moments is they lose a sense of their separateness between the self and others due to an inhibition in the region of the brain, the left posterior superior parietal lobe. You needed to know that before you went home. But basically what happens, what he's saying is that in meditation, as one is centering with himself, attuning with oneself, the area of our distinctness and separateness kind of goes offline, and we have this experience of being at one with one another, of being at one with all of creation, at being one with God. And I think we could connect that with this sense of elevated flow that Dominic was talking about, that as we perform these practices, we feel more connected. Our empathy goes up. Patrick McNamara talks similarly about a decentering process. So we might say that as we perform regular practices of virtue and well-being, we increase our capacity to love our neighbor as ourself. And the way we're doing that is our brain is adjusting and we're becoming more intra- and interconnected. So the last one that I want to highlight is that I think what practices of virtue and well-being do is they highlight that we as embodied human persons are intra-related. So that's the connection that we have to all the aspects of our embodied self, mind, body, spirit, etc. But that ties to our interconnection of inter-relationality, connections with others. And it's really those two together that I think is what we're called to do and be as people of faith. So taken together, intra-inter-relationality names how our ethical capacity to see and connect with our neighbor depends on the attuning and mirroring processes in our middle prefrontal cortex. In layperson's terms, as we spend time loving and caring for ourself, our brain responds, our capacity to love and care and connect with our neighbor increases. Love of self, love of neighbor. And so what I would leave you with is the threefold model of love. Love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength and love your neighbor as yourself. Here are some other wellness implications. I'm not going to read through the list because you have that in the handout. And so now what we'd like to do in the remainder of our time, which I see is 20 minutes, so we're doing okay. I think we're doing okay. So we thought we'd let you talk amongst yourselves for maybe three, four, five minutes. So break into a neighbor, two, three, four, et cetera. And then Dominic and I will both be up here. And then you can, if you want to be brave and ask your question, that will live on the internet forever and ever. Do it. And if it's a difficult question, Dominic will answer it. If it's a softball, easy question. You know, he's more senior. He's been here a long time. He's much more acclaimed. So anyway, we'll give you some time and we'll call you back together and see if you have some questions, reflections for either of us, for both of us. And we'll kind of go from there. Is this live? So for posterity. No, the question I have is that having read so much in history and theology, the tradition, but nowadays with the whole development of neuroscience, neuroplasticity, and the way we look at the human condition. And some of what the ancients have said seems to be bearing out, borne out by some of the scientific research. And I guess one of the questions is there any sort of dangers along the way or new developments about the human condition that the ancients missed or the things that the ancients said. You know, whether it's, I'm thinking of maybe Benedict, you know, and his rule and what that did for culture. You know, it's sort of work and pray. It's sort of using the body but also using the mind. Another impacts of perhaps throughout the tradition that might help us to understand things more better. I'll start and then Dominic can add to that. I would say it is interesting, especially when you're talking about theological anthropology. In fact, one of the things that I argue is that we are returning to a quote-unquote more primitive understanding. But I don't really think it's primitive. It's just that it's an earlier understanding. That I think, especially if we look at the Hebrew Bible, there's a really embodied human person that's created out of the dust, et cetera, et cetera. But I think that advances in neuroscience and other cognate disciplines, behavioral science, human development, critical theory, gender studies, all the other conversation partners, at least for me as a pastoral practical theologian, I bring those together with some of the classics and et cetera to deepen and enrich my understandings of human persons, of God, of relationships, of what we're called to do. So I don't think we have to choose one or the other, but I think we continually reform and refine and expand, especially in the neurosciences. I mean, there's so much development where now we can look in real time using fMRIs and et cetera, et cetera, at the speed of thought, really, where we get to see what is actually happening. And in some senses, it harkens back to previous stuff and research and et cetera, but a lot of times it advances in some ways or we ask new questions. And so I think there's a constructive, important constructive part of it, but I'll leave it there so I don't answer everything, but anything you want to, yeah? I only had one thought that came to mind as you were speaking. I went to a school run by Benedictine monks, Worth Abbey in England, the EBC, the English Benedictine Congregation, which people joke stands at every bodily comfort because the Benedictines live life very nicely. And I remember one line in St. Benedict's Rule, which is idleness is the enemy of the soul. And I kind of think for our time, it's more like we could do with a bit more idleness, a bit more time, Sabbath, you know, that kind of activity. So I think there's some things that may have been appropriate then, that idleness is the enemy of the soul, that now actually the importance of leisure, as you know from Joseph Pieper, is the ability to cultivate time for ourselves and a kind of idleness or recreation is something we miss out. So we have to sort of pick horses for courses, I guess. Just a question, based on what you're talking about, and as I understood it, it was sort of we act ourselves, and I don't mean act in a pejorative way, but we act ourselves into a particular person, if you will. I'm just wondering what the moral implications are in a situation where we're encountering a person whose actions, whose actions are, how do I say this? They're not assisting them in getting to a virtuous personhood. Do we carry then a greater burden of interacting or interceding, and how does that interplay with your understanding or explanation of acceptance? We'll switch. You go. Okay. Well, I guess I think of the classic notions of fraternal correction, that there can be a correction of particular manifestations of bad behavior or acts that aren't authentic or whatever, but underneath that can be, as Augustine said, you can love the sinner but hate the sin. So I think that there can be that this is not acceptable, this behavior, but you are acceptable. You don't have to do this playing up kind of behavior. So I think that, I'm drawing on my two years of teaching high school now. This is the best I can do. And I remember one of the monks at my school saying, my last resort is I pray for this kid. He's so annoying. And usually when you meet the parents, then that's why everything slots into place. It's not their fault. There's no bad kids. It's just sort of inadequate parenting. So I think that underlying acceptance, you're accepted as you are, but that behavior is not acceptable. That distinction is helpful, as Augustine drew. Yeah, I think what I would add, at least from the neuroplasticity perspective, is that neuroplasticity doesn't really discriminate. So there are practices that are more life-giving and there are practices that are more not life-giving, less helpful. people. And there's some research on neuroscience and addiction. You know, and we know the neuroscience behind that and why addiction becomes such a pernicious thing and people can get stuck to that is that the brain will adjust and adapt and rewire so that that pathway is much more efficient. So the first time someone maybe, you know, does something that's not well for them or others, it maybe is a little bit more difficult, inefficient, but over time with that repetitive behavior, the brain gets more and more efficient. So the neuroplasticity can go either way and so what I try to do is encourage us to obviously choose things that are more life-giving for neighbor and self and to help all of us remember that our behaviors and practices are constructive. You know, there's a performative, constructive quality and it's not just a throwaway sort of thing to pay attention to how the brain works but that's the best I can do for now but thanks for the question. I haven't heard much about dopamine physiology and all of this and the reward circuitry and is that a part of this model as well in terms of wellness and practices? Yes. Thank you for that question and that's why I'm really a fan of bottom-up processing because one of the really significant things about physical activity and exercise in particular is that it is a natural way of producing dopamine and serotonin. In fact, the SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, basically produce artificially in the brain what we do when we perform cardiovascular activity, et cetera. So if you lost all of that, basically when we perform cardiovascular activity, our brain is flooded with dopamine and serotonin and things that help increase mood but also stabilize mood. And then we didn't really go into how regular practices of well-being can counteract kind of the negativity bias of the brain and all sorts of things. But if you're interested in that, maybe I'll do another one of these or we can talk more about that. But yeah, I think that's a really powerful piece, particularly of why embodied practices are so powerful for not just neuroplasticity but for well-being. Thank you. I have been very fascinated how you too got a human being from the virtues, the Christian virtues, and then sort of mingled together with the intricacy of a human being, a human being, a human being, and yet some of the actions that we do just takes just one minute to happen and how far the journey that it takes and we have been able to break it open so that we can see almost and realize what is coming. It is very fascinating. Especially I was fascinated by the studies of the Sisters of Notre Dame, longevity, what makes them longevity and connect it with wellness. That is a very fascinating thing and I wish many people learn how to, many of us learn how to teach and learn how to live longer and what it takes to do it. Now, one of the questions that I have here, Ruth, is about theological virtues. And the theological virtues, it seems, Professor, you are emphasizing Christians, how the Christians practice theological virtues. And the question that came to my mind is that how do you measure the theological virtues of non-Christians, especially those who are not, you know, who have, who are not in tuned to Christianity? The big million dollar question if I could answer that. I guess in those issues of inter-religious dialogue, I don't at first think of theological virtues, but what I think of is, I guess, more generally grace or what St. Paul called the fruits of the spirit. Do you find those experiences of joy, self-control, forgiveness, love, and so on that St. Paul lists in Galatians and elsewhere, do you find those and recognize those in examples of holiness in other religions? And I think, obviously, people do find that and there is some resonance. And so when people share that experience and we as Christians might recognize that, we, through our Christian theological lens, see that as the gift of the spirit. It's not, it blows where it wills, it's distributed widely. And then as Christians talk about Christ and hopefully try and live somewhat patterned on Christ, then those other people recognize that holiness in the Christian story of Christ and that's what the spirit is forming people towards, is to be like Christ in some way. So I wouldn't, I mean, it's a good question about how do we think about virtues in inter-religious dialogue. It would be a good thing to explore, but I guess I'd take it in a more basic level of do we see the fruits of the spirit in other religions? Yes. And then when we talk about Christ, does that resonate with what those experiences of holiness we see in other religions? So I have a question about the mirror neurons that you were talking about. So let's say I just hang out with my two brothers here and they're very virtuous and I'm not so much. This is a hypothetical. Of course. So let's say I'm hanging with the bros and they're very virtuous. Would I become virtuous just by being around them or would I, well, I'm sure I've had to practice, but would I be pushed in some certain way to be more virtuous just by being with them? That's an interesting question. I would say you maybe would, you know, be more connected to their experience of virtuous. So if they felt more at peace, if they felt more connected, if they experienced the AUB, the absolute unitary being because of that, you might feel more connected and more empathy from them. Oftentimes we talk about that feeling of feeling felt. So you might feel that. But I don't think it's quite as simple as osmosis. I mean, it's more about the mirror neurons, what they do is that they show that we are interconnected and particularly when we can anticipate behavior. I mean, sometimes we talk about emotional contagion. That's the same kind of thing. So if a group is laughing in a conversation and you show up, you will feel lighter. You might smile. You might laugh without cognitively thinking about I'm going to smile now. So your prefrontal cortex will sort of get bypassed just by your embodied brain and you'll smile when you see someone smile. But I'll have to wrestle around with if there's more to that. I would say that we need to then co-participate with the Spirit's presence. So it's not a passive. That's the agentic performative part is that we really need to play a part in it. But I would say that using Dominic's theological virtue lens is that we are sort of predisposed with the gifts of grace and then we can participate with that, if that makes sense. I would just say other than steer away from Scott, I would just say it would be like a necessary but not sufficient condition. It's necessary that you have a community of friends that embody these virtues but it's not sufficient. You need to appropriate it for yourself and make it your own. Thank you.
