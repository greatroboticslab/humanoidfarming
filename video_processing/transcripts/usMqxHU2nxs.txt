 Andharki Namaskaramandi. Today is a very important day. APCNF Guruji Andharki. They should understand the science and also the practices. What is different and why it is required. So today I will explain the science behind natural farming. Because many of the agriculture officers, horticulture officers have an impression that this is traditional agriculture. Or the intro science A. Mundi. So I want to take you through the science. And since special CS will be joining at 11.30. So we have to conclude this by maybe 11.15, 11.20. So I want to take you through the 45-50 minutes. Then I would like to listen to the officers. Any doubts or any clarifications that you require. So this is the format. So this is the training video shoot. This we should be playing at the VA level. I want to explain the process of the practice of the Viva Saiyam and why it is required. So right now I will take you through a presentation on what is APCNF. What is APCNF? So this is the government of Antirapadish Lakshman. The government of Antirapadish Lakshman is 37.30. All villages and all 60 lakh farmers, 20 lakh farm workers, households. And Prakriti Viva Saiyam is for farmers prosperity. So the government of Antirapadish Lakshman is for farmers prosperity. And most important is the planetary health. Because without the planet health, we are nowhere. So how is natural farming important for planetary health, human health and farmers prosperity? That's what I will give an overview. I will give you an overview. I have many other visions in the field. But this may give you a very different insight. Especially from the science point of view. I have a vision that I have covered in this vision. So we have around 12,38,000 farmers till last year. And this sounds from Lakshman, 50% villages will be 6,855 gram panchayats. And we are touching 26% farmers. And one of the important things here is that our strategy is to prepare for small and marginal farmers. And I will tell you in the next slide why. Then we recognize overnight transformation is going to be 3,4,5,6 years. But we are not giving any financial incentive. If you are enrolled in natural farming, you have DBT. That's not the incentive. We want farmers to get benefits from the first year itself. While economic benefits are going to be, health benefits are going to be, or soil health has improved, resilience has improved, variety of benefits. So first year, this change is going to be very narrow. And the results of the first year, all the efforts have been made on account of that. So this is where we are today. And what we want to do in 25,26. These 25,26 targets, I think we have communicated to you. Other targets, district collectors, we have received. So that every month, the review will be around these targets. Now please see this slide. This is a survey survey. In the 10th month, 12,46,000 are farmers. And 4,000,000 and above are landless farmers. This is a survey survey. 47% farmers have less than half hectare, 1.25 acres. So less than 1.25 acres, we have 47% farmers. And they are operating 20% area. And 83% of them are already in the APCNF fold. And almost similar area. They are in natural farming. Next category, half hectare, 1 hectare. So they are 30% and they operate 30% area. Virgur Dada, 83% are enrolled in natural farming. But only half of their land has come into natural farming. So here we should increase the area to 100%. Then we have next group, also imported group. 1 to 2 hectares. 2.5 to 5 acres low. Varu, in terms of numbers, they are 18%. And in terms of land they operate, they are having 33% of the land. Until one third of the land is with 18% farmers. Varu, 84% are practicing natural farming, part of their land. And 40% of their land is covered. Then the final category, 2 hectares and above, big farmers. Varu, 85% are only. But they have 18% of the land. Varu, that is most important, interesting. 86% are practicing natural farming, but not on their entire land. So 23% area, they practice just well. So I want to explain to, highlight to all of you, that natural farming RYSS strategy is geared towards this 80%. Small and marginal farmers, the implementation mechanism is around that. So I can't have a strategy around 5% farmers. So that strategy will be different. Or even around 18%. So this you please keep in mind. And that is a specialty of Andhra Pradesh. Because we are catering to the common farmer. Then, Inko Kars Tranalika, Naal Lakshal Mandi, Yavarayte Bumileni, Landless Farm Workers Sunaro, Varu Kosam, Homestead Gardens Savani, Planches. So this is about the program. But now I want to take you, why is it, okay, before that, just to tell you that we are declared as a national resource organization. We are a center of excellence for the Ministry of Agriculture. And we are supporting 16 states in the country. You can see North, South, East and West. Inka states had Uttar Pradesh. I think in the days, Gujarat had Uttar Pradesh. So we are there in 18 states. So Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Tilangana, Karnataka. So all the four southern states. So West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Meghalaya, Assam, North East slope. So like this, states are coming to us. Because of the superiority of our technology and the science behind natural farming. That is the country. One is from 55 countries. One is from 55 countries. One is from 75 countries. One is from many countries. One is from Africa, Europe, Asia, then America, Australia. So these many countries have come to us. And we are also working in these countries. We are working in Zambia, Indonesia, and we are working in Sri Lanka. We are working in the country in the country. We are working in the country in the country. Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, Tanzania, Egypt, Brazil, Mexico, Congo, and I think I have to add Mali. So both nationally and globally, there is a lot of expectations from AP. So something we should all be proud of. Then I go into what is the crisis. We have a crisis for which we need a solution. This is the climate change of greenhouse gas emissions. But what is the state of the planet? The state of the planet, planet health alone. Manushal arugyamu, soil health, paschal arugyamu, mokkal arugyamu, avanni vinna mana. But the planet arugyamu, there are these parameters. So this is called planetary boundary science. This is a lot of science. This is, you know, originated from Stockholm Resilience Center. Akada, Professor Johan Rockstraw Mani. Now he is the director of the Portsmouth Institute of Climate Change. So what 15 years ago, Planetary Boundary Science and Stata India, what they have said, there are nine planetary boundaries. If we are within the boundary, then the planet is stable. Otherwise we are in a very unstable situation. And our aim conclude the satsar is a prasthutam. Six out of nine planetary boundaries have been breached. A very serious statement. We are in a very serious statement. And they have also declared that already humanity, in the Bharat Deshwani Kathu, Vattam, Prapanchamllo, Desha, Lanni, Kalipi, have crossed six out of nine planetary boundaries. And they have also concluded that the current agri-food system is the greatest cause for the degradation of our planetary health. And this is the most important statement. We need to practice agriculture to produce food. There is no doubt about it. Otherwise we will starve. But Manamu yeh vidanga vyaasayam cheshtu namo, that is causing the planetary boundaries to be crossed. So, and we will die. The way global warming, other things are increasing, there is no hope for the future. So this is the statement, which was released by the Stockholm Resilience Centre. The current agri-food system is the greatest cause for the degradation of our planetary health. So we cannot continue the way we are doing agriculture, the chemicalization of agriculture, or the way we are ploughing the land. So there are so many practices which are wrong. So what are the six boundaries which we have crossed? So first boundary, bio-geochemical flows. Ante natrajani phosphorus. Today we are using more than twice the danger levels. So we have exceeded the planetary boundaries for the bio-geochemical flows, for both nitrogen and phosphorus. And you know that every year, usage of nitrogen is increasing for every acre of land. Second is novel entities. Ante ivi, these are synthetic chemicals which don't break down. Yelapun-tai, either in the soil, in the air or in water. And they are causing tremendous health damages. Novel entities slow, plastics would have died. So these cannot be broken down. They are not biodegradable. So in novel entities, danger mark almost twice higher. Then land system changes. So this means deforestation, desertification, degradation. Idigoda, chala, peddhat, has deteriorated. It has deteriorated. That means desertification has increased. Then biosphere integrity. Idhi actually is one of the most serious casualties of our agriculture system. Mirchuste. Because of agriculture, we have lost biodiversity. So this is called biosphere integrity. Then fifth one is freshwater change. So green water, which I will explain later, we already crossed the danger limits very significantly. And then finally climate change, which is measured in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. For M and Tarante, agriculture is not the only reason. But agriculture is also an important factor. So please keep this slide in your mind. Because this represents today's position. And all of you are aware that we are in the sixth mass extinction. Because of these conditions that we have created. So for M and Tarante, five out of these nine are on account of agriculture. Black dot, Sevaite Unnayo, that shows this parameter is caused by agriculture system. Five out of nine. Just see how much damage we have caused just in 10,000 years. We have started in the 10,000 years ago. And more so in the last 100 years when chemical agriculture took over. So this is the present situation. Idhi Inko Ka, very dangerous indicator. These are temperatures from pre-industrial era. So Paris Agreement, all countries agreed. They will take all the measures to keep the temperature increase below 1.5 degrees centigrade. And we will see that 2024 low, we crossed that. We reached 1.60 degrees centigrade. In 2023, we reached 1.4 degrees centigrade. But in 2024, we reached 1.6 degrees centigrade. So, the previous slide, the planetary boundaries have been breached. And this slide is just a confirmation that how badly our planetary health has been deteriorating. So we have to wake up. So is there a solution? So, now scientists believe, scientists all over the world, including United Nations, that agroecology or farming in harmony with nature is a solution for these multiple emergencies. So, what is natural farming? So, what is natural farming? It is a holistic land management practice that leverages the power of photosynthesis in plants to close the carbon cycle and build soil health, crop resilience and nutrient density. So, please remember, it is a new science. So, this science is only 25 to 30 years old. So, we have a lot of good science in the past. So, we have a lot of good science in the past. So, we have a lot of good science. And we have a lot of good science in the past. We didn't know the entire science. We didn't know the entire science. We didn't know the entire science. But over the last 10 years, RYSS has gone very deeply into the science. And we have learned from the best of global science of agroecology, regenerative agriculture, but also from our own farmers for practicing natural farming. So, RONDU KAMBANJESHA. Best in the world and best in our own state. And also something pioneered by our department, our farmers. So, these are the scientists who are at the forefront of this new science. Dr. Elaine Ingham, Walter Yana, James White. I have given you some important names. We have learned so much from them. And they, in turn, are very happy with what we are doing. Walter Yana Gharikana, Occhhar Vandegar Ki. Dr. Leningham is aware of our work. So, more and more scientists are appreciating our work. But these are the people who are at the forefront of this new science. And what is so different about this science, I just want to give one example. And then others I will touch briefly because we are running out of time. And so, E, nutrient cycling hypothesis law. And this is very important because our entire agriculture system is based on NPK. So, natural farming law, E, Mantunamante, there is no need for even one gram of external fertilizers, either synthetic or organic. So, please note this point very clearly that we are not providing nutrition to the plants. So, biological inputs, natural farming law, Arthra, Gana, Drava, Jeeva, Amrita, Alu, and nitrogen. They are meant to stimulate the microbes in the soil. So, this is one very, very important difference. The Green Revolution science talks about replenishing the soil with nutrients. Here we are saying, no, we need to replenish the soil biology and not give nutrients directly. And here is the bio inputs, natural farming law, Arthra, Namo. They are just 5%, maybe 500 kg, 600 kg, maximum 1 ton per acre in a year. Versus some 10 to 12 tons for one crop in traditional agriculture. So, this is the most important point that there is a very different model of nutrient cycling. Which I will explain now. So, all of you, Mikantharik Jailtsu, photosense is the base of life. And if you see the plant, photosense is made by the leaves. So, 40% of the food they make is stored in the leaves. For development of the shoot system. Stored in the shoot system, not leaves. Stored in the shoot system. Stem, branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, grains. 30% is used for root development. But 30% of the food is exuded into the soil. The root exudates. And that is the food for microbes in the soil. You can see around the rhizosphere, you will have microbes, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae. So, Ivanyaguda, they are consuming the food given by the plants through photosynthesis. So, photosynthes. Root exudates they consume, they multiply. And in return, through complex interactions across species, the nutrients required by a plant are made bioavailable to the plant at the right time and right quantities. This is just to give you an idea of how big the microbial world is. So, it is estimated that, you know, amount of carbon in all the life forms is 550 gigatons. And 550 billion tons. The antler 450 billion tons is in plants. And out of the balance, 100 billion tons low, those which are invisible, can be comfortable, microscope dwarane, mananchuda galata, bacteria, fungi, archaea, protease, and the nature of the plant. They constitute 93 billion tons. 93% of the other than plant life forms are actually invisible life forms. And all visible animals, including human beings, dogs, cats, fish, lions, tigers, all animals put together account for only 7 billion tons. So, you can see that this is a microbial world and also world of plants. Now, soil biology is pretty much optimized to test them. We get proper nutrient absorption. And more important or equally important, a good soil structure is created. And this can be done only by the microbes, not by machines. So, this soil structure leads to better water infiltration, water holding. And the third point, water vapor harvested for irrigation is something which we should be proud of. Andhra Pradesh Loni, the Sambhava Mainadi. We are the first ones in the world to show this.ään Team 2. Saien S quiser. Semi odharnanga. 4這樣子 are known by any Earth shan'a ranga. All the DAOs, ADAs are familiar with the four wheels under ZBNF. But please remember what we are saying is not ZBNF. The principles of APCNF are totally science-based and they are different from, not totally different, but they are little different. And are different same content. That we are emphasizing crop diversity and a living root 365 days of the year. So, you should have soil should be covered with living crops 365 days of the year. And there should be diverse crops. And if you have a crop residue, you should have mulch. Then minimize the tillage. Farmers own seeds to be used. Then integrating animals with crops, with land. So integrating animals into farming. Biostimulants. Ganadrava, Jeevamrathalu. They are not bio-fertilizers. They are only bio-stimulants. Soil biogen trigger chedanaki. Then pest management through botanical pesticides and also better agronomical practices. And finally, no synthetic chemicals. So these are the general principles, Andy. So all of you, please keep this framework in your mind. It is not based on merely adding biological inputs. No. They are actually coming as point number seven. So there is crop diversity. This is seed coating. Bija Amrita is nothing but seed coating with microbes. Then Ganajiva Amrita is soil amendment. Drava Jiva Amrita is a liquid for foliar application. There are also other tonics like pancha caviar, agamina acid, etc. Then botanical pesticides. So this already you will be seeing in the field or you have already seen in the field. So this is the science and practice of APCNF. So this is the science and practice of APCNF. Here's what we have brought here together. From the field roaming aroundなpament of plantilla. So how then some of these nutrition sources as an NPC in monkeys are planning to do. So, the science and dance is the science and Одri nunca готов. In other places would be NGOs or CBOs. Knowledge low, knowledge dimensions are very important. And the research that we have done shows that this is the best kind of agriculture for all farmers. In terms of impacts, I will not go into that, but we find that there is no yield penalty. If all the practices are followed, then yield differences are... Yield penalty are not allowed. Yields are higher in natural farming. And cost of cultivation is lower. And that's what a farmer needs. That cost of cultivation should be as low as possible. And income from the yields should be as high as possible. So results are very positive. I don't have time to go into them. Then, just to show for one for paddy, we found water saving of around 50%. Then, this is just about our discovery about natural farming and water harvesting. So, worship need lu. Only two drops are stored. Out of 100 drops, two drops are stored in the dams in the world. Twelve drops are in river streams. Then, 36 drops go into the soil. But 50 drops are what we are losing by runoff and evaporation. So, if you only want the 100 rain drops, 50 rain drops are being wasted. And then, we are complaining of water shortness. So, through natural farming, you can optimize green water. So, soil percolation is better. Water infiltration is better. Soil structure is better. Soil porosity is better. Water infiltration happens easily. Water holding is increased. And green cover, low temperatures, evaporation losses are reduced. So, automatically, natural farming will lead to water saving. But, in addition, what I call as the new water paradigm. So, this is a new phenomenon triggered by natural farming. And this was something very, very extraordinary, which I will explain. We are able to see that plants are harnessing water from the air. In tropical countries, water in the air is up to 50,000 parts per million. So, 5% weight of air is actually water. But this water, Galla Unantavaraku, it is creating heat. So, our breakthrough came when we did these experiments in 2018. This experiments took place in Anantapur. Lakshmanayak is responsible for conducting these experiments. And also, a lot of innovations have come from Anantapur. And that's why he is our Chief Technology and Innovation Officer. So, Walter Yanagar, he explained to us that natural farming is all. Plant physiology is all about. And there is biological water. There is soil surface water. But crop germinate in Anaka, he said that more than 80% of water is coming from harnessing. So, leaves are able to harnessing water from the air. So, this is such a big breakthrough. This is the PMDS that they sow in the hot summer. And this year, all of you, all JDAs, ADAS are equally involved in the PMDS. And you are the best people to tell me what is the feedback that you have got from the farmers. So, this PMDS is really a game changer, which I will explain in the next couple of slides. This is seed pelleting. It is not only for the first seed pelleting. So, this is true. Seed pelleting is for sowing seed under dry conditions. Very important for rain fed areas. Then, based on pre-monsoon dry sowing models, we move to 365 days green cover. What will the best farmers have started practicing what is called as A grade model. That means, prathii pradhanapantato paattu aydaru associated crops in Thai and about 20-25 biodiversity crops. So, these A grade models, we have to make up to our country in the right direction of 21-20 rupas. All the farmers in our small-module farmer category, up to 1 hectare category should come into this. More important, farmers incomes increase tremendously with this. So, I request the DEOs, ADAS, AOs to interact with such farmers in your district. You will get lots and lots of ideas. And you will also be able to take it forward in your own way. This is cotton low A grade model. Just an example. Cotton 5 feet spacing petty. Within cotton, cowpea, pearl millet, cluster bean, green gram, okra and castor. This one is a low seed seed rate. Because, in the same amount of seed, one acre seed rate of cowpea, one acre seed rate of pearl millet, cluster bean, soontai. So, this is another A grade model in horticulture crops. And this is very important for horticulture. This is very important for horticulture. Antar pantaloo, PMDS, soontai, in the same way. Whether it's banana, whether it's papaya, whether it's mango, coconut, oil palm. All these trees will benefit from intercrops. This is an A-tm model. This is an A-tm model. For just one fifth of an acre, we will get plenty of income. They will have about 50-20 different vegetables. And ciliate a model. This is a Pallanikwilna. This is another farmer in Krishna district. This is from Anantapur district. This is paddy bund widening. Crop diversity plus income. This is drought proofing model. This is a result of resilience to floods, which happened last year, December 23. Last year also, in 2024, we had floods in NTR, Krishna, Guntur. And we found crops like banana, paddy, cotton were very badly damaged. But what we did was, A-y-tm plants were less than 3 years, natural farming low. And plants were more than 3 years. And we will not have PMDs just try to go. So differences were in Chuddha. And we found chemical banana 100% damage. Natural farming low less than 10% damage. You can see how the cotton crop is after the rainfall. And then paddy crop. And this is very important slide. You can see here. Right side, chemical field. Rhizosheath is only 26 cm. In the middle, less than 3 years. APCNF. So rhizosheath is much better. And diameter is 32 cm. But if you look at this, greater than 3 years. You can see this soil is dark colored. That means carbon is being stored in the rhizosphere. And this attracted a lot of beneficial insects, earthworms. So good root structure is possible through natural farming. And natural farming also improves the shoot structure to withstand these cyclones. One more thing we did. Chemical field and NF field slow. Bricks refractive meters observations. These are called in Jari Gindi. And you can see here. Chemical AE today. NF-PMD is 12. And highest is 13. Highest is, sorry, 14 for 3 years. Trichomes. Bricks value of Cheta-Puduki. 5 in the chemical low. This is 3 times. So, Bricks value is an indicator of efficiency of photosynthesis. But this is something very, very important, especially for Horticulture department. Bricks will tell you how healthy the plant is. Bricks value of Perge Koddi. Pest attack would be. This is how we try to look at the Horticulture department. This is how we try to look at the Horticulture department. This is how we try to look at natural farming. So, what is the difference? And these results are so amazing. You can see here, the 1 year farmer, these are mentors data. It is about 6th, 5th, 5th, Rodher, 5th, 5th, 5th. 4th, 3rd, 2nd and 1st year. So 26% weed occurrence is there in the first year. In the 5th year of natural farming, it gets reduced to 5% only. Similarly pest incidence, 17% and 4% No spraying of any chemicals whatsoever. Disease incidence also 12.65% to 2%. Then in the 4th, 5th year, there are some farmers who have given up. They say it's not required. Our soil is very good now. The soil is very good. This shows the state average yields have gone up 22.87 quintal inchi, 33.57 quintal swaraku. Cost of cultivation came down from 19,000 to 14,000. And net income. Yields have gone up from 23,000 to 34,000. Net income went up from 40,000 to 73,000. These are all the scientists working with us. Scientists and foreign institutions, ICR, State University. They're all publications. Then we have an Indo-German Global Academy. I'm a Jilal-Loh Raith Shastra-Vetal-Unnaru. So our idea is to have one farmer scientist for every village over a period of time. So, one paradigm shifts is very important. Natural farming law. And this is the most important for all the agriculture department officers. That nutrient acquisition doesn't happen only through soluble inputs. Microbially mediated nutrient acquisition is very important. And it happens through rhizophagy at the rhizosphere. Then no external inputs are required. Synthetic or organic. Crop diversity is critical. All plants fix nitrogen, not just legumes. Weeds have a purpose. They indicate that the quality of your soil is poor. Pest management. Pest management. Already we discussed the role of... Once the soil is healthy and the plant is healthy, Pest will not attack the plant. There is a new understanding about pests. Then use of biostimulants, biopest sites have kept it 8th, 9th point. Because they are required only temporarily. For 5 years to work and do other principles. Then we can dispense with biostimulants also. There is a very important water paradigm in natural farming. geschrieben. Po. 11 is very important. Don't use aascal damage İslam relied uponør 게ум kufpa. For example, if surgery is big enough it won't cost H wennSi 눈물 und�. Conventional farming, barren field is 52.7 degrees centigrade. Here natural farming, cool, 31.8 degrees centigrade. And this we did with number of sets. So average allowance is natural farming, sorry, natural farming 26, 27 degrees centigrade. I don't think chemical farming is 37 degrees centigrade, 10 degrees higher. Then if you compare with fallow lands, barren or fallow lands are 48 degrees centigrade. So without reducing barren lands, we cannot find a solution for climate change. So this is an award we won last year. It's a 1 million euros award, very prestigious award. Thank you.
