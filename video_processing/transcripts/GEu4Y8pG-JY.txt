 So I'm very pleased to introduce Newton and I've really taken advantage of Newton this year so I apologize he led a module I apologize to you Newton, not to you. He led a module at the field school and we actually did a duplicate demonstration trial for him this year so without further ado thanks Newton. Thank you I hope I'll be loud enough that I won't need this. Okay most of us know that the soil beneath our feet there is actually teeming with life. A lot of organisms, a whole different world down there looks very innate from up here but it's actually a world full of organisms both macro and micro organisms. Now they do a lot of wonderful things for us. I know some of them are pathogens but the vast majority of them do wonderful work for us and today we'll just show you a couple of things that they do and one of them has to do with nitrogen fixation by Rhizobia and the other one has to do with a phosphorus acquisition by Michael Riza. So we have this demonstration plots here on nitrogen fixation and over there something on mycorrhizor. We'll come to that a little bit later. And so because these microorganisms are so small we can't see them with our naked eye, we usually know about the activities from whatever structures maybe they leave behind. So in the case of Rhizobia, as they interact with legumes they form these nodules and these are the factories of nitrogen fixation. That's where the nitrogen gets fixed. So it's a symbiotic relationship in the sense that the Rhizobia supply the plants with nitrogen whereas the plant supplies the Rhizobia with carbon. So the photosynthesis that carbon that the plant fixes gets transferred to Rhizobia. So it's a symbiotic relationship the plant gets nitrogen the Rhizobia get carbon. Now it's a very expensive relationship from the plant's point of view because that carbon is not cheap. The plant can use that carbon for its own growth and for its own physiology. But because it needs that nitrogen then it gives that some of that carbon to the Rhizobia. Now the point I'm getting at here is that if you have a soil for example that already has a lot of nitrogen either residual nitrogen or you actually apply nitrogen fertilizer then what you are signaling to the plant is well why should I invest in this Rhizobium business or these nodules when in fact I have nitrogen here already with me. So because it's an expensive process if you supply the plant with nitrogen fertilizer or if you see that legume in a soil that already has quite a bit of nitrogen fertilizer then that symbiosis won't be as effective. So the plant will just take that free nitrogen of course free to eat not to you and and not bother about inviting the Rhizobium in to fix nitrogen for the plant. Now how many people use inoculants here? Okay granular or peat? Granular peat 50-50? Okay the ones that like granular why? Granular peat 50-50? Easy to work with? Cheaper? No? Not necessarily? Just easier? How about peat? The one that use peat? The price is good? Okay okay yeah. So what I'm hoping to demonstrate to you here is that those two formulations of Rhizobia of inoculants actually form different patterns of nodules and for the see one of them the granular inoculant is actually applied to the soil whereas the peat inoculant is applied to the seed. Now Rhizobia are not very mobile in the soil now they all multiply but they won't move with water and everything not not as much okay so when you apply or when you inoculate your legume seed and then plant that seed most of the Rhizobia is just around where you planted that seed and so when the plant germinates it's those first roots the primary root and a few of the laterals that emerge first those are the ones that will get nodulated first because that's where the Rhizobia is. So with peat inoculation then you get what we call crown nodulation so most of the nodules are around the crown. Now I'll see if I can I dug up a few earlier but they have dried up already so I'll see if I can dig some some fresh plants here so this is I'll just show you the treatments so this is lentil un-inoculated here low nitrogen and it's the same thing that in that next replicate and the other two there for peas so it's the same treatment so un-inoculated low nitrogen that raw for both lentil and peas and here we have peat inoculant both for lentil and for peas at the back there and over here we have granular inoculant same thing so before you assess before you start to assess nodulation one of the things you have to look at is just looking at the plants because we're talking about nitrogen here so nitrogen deficient plants will look yellowish whereas plants well supplied with nitrogen will look greenish so one of the things you look at is just look at the plants is there any difference between that treatment here and this treatment in terms of plant color or is there any difference between this one and that one there now I don't see much of a difference and I said I suspected two things either the background nitrogen here is very high already or or that the plants are still young and so usually if you see the the peas at the back there they're just beginning to flower from flowering to port filling stage that's when they'll need a lot of nitrogen and that's when differences will show between a a plant that's not getting enough nitrogen and one that does or that is getting enough nitrogen so in this particular case it's a combination of both I'm told the background nitrogen here is a 60 pounds of n which is quite a bit actually but secondly if we come back maybe at port filling stage we might see color differences here but we're not seeing that color difference yet but we might still see well as I say I was here before so I know there are no use here so I'll dig up a few plants is there any nodules on this stuff here too like is there any there would be and as I say I've been here before so even here there could be nodules and the actual they are nodules and that's because the soil has indigenous rhizobia or native rhizobia so the populations are not the same but they will have native rhizobia in there so you might see nodules now the thing about native rhizobia is you don't know whether they are good fixers of nitrogen or not some of them could others could not but what you want is that you want your nodules to be formed by that inoculant that you put in because you know that the company selected that strain because they know it's a good nitrogen fixer so if you just see nodules and they are formed by indigenous rhizobia you don't know whether you're actually getting good fixation or not okay so yeah so let me start here then and see and so when you're digging the plants for nodules of course you don't just pull them out like that you'll be stripping the nodules so you actually dig around the plants dig deep down and get the root at the bottom okay okay I see one nodule here but not not a whole lot many so it's hardly anything there yeah I got nodules you wouldn't have done that yeah it's nice and wet today these are demo plots guys so come on over and yeah yeah yeah okay so I need no crated hardly any nodule yeah yeah there are some there but not necessarily around the crown not as many around the crown as I would have liked yeah so apart apart from looking at how many nodules you have you also have to look at the size of the nodules how big they are and also what's their color now when you just dig up the plant you can actually tell we don't have to now put a some water here sometimes if the soil is very muddy you might need to spray your plants so that you see the nodules very well oops but in this case we don't have to I can see them so so apart from the distribution of the nodules you have to look at the nodule size and then nodule color and now these ones here they look pretty pinkish to me so you should have pink if you crash an odule it should look pink inside it should have some pink juice inside so that's a sign of uh uh uh uh an odule that's fixing nitrogen very well oops sorry oops sorry so dig up some granulars here and actually the peas might be better examples i dug up a few i put them on the side there you can you can look at the peas later you figure it'll take longer for the granular inoculant to get the nodule started yeah i was going to come to that point so the difference between crown nodulation and which is what i said about seed inoculation so most of you nodules are formed on the crown so because the nodules i mean the inoculant is in the vicinity of the plant those nodules on the crown tend to form first okay whereas with granular inoculants the inoculant is in the soil you are applying the inoculant in the soil and so it will take a while before the roots or some of the roots some will reach that inoculant very quickly but some will take some time to reach that inoculant and that's why so quite a few of the nodules and a granular inoculant will be on lateral roots instead of on the crown now so the difference then is those crown nodules form first and so they'll start fixing nitrogen first but then they will also die earlier okay so whereas these other guys they will start fixing they'll formulate and start fixing nitrogen a bit later but they'll also keep fixing the nitrogen well into the life of the plant so so you get a trade-off both ways so a good combination is where you have good both crown modulation and lateral root modulation okay but when you've got a land that's been in rotation with pulses for several years you do kind of build up a natural that's true that's true but i think it's always better to inoculate anyway you still inoculate but what i'm saying is you still you get some that okay well will come on naturally that's right yeah yeah yeah and because those are in the soil they don't take to form on lateral roots that's what i mean on lateral roots that's true yeah yeah okay now on the other side here what we wanted to show you are there is anybody who grows dry beans here no dry bean growers um a little bit do you inoculate or you apply nitrogen inoculate good yeah because quite a few guys in the leafbridge area in the irrigation zone they don't bother about inoculating dry beans because uh they say that uh beans are for they're known to be inefficient nitrogen fixers and so they don't even bother instead they just apply nitrogen so what we wanted to show you here is treatments where we've applied a lot of nitrogen we've applied nitrogen fertilizer so what that does is first of all it will discourage nodulation but even if you have nodulation they won't be much nitrogen fixation in those nodules because as i said before it's an expensive process for the plant and so the plant invests in that system if it is in a nitrogen deficient soil but if you give it enough nitrogen it won't bother to fix nitrogen so that's why again it's not very clear here but i mean they wouldn't be it wouldn't be clear here anyway because this is all high nitrogen contents but what we're supposed to show is that there will be very little nodulation in these plants here because of the high nitrogen but there are actually some here already but not as much as we're inoculating in a low nitrogen soil although as i said this this soil though 60 60 n is not really low end that's quite a bit and that brings me to what we call starter nitrogen some people say should you apply starter nitrogen now if you're applying that phosphate fertilizer like 1121 that's got enough nitrogen there already so you don't need to apply another nitrogen just for the rhizobia to help the rhizobia so in most cases there's no need to apply any more nitrogen fertilizer just rely on that rhizobium because otherwise you are just replacing that biological process with a chemical process if you apply a fertilizer newton i have a question for you if we're applying a granular inoculant and we're putting it seed placed and you're also putting it seed placed with that 1152 is there any toxicity issues with the fertilizer itself or and and if there is it rate dependent or is it completely safe i know there are toxicity issues if remember the when granular started started coming up uh people didn't have that third tank to apply for application of granular so some people thought well can't i use the granular can i just put it in the same in the fertilizer tank now there there will be a lot of toxicity when you are mixing uh but even if it's in a separate time it would still be mixed together that's right but not as much so uh the soil has a way of conditioning things so there will be yeah there will be issues but not as much as actually using one tank for both fertilizer and granular inoculant that's right did you catch what i meant though i think what what i'm saying is that if we may still have a separate tank okay yeah and you've got 1152 in a separate tank but they're going through the same seed run so okay the same hoses yeah and it'll be with the seed i know that that we usually put the fertilizer down in levels that are not going to damage the seedling itself but i'm just curious if you know if there's any potential for damaging the inaugural yeah i i'm not aware of any study to that effect but i think as long as it's uh good for the seed it shouldn't be too bad for the uh for the rhizobia as well but uh yeah no i haven't come across any any results to that effect speaking of the starter fertilizer loss how uh how much is actually needed well people say up to 30 nitrogen is not too bad once you start getting to 60 then that's not starting anymore now you're just replacing the rhizobia but after 30 shouldn't be too good that's pounds of the actual nitrogen that's right yeah yeah okay uh we'll come to the mycorrhizor here and we're fortunate we have a a representative here from uh premier tech which is a company that manufactures uh a mycorrhizor product called mic pro and his name is mark can i uh i'll let him uh speak about mycorrhizor i already showed him these plots here so you know he knows what's going on well thanks dude i won't take a lot of time here but um like newton mentioned uh we uh manufacture inoculants at premier tech premier tech is a canadian uh owned privately owned company we've been working in horticulture and agriculture for uh well horticulture for well over um 10 15 years on the inoculant side but in terms of agriculture we're relatively recent about five years and our main focus is the mycorrhizor so as newton mentioned in his introduction we have good fungi and we have bad fungi we try and spray to get rid of all the pathogenic fungi but there's actually fungi in the field that are there to help your plant uptake nutrients and the mycorrhizor is a beneficial fungus that associates with root systems of both pulses and cereals we do have some demo plots here on cereals as well but the idea is to build a stronger root system and increase your surface area for nutrient and water absorption from the soil as probably a lot of you know we invest money in putting fertilizer down uh at seeding and we know that the plant itself is somewhat limited in what it can uptake from the soil so having these beneficial bacteria and fungi are there to help help basically optimize your uh nutrient uptake and what we see is that obviously translates to healthier crops uh and that translates to uh higher yields so we do see in a lot of pulses better uh increased yield and in the cereals we also see increased yield but one of the aspects that we're starting to dig into a little bit more is the quality aspect so if you can imagine that you're uptaking more nutrients from the soil those will end up in your seed and will help your plant resist stresses and also increase that grain quality so there are different types of inoculants to try and make things easy for uh the growers to use so there are different formulations and different ways to apply it but the idea is that you want to get that mycorrhizae down just as the same concept as your inoculants for nitrogen fixing you want to get it down close to the seed on the seed or in the furrow so that as soon as that seed germinates it starts forming that symbiosis or that network uh to improve nutrient uptake for the plant so in a nutshell that's uh that's the idea behind using uh these kind of inoculants to improve your plant production is to not replace fertilizer or chemicals but it's used as a tool to basically maximize whatever you guys are already investing in and putting into the soil for your crops i just dug up some plants here from uh mic pro and none there i think i think they're in this order in this case we're not looking for nodules because they don't form nodules and you can't see this type of mycorrhizae but you're supposed to see just look at the the root system and look see how healthy it looks and now although it doesn't look like much here but a subtle difference can mean a lot in terms of yield differences now if you look i think from here you can tell this is un-inoculated and this is inoculated just look at this replicate and look at in the back there as well now you can sort of tell you know there's seems to be some difference here between the inoculated and the un-inoculated so that's one variety and this is durham wheat and this is another variety of durham wheat and that's a third variety of durham wheat so again just comparing inoculated and un-inoculated sometimes when they are too close the plants are too close you can tell but look at the ones close in the back there sometimes you see better when the plants are a bit further from you any questions how are we doing for time how are we doing for time okay i'll just ask a final question here about uh some of these biological products we see on the market has anybody tried those some of these liquid products that uh you see on the internet or you do you know what i'm talking about has anybody tried them the biological products that are supposed to work wonders for you in the soil no and i'm talking i'm not talking about micronutrients but yeah right yeah well looks like uh yeah you guys maybe i'm not quite familiar with those but that's that's a good thing the only thing i was going to say is whether they work or not i don't know uh see they have all kinds of claims now the best way to do is on your farm have a if you want to try a product you know just try it out first before investing it you know have a patch with that inoculant in and a patch without that and just see what the difference looks like before you invest big anything else okay so i'll leave it there if uh how about a liquid inoculance or liquid inoculants well so liquid inoculants it depends are you talking liquid inoculants applied to the seed or to the soil either way yeah you know the thing about these formulations is uh under normal conditions if everything is okay on the farm usually formulation doesn't matter okay your peat your granular your liquid whether applied to the seed or the soil they all work perfectly but the difference comes when there you have issues on the farm uh is your soil acid uh was it a dry year or was it a very wet year too wet so in those of on those kind of conditions uh research has shown that the granular inoculants tend to perform better in those conditions than these other formulations but if everything is fine the weather is fine there shouldn't be much of a an issue yeah hey newton i have got a question for you which i kind of lost all of a sudden talked about the weather and it erased my brain uh so you talked about the symbiotic relationship of inoculants and and the plant and that it does come at a cost to the plant now i've also heard that oh yeah we should get nitrogen fixing wheat they should genetically modify that that would be awesome what's your take on that is it really that awesome or is it does it come too much of a cost people have tried for a long long time to have that kind of thing in wheat uh so the difference with the legumes is that nodule that nodule is a very complicated organ you know it houses the you know the rhizobium uh but it also controls what goes in and out of that module wheat doesn't have that kind of structure but people are trying to engineer it so that they can have can have some kind of structure similar to the nodule but up now attempts haven't been successful but people are still trying so with this jmos now who knows you know there might be something coming soon but up to this point it's been difficult and i guess then the follow-up question is is is it worth it like you know it's always a trade-off that it comes at a cost of the plant yeah you know like uh depending on the price of the crop say the dry bean guys they don't really rely on the the nitrogen fixing capabilities because the fertilizer is worth it worth the response essentially yeah that is true but i think if we if we had such a system it would be it would help environmentally at least so then we saw that we don't have to apply so much fertilizer yeah i mean like for legumes for example you know we don't apply as much nitrogen if it has on legumes so the environmental footprint or the carbon footprint or whatever footprint is less so if if only just to protect our environment it would be good to have nitrogen fixing weight any last questions for newton all right join me in thanking him
