 Through the Eastern Africa Agricultural Productivity Program, or EAP, tens of thousands of small-scale farmers are receiving the training and resources needed to increase the production of rice, cassava, wheat and milk, the region's most commonly consumed foods and several of the most vital commodities in the fight against hunger. With support from the government of Tanzania, Maria and other rice farmers in the last two years has doubled and in some cases more than tripled yields.

I miss believing thataltro and we can grow the plants and grow the plants. To productively farm this land, Maria and her fellow farmers are learning better rice farming techniques and have worked with researchers to identify improved varieties of the grain. We have to plant a plant, plant, and plant a plant. But our plant was a plant. After the plant, we have developed a plant, a plant, a plant, and a plant. And we can grow the plant. Across the Lake Victoria region in Uganda, as in other parts of Africa, cassava is one of the most popular crops. But cassava brown streak disease has been a major threat to the food supply and has caused many smallholder farmers to lose an essential source of income. Cassava as a crop is being devastated by cassava brown streak disease. And so we are sure that once we have gotten these plantlets that are disease-free, then we can actually distribute them. An essential aspect of improving agriculture is to provide farmers with new technologies that are suited and adapted to local conditions and can better withstand crop diseases and the effects of a changing climate. The first attribute that I see with it is high yielding and the first growing variety. The number two, it is resistant to diseases and pests. But November normally is a very dry period. But this cassava managed to resist the harsh weather and it managed to make it where it is right now. In Ethiopia, agricultural research centers have created several wheat varieties that are resistant to the plant diseases that have decimated many farmers' crops. In 2010, both of the varieties are susceptible to yellow rust, so there was 100% yield loss. But nowadays, more than 10 varieties you can see in the farmers' fields, so the distribution of the rust is reduced. The next generation is 82% yielded to fill.

Also, a healthy mix of animal feed that uses various types of fodder and protein-rich crop residues has greatly contributed to increased production of milk, putting more money in smallholder farmers' pockets. We have more fiends, then that translates to more milk. Our farms are green because of the manure. They have people have trained us how to plant good quality of napkin grass. They have also trained us how to balance their foods so the animals are healthy. To succeed, we have to do it as a business and also commercialize agriculture because that is the way forward for us to meet our domestic demand and also export. With funding and other support from the World Bank, investment in the agriculture sector is producing returns upwards of 40 to 60 percent, creating jobs throughout the region and transforming the lives of farmers and other small agribusiness owners. farmers will graduate from being subsistence to becoming semi-commercial and some will be commercial farmers. Unlike having a national program, the regional program, we have that age of many researchers, many institutions, both publicly and private, come together and work together for a common goal. farmers are held by vegetables and microferechtств. population<|ar|> farmers agricult Adelaide farmers However, farmers and children have workers that will be planted in our sites and Mechan Too that anything
