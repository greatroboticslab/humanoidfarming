 We get a lot of questions about folks talking about winter grazing. When I met Gabe, he's in North Dakota. He was saying that when he had a snowstorm, his animals would choose to graze in his field rather than be in the barn with the hay. That's in North Dakota. John Lyons doesn't get a lot of snow in Piedmont, Alabama, but he said when they did get 11 inches of snow, his animals went out and dug to forage in the fields rather than eat hay in the barn. So that's the two stories I know. What do you got? So first, I would have to go back to what we call historical ecological context and pose the question, where in the world do we think the bison, the elk, the antelope, the caribou, the moose, everything else ate during the winter? Did they go to somebody's barn? I mean, how did they survive? Yeah. The oryx. Right. So all we're doing is we are mimicking what has happened for millennia. The oryx. The oryx. The oryx. The oryx. The oryx.
