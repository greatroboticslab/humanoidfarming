 Here in Vermillion Parish, they're very dependent on their cattle industry, but the recent weather conditions have affected harvesting hay, which also affects continuous years. Low hay shortage can make people have to dump their cattle on the market, dump their calves sooner than they want, get rid of cattle, get rid of big cows, and it drives the market down. Too many cattle on the market, and the lack of hay also hurts us with the poor cattle. Coy Jerk, a cattleman in Abbeville, has grown up in the cattle industry. He says the hay shortage has been affecting everyone in the local industry. Girls, let's go, let's go. We're just trying to hold on, I guess. Hold on until, you know, hopefully next year we won't get the rains we get. And hopefully we don't have a cold winter like they're calling for. So if we have the cold winter, we'll see. He says the continuous rainfall hasn't given them enough time to cut and produce hay. This year was kind of a wet September, so it's still wet. We're still battling it. As we speak now, I'm trying to get some hay in before the rain tomorrow. So pushing, you know, time. However, Dirk says the cattle industry is in his blood and he's optimistic the industry will continue to have a substantial impact on Vermillion Parish. Oh, you have to like it. I guess the biggest benefit is liking to do it. That's about it. It's a hard industry. Dirk is hoping the upcoming summer will be hot and dry, allowing him to harvest his hay.
