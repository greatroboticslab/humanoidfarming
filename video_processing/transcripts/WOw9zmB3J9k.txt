 I hope you just don't lead anyone else on. Like it's not a game. I'm pissed. You basically called me a hoe. You have great eyes. I have great eyes? Yeah. Should you tell everyone that? No, I haven't told a soul. You're lying. So, first things first. Hit me. Where are you from? St. Louis. And how do you like it? Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. So, are you a Chiefs fan? Uh, I'm not really a big football fan in general. What you got in your hand? Well, I brought something for you. Oh, okay. Oh. So, it's a photo of me. Yeah. Because even though I'm a city girl, I can still be a farmer and look the part. Right. Yeah. Yeah. You definitely look the part. Yeah. That's a good photo right there. Oh. Um. Um. I cannot kiss you. I cannot kiss you. Okay. There's a reason for that. I'm going to marry someone someday. It might be you. It might not be you. And I do not want something of me kissing another man on television. You. You. If it's you, then we don't have anything to worry about. I certainly thought that, uh, this was going a different way. It obviously is a dating show. Yeah. That those are my values. And that's what I believe. And I don't want that of me on the internet anywhere. Because I want my husband to have more than that. I'll give you this, but you gotta trade me. Four. Please. Stay. I want you. I need you. Oh God. Don't. Take. These beautiful things. There was, you know, there was a girl or two at the, at the speed date. That I kind of thought that too. About the time. You know, you know. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm sure the other person was really gonna, you know, that too. About the heart kind of skipping a beat. Um, you know, it. And I feel like I've got a really good connection. I do not want to string you along and think like, if it comes down to you and another girl, that I've only looked at her. I, I re, I respect for you to be like, ripped abandon off Taylor. You ripped a bandit off Taylor, you're like, it? You're not it. No, no, no, no. No, you did, but it's fine. I just wish you would, like, want to get to know me more. But because you have your eyes on someone, I hope you just don't need anyone else on. How are you? So if I'm going home, I'm going to protect the other girls. So we actually decided, well, we as in he, decided that I'm going to go home. He was like, it's really hard because from my very first conversation, I had eyes and my heart skipped a beat for one girl. I honestly couldn't care less if I impressed them or not. You know? I'm from Southern California. I grew up in Orange County. OK. I'm a SoCal girl. I'm not a good farmer. And I just recently moved to Dallas. Could you see yourself kind of adjusting to the small town lifestyle that you've been, you know, experiencing the last few days? So I'm going to be honest. Shopping and going out to dinner and being around civilization is important to me. OK. I'm not going to lie and say that I can go live in the most rural area and be super happy with it. We definitely appreciate the honesty. Yeah. I know that's not necessarily the cookie cutter answer that you're probably supposed to give. Yeah. Right. Well, you know, John does value this farm a lot. For sure. And it happens to be two hours away from civilization. That might be an issue in the future. For sure. It could be an issue. I think, like, compromise is a big thing. Right. You know? No, I think John, he's at the wheel of his vehicle. You know? I'm going to be honest. I'm also used to being at the wheel. But there's only one wheel in the car. There's only one steering wheel. That was very concerning to me. When you're married and you're choosing to spend your life with someone, what they need is just as important as what you need. And I'm not exactly the type of girl that's going to sit in the back seat. So that was a little bit of a turning point. Kind of sucked to hear, honestly. Are the girls in this from the city, from the country? Most of our gals live in bigger cities. Yeah. I don't think any of my girls been to Alabama. So they're definitely going to be different. I think it's a better match sometimes when vicariously you'll get to fall in love with the country again through them. Yeah. So when did you realize she was one for you? When I saw Father the Bride in 1991. That was it, huh? So how many have come and gone already? No, I've sent one home. I sent one home. I sent one home. I haven't sent anyone home yet. You haven't, really? No. Five? Five. You can't just pick five. Yeah, I know. These aren't baseball cards. No, no. Whoever it is that you start to find yourself really nervous around is probably the one. Yeah, that's a good way to look at it. Yeah, definitely. Well, good luck with all of it, guys. And you, you have a problem. I do have a problem. Right. All right, guys. All right. It was a pleasure. Good luck. Thank you for the advice. Yeah, well, I mean, no pressure. This is only your life. That's right. I do. I got up at like 5.30 this morning, and I room with Haleigh, as you know, and she wasn't in the room. I checked with Chelsea, and she wasn't in there. I don't know where she could have been. My gut feeling is that maybe she was probably sneaking off. This is maybe C-Met. Yeah. Because I feel like they've been like eyeing each other differently like when we're around them. So I feel like it's possible. Where else would she have gone? Yeah. Right now, my feelings are strong for Matt. But it's already hard enough to get time with him. And now with Haleigh sneaking out, I obviously hope that's not the case. I want to make sure that these girls know they can trust me, and that we're all on the same page. Ready to figure this out? Honestly, I do want to hear Matt out, and I hope I can get the answers that I need in order to move on from this. But if I don't sense some type of honesty, I don't think I need to be here anymore. Some stuff obviously went down that we're all aware of, but we can't like continue to move on with this, obviously, until everyone like feels good. I think we would just really appreciate some honesty, especially from you, about what happened. I mean, nothing happened. I don't know what else to tell you guys. I could see why you think that and like why it looked like that. But that's also not the case. So I really do like Haleigh. Like she's been great. And I've gotten to know her a little bit, but not any more than you guys. I just wanted to like chat with you all because I feel left out since Vivian left. And like I just feel, you know, out in the cold. And I just do want to like wonder why that's the case. Or like, yeah, just want to like hash it out right now, because I don't want this lingering. I don't want this to be the energy in our house at all. I'm not a confrontation person. I don't enjoy conflict at all. But after my date, I had heard a comment being made that like, oh, like you wouldn't have wanted the one-on-one anyways because they don't make it to finals. And that was really frustrating for me because that sounds like you think it's a game show and not like you're winning a husband at the end of this. Like it's not a game. And coming from like a super high high of the date and then hearing that made me not want to be friends with you, if I'm being completely honest, we're here for Jay. And I feel like I can't talk to you about that at all. I think Tiana is very calculated. And I think that everything she does is with intention. For me, like, just like little digs you've made, like when we were listening to Sexy Red and like Vivian and I were looking for the hose, and then you told me to look in the mirror. Like that's not nice. Is anything going to change between you and Tiana? No, nothing's going to change between Tiana and I. Like I feel how I feel, and I don't feel like I need to sit there and have a conversation with her. Like, I mean, it's like you basically called me a hoe. I'm just like over it. I had no idea where this was going to go. And I honestly came in here thinking this is going to be extremely easy. Mm-hmm. And then I met you. And the spark flew instantly. And I need to tell you right now, you are one of the most amazing guys that I've ever met in my life. You are probably one of the most fiercely loyal people I've ever met. God-fearing, family-oriented, and everything that I've ever looked for in a man. God-fearing, family-oriented, and everything that I'm doing. But. There are just little things that are keeping me from believing that I am what you need from a partner. I think I'm what you want, but. You are very much someone that likes to be in the driver's seat. And so am I. I think you need someone who's going to let you lead. That's OK. I appreciate your honesty. Y'all got a cool group of guys. Authenticity is the best thing. Look for that in the girls. Yeah. I'm sure y'all know all this. I'm just speaking to friends here. Yeah. Thankfully, don't look for the girls that are trying to start stuff with other girls, you know. So look for the girls that do the little things for y'all. Like Sydney, she was always watering my grass. But it helped because we weren't getting rain. And you know, I had green grass. I was like, yeah, right there. It means a lot. But my last relationship ended kind of very abruptly. I had a lot of insecurity, I would say. I'm always someone who loves, like, way too hard. And, like, I'm never given the love back. I don't want to cry. I am emotional. I do get emotional. Really? Yes, I do. Come on. No, I won't cry. I'm not going to. You're already getting there. No, I'm fine. OK. No, I just think it's true. Like, I do, like, always love people, like, way too much. Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine, though. You're not crying yet. You're just making me giggle. It's just the smoke, right? I think that I have always hoped to fall in love. And I've always been that girl that wants a fairytale ending. But unfortunately, I've always been let down. I'm dating to marry. That's really important to me. Yeah. And I want to be in a serious relationship. But it has to be mutual. Like, I will not be in another relationship where I love the person more. Mm-hmm. It just won't. I do have to have someone that is willing to accept that and, like, also know how to handle my emotions and things like that. Kaylee has a phenomenal heart. She would make anybody around her happy. I mean, she makes me happy. Thank you for bringing me on this date. You're very welcome. You want to head out? Yes. All righty. But I don't want to break the girl's heart at all because it does seem fragile. And it does seem very large. That's a lot of pressure. Hi, guys. Hi. I'm Tiana. Tiana. I'm Rissa. Hi. Nice to meet you. This is so cute. Is it? I love it. I don't know where to sit. Yeah, you can sit here. Yeah. Or there. Yeah, Rissa, she from California as well. Yes. Woodland Hills. Mm-hmm. Just crickets. Okay, then. But with Julia, I just could tell that she was not feeling it anymore. What's up? And it kind of goes back to, you know, actually speak a little louder than words. I just wanted to pull you to the side and just, you know, really just tell you how I've been feeling lately. When I first met you, you know, I was a little nervous for you on the farm. But, uh, I was like, you know, I want to give her a chance. And, like, when you first came and I seen you, you know, kind of start moving the hay bells, interacting with the cows, I thought that was heading in the right direction. And you was like, you know, kind of willing to try, but I couldn't see you happy here. I don't think you could even see yourself happy here, honestly. I just feel like you're lucky to have me here and you're not taking advantage of it. That's all. But that's like, so I'm just kind of checked out and kind of like, whatever. I just feel like almost like a hit to my ego a bit. I think we just kind of need to part ways. Whatever. I wish, you know, nothing but the best for you. Jay is a great guy. He's just not for me. He's kind of boring. Sorry I said that. I know you said you wanted to have a conversation. Yeah. I don't know if there's a reason for me to be here anymore. I just kind of felt like I was on the back burner. Yeah. And I feel like my person that's for me isn't gonna, like, make me feel that way. And you're a great guy. Like, it's just like with time being so limited, like, I just don't know if it's for us. Right. Well, you know, it's just really good to know. I know, you know, we haven't spent a lot of time or anything together. I think the biggest thing for me is with all the drama, it's kind of made me feel like, you know, that connection, that chemistry just wasn't there. But this process, time is everything, and I'd be doing, you know, you a disservice, me as well, if we waste any more time. For sure. There's nothing against you as a person, because I mean, you're beautiful. You got a great personality. Yeah. Oh. So, how do you feel your first night here? Yeah, how's it been? It's been a little awkward, not gonna lie. Yeah. I understand it was, like, not an ideal situation. John potentially having a connection with another girl was a little bit scary for us. Absolutely. Yeah. Are you feeling a little bit better? It was tough being on a one-on-one and feeling like we had a growing relationship for, like, the first time, I feel like. I was on a high, and then I just, like, went straight to a low. We just had our mindset that, like, if he brings another girl back, then, like, he doesn't see something really special in us. I also get that. He assured us that it wasn't true. I walk into your quarters. You're so kind. I've really enjoyed this time with Claire. Her and I feed off of each other very well in terms of humor and conversation. Just had a really good time. Good night. Good night. Good night. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. There's a couple billion people in the world. And a million other places we could be. But you're here with me. Take a moment. Yeah. First kiss with Claire was pretty nice. Just something about her. Yeah. I don't really want to talk about it. I just feel like you don't pursue me, and I want to feel pursued. I want to be wanted. And I don't feel like I'm getting that here. I totally understand. I can't choose between the three of you right now. I'm so damn indecisive. It's, you know, if I was in your shoes, I would probably be fed up with it as well. It's like, can you not see that I'm a prize? Like, I get it. There's a lot of things about you that I really, really like. But I still haven't made up my mind. This is, this is a lot. It's hard because I know my feelings towards you and I do like you. It's just like, I love myself enough to be like, you know what? If you're still unsure, like, it would just be best. For me to like, send myself home. I get it. This sucks, but I understand. But I'm sad to see you go. Are you glad you came? I am. I'm definitely happy that I met you. For sure. I'm really happy that I met you too. I'm feeling nervous for John to meet my family today. I mean, I really like John, so them getting along is definitely important. Does anyone want a glass of wine? Yeah. This one? That'd be great. Okay, great. Do you guys want? No, thanks. You want a tea or a water or anything? I'm fine. Alrighty. Yeah, so. Pinecone. Dang it. So how has this been? Oh, yeah. How has this journey been for you guys? Interesting. Yeah, very interesting. He uses the word interesting as like a good thing, so. I do. I had to quickly learn that. Okay. I really don't know what I'm saying when I say it. I just kind of say it's interesting. Interesting. Yeah. You are right up my alley and you have everything that I've been looking for and you're so gorgeous. But I just feel like I don't know how I've gained this stronger connection with Chelsea. I'm just. I don't even know what to say. You're joking, right? I gave you such an easy out the other night on our date. I felt like we were in the friend zone and you literally just said everything that you thought I wanted to hear. Whatever. It's just such a shame to me because we could have left this process as really good friends. But now I'm just leaving with a bad taste in my mouth because you led me on. Everything I've said to you, I meant. I didn't just say that because you wanted to hear it. Well, it certainly seems that way now. Yeah, I understand. I just have been genuinely conflicted. Like you guys are both so great in so many ways. I've meant every single word that I said. It's one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make. Like this is not easy. I don't. I would love if you could stay here. No, of course it's not easy. And yeah, I know you would have loved if all the girls could have stayed here. You said that multiple times, but that's not how this works. Well, I wish you nothing but the best. I do for you as well. I don't have anything else to say. All right, we'll be praying for you. Yeah, you too. I'm pissed. Oh my heart. Bless his heart. Oh, he had to add in there. I'll be praying for you. No, I'll be praying for you, buddy.
