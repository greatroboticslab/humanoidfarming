 If you ever want to grow potatoes but you lack the space to do it, here's one way to grow with limited space. Try using a grow bag. To start, fill the bag with 5 inch of potting mix. Fold it and add 3 to 5 inch layer on top. Make sure that the bag is well draining and only water when the soil feels dry. Once the plant starts growing, it's time to hill up. Unfold the bag and bury the stem with finished compost. Leave about a few inches above soil level. Repeat the process until you've unfolded the entire bag. And if you want to go a little extra, use a burlap bag to keep hilling up. When the flowers appear, you can stop and harvest is ready when the leaves turn yellow.
