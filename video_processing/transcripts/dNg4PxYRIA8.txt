Howto & Style
 I can't believe this actually worked to keep my buttercream from melting at the farmers market. But it did. I mean, I knew it would work because that's just how I get down. But let me stop playing in your face and tell you what I did. I used ice packs and a fan to circulate cool air in my display case. Yeah, it was that easy. And nothing melted. Even when the temp hit 90 degrees. And I was out there for over 4 hours. I'ma have more details on my process in the captions so you can try it too.
