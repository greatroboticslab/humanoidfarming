 Hi everyone, with Ümit's absence I'm becoming more and more of a fixture in these videos. Today I want to talk about agriculture and how artificial intelligence is affecting it. When we think of AI our minds often gravitate towards industries like technology, finance or healthcare but agriculture isn't typically the industry you think about. But AI is making significant inroads here, revolutionizing farming practices in remarkable ways. Today let's explore how AI is not just enhancing agriculture practices but fundamentally transforming the sector. AI enables something that hasn't been done before. It's called precision agriculture by analyzing data from various sources like drones and satellites or IoT devices. And this analysis allows for precise monitoring of crop health, efficient allocation of resources and optimizing yields, leading to more sustainable practices. For example, companies like John Deerey are leading the way in precision agriculture. Their AI powered equipments use satellite data and sensors to guide autonomous tractors, ensuring that resources like water and fertilizer applied exactly where they are required. And this obviously reduces waste and increases productivity of agriculture. Another development of autonomous machinery is like self-driving tractors and harvesters. It's revolutionizing farming operations. These AI driven machines can perform tasks like planting, weeding and harvesting with minimal to non-human intervention, increasing efficiency and addressing labor shortages. Farmwise, a company that developed Titan FD35, an autonomous robot that can remove weeds from vegetable fields without using herbicides or chemicals and that promotes healthier soil and healthier crops. Also, AI is also developing, AI is playing a crucial role in developing climate resilience crops by simulating and predicting their responsibilities to various conditions. And this enables the breeding of crop varieties that can withstand extreme weather events and increasing food security in the face of an increasing concern of climate change. In silico medicine, for example, is leveraging AI to develop climate resilient crops that can withstand droughts or cold snaps. And the integration of AI has shifted agriculture like it shifted every other sector into processing of data and data driven decision making. Farmers now rely on AI power tools to analyze soil health, weather patterns, crop performances and leading to more informed and efficient farming strategies. For example, in Kenya, small scale farmers use AI tools. I believe they are called virtual agronomists or plant village that provides personalized farming advice and help with pest identification, management, crop suggestions. And these AI solutions have led to significant boosts and crop yields. AI enhances also the supply chain, the efficiency of supply chains by predicting market trends, optimizing distribution routes, reducing food waste. Next, in India, in India, the government has launched an AI, KISS'N AI initiative using AI to help farmers access market prices and optimize crop planting based on market demand. AI solutions like this measure that crops are distributed efficiently. Like they are producing the crop the market needs the most and reducing the waste and ensuring fresh produce at every level. Automation of agricultural tasks through AI is altering the labor landscape. While it addresses labor shortages and increases productivity, it also necessitates a shift in workforce skills towards technology management and data analysis. FarmLab, for example, is using AI and satellite imagery to monitor soil carbon levels. And they are working to make this data available to farmers and make this effectively manageable. With the rise of these new technologies, farm workers will no doubt need to learn new skill sets to operate, manage and maintain these equipments and systems. AI also contributes to sustainability in agricultural practices. For instance, AI-driven tools for carbon sequestering monitoring like farm labs we talked about are enabling farmers to track and improve their soil health, which can help with generating carbon credits and contribute to efforts against climate change. These tools promote environmental stewardship while helping farmers profit from sustainability efforts. In countries like Kenya, AI tools such as Virtual Agronomist and Plant Village provide small-scale farmers with tailored advice on fertilization and pest control. Leading to increased productivity and income. Farmers using these tools have seen dramatic improvements in their crop yields, which in turn helps to improve food security in the region. And governments are also adopting AI to support farmers. For example, in Uttar Pradesh, the state government of India, in collaboration with Google Cloud Platform, has launched a digital public infrastructure project to provide farmers with access to market languages, loans, advisory services. And this system uses voice-based interfaces in various languages, making it more accessible to farmers in rural areas. And AI is not merely a tool enhancing existing practices. It's a catalyst for profound transformation in the sector. From precision farming to autonomous machinery to data-driven decision-making and efforts in sustainability, AI is reshaping agriculture into something more efficient, more resilient and more sustainable industry.
