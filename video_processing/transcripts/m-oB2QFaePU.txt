 This is how a hay baler turns loose hay into compact bales. First, it picks up dried grass from the ground, compresses it into tight rectangular shapes, then shoots each bale into a trailing wagon for collection, saving farmers hours of manual labor and making transport and storage much easier during harvest season. These machines are essential for efficient hay production on modern farms.
