 Welcome to Tuscany, I'm Santiago. I'm Maria and we are from Agriturismo del Sole and we will show you our place. We are in a great location, we are in the middle of Crete Senesi and Valdorcia. Over there is Siena, Montalcino, Montisi. It's where we take the olive to make the oil. Pienza and Montepulciano. We produce olive oil, our food is homemade. If it's not, we buy it in farms all around here. We've got six rooms and one apartment with two rooms. Every room is suitable for couples, for family and for friends. One room is for disability and wheelchairs. Our Agriturismo was rebuilt in 2020. We want guests to feel like home, for that we take care of details. In each room there are furniture of my family and there are very great views. In our Agriturismo there are a lot of animals like cats, dogs, mini pigs and goose. Horses. As well. We are pet and children friendly. We can also rent bike and vespas to enjoy this place in another way. And have a great experience as well. So when you are in Tuscany, come and visit us! Conves years. Thank you very much. Mechanic design basic comfort Train visitors,
