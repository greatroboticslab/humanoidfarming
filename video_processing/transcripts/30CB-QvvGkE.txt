 Hi, this is the Farmstead Products 150 HD Seed and Grain Cleaner. Today we're going to give you an overview of this machine. Let's start up at the top. This is the hopper. This is where you would put your seed or grain that needs to be cleaned. On this side we have our pulleys. Pulleys are adjustable. You can adjust the speed of the fan as well as the motor speed. The motor is a 1.5 horsepower farm duty motor. It can be wired at 110 or 220, your choice. Again, this is your hopper. We have an adjustment gate here. You can adjust the speed and flow of your seed coming out of the hopper that will fall through the screens. This is a three screen system. The seed will fall through the first screen, through the second screen, and onto the third screen. While your seed is falling, the fan is blowing off the chaff and particulates that you don't want in order to clean your seed, as well as the body is vibrating. On this side we have the shaker mechanism. This is what makes the body vibrate back and forth. Here we have the fan that is blowing as your seed is falling through the screens. On the backside here, on the bottom, this is where your clean seed will come out. Also, we have an adjustment door here that you can open or close to increase or decrease the amount of wind that is blowing. This is the Farmstead 150 HD. Thanks for watchin'.
