Howto & Style
 Hey, Sean here from Spoken Garden. If you're growing plants in containers, then you know they need to be watered. Well today I'm going to give you three tips so you can keep them healthy and hydrated. So the first tip is you want to see if they actually need to be watered. Easy, use your finger, put it down into the soil, and see if you can feel any moisture. I'm bringing my finger out and it feels really dry, so we need to water this plant. The second tip is to not directly water overhead any of your plants because you don't want the leaves to burn in any sunlight and you don't want to bring more pests and diseases to your plant. And the third tip, you want to make sure when you're watering in a pot to fill it up to the rim of the pot and do this repeatedly because if you just do it once that water is not going to reach all the roots down below. So you want to do this two or three more times. So thank you for watching and we hope those were helpful. Make sure to subscribe down below so you don't miss our future garden care videos.
