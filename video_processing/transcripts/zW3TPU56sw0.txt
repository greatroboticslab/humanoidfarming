 It's 70 and sunny in Michigan and the fear of frost is long gone so it's time to plant my peppers. First I'm picking all the best ones from the bunch, focusing on plants with the thickest stems, early forking, and healthy root systems and taking them to the garden. I like to place all the plants first so I can make sure I'm happy with the arrangement and spacing and then I go in and plant them. I dig a small hole, drop a handful of worm castings in for nutrients, and plant each pepper by bearing the stem by about an inch. Now to safely get them out of those cups I just flip it over, crinkle the bottom, and it pops right out. Now I'm doing pretty tight spacing in here because I'm hoping they'll support each other on windy days and help reduce sunscald on neighboring plants. I'm also planting a few marigolds on the edge for pest control and starting cilantro seeds and dill seeds around the border. The whole bed gets a layer of straw to help the soil retain moisture and suppress weeds and then just watering that all in nicely to welcome the peppers to their new home. Now I've planted 66 peppers this year so follow along to see how they do.
