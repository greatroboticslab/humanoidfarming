 Music My name is Chris Wharton and I'm an associate professor in the nutrition program at Arizona State University And I'm extremely excited to have Jean-Martin Fortier here to offer this incredible workshop on profitable small-scale farming This is a collaboration that's been months in the making With a lot of organizations and I want to just call some of them out now so Kelly Young for example at U of A Cooperative Extension Helped put this on along with steadfast farms and Eric Schultz And a number of other folks are contributing to this event So I just want to make mention of one of the other organizations involved in this workshop It's called the food systems transformation initiative, and so this is a new organization at ASU It's one that I direct and it's really focused on Broadly equitable participation in the food system and that means we really care about food security and people's ability to have access to healthy Oftentimes locally produced culturally appropriate affordable food, but it's also about ensuring that people can have livelihoods in the food system And so this event is really an important piece of that we really care about having an integrated and diverse food system And allowing people to have the opportunity to be producers and participate in the food system from that perspective as well This morning We started out by looking at the sales and the amount of production that we do on our farm And then talked a little bit about the evolution of how we farm where we started, you know, we knew nothing about farming Started with 30 CSA members went to 50 the next year Then we went to 100 150 out of the farmers market and another one took us about five or six years To really get going broke the hundred thousand dollars sales mark in year four and We've been grossing 10% more ever since And always with a better bottom line so and then trying to explain to you guys that Part of the success comes of the land constraint that was our best teacher actually And it forced us to look at the way we're doing things in a different way We went with a permanent bed system That didn't make it necessary for us to have a tractor We avoided the cultivating with the tractor replace it with close spacings And by doing so optimized Certain things we also looked at the design of the farm really important And now I want to go in through certain details Of the soil Because Really that's what allows this intensive system system to happen And this is a great drawing taken from the book And I think it illustrates one important feature that we never need to forget Is that what makes The success of a crop What fuels this Is not the fertilizers It's not the compost It's not the seaweed or this magical powder Or whatever else people want to sell you What makes this possible Is the active life inside the soil These guys The earthworms The earthworms But also You know there's different Different critters Microorganisms They take the organic matter And they transform it Into nutrients That are readily available for the plants So the more biologically active your soil is The more fertile it is Okay So that's something that modern agronomy needs to come back to and teach us Because The way it's been done in the last 50 years Is we've replaced this With fertilizers Thinking that If you have the good balance Fertilizers You'll get good crops But what happens Is that the fertilizers They inhibit this life And so you'll get Less outcome from their work And so you need to put more fertilizers And then if you put more fertilizers You'll get less of the biology going So you need to put more So it's a win-win situation if you're selling fertilizers But if you're growing crop commercially You want to move away from that kind of system But also soil is sensitive Soil is not something that you can just run into with a rotor tiller or whatever And not think about the consequences You need to be thinking about the life inside your soil And your strategies should always revolve around how to enhance this life I don't have all the answers to that But it's definitely an approach that we need to keep in mind So the pH and the mineral balance These are what standard soil tests will tell you Again it's a good idea to have an agronomist or an extension agent help you out at that stage But aeration and drainage To create a habitat for that life To operate properly is important It's their house So keep this in mind Is the soil loose? Is the soil well structured? You know can the earthworms navigate in it? Organic matter crop rotation cover crop Is what we as growers need to put into the system To make this work Okay? So that's something to keep in mind This is something you have in the book So you don't need to read it down This is the fertility program that we've had on the farm for many many years And I'm not really sure how much it applies here But there's one key factor that you guys should be thinking about Is that we would put compost You'll see a lot of compost But it needed to be supplemented with organic fertilizers Because in our cold climate The organic matter in the compost needed to be mineralized Needs to be mineralized by the life in the soil And when we have soil that is not really hot This digestion takes longer But also when you're fertilizing Or for your writing compost or whatever You need to take into account What stage the plant is at Like most plants They'll want to have nitrogen early on in their growth stage Because they're doing all their leafy canopy To attract photosynthesis So they want to have nitrogen earlier on And it's a good mixture to have Organic fertilizers and compost Because once they've done that Then the root system can really develop And then they can go in the soil And get the compost And get the micronutrients that they'll get from the compost So in our fertility program If you read it in the book You'll see that there's a combination of both We've been using a lot of chicken manure With the compost And we're not adding compost every year just blindly It comes with You know we buy our compost Ready-made Comes with an NPK And we've had the fertility program Built according to what crops need When And then we fraction the does In many instances So again the take home message here is There's more to it than just blindly putting compost And thinking that all will work Your soil needs to be activated You need to make sure that The plant is getting what it needs at the right time And what's great about adding compost Is that you're not You're doing both You're putting nutrients And you're putting organic matter Which is what your soil really needs Both The reason why we buy our compost Is because we don't have a loader So to make the compost without a loader To make 40 tons of compost with a pitchfork Even if the interns are really nice I don't want to be that dreadful with them But also because you want to have compost That doesn't have any weed seeds Okay I'll talk about How we deal with weeds this afternoon And the big part of it is weed prevention On the farm So we have a whole program About how to minimize The weed infestion on the farm And the big part of it is not adding some From the outside in So an old pile of horse manure That somebody gives you That's a huge no-no Because if you put that in your field You're adding gazillion tons of weed seeds Into your garden The other reason why you would want to compost That manure is because when you're composting You're creating a product Where the nutrients get activated And they can stay in the soil for more than one year Which is not the case when you're only applying manure Okay So you're stabilizing this And you need to be doing it the right way So one other reason why we don't Make our compost is because frankly I don't really know how to make good compost You need to measure the temperatures You need to make sure that your pile Is covered all the time Is covered all the time And it's not the right time That's the right time And we have such a short season on my farm And I'm just happier to have somebody else That really knows what he's doing A geek do it for me And then he delivers it to my house To my farm And it's very affordable You know a 40 ton load Used to cost us around 2000 dollars Which is a fraction It's really 2% 1% of our sales on the farm You had a question? Somebody had a Yes That's better than That's better than just But you can compost it too But tarping it is one answer The thing is that if it's been Out in the fields Not covered for two years It doesn't have any nutritional value It's been leached away By the It has organic matter But at least you need to be aware of that Okay So we buy our compost Because it's easier for us to do so Because we definitely don't want any organic matter And because we want to have prime stuff Ideally with an NPK Analysis So we can We can add it Not blindly Does that make any sense for you guys? In certain parts when I say this Especially in France People are like You know You're not in a closed loop system No I'm not I'm in an intensive system The bottom line of my farm Is to get too decent salary From it And I'm super happy To be working with the geeks That are making that compost This is like I'm collaborating with them So The same thing We don't make our own seeds Because I prefer to deal with professional people That are really geeky about it And I'm not So Okay So spreading out the compost This whole idea of working I said it Eric did you hear that? I said the word idea again Can't say that word in English I'm sorry Is to be able to build soil over time Which is really uncommon In most conventional farming setups You have a soil that has a certain texture A certain amount of organic matter in it But if you keep amending it In big and large quantities over time You'll have a soil that is very different From what you started with And this is possible Because you're not using a manure spreader And spreading it everywhere You're concentrating the surface That really needs it I.e. the permanent bed And since you've intensified You get more production per square foot It's a worthwhile investment To say I'll be adding A lot of organic matter onto these beds Because they're valuable Each one of these beds We'll look at it later on Brings in at least $500 So if I put $40 of compost in one bed Which is four or five wheel barrels It's an investment So we're redefining this by thinking We're also building up soil We're building up the organic matter in our soils Some of the fields that I visit They have good cropping systems But they require a lot of organic fertilizers Because the texture is just not there yet Why not invest and put a lot of organic matter It's a worthwhile investment Okay so that's what we did for many years And we would spread it out like that And with wheel barrels And every year this year again There would be an intern Or sometimes it would Sometimes it would be the worker The first year worker And say oh JM You always talk about efficiency You go around giving conferences About how you need to be effective And all of that And there were wheel barrels Why don't we get a manure spreader And really you know speed up the process Because it does take time If you're putting seven Seven you know five to seven wheel barrels per bed And you have A hundred beds That's it can take three or four or five days And then I'm like yeah I've never thought about that Thank you for pointing that out But you know if you think it through Okay a manure spreader Let's say I find one that is four feet center to center They're pretty rare because they're all overbuilt now Well it needs to have a large turning area at the end So that would mean that I would need to reduce my beds Or I would need to have more land But I also need to have a loader For the tractor Because if you want to be really efficient Then you need to have a loader And then you need to have another tractor To be hauling the manure spreader So then you're buying two tractors And you're not going to buy them new Because you're using them for that And what's going to happen And when it's time to put the compost One of the tractors is going to break down And then you're going to spend your day Looking for the part somewhere in town And just while you could be doing it With a wheel shovel and a barrel And just doing it faster And not thinking about how This could be done differently At worst case scenario I could hire my neighbor He is 15 year old And he's a hockey stud And I could time him and say Okay how fast can you do this I'll pay you 15 bucks an hour And he would take two days to do the whole farm And then I don't need to buy machinery Wheel barrels and shovels in 2015 Might be appropriate technology Reliable And it's sequenced with all the rest of the things That we need to do on the farm Okay So I'm not here to convince you about this But if you go off and design the whole farm Because you think this is slow You might lose out in the end Okay Questions Yes How often do you do compost? We put compost That's the part in the book that you should read We put compost every other year In our rotation It's been divided that there's Botanical families But also heavy feeders and light feeders The nightshades And the heavy feeders The nightshades The cucurbits The crucifers They get the compost every year But the fields get compost every other year Because it's a rotation So we put a lot of compost every other year And then for the radishes The carrots The lettuces That come into these fields The next year They get the leftover from the previous year Try to I'm being filmed So it's important that I not go off And just Say crazy things But Was that clear? Yes Okay I leave them in the alleyways You were asking me about Using the pathways Which is what we do now But I'll I think I'll get there later on Okay We built up our soils this way Putting a lot of compost for five, six, seven years Our organic matter went from three percent to twelve percent Okay And that's when we stopped doing this And changed the regime where we're putting less organic matter We've substituted the compost for vermicompost Or what's the other word for that? Worm casting Okay Yes Putting on top And then we would go with the harrow And we would mix it into the first inch of the soil Okay Okay So that your nutrients doesn't get leached Or the soil binds it together If you're not calculating wheel barrels per bed What most people do is put half an inch You need to calculate Okay Three wheel barrels two wheel barrels five wheel barrels seven wheel barrels It's again it's better to do this consciously with a goal in mind And then just kind of spreading it out and just doing whatever Because if you over fertilize with compost Or with organic fertilize You can be polluting just the same as conventional farmers do Okay So you should have a target You should always have your compost pile covered Because when it rains otherwise it gets leached of its nutrients I've told you guys that I didn't know how to make compost That's a fact Because every year I make compost And the result is never quite successful But we do use some of our leftovers Like let's say the old tomato plants And we had a couple of sheeps and we would make piles But honestly if you're going to be successful as a grower If you're selling prime stuff Your compost input is one of the most important ones So make sure that it's good compost Good quality compost It's not just anything that you're trying to build without measuring temperatures Without taking care of what's going in where Without looking at the ingredients It's a definitely worthwhile endoward to do this right
