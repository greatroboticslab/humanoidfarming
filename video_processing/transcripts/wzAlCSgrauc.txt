 We knew where we were on to something when that fall we were watching our two young boys pull carrots out of the garden and just eat them right out of the garden knowing that it was completely nutrient-dense, never been sprayed, never been tilled, very biologically diverse soil, extremely healthy. It was right then and there that we knew that we had to share this with other people, help people grow their own food in healthy and regenerative ways.
