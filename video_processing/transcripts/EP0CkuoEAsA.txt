 How much I made farming my first year is by far the most asked question I got. So I'll tell you in less than 60 seconds. My total cost for owning 50 acres of land came to $25,500. Now that includes interest and principal payment on the loan, as well as property taxes. Now my input costs came to the grand total of $30,500. That's the cost of seed, fertilizer, equipment, and labor. This being my first year, it should only get more efficient from here on out. Combining land and input costs, we get a grand total of $56,000 in the whole, or $13,000 per tillable acre. Revenue from corn came to $40,400, or an average price of $4.49 per bushel after all drying costs. We yielded 212 bushels to the acre on 42.5 acres. Now according to these numbers, we lost about $16,000 this year. And you can watch the full video on my YouTube channel for way more context and way more detail.
