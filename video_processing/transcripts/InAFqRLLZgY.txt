 This year we decided to raise more pasture poultry meat chickens. You know take it to the next level and try to sell some. My goal is to sell 200 this year and today is the day that we need to process 150 of them. I mean are we crazy? Now typically we always just do 60 at a time and eight weeks ago we got our first 150 batch of chicks. Our first time doing this many at once. Man that's a lot of chicken. There were three weeks in this brooder before we put them on grass and they did great in this brooder. No signs of snakes or critters that were trying to get in here. Now it took a little bit to get used to moving this many chicken tractors. Usually I'm just doing two at a time. But moving this bigger one that has 60 and then moving three more. So Plus taking care of all our pigs in the gardens and everything else. Farm chores became twice as long to do with this many chickens. The most important thing I think when you're raising this many chickens or even if you're raising a little bit of chickens is the water. I would say that's more important than the feed because you can't have them run out of water. The waters need to work also. They can't get clogged and there needs to be enough of water for them so they don't run out throughout the day or midday because 30 chickens in one of these coops will go through definitely go through a five gallons of water a day. The bigger coop I'm having to come out here two three times a day to make sure it's filled with water. All right that's it guys these broiler chickens meat chickens are eight weeks old now and it's graduation day. Time for freezer camp. Yeah so this is day one of processing all these 150 chickens. Actually I think there's maybe 153. So the plan is we're going to do 50 a day for the next three days and then eventually it should all get done. So we just did 30. Now I need to pick up 20 more only because we don't have that many crates to fit 50. So we have about as many crates to fit about 30. So we're going to pick up 20 more crates. The crates make it very efficient. All right the whole familia is here. All hands on deck. All right yeah we're all happy today. We're all happy today. We just got started. Anna's here. Day three.

Dad Ch сегодня. all right we finished just in time we put 50 in there it started raining thunder and lightning so now we need to pick up more chickens to get ready for tomorrow because we still have a hundred that we need to put in the freezer and then also we need to move out these 30 chickens chicks out on the bigger coops they're just walking in all right they're coming out of here come on i don't know how many that is yeah they're just coming out man we're uh that was actually pretty easy now that we have a chicken coop a free chicken coop we gotta put these little chicks in there and then we need to take these bigger chicks out for processing or excuse me graduation tomorrow so we need to grab from one one coop that one or this one good job randy it takes a little bit to get in that groove and which station does everyone like or gravitate towards now i was thinking maybe we should take these chickens to a processor but then looking into it the nearest processor for us is three or four hours away and that doesn't seem too practical whenever we process chickens we're usually doing 25 to 30 at a time which is super doable for just you know two or three people but this time since we're doing 150 i would say the only really only difference uh as far as setup is we have this fancy scalder holds the temp better although it takes an hour and a half to heat up to where we need it before we're using this turkey fryer which this works great too the only problem is that you have to babysit this with the temp and you have to keep turning it on and off uh you can't get it too hot so this is actually pretty fancy and more convenient more coolers we're using two coolers each one of these coolers holds about 30 chickens and then having our cooler this helps so much too man i don't know what i would do without this thing so we put some chickens away already here there's about 75 so having a structure like this where you can house and keep them cool let them rest before you stick them in the freezer is helpful and today is day three of butchering these 150 chickens man i can't believe it uh so today we're only doing 45 and the last of the 150 chickens today we're gonna we still have to do cut-ups and we have to bag and put the rest in the freezer plus i think there's something to be said of processing an animal on the farm you know they don't leave this farm we have better control of how we want these chickens processed and we're the ones who raise these chickens who fed these chickens all right crate three of four is done we have one more crate to go all right there it is this is the last of it in here all put in the cooler uh some of that 150 chickens were for us or for um my mother-in-law father-in-law uh and also we're gonna be putting that in the farm shop and for sale on our website now we're piecing out some chicken we've got chicken breasts leg quarters and we're bagging them but make a whole bunch of bags you know what i'm saying like make a whole bunch of bags um okay all right so we're almost there guys almost home final step is we need to bag and weigh and price out all the chicken but doing this many chickens you really have to plan it out i we really didn't want to do more than 50 in a day so that's why we broke it up between a few days and then it actually took us four days to finally put all these chickens 150 in our freezers finished all right that's it guys we did it that wasn't so bad right that was a long four days i know well today wasn't bad at all today was not bad we didn't have to do any butchering we just peaced out and weighed and labeled so today wasn't bad but it's it's been a long four days yeah i mean do 150 chickens do it and then by day three or four you should be a pro i'm thankful that the weather was so good today best father's day best father's day ever that's good to hear all right couldn't do it without you randy thank you anna couldn't done without you and our daughter penelope she's she's definitely a pro she is the quickest one out of the bunch yeah this is definitely one for the record books we'll always remember this weekend of butchering our first batch of 150 chickens all right that's it guys this big old coop that i have is empty we're still going to be using this coop this year i i have turkeys coming and hopefully we can use that for this because it is bigger and turkeys are giant so we're just missing the rain these last few days on butcher days but also we've been getting a lot of rain here all this rain reminds me of when we first moved to north carolina where it would rain just a little bit every single day all right yeah this is the next batch we saved one actually we saved two of the birds from butcher because i felt like they were just a little too small there's another one there yeah we're gonna be doing it again in the next uh four weeks these guys are halfway home so now we have freezers full we got this freezer full we got this one's about half full and then we have this full chest freezer we got whole chicken we got cut ups now for sale on our website pasture raised organic fed chicken now available on our website buy on
