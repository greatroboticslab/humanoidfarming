Equipment that is Rental Tough

Howto & Style
 My name is Toby Kilhorn. I'm the rental department manager here at Longenecker's True Value. I've been here for 17 years. I've been in the rental business for about 30 years. Yeah, in the rental business you want your equipment to last. You want your equipment to be very tough. That is very important. And in this particular piece of equipment, there's a big difference between rental tough and commercial. And this is definitely rental tough. If it can handle a rental, it can handle anything. One of the things that we have to deal with in rental is a lot of maintenance on pieces of equipment. And I will say that the Auric has very little maintenance. It has shear pins instead of bolts and stuff. We've hardly done anything to fix this thing. This thing is just indestructible. It keeps going. Zero downtime that I've known of. And that keeps everybody happy. Us as well as the customer.
