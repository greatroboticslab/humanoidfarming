 Down on Main Street for 52 weeks a year. These are certified organic cherries. Hundreds of people head to downtown Culver City for the certified farmers market. Dozens of vendors from around California bring fresh produce, products and food to the certified market. These farmers grow what they sell. It's from seed to harvest. That's what this industry requires. Cynthia Ojeda, CEO of Sustainable Management, lead organizer of the farmers market, has walked Main Street each week since 2017. I'm here every week. I know you are. I love it. I know you are. Thank you. This is the greatest little city to begin with because there's so much vibrancy and energy. And then here you have this gorgeous street, Main Street, with this beautiful farmers market market. You get such a sense of community here because it is a tight community. So the farmers market is a fabulous spot to unite this community under one umbrella. Visitors can find delicious, culturally rich hot food, bakery, prepackaged and specialty items from more than a dozen food vendors. And live music. The Culver City farmers market participates and accepts payments from federal and state programs like CalFresh, MarketWatch, WIC and the Farmers Market Nutrition Program. Our farmers are very important. And I want everybody to remember that these farmers are putting so much effort and time into the cultivation of their produce for you. For you. So love your farmer and show them your love. Welcoming all to visit from 2 to 7 p.m. every Tuesday. And there's no better time than now.
