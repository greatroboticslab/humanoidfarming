 When I first started regenerative farming, I thought I had the perfect plan. But one huge mistake set me back for years. My goal was to eliminate chemical fertilizers, and I thought adding nitrogen naturally was the best answer. So for several years, I focused on short-term fixes. First with poultry manure, which worked temporarily, but only on a small scale. Then I turned to nitrogen-fixing cover crops like clovers, hoping that they would meet those gaps. While they helped a little, something was still missing. You see, I was focused on filling nutrient gaps, not on building real soil health. You see, years later, I realized our soil didn't need sky-high nitrogen levels. It needed diversity. A mix of diverse cover crops and livestock to graze them turned out to be the true key to transforming our soil health, as you'll see in the related video.
