 Hey guys, welcome back to Next Level Gardening. It's May, can you believe it? The great part about May is you can feel the sun on your face, the weather's warming up, there's optimism in the air for the garden that's on its way, or should be on its way. So if you watch our second channel, Little Homestead Big Dreams, you know that we had a death in the family earlier this year, and that has pushed everything back so far. This is the latest I've ever been. How about you guys? Do you have your plants in? Are you feeling like you're right on time, or are you feeling late like me? Well, I can tell you right now that it is absolutely not too late. In fact, some of you may just be warming up enough right now to get some things outside. In this video, I'm gonna talk with you about, no matter where you live, what you can start growing in May. If you've been gardening as long as I have, you'll realize that gardening is very forgiving. There's lots of second chances. It's never too late for something, at least. You don't have to have it all planned. You don't have to be ready to go January 1st. You can start messy. You can start late. But if you start, magic always happens. All right, quick garden nerd moment. Your USDA zone matters, but not the way you think. It mainly tells you your average winter lows, but it doesn't tell you what the weather is like in May. If you're in zones three through six, your weather is probably just now starting to warm up where seeds will start to pop. If you're in zone seven and up, welcome to the jungle. It's time to get the warm season crops going. Either way, there's a list of things you can still plant. Because there is such variance in what you can plant depending on where you are, we have created our free planting calculator and garden companion. You can get it at plantingcalculator.com. Again, totally free. But all you have to do is put in your zip code and it will tell you when it's time to plant and how to do it and full growing guides for everything you want to grow. I'll leave a clickable link down in the video description. If you're in a place that's still cool in May, great news, you still have some time to get some delicious cool season crops in. And here's what you can sow right now. Romaine, butterhead, even loose leaf lettuces. Sow them thickly and harvest baby greens if it gets too hot outside. Spinach is another great one. If you want bigger harvests before the heat kicks in, look for fast maturing varieties like Bloomsdale or baby leaf. If you like radishes, Cherry Belle, French Breakfast are two good ones. They go from seed to harvest in under one month. This is a great time to plant carrots and beets. If you get them started now before the weather heats up too much, they'll be able to grow and mature through the heat of summer. If you still have cool days, you still have a chance to get peas in the ground. Sugar snap, snow peas, shelling peas. They climb and love the still cool weather in early May. Trellis them with a simple bamboo teepee or some old sticks tied together. If it starts getting too hot before you planned, you can always harvest the pea shoots, the little ends that have the tendrils, maybe a flower, a couple of tender leaves. They're great in salads and stir fries. If it's warming up, but you want to try some of these anyway, plant them in partial shade and that will at least give you a better chance. Now, if you're past your last frost date or are very soon, it's time to start thinking about warm season crops. Tomatoes are the undisputed king among warm weather crops to grow. They're the most popular crop to grow in the entire gardening world. If you live in a really hot climate, like Texas, Florida, Arizona, we are pushing the limits of lateness right now. However, if you get them under shade cloth, it's going to bring the temperature down quite a bit and at least help them get through the summer and maybe still produce. Peppers love steady warmth and they do not like to be put outside too soon. So make sure your nights are 50 degrees Fahrenheit or above or you're going to stunt your pepper's growth and they may never recover. Winter squash and summer squash are great to put in right now and you can direct seed them into the garden. They'll be up in possibly less than a week and they grow really fast. You can sow bush beans for a quick compact harvest or pole beans for a bigger vertical harvest. The bonus is they enrich the soil with nitrogen and share it with the plants around them. Pumpkins and melons love the heat of early and mid summer and they're going to take off really fast when started now. Give them a sunny spot and space to sprawl. Don't be shy about feeding them compost. They are heavy feeders and the more you give them, the more they'll produce. And don't forget to mulch around your crops. Keeps the roots cool, keeps the water in and keeps the weeds down. Now, if you're starting late and wonder if you have enough time for a harvest, go for quick maturing varieties like early girl tomatoes, bush champion cucumbers and little baby flower watermelons. With these, you get a short season, but a big harvest. Never underestimate the power of flowers in and around your garden, not just for beauty, but for pollinators, pest control and pure joy. Some of my favorite flowers for the vegetable garden are sunflowers, zinnias, marigolds and cosmos. Not only to attract pollinators, but to attract special beneficial insects that'll take care of the pest control in your garden without you even worrying about it. Want even more blooms? Deadhead your flowers. Just pinch off the spent blossoms. It tells the plant to keep producing. May is an amazing time to get herbs going. Even if you only have a small balcony, you can grow herbs for pennies of what you pay in the grocery store. All kinds of basil are great for warm weather. Holy basil, sweet basil, lemon basil, Italian basil. The world needs more pesto, guys. If you don't hate cilantro and you still have cool weather, you can grow that right now. If you're going to be heating up shortly, I would put it in partial shade. Plant dill near cucumbers if you're dreaming of making homemade pickles later this summer. Parsley is a great companion plant to tomatoes, either curly or flat leaf. My Mediterranean herb garden right now is overflowing. I've got oregano. I've got thyme. I've got lavender. I've got rosemary. They thrive on neglect. And if you don't have hard winter freezes, they're going to come back year after year. I want you to know, and I'm telling this to remind myself, May is a month of second chances. Don't get lost in thinking you're too late or you should have done it sooner or you're super behind. You didn't miss your window. The truth is there's almost always a seed you can plant, but especially in May. And gardening, it's not about perfection. It's about showing up messy, hopeful, excited, running late. Just trust that something beautiful will come out of it. All right, guys, what are you planting this month? Let me know down below.
