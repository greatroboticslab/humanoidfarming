 So that's the quick and dirty version. You cut it. No, that's what I want. Rake it and bale it, right? So that's it. And then from there, you know, the list goes on. We do quite so many squares. We have a system that we bundle it into a bundle of 14. I shared some of those with you in a photo to where we can handle some of these, Stephen, just my dad, myself, and a few others with equipment. I mean, this is a lot different from when I was young and you were going out and bailing it and throwing it on the wagon and bouncing around in the field and then taking the wagon to the barn and throwing it up in the barn and stacking it. I mean, we're trying to be as efficient as possible with the little amount of labor we can put into it. That's really cool.
