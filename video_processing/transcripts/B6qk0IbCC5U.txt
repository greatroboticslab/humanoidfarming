Howto & Style
 Have you ever thought about taking marginal land and turning it into an income of $10,000 an acre per year? Well, you can with pastured pigs. So this is marginal land. It's up here in the woods. It's not good pasture, but we've cleared a lot of the trees off, opened it up. The pigs have brought on the grass by their disturbance, and we move these pigs about every 5 to 12 days. They have their self-feeder. They can eat all they want to from the concentrate. They also have all the grass they want. And so we just move them right through the different paddocks. They get about a half an acre every 5 to 12 days. As they get bigger, we move them faster. When they're small like this, we don't move them quite as fast. So we keep the same amount of pig pressure and impaction on it as they grow. They just stay with the electric fence, and they have a real pig's life here.
