 Hi, I'm Jake Schefferstein here to talk to you today about some conservation practices with farming. I'm also joined today with Jeff Miller from Cornell Cooperative Extension. One of the first things we're going to talk to you today about is how to control some erosion on side hills. So if Jeff will hold up our first demonstration farm a little bit higher. So if you can imagine it's back in the spring back in May I've got my tractor here I'm going to go along and work the field up and down going to go through I'm going to plow it disk it get it all worked up all nice then I'm going to go back through and plan everything and you know the forecast happened to be it was going to get rain tonight so it's going to get everything planted before the rain so I get everything all sprouted and now I'm going to come over here and get my rain cloud so I'm back home waiting for it to rain everything's good and then the skies open up and as you can see most of my hard work all washed away. I believe those little things there that's called real erosion right yep Jeff. And then when the whole thing slid like that that sheet erosion right yep across the whole face yep yep so everything ended up down here on the floor and the big pots are called gully erosion oh yeah these big things here gully erosion so you can set that back down now so obviously we don't want this to happen and one of the reasons for that is the financial loss that just happened so right here we've got an empty bag of seed corn and so in here we've got comes 80 000 kernels to a bag and that'll plant what about two and a half acres about two and a half acres and just this one bag that plants two and a half acres uh averages between 200 to 250 dollars just for this one bag and right Jeff that's yeah I mean this exact one I think is 210. And then there's some more expensive BMR hybrids that are in the 350 range yeah so it all comes down to different varieties and types and brands and so that's just a seed corn you've also got your fertilizer all your fuel expense all your wear and tear on the equipment like I said going through several different operations and so this year what was our average cost for an acre between 500 and 600 okay so 500 600 per acre uh on my family's farm last year or this year I mean we planted I think around 300 acres so if we lost it all we're talking a pretty big chunk of change it's down to drain but with all that cost um that's not even the biggest expense Jeff you know what the biggest loss was that's soil leaving the fields yep all that topsoil washing away um topsoils you know it's not like you can just go down to walmart and buy a couple hundred acres of farmland so we need to do what we can to preserve what we have and to prevent that from happening so going way back even pre-world war ii uh different universities like cornell and working with the extension service started to come up with some different ideas and right here we have one example so this is going to be farm number two so what do we call that Jeff strip cropping yep strip cropping or uh what's the other contour stripping contour farming yep so on this one you can see first off we've got a couple different crops this would be representative of like a hay field so instead of just being one big corn field we've got hay corn hay corn and you'll also notice the fields are running side to side so that's why it's called contour farming it's following the contours of the land so this one instead of going up and down we're going to go sideways go through get it worked up plant it so let's see what happens when a rain cloud opens up so with a real big storm you'll see we are getting some erosion but when it gets down here to the hay field when it hits that sod it acts like a a break to help hold things in place so we are getting some erosion if it was a real big storm the cornfields might be lost but we're helping to hold the soil in place so just uh you know one of the examples of what we can do to help keep our soil in place another thing we can set that down i guess another thing we can do is reduce number of trips and the amount of tillage we do with the land like i said in this first example i went through plow disc everything on our farm we do what's called reduced tillage where we might just go through with like a chisel plow and one pass with a disc or maybe just one pass with a disc there's also no till where you just go into last year's stubble with the planter and uh with the planter plant it right on top without tilling it at all um anything you want to add jeff i know in this county also strip till where farmers go through with a piece of equipment and they actually just till up strips in the fields maybe 10 inches wide where they're actually going to plant that annual crop and now i know you've said before in our county with our land no till isn't really the answer for a lot of acreages because it's so wet and heavy we still want to do a little bit of tillage but there's opportunities in many fields many acres in the county to go with no till on some of those wetter fields yes you probably want to do some primary tillage on those fields okay now another thing in along with the conservation on the farm is nutrition management i said we have our hay fields here one of the things we can grow in our hay fields is this nice leafy stuff here this is alfalfa and the reason the farmer one of the reasons the farmer grows it is all these leaves on here is a lot of protein for the cows but another reason has to do with the root system i'll see those nice long tap roots on there now the benefit of that one it helps hold the soil in place like with these examples it digs down in anchors itself another reason is because it goes down so deep on years where it's not wet where it's dry it can access a lot more moisture and the other reason is because uh the alfalfa and also the soybeans i have here are in the legume family and you want me to handle it you want to take why legumes are important yeah so legumes uh have nodules in the root system where bacteria live and the bacteria actually produce nitrogen that is a needed nutrient for those plants and the nitrogen that's produced in excess during the year can be used by other plants that don't have the ability to produce their own nitrogen so the grass crops like corn and also just regular grass hay can't produce nitrogen like he's saying but needs lots of nitrogen to grow so as he's saying plant legume crops one it makes their own nitrogen so that helps keep any nitrogen in the soil and reserve and it can also add to the nitrogen in the soil for the other crops one other thing to talk about is that alfalfa and that grass they're perennials so they're in the fields all year around so these these other crops that we grow like soybeans and corn are annuals vegetables so there's bare ground for five months out of the year until that plant actually develops enough canopy to protect the soil and they're not only in all year round but they're also year after year so you you plant it once and it'll be hay for you know four or five maybe even longer to help hold that soil in place and that pretty much wraps it up for us so i'd like to thank you for joining us for virtual conservation education days and have a wonderful day
