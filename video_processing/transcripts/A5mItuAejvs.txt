 Ever wondered why cactus farms exist? They produce fruit that pop out just like a popsicle. Each cactus is harvested one year after planting, and wherever you see a brown scar, fruit will never grow back there. The fruit is called a prickly pear and tastes like a mix of watermelon and bubblegum. Surprisingly, they are very heavy, as one plant can hold up to 200 gallons of water. But what about the cactus leaves? They're not even called leaves because of how menacing they look. They're actually called pads, or no-pails, and they can be used in some of your favorite dishes, even tacos. Would you give this a try?
