Howto & Style
 I wish I knew this before I built my DIY greenhouse. I figured out a way to hack nature so I can grow food all winter long. But if I could start over, here's what I wish I knew. Location is everything. Pick a spot with full sun and as little sloping as possible. Materials matter. Don't waste time with low quality greenhouse plastic. Go straight for the good stuff. Pick plants strategically. You can't grow tomatoes in the winter without a heat source, so this off-grid setup is best for cold loving plants.
