 Let's create a new no-dig raised bed. I'm using two untreated scaffold boards to create the frame of the bed and I just screw them together using wood screws. I then roll out some recycled packaging cardboard as a base mulching layer to help suppress the existing vegetation but you could just use cardboard boxes. Just remember to remove all tapes, staples and don't use any coated in plastic or covered in inks. Then lay the frame back down on top and it's time to add some organic compost. I add around six inches but if your bed is quite deep you could add some organic matter such as leaves or branches or even some good garden soil before a good layer of compost. I then just rake it out evenly and tamp it down to compact slightly and create a nice planting surface. You could add a layer of wood chip around the perimeter to stop grass and weeds encroaching on the bed or just remove the excess cardboard. And then just get planting, why would you ever dig?
