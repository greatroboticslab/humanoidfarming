 Fishing is one of the weirdest but also most underrated features in Minecraft. To understand it, I'll split it into two halves, fishing speed and fishing power. You see, a normal rod takes between 5 and 30 seconds to catch a fish. Lure 3 subtracts 15 seconds from both the max and minimum wait time. However, everything else relies on third-party variables. If the bobber is not directly exposed to the sun or moonlight, the wait time is approximately double. And if the bobber's block is being rained on, the wait time is reduced by about 20%, which overall can make the cast time an average of around 20 seconds. As for fishing power, you can fish up three different types of items, either fish, junk or treasure. Luck of the sea increases the chance of catching treasure at the expense of fish and junk. To catch treasure, the bobber must be in a 5x4x5 body of water, and then it has a 16% chance to catch any of these items. And possibly the biggest myth of all, the moon phases actually have no effect on fishing whatsoever. It's only if the bobber is exposed to the moon or sun that matters. So, it does seem to be a difficult day. Let's go to this one. Let's go to the pusts! We aim to go to theod要 Velocity crypto dance and정이 the rain is reading. It's only if he gets weird.

How much did they condition me from the fish? Can't tell him to have a job? Wow, sorry that he wears in staring at the buster. Gosh, that's the reason why, if there wasn't a lack of one thing, let's pick up a chance.
