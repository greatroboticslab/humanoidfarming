 Hey everyone, it's Jack here from Mindful Homestead. If you're thinking about picking up a small tractor like the Kubota behind me, you're going to want to stay tuned to this video. Whenever I talk to somebody that's new to homesteading, one of the first things that pops into their head is that they need a tractor. It kind of fits that stereotypical image of what you think a farmer is. You think a farmer's driving around hay fields on their tractor, they're mowing hay, they're using the bucket to clean out cow or horse stalls, they're doing all sorts of things and they're on their tractor. And in reality, you don't necessarily need a tractor. There's so many things that you can do on a small farm or homestead without one. It's definitely a myth that if you want a homestead, you need a tractor. On the flip side though, there are lots of ways where a tractor makes work on a homestead a whole lot easier. At the end of the day, only you can really decide if a tractor is going to be a good fit for you on your small farm or homestead. But in this video, I just wanted to shed a little bit of light on the thought process that Jackie and I went through when we were thinking about buying a tractor. If you can fit it into your financial plan for your homestead or small farm, they make a lot of sense. So we're going to talk about some of those pros and cons about a tractor and let's get right into it. So what's the first reason we got this tractor? Simply put, this thing is a force multiplier. It allows you to do more work than you could do on your own with your own muscles or it allows you to do more work over the course of the day, work longer for an extended period of time. With this tractor, when we filled our raised beds, Jackie and I were able to move about nine yards of compost and loam mixture. If we had been using shovels to shovel that compost and loam into a wheelbarrow and then bring it all the way around the backyard, it probably would have taken us the better part of a day and we would have been pretty beat up about halfway through the course of the day. Same thing with mulch. We have mulch that we're putting in the beds down there or up on the decorative beds near the house or even the wood chips that we moved for the garden that we put in between the aisles of the raised beds. This really allows you to do more work than your body could physically do if you were doing it by yourself. This kind of ties into the last point but not only does this tractor allow us to do more work in any given setting but it also allows us to speed up the time with which we do that work. The wood chips in particular that we moved from halfway down the driveway all the way up to behind the house as well for the garden. Those wood chips are a good 400 feet down the driveway and then we would have had to come up the driveway all the way around the garage and then into the backyard where the garden is. So the fact that we had the tractor and we were able to do them in bucket loads about a yard per load, it allowed us to work quicker. We were able to get that done in less than a full day which is huge especially if you're a two-person operation on the homestead. Three people now with Emma. Which kind of leads me to my next point which is going to be ease of use. These subcompact tractors are typically equipped with a hydrostatic transmission which means that there's very little learning curve. I have video of Jackie hopping on this thing literally a day after we got it and driving it around and moving mulch into some of the beds around the property. You can hop on this thing and as soon as you start it up you could push the pedal to go forward, push the reverse pedal to go backwards, learn the bucket and it's all really straightforward. There's not a whole lot of training that needs to be done with something like this. You do have to take all the typical precautions that you would with any other tractor from small to large. You don't want to carry your load too high in the bucket, you don't want to side slope the thing too much, you don't want to run it out of diesel. That's a big one because diesel systems are a real pain when you run them out. But other than that, these things are designed to be super user friendly. So the small size and easy use of this tractor were definitely one of the big reasons which led us to want to bring it on to the homestead. Another important thing that drew us to this machine was the fact that it's so versatile. It does have a full category one hitch on the back. Obviously that hitch is going to be limited by the size of the tractor and what it can pick up. But it's got that category one hitch on the back with a PTO output there. It also has a mid mount PTO output along with a mower deck that comes from Kubota on it. And it's got the bucket on the front end which has a skid steer quick attach coupler on the front of it. The nice thing about having that skid steer quick attach on the front is that if we want to get an implement like a snow pusher or a light materials bucket or anything like that, as long as it fits on the front mount of a skid steer, it'll be able to go on the front of this. There you want to make sure that it's not too heavy for the front end of this tractor. Obviously we're not going to be as powerful as a skid steer in terms of lifting capacities and things like that. So you do want to pay attention. But the ability to move things like light materials buckets, snow boxes and things like that is pretty nice. In addition to the loader and the bucket that it comes with, we also have the K-Connect quick hitch system. And what that does is it allows us to run our snow blower on the front of it by running a PTO shaft up to the mid mount. I'll throw a link to the snow blower review up here in the corner of this video if you want to go watch that. That K-Connect system also allows the use of things like brooms and snow boxes and other implements as well that are quickly attached. There's also a variety of rear implements that are designed for smaller tractors such as this. You can get everything from a landscape rake for the back to a tiller to a post hole logger. There's a whole host of accessories out there for these smaller tractors that really allow them to be transformed into whatever you need them to be for your farm. The last thing to talk about this is how affordable these tractors actually are. Notice I didn't say cheap. So Kubota and all the other manufacturers know that these tractors are not going into the hands of people with a lot of money. Because of that they put a bunch of programs in place that make it a lot easier for homeowners and small farmers to pick up these tractors. The financing options that you see on a tractor like this are going to be a lot different than the financing options you would see on your standard used car or boat or something like that. And when I say a lot different, I mean a lot different. It's important to remember that these types of tractors are not cheap. The tractors themselves are kind of expensive and when you start adding implements on it adds up real quick. But the financing options that you're going to find from Kubota and a lot of the other manufacturers make it really easy to bring one of these things into your small farm or homestead. Kubota itself was actually offering zero percent financing when we picked this tractor out. Now it is important to note that I'm not advocating that you go out and take on a whole bunch of debt for a tractor that you don't necessarily need. For all the other reasons we talked about in this video, this tractor made sense for us. But if you have a much smaller homestead where you don't have a use for a tractor, I wouldn't recommend just going out and buying one. There's a lot of other things to think about if you're looking at getting a tractor. Where you're going to store it is a big one, how it's actually going to be utilized on your farm and your setup, and who's going to be using it are all important things. The other thing that's important to remember is that this is a small tractor. I'm not going to be one of those guys that comes on here and tells you, oh my Kubota BX can do everything a bigger tractor can do. Definitely can't. There's a few situations that we've had with this thing where I was either carrying too much in the bucket or I was trying to do too much work with it. And the tractor didn't necessarily fail me, but it wasn't performing how I would have liked it to. When you're looking at a tractor, definitely keep its limitations in mind. It's super important that you get the right tractor for the job that you're looking to do. Another important thing to remember is that brand is not necessarily as important as some people would have you believe when it comes to small tractors like this. But if you're looking at tractors and the John Deere dealer nearby is kind of known for having a shoddy reputation or the Coyote dealer is pretty shoddy, or whatever the deal is, you want to buy essentially a dealer and not just a tractor. All of these tractors in this space are going to be pretty good. It's the dealer that you're going to have a long-term relationship with. So if the dealer nearest to you that provides the best service level is going to be a New Holland dealer, don't hesitate to pick up a New Holland or some other brand of tractor out there. But if it's a Kubota, it's going to be a pretty good tractor. As always, thanks for watching. Sorry this video is a day late. We're going to try to stick to the Monday and Thursday upload schedule. If we can't do that for some reason, we'll put a post up letting people know that the video is going to be a day late or that we won't be uploading a video that week for whatever reason. But otherwise, plan on seeing new videos every Monday and Thursday for the rest of the spring and summer. Thanks. Have a great day.
