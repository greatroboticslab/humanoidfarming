 It's not magic. It's actually a secret technique to produce high-quality pineapples. In Thailand, farmers apply calcium carbide or ethylene to the plant's core, triggering uniform flowering so all plants bloom at the same time. Some also damage the crown, trimming or twisting it, to prevent it from growing too large, allowing more nutrients to flow into the fruit, making it bigger and sweeter. In colder areas, they wrap the fruit in straw to protect it from temperature changes and ensure proper ripening. These techniques improve fruit quality, maximize yield, and create a steady pineapple supply.
