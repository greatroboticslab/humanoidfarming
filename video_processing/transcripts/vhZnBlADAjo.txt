 Sorghum sedan grass is a cheap, highly productive cover crop that offers excellent livestock nutrition and it rapidly builds soil health. Prussic acid poisoning and nitrate poisoning are two of the main problems associated with grazing sorghum sedan grass. Prussic acid poisoning mostly occurs in new growth, regrowth, after frost, and during drought. Sorghum sedan grass looks dark and green when it has plenty of nutrients, but it can look anemic when it lacks nutrients like this kind of yellowish color here. We grazed cows on this anemic looking sorghum sedan grass crop without any problems. However, drought stressed sorghum sedan grass like this looks palish green, the leaves will curl, and when it looks like this it should never be fed to livestock. Sorghum sedan grass has a lot of benefits for livestock and if you're able to manage it properly your livestock will benefit from it. Even if you can't graze it however, it's still a wonderful soil builder.
