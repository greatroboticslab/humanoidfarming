Howto & Style
 Let's talk about the new Lomi Bloom. If this is the first time we're meeting, hello! My name is Aaron, aka GardenZad, and I'm an urban gardener who does traditional composting, the compost tumbler, as well as a lot of vermicomposting. And I've also been using Lomi for about a year. I firmly believe that we all need to eliminate food waste going into the landfill, and thankfully there's a solution for everyone. I've always been a strong proponent of Lomi, particularly for people who don't want to deal with worms, don't want to deal with balancing nitrogen and carbon sources in a traditional compost setup, or don't have the space or time to manage traditional composting or vermicompost. It's compact and incredibly convenient to use, which means anyone can use it. The new Lomi Bloom takes most food waste, including some things you can't traditionally compost, and turns them into Lomi Earth, which you can mix into soil to help grow more fresh, healthy food at home, or just keep your lawn or plants looking great. And Lomi Bloom lets you connect Lomi to your phone and earn rewards every time you run a cycle, refer a friend, and more. App also helps you track your environmental impact so you know you're helping the environment every time you put your food waste into Lomi instead of the trash. Lomi is a wonderful, worry-free option and makes a stunning addition to your kitchen counter.
