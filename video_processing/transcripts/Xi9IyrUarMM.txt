 Here is one massive problem that exists when it comes to the end of the year for these farm operations and that is they're waiting for their accountant to tell them how they did for the year. Guys, this has red flags all over it. Now, with our customers coming to Legacy Farmer, we're helping them get so structured and organized financially that our customers know how they're going to do for the year three months before the year is even over. They don't need to wait to let their accountant go tell them how their business did. Now, the accountant is there for one reason, to minimize your tax liability, right? So your accountant needs to tell you what your overall taxable income is so that you as a business owner know what you need to prepay or buy in order to get that tax liability as low as possible. But your accountant is not there to tell you whether or not your business was successful or not. It is your responsibility as the business owner to know the numbers at a detailed enough level to know whether or not you were successful for the year or not. And that is the exact thing that we train and teach our customers inside of Legacy Farmer on. We do not want our customers relying on their banker, relying on their accountant, relying on anybody else to tell them how their business is doing financially. It is your responsibility as a business owner to know that number.
