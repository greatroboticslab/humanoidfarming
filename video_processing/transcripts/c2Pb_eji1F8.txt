Education
 so so in my last couple videos i went over uh sort of the business side of this farm and vegetable farms in general um and it's gotten me thinking that um i want to do a video explaining why farm at all like why did i get into this um and why you should if you're interested in this um because i think there's a lot of benefits more than just the money and i think it's a lifestyle that a lot of people could fall in love with um definitely not for everybody but there's a lot of people out there i've met that surprised me how interested they are in this and i want to explain some of the benefits that i've reaped so far from having this farm skills that i've learned and why i love farming so much and to start off i want to explain that you know i had the video last week where i'm explaining you know uh what it takes to get to a level where you're making four thousand dollars a week um and that's really just the summer we do produce vegetables in the winter and it's probably one to two thousand dollars a week so um you know the spring it slowly climbs up and then prime summer you're hitting four thousand a week it will probably go even a little bit higher we might hit five thousand a week and then it'll start to go down starting in september and then eventually down to two thousand a week again so i wanted to throw that out there and it also i have a huge benefit um compared to most people to get to this level because i've lived with my parents to start this farm so i have had no real expenses personally um so i'm very privileged to be in the position to have a farm like this and be in a position where i didn't have to live off the income i made from it for the past three years um i think i it could have been done with me not living with my parents but probably a much more difficult than our climate and our market um just making the amount of money you need to live and i'm just now at the position where i'm going to start paying myself uh about the same as what i pay my employees and then eventually it's going to be more and more than that but i do want to explain that to people um i'm in a very privileged position to be here and i understand that um not all people very few people are going to be able to live with their parents and build a farm like this um but it's not like it was easy for me at all it still was a lot of blood sweat and tears going into building this place and i didn't really spend any money on myself the last you know basically seven years to be honest um and eventually i'll come out with a video explaining a little bit more about my background and stuff but today i want to go into why i love farming and why i think if you're watching this video you might love it too so let's get into it so the way i got interested in farming in general vegetable farming is when i graduated college and my senior year of college i saw what all my friends were the path my friends were going down and um what kind of jobs people were getting and i just kind of knew that that couldn't work for me um and what i mean by that is a lot of my friends were just doing going down the desk job route the rat race route and um i just felt it in my soul that i couldn't do that i just am not capable of sitting at a desk or doing um what i call matrix work you know just you're working at a department store or you're in some kind of sales job and eventually you can make a lot of money doing that but um just to me that is a path to misery i know that in my soul that i can't do that and again i want to reiterate that i'm very privileged to be in the position to not have to do that um i had you know my story is kind of long but um i'm not going to go into it in detail here but i spent a couple years working in chicago doing uh volunteer work for certain volunteer organizations um around food um one year i worked at a soup kitchen for a year and it was a blast um and then the next year i worked at a food pantry which actually weirdly taught me a lot about what i'm doing now um and and it was actually a lot of entrepreneurial kind of stuff but uh those two years um i didn't make any money really it was like uh they get they pay you a stipend and living expenses and stuff but i didn't make any money so um that's what i did my first two years out of college and it was a very positive experience for me although i just had no money um where most of my friends were starting to make you know 50 to 75 000 a year living on their own all that kind of stuff so i knew that chicago wasn't going to work for me long term so i ended up moving out here to wyoming where my family's had property for many years and uh ended up working at a vegetable farm and still very good friends with that vegetable farm to this day and they're literally like two miles over there but when i was in chicago i saw some vegetable farms that were in the south side which is a really rough part of town lots of drug activity gang activity murders um if you know anything about chicago you know what i'm talking about there's a lot of that going on there and um what i saw from those farms is that the kids that would have been dealing drugs were working they were farming doing similar kind of stuff to me and they were doing it on parking lots just building compost putting it two three feet deep and growing um stuff like spinach the same kind of stuff i grow here and selling at the restaurants that's really what got my wheels turning with this whole vegetable farm thing and when i heard about the farm out here that's when i decided to move out here and work there and sort of got my ball rolling on the vegetable farm front but to go back to what i'm talking about the that was an example of giving people a purpose that otherwise they'd be dealing drugs because in the south side in the west side of chicago there's no jobs there's no nothing there's no grocery stores or anything so it was a business that formed that was giving people something to do that was really positive for the community and i back to my college experience you know i just saw what all my friends were doing and i just know that i can't do something that doesn't matter and to me a lot of what they were doing was just pointless um it doesn't really do anything positive for the world and again i'm coming from a real privileged point of view right you know a lot of people have to do that kind of stuff to survive i have been fortunate enough to not have to survive i've had other ways of you know surviving the last couple years so i don't have to do the rat race um i'm very lucky in that way but i wanted to do something that actually was making a difference and making the world a better place and that's how i got interested in vegetable farming and then um the the benefit to doing this now that i'm actually in it and selling to people on a regular basis i'm making people's lives better by selling or i shouldn't say that we are because i have employees now and this is much bigger than me it's not about my ego at all this whole youtube channel is not about my ego i genuinely want to get more people interested in this but this food everything around me is filled with nutrition light sunlight energy it is i feel differently when i eat this more often there is a huge amount of health benefits to people eating this food and it is honestly basically about the same price as the grocery store right now there's very little price difference right now and it is uh food that can withstand uh food shortages if there is food trucks and stuff not coming here there's this is a source of food it's not much not gonna lie you know if we have truck stop coming we're gonna sell out real fast it's not like this is going to feed the community this farm alone is not going to feed my community my tiny community if that happens so i'm not really advocating for that but i'm just saying that technically this is a food source um this is basically a local produce department and um so there's a huge amount of value that this farm is bringing to people that selling stuff made in china at a department store is in my opinion not and the other big benefit to this is i'm employing people now i'm employing people and teaching them life skills that they can put on their resume and not only put on their resume but they'll be able to grow their own stuff in some ways they're going to learn skills here on working land on building soil on building fertility that they don't teach in school you know if i had worked on a farm like this when i was 18 my life would have been a very different experience um and so i'm really excited to be able to provide that experience to people now um and if you're interested in doing something that actually matters starting a farm like this provides all of those benefits to the bigger picture the outside community than just a typical rat race job so there's a lot of value that a business like this provides to people if that's something that's important to you and you want to do something with purpose that matters this is a really good option and it's i'm seeing the benefits more and more the deeper i get into this business because i'm still a long ways away from where i want to be with this business um but it's much bigger than just making money to me this whole business is much bigger than that and if doing something that matters and has purpose is valuable to you this is a viable career path for you so another reason why i love farming and love my job is this i get to work outside and for me i'm an outdoorsy person i i spend most of my free time on the weekends hiking and spending time in the mountains here in cody or around cody and so i love working outside even when it's not nice out and today is actually 98 degrees i don't even notice it that much because i'm so used to it but i also grew up in chicago and to me this height is nothing compared to chicago it's not humid it's dry it's beautiful um and it's actually kind of overcast today so it's really weird doesn't feel that hot but i love working outside and um i love the exercise that i get working here you know i'm not going to be you know a lot of my friends are kind of having health problems already and they're only 33 i'm 33 and i'm in really good shape i'm walking like 10 000 steps a day um and i'm not exhausted now that i have help it's not like too much exercise because when you're doing this by yourself it's too much exercise but you know this is a really nice happy medium now and i am just in love with what i do um it's and i'm i'm surrounded by you know beautiful plants all the time so if you're a type of the person that likes being in nature and outside this is a spectacular office you know um i don't think many cubicles are going to look as nice as this so if you like to work outside it's just you know there's no better thing to do and i'm pretty spoiled also being in wyoming the weather is spectacular here during the growing season i think compared to most places the south is definitely going to be rougher working outside um but our winters and our springs are way colder than most other places so i'm not feeling too bad um i still work in the winter and do go outside so um i still have to walk out in the greenhouses even when it's negative 30 so i still have to do stuff when it's really cold and i don't know for me once it's below zero i don't really notice the difference between negative five and negative 30 so it's like no big deal again that's not for everybody but for me i love working outside um i can't do the desk job stuff working inside under artificial lights all day i go crazy i've done a little bit of that in my life and it's just not for me so if you're not that type of person either this is a great career path for you so another reason to start a farm is you learn real life skills that you do not learn in school these days i have learned more starting this farm that actually is going to benefit me the rest of my life than my entire college education bar none no no questions asked um the skills that i learned in college i've pretty much already forgotten i didn't even learn anything in college for real like the i didn't learn anything about business and i went to business school i didn't learn anything about real life skills okay so since i've started the farm i have learned basic plumbing basic electrical basic building all these greenhouses i had to build myself right now um all of the plumbing the irrigation that's buried six feet deep around the farm i did all that myself i learned how to fuse pipe which is absolutely brutal if you don't know what you're doing uh and electrical i've wired all the fans in all the greenhouses wired all of the stuff in the wash pack building um that's stuff that i'm definitely going to be using the rest of my life if i'm going to renovate a house someday or do basic plumbing in my house stuff like that huge benefit for the rest of my life this plant identification i could go in a place like chicago i just was in chicago two weeks ago and i recognized tons of plants that i see right around here that um actually surprised me i didn't think the weeds would be the same there but they are like this lamb's quarter i saw this in chicago um grass we got that i mean everybody knows what grass is um thistle amaranth all that kind of stuff i know what it is how it behaves how to take care of it so if i buy property somewhere else i can know how to manage those plants or let them go or you know pull them those kinds of things i know how to work land i can look at a certain plot of land and tell you how much food i could grow on it growing food is probably the most valuable skill that i've learned by doing this because i can start a garden like nobody's business because when you learn how to grow high intensity vegetables on very small acreage the same concepts applied to a couple hundred square feet in your backyard can pretty much triple your yields um and you know full disclosure i do have a gardening course in the description that i do teach pretty much this method of growing in your backyard with some tweaks but uh you know you can learn how to grow a lot of food with these techniques and so i have learned so many life skills in the last four years of building this farm that i have never learned in school i could have learned them when i was 16 i could have started learning all that stuff when i was way younger but you know that's just not the world that i grew up in and um luckily i had that great never sing farm course to teach a lot of that stuff but a lot of it i just learned by doing it um and going to ace hardware and asking a million questions ace hardware is probably the cheapest education out there um that's why they call it the helpful place but um man that is probably one of the biggest reasons to start a farm i mean i wouldn't say learning life skills is a reason to start one but it's just it's a huge benefit you know most of my friends i wouldn't hire them you know they're doing doing desk work and stuff you don't have much life skills you're calling a plumber you're calling an electrician you're not you don't know how to do much stuff you don't know how to do many handy things and um i want to see i want to live in a world where more people know how to do practical things one of the nice things about living in wyoming is a lot of kids around here do grow up learning those kinds of skills because this is still somewhat of a farm community it's changing um we actually have quite a bit of amish people that live nearby that are very knowledgeable and all that stuff but like the working with your hands and learning all those skills are something you're going to take with you the rest of your life you know i can confidently do basic plumbing electrical look at a piece of land tell you how to grow certain crops um i mean i'm at the point where people are asking me questions on how to how to manage their own land people want me to come out and consult for them just because they see what i'm doing here so if you do this you're going to gain all those skills and it's going to be tough to learn i'm not going to lie it's not like as simple as uh watching a video or reading a book um i learned most of this stuff by failing and screwing up but um you don't necessarily have to screw up you know you could definitely do it more intelligently but at the end of the day doing it is the best way to learn but those life skills are transferable to your children you're going to be able to teach your kids how to do that kind of stuff in which i wish i learned more of that when i was a kid um a lot of skills that are just lost in today's day and age i don't see a lot of my generation super knowledgeable with that stuff at least where i grew up i grew up in the chicago suburbs so it's not a farming community at all so that's part of what i where i'm coming from but uh i want to live in a world where a lot more people understand that kind of stuff just because it builds confidence to be able to do that kind of stuff you know so um huge reason to do this if you're totally foreign to farming at all that's a good reason to do it so i sort of covered this in my last two videos uh or touched on it at least but if you start a farm like this you can make real money you know four thousand a week that's the business's income that's not necessarily what you're paying yourself right off the bat at least but that's a real income eventually so there's a lot of costs involved in all this and what i'm talking about when i say four thousand a week i'm talking about sales and production really um but i'm at a point now where i have enough coming in i can start paying myself probably about you know a couple thousand a month and um it's taken me a long time to get there but eventually once you reinvest and i'm almost at the point where i'm all i'm going to be doing to reinvest from now on is building more greenhouses and there's actually a grant out there nrcs grant where you can apply for it and almost everybody gets accepted and basically there's a grant that pays for the materials at least for your greenhouse so the high tunnels and stuff you can get paid for you still have to build them and it's it's no small task believe me but um it's an amazing program because um that makes it easier to grow your farm but the income is significant it's not just gardening um one of the things i want to make videos like this the reasons i want to make videos like this is because this is not gardening this is farming um this is not gardening at all a lot of people who want to work here think this is gardening and they just don't last because it's not the same it's much more intense there's a lot of production happening here and a lot of movement you know these beds are always in production there's always something growing in them the whole growing season and so it's a food factory that's what this business is and that allows you to create a real income once you have the market for it and i kind of go into that a lot more in my previous video but once you reinvest you know what my goals are for this farm is i would like it to be a three hundred thousand dollar a year business now that doesn't mean i'm paying myself three hundred thousand dollars but i think i could probably pay a hundred thousand just knowing enough about where the costs are and everything or even more and i plan on having other kinds of income so i'm not sure if that's really what i'm going to do but um there's a real business and real income here if you start a farm um it's not easy it takes a couple years to get to that level you know the first couple years you pretty much have to reinvest everything and make sure you buy infrastructure that's going to make you have a work-life balance that's that's good for you and i'm also talking about working 40 hours a week eventually um i'm almost there right now actually um and it's it was definitely a couple years of 70 hours a week during the growing season especially if you're building these kinds of things but you know once you get past that really those really tough couple years there's a real income here um that could support a family and all that good stuff um especially if you want to throw in the other things you could do with like youtube making youtube videos that's a huge potential revenue source um and people really want this kind of stuff right now i think the world is really gravitating more and more towards this kind of food system but um the bottom line is there's real money here and um it's not just a hobby or a little side income you can make a real serious income you know six figures no problem eventually um and again it's not easy i go into all of the difficulties with that in my last video i'll try and put a link to that somewhere in here but there is a real income here um that's going to be worth your time eventually and you're going to be paying yourself a lot more than just you know 17 an hour once you get things dialed in so um huge reason to do this it's not like this is just uh a hobby or something like that there's a real business here with a real income and it's not just some pie in the sky idea so the last and probably most important reason to start a farm is once you build this you have a sellable asset and that's probably going to sound crazy to some people who actually are into farming but my vision is eventually that this is going to be a turnkey business just like a restaurant that can be sold now in order for that to happen i definitely need more people to be farming but this farm i can actually have people with no experience show up and still produce a thousand dollars worth of value because of the infrastructure that i have and that's only going to improve over time this doesn't require a whole lot of skill i need people to be tough and work outside and know how to work and show up on time that's pretty much what mcdonald's needs you know mcdonald's is a franchise and so when you build a farm like this in specifically the never sink farm style it is eventually going to be a turnkey business that you could sell and once you build this you've learned one more really valuable skill and that's how to build a business again i went to business school i didn't learn anything about building a business there luckily my dad has built two businesses so i learned a lot from him and i learned a lot from just knowing a ton of other business owners and taking this farm course and stuff but i know how to run a business and a real business not just an online business that makes money on the internet this is a real business just like a restaurant or uh mcdonald's you know and that's huge deal you know businesses sell for i i don't even know what this would be valued at if i had it at three hundred thousand dollars a year in sales and then the amount of infrastructure at that point i'm guessing it'd be worth like a half a million just off the top of my head rough guess but you know at that point you're not just a farmer you're an entrepreneur and you're always an entrepreneur even if you're farming in my opinion um i know that's going to trigger some people but all farmers are entrepreneurs they always have to find markets they have to sell their crops you know so you're still an entrepreneur even if you're think of yourself as just a farmer and you're going to be doing a business like this you can write your own ticket you can start all sorts of other businesses attached to this you just keep farming i'm going to farm for many years still but eventually i want to be doing other things i don't want to be attached to this business and um you know a lot of the psychology and how people talk about farming in the old school way is you know you take no days off and you're attached to the farm forever and some farms have to work like that no don't get me wrong i mean i don't know much about a lot of other kinds of dairy farms or beef farms and stuff like that i don't really know much about that i don't know even about other vegetable farming methods so i just know that this style the possibility to sell it as a turnkey business eventually is there and um so you put in you know say you put in a decade of of work and you make six figures for a couple years but you want to get out of it you could sell it and do something else you know the your possibilities get a lot bigger when you get to that level and uh so it's not a dead-end job it's not a hobby um there's a lot of potential in this and the world is really going towards this direction more and more every day and i think in 10 20 years the opportunity to sell a business like this will be a lot higher because the demand is just through the roof you know for example we just started going to a new market in a big city about an hour and a half north of here um and there is nobody grow there's nobody growing this volume of high quality vegetables up there there's a lot of vegetables there that are brought in from other places but there's very few local stuff and we are selling out like crazy and it's a big city they've never seen this kind of stuff before and it's just an hour and a half away and that's just a little indicator of where i'm at you know in the west i think there's a lot less of this kind of farming going on but in the east coast there's probably a lot more competitive but uh the whole world is getting more and more interested in this i mean guys i went to college with are asking me how to start a farm which just blows me away um but the interest in this kind of stuff is skyrocketing um and so that is a huge reason to start is that potential down the line and there's so many other opportunities that could come from this just because of what i just said the world is becoming more interested in this once you get to where i'm getting to i'm still not where i want to be you know i'm getting people asking me to come out and look at their property and consult on building greenhouses and building farms there's the possibilities are endless especially if you're young you know like i'm 33 years old i got a job offer from a farm in idaho to run a 500 acre potato farm and that's because there's nobody my age who knows how to farm anymore like um almost nobody right so the the job market for farming is only going to go up over time and it's going to be bumpy for the next you know couple years but you know i just explained the business model pretty much in the last couple videos and the potential in it so there's there is money in it right now and not in 10 years but in 10 years 20 years there's going to be a lot more money it's only going to go up um and so anyway i hope that inspired some people out there who are halfway interested in farming and i hope i kind of painted a realistic picture because i don't want to make it seem like it's easy and i want to explain you know where i'm coming from because i definitely have it easier than a lot of people um not to say that my path was easy but um i had a safety net in a lot of ways so um just want to be real with that but you know i hope this inspires some people that are interested to start at least looking into it starting something on the side um because you can do that you don't have to go full-time right away for sure i think that'd be the smartest way to do it if i had to do it again um and uh but i just think there's so much potential in this and if you're the kind of person that wants to exit the rat race and not work in the matrix i think this is a really good way to do it so hope you enjoyed that and we'll see you
