 This is a set of pallet forks. They attach to the front of the tractor. It is going to frickin' rain. Well, hey friends and neighbors, this is Chuck out at Sheraton Park Farms. Welcome back to the farm. So today we're gonna talk a little bit about tractor implements. We've been on our farm now, this is our third full year and we've got a subcompact 40 horsepower Coyote. We've showed that in a couple of videos. But today I wanna talk about implements and what we think the two most important, well let's make it two and a half. The two and a half most important implements we think you need to go along with your tractor if you're starting to farm. So hang out with us, let's look at them and talk about why we think they're important. Stick around. So y'all have seen our tractor in a couple of videos that we've done and I think we're still probably gonna go back and do a full review on this. But in the previous videos that we've shown the tractor we were using either the grapple or the flail mower. And while those are two implements that we do use a lot, we found that they're probably not the most used implements that we have that go with the tractor. Bought this tractor brand new, about a little over a year ago, we've got somewhere around 230 hours on it. So it does get used. We don't abuse it, but this tractor does get used just about every day for some task or chore. Since we bought the tractor, we've found a lot of uses for it that we never would have imagined that we would have. And so it's just a, it's a very important tool on our farm. We've also got the side-by-side. We're gonna do a video on the side-by-side and talk about tractor versus side-by-side, but that's another video for another time. So let's talk about the two things, or excuse me, the two and a half most important implements that we think that you need for your tractor. So when we first bought the tractor, it came with a bucket. And this tractor's got the skid steer quick attach system on it. So you can trade the front end implements out really easy without a whole lot of problem. But again, whenever we first bought it, it had a bucket on it. And I thought, man, that bucket is gonna be the cat's meow. Because before that, I just had a little, like a 23 horsepower Kubota. Didn't have a front end loader on it. Had a belly mower. I mean, it just wasn't, it really wasn't well suited for what we do here. And a friend of mine, a guy that I work with said, man, you need to get you a set of pallet forks for that tractor. Said that'll, you'll use those just continuously. You'll probably never even take them off. And smart guy, and I thought, eh, maybe, yeah, maybe so, maybe not. So I ended up kind of diving in and I bought this set of pallet forks to go with. And he was absolutely right. These pallet forks stay on the tractor just about continuously, unless we're moving some mulch or I need the grapple for something. But primarily these forks stay on all the time. The nice thing about the forks is they are adjustable. So you can slide them, slide them in and out to adjust the distance between, between the tips on the forks. So if you've got different sized pallets, works real good to change those around. We lift, you know, saw logs with this. If we're gonna be cutting, we're gonna be cutting firewood or we're doing some trimming, they work great for that. But the key thing that we found in using the pallet forks is get you some old pallets. If you've got access to some pallets, you know, a lot of times you can pick them up for free on Marketplace or Craigslist or someplace like that. Pallets mixed with these are great because you can take those pallets and you can mount different pieces of equipment or tools or something like that onto those pallets. For example, we mount our chicken scalder and our chicken plucker on a pallet. So when we're ready to move those things, we just scoop the pallet up, take it where we're going and works great. Throw a pallet on here. We can throw, you know, thousand pounds of feet on the front. We unload the track, or excuse me, we unload the truck when we go pick up feed. So these things have just got a ton of different uses. Pallet forks, probably if I were starting over and knew then what I know now, a set of pallet forks would be the first implement that I bought for my tractor. So the next implement that I would buy for my tractor would be one of these. And this is a carryall. This is a basically a carryall frame. We bought the frame at Tractor Supply. I think they're about 139 bucks. And then we built the carryall on that frame. So, need to rebuild this. We just kind of cobbled this together with some scrap material that we had around the farm. There are a number of guys out there that have done just a fantastic job on building nice carryalls with a lot of cool features. And I'm gonna post a link to one of those above right now. A guy, his channel is DIY My Way. He has got the coolest carryall that I've seen. And I'm determined to build one of those, hopefully this winter when things slow down. But the carryall, lot of cool uses for this. You know, if we're going out to the pasture and we need to be carrying some fencing supplies, you know, we may have a load of feet on the front, on a pallet, and we're carrying some fence posts, some wire, a fence pounder, post puller, you know, just whatever we need to carry. This is just kind of like a trunk on your car. You can get all the goodies that you need in here. You can carry whatever you need. Works great for that. Another thing that you can use your carryall for is ballast. If you're gonna be carrying a heavy load on the front, you're gonna have 1500 pounds of feed or something like that on the front. And you need some weight in the back because you don't want that tractor to be real front heavy. You need something in the back to kind of counterbalance that. Carryalls are great. You can load it up with cinder block. You can load it up with other feed. There's just all kinds of stuff you can put back here on a temporary basis to create some ballast. So carryall works great for a number of different things. Carrying stuff, like the name implies, and also using it for ballast to counterbalance the front weight. All right, so if you've stuck it out this far, you're probably saying, okay, farmer boy, what's a half implement? How are you getting two and a half implements as being what you need for your tractor? So this is the half or the third, however you want to look at it. I kind of consider it a half because it's super small and easy to use, but it packs a really big punch. This is a trailer mover. And we picked this up at a farm and garden store for, I think it was about a hundred bucks. I forget exactly what it cost. But this thing is fantastic. We use this to pull our egg mobile around. We use it to move our stock trailer around on the property. We use it to move our, just our regular utility trailer around on the property. It is super nice because we can throw this on the tractor and get the tractor into a lot tighter places than we can the pickup truck. Nice thing about these, they do have the restyle insert. You can pull these out, trade them out for different inserts. So on this one, we've got just a, it's just a straight hitch. We use this to move the egg mobile around, back up to it, and we just drop the pin in there. We hook up to the egg mobile and move it. Again, when you can take this out, I've got another one that's got a three-way ball on it. So it's got a two inch, two and five sixteenths, and I forget what the other size is, but it's got a three size ball on it. So super, super nice to be able to just throw this on and move stuff around. This one also has a two and five sixteenths ball on top. So if you're pulling a gooseneck or you've got a gooseneck that you need to move around your property, you can throw this on there and move it around. Again, this thing really packs a big punch because we don't have to move the truck around. The truck does have a tendency maybe to rud up some of the ground. We can get in a lot more tighter places with the tractor than we can with the pickup truck. And so it just makes a huge difference whenever we're trying to move stuff. So the half implement would be a simple trailer mover. And again, you can pick these up at a lot of farm and garden stores for around a hundred bucks or so. So those are the two and a half or three tractor implements that we think are probably most valuable on your farm if you're just getting started. There are a lot of other options, box blades, grapples, mowers, tillers, all kinds of different things that you can put on a tractor. And get a ton of work done. These things are, I mean, they're a rolling tool and we certainly would be lost without having a tractor on our farm. So again, those are the three, two and a half implements that we think you need to get started. Listen, we appreciate y'all watching. I'm gonna post a couple of videos over here, some other stuff we got going on. We've been picking beans, we got chickens, we got eggs, sheep, you name it, turkeys. We got a lot of stuff going on. So if you're not subscribed, that subscribe button is gonna pop up in the center screen. Be sure and click that follow along. We're getting close to a thousand subscribers. Thinking about maybe doing something special after we hit a thousand, we'll see how that works out. But appreciate y'all watching and we'll see you on the next video. Thanks.
