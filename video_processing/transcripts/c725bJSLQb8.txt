 I do have one. So with your relay cropping on your soil testing, what has your organic matter been doing? Has it really went up since you started? I mean, I know you use manure, so it's probably higher anyway. I should have done some baseline tests, but I can tell you that the fields that we chose to do this early on, that has had this done on the same field three or four times is a completely different feel when you're walking on the field. The porosity, the tilth up top is tremendous. The weed pressure goes down. Our corn yields go up the next year. And I attribute that, and people will argue with me on this, but, you know, when you throw a cover crop out there and seed it in October and November, and then you burn it off with glyphosate, your carbon and nitrogen ratio on that biomass, yes, you have roots down low, but up top, you've got cotton candy that just melts in your mouth.
