Howto & Style
 Hi there, welcome to the farm. Are you considering starting a homestead, but maybe you have some questions? This video might answer a few of those questions. Well, we are Donna Brenda Wordenberg, and about six years ago, we bought a 42-acre farm with no farming experience. No, we didn't, did we? We didn't really know what we were getting into, so don't let that stop you from starting your own homestead. You can learn very quickly. And we were kind of unusual, I mean, in several ways. First of all, we're not young. When we bought the farm, about two months after we bought it, I turned 60. So just to give you a bearing now, so I'm now 65. And I'm now 63. Yeah, you had to check with me, didn't you? When you get to that age, sometimes you don't remember how old you are. That's how it is. But we've actually had a lot of new subscribers lately, so we just kind of want to give you a little bit of a history of who we are and how we wound up on a 42-acre farm. And a little bit about why we're doing a YouTube channel, kind of what our purpose is here. So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... So... tipo... Like... So... Like... Well, your family knew a little bit about farming, but I didn't. And the only real practical experience you had was a small garden in a suburban neighborhood. That's what got us looking in the first place. Yeah. Because I only had a very small garden and I wanted to grow more food. And I also wanted chickens. Yeah. So we set out looking for maybe three to five acres somewhere in the area where we could buy an old house and have a small... I don't even think we were thinking of homestead or farmstead or anything like that. We just wanted to have chickens and a garden. So we didn't really plan this out, did we? No. It was kind of impulsive. Yeah. Luckily it's worked out okay. Yeah. We are known for that. Yeah. But how do we wind up on a 42 acre farm? Yeah. Well, that's another story. Our daughter on vacation said, Hey, mom and dad, here's this farm. That's not too far from your current house. Now, why don't you buy the farm and then we can all live there? And we thought that was crazy. We laughed. And then two months later we bought the farm. Yeah. We were able to購読 at location. Outside your family. Are the sliding house means they can all live. It has to be easy to find it. And don't worry with us. So when we have a nice kitchen door, one father would grow up for it. We've had a tiny other building where it's hiding. But now it's a great story. Because our daughter built a house. Um... We split it up into four 10-acre lots. We have three children. Yep. So she has a house built there. Our other son bought one of the other 10-acre lots, and our other son is considering doing that in the next year or two. So we may have a Wardenburg family compound. Yeah. But, yeah, we have three children, and we got married pretty young. Probably too young to get married. I was 19. But I was 21. I knew what I was doing. He was really mature. But we had three kids, raised them in a suburban house. Typical life. He was in the insurance industry, and I had a couple businesses and did some things. No dreams of farming or homestead or self-sufficiency. And the kids all moved on, went to college and moved out, and we got into hiking, backpacking, biking, cycling all over the place. And I loved that. That was great. But then, as I got into gardening more and wanted to do some other things, that's when things started to change. So here we are. We wind up with a 42-acre farm. And that's kind of when I learned about how much you like being home, and you like having activities centered around home. And that, I think, went into our consideration of investing in a larger piece of land. Were we going to enjoy being there, working there, spending our time there, rather than other activities? Mm-hmm. And it is a lot of activities. Yeah. Just here at the farm. So, I mean, since we bought it, we've learned so much. Remember, we had no farming experience. Mm-hmm. So we learned how to garden. You know, I mean, I garden in a small space, but we took it to a... How big is our garden? Yeah, it's like 200 by 400. It's all fenced in, but it includes an orchard in that space there, too. So that's a lot bigger garden than I was used to. Yeah. And we also jumped right into chickens. Had to build a chicken house and do all that. Then we learned how to... We did a high tunnel, like a greenhouse-type thing. I mean, we've just kind of jumped into things. Bees and cattle and chicken. You name it. We've done it all. Yeah. Now, we did... One thing we did early on, because we didn't know what we were doing, we made sure we had, like, a mentor for each area. We had someone that could help us with bees, someone that could help us with chickens, garden experts. Plus, you can learn a lot about gardening on YouTube. You know, so we made sure we had some help doing all this. So that kind of brings us into the phase of, what's your channel all about? We're really excited about starting our adventure on the farm. And my friends said, oh, I would love to have ground and do it. You guys ought to do a YouTube channel. So this is our beginning of the YouTube channel. But we need you. So we need those of you who know what you're doing on the farm to give us advice. And we're really just looking forward to support. So, you know, sign up. Subscribe. Subscribe and like and do whatever you're supposed to do on YouTube. And we're really very thankful that we have so many viewers. And recently we added quite a few viewers. Yeah. Good to have you here. Welcome to the farm. Yeah, welcome. So really the purpose of it, it's not a how-to channel, because frankly, there are people out there that have more experience in each of these areas than we do. But we really wanted to just share the, you know, our journey of where we were going and what we were learning. And it turns out that we've built quite a community with people who have expertise in all these areas. And we love it when you share your opinions and ideas of how things work. So really it's about the community and sharing together. Well, and watching our channel, you might learn some things, because I do a lot of experiments. And you might learn things from our failures and from our successes. But we just want to share what we're doing with other people who are like-minded. And you're either doing it themselves or want to do it. And we try to make an environment here to make you feel at home too. Like, hey, Don and Brenda are on, you know, let's- Get a cup of coffee. And sit down and relax and try to just get the farm vibe and welcome you and get the feeling of what our life is like every day on the farm. Well, and one thing I like doing is encouraging people. I mean, yeah, if I can learn to can at 60, learn how to do bees at 60, learn all these new things in my 60s, anybody can do it. I mean, you know, you can teach an old dog new tricks. But it's been wonderful for us keeping us young and keeping us engaged and doing new things. So I just always want to encourage people, no matter what your age, give it a try. And it goes the other way around. We appreciate your encouragement so much when we're doing things. And also with the encouragement, maybe a few ideas to try different things in your experience. Because frankly, we have a lot of viewers that lived on a farm years ago. And maybe they're not on a farm, but they miss it. And they enjoy the time and experience. And they can give us a lot of advice. Yeah. Even just the last video I did about propagation, propagating sedum for the first time. I didn't know if it was going to work. Well, I couldn't believe how many people responded and said sedum is one of the easiest things to do. That was wonderful. So I quickly went out and did a lot more cuttings and have even more sedum started. So that was wonderful to have all that affirmation and confirmation that it would work. So we didn't plan. But if we had to go back 15 or 20 years now and plan and do things, what are some of the things that we would recommend to others if they're planning to do a homestead in 5 or 10 or 15 years? Well, definitely, you know, have a plan. Kind of know why you want to do it. Do you want to grow all your own food? Do you want to have animals? Do you want to have an orchard? Kind of what are your favorite things or most important goals to you? And it would help if you don't know what you're doing in that area. Find somebody to come alongside you and help you with it. Or find someone, a farm or a friend that grows a lot and go help them. And you can learn a lot by just gardening with them and working the orchard or the animals. And you will, I think, get a sense of whether you really enjoy that. But I will tell you it's different, at least for us, when it's your own vegetables and your own animals. There's a different level of care and energy on it. But I think working with somebody else, even on their property, will give you a pretty good sense if you like it. I'd say the other thing, too, is, you know, if you're 40, 50, 60, and you want to do this in the future, it's really important that you try to stay healthy and strong, keep walking, keep working in ways to keep your body strong. Because, like, some days, how many steps? It's hard work. Like, you get 20,000 steps in a day a lot. Sometimes in the spring, between 20,000 and 24,000. Yeah. Yeah. Springtime is crazy. And I think when I looked at what the recommended number of steps for people our age, they're saying 6,000 to 8,000. And, like, well, yeah, maybe three times that. We're doing that. I think we're okay. But I'll tell you what. By the end of the day, me especially, I am tired. I mean, when I sit down there and I am spent, I'm done. Until I get the chickens tucked in for the night, I'm ready to put my jammies on and chill out for the rest of the night. Here you go. You're with your sisters, okay? That's where you're going to sleep tonight, okay? You'll be nice and safe tonight, okay? I'll be out in the morning to let you out, okay? Night-night, girls. Nighty-night, girls. They should be safe in there. They'll be completely safe in there. Nighty-night. Nighty-night. Nighty-night. So we went all in on this and did the solar in addition to all the farming and, you know, the canning and the food preservation, the self-sufficiency. I think we've done about as much as we could do. Oh, yeah. But we're not totally self-sufficient yet, are we? No, but we're closer than we've ever been. Yeah. And if we had to, we could be. Yes. But we would just be doing without some of the things. You couldn't enjoy bananas and things like that. I know. Yeah, I'd miss certain food that we can't grow around here. Yeah. But we do grow a high percent of our own food. We produce our own electricity. Now, we're still on grid because we actually produce more than we use. So we actually get paid back by the electric company for what we produce. Yeah. We have a well, so we don't have to pay a water bill. We have a septic tank. So, I mean, we're kind of, we don't have a lot of expenses and things we have to buy. And because we're on a farm, our land taxes are lower. So, like, we didn't really have a goal of what would be called, you know, homesteading. I don't know. What does homesteading actually mean? We actually looked it up on ChatGPT. What is homesteading? Yeah. It's a lifestyle of self-sufficiency that typically involves growing your own food, raising animals, preserving food, and sometimes producing your own energy, like solar power. Yeah. I guess we really are homesteaders. But you wouldn't have to move to a big property like this. We encourage it. Anybody can do it. You can have a small garden, even on your porch or in a backyard. You know, in fact, the bigger you get, you're going to buy more expensive tools and toys. You know, like we have tractors and other things. And when you put that in the mix, you have to raise a lot of vegetables to pay for tractors and things. So probably the most cost-effective way to have a homestead is to have like a 4 by 12 garden in the backyard and grow the vegetables that are the most expensive, like tomatoes and peppers. I mean, there are things that you really like and enjoy fresh. Yeah, salad greens and stuff like that. Yeah, I mean, we did jump into it with both feet, 42 acres. Yeah. You don't have to do that. You can start smaller and do whatever because you can grow a lot of food in small spaces. Yeah. I mean, there's a million YouTube videos out there about growing food in small spaces, whether it's in raised beds or growing vertically. There's a ton of ways to do it. You don't have to spread out into a 200 by 400 garden. And all you need really is a shovel and a rake and maybe a pitchfork or something. And you have a low investment and you're going to get a high return and a lot of joy from that. Now, one thing I would encourage you to do beyond that is to buy a couple chickens. When you have animals, and a lot of neighborhoods and places will allow you to have two or three chickens. You'd be surprised. But if you get two or three hens and you get to enjoy your own eggs, that's amazing. And it's really very simple. Yeah, chickens aren't that hard to keep. Yeah. They really are. And the eggs are so good. I mean, we have eggs almost every morning. Yeah. We love our eggs. Now, see, we're up now to about, I have 47 full-grown chickens and 16 little chicks that are soon going to be introduced to the big girls. So we have a lot of chickens. Yeah. But not only do we grow food for ourselves, we actually have a farm stand that we sell at. So we do sell food, but we grow enough for our family too. So that's another whole level. Yeah. And we also have 15 acres that we either grow corn, soybeans, or right now we're growing wheat on it. But we don't have the equipment or the tractors that are needed. The big stuff. The big, big, you know. So there's a farmer right down the street and we pay him per acre to do it. And then we take the market risk and sell the produce goes off to a co-op somewhere. So some people ask us, you have a homestead and a farm and you're selling your produce out front. You sell beef and you've got 15 acres of grain that you sell. So is it profitable having a farmstead or a homestead? Not necessarily. It's very hard in this day and age to make money on a 42-acre farm. The scale is not there. To make money in farming, farming, you have to have a lot of land. But you can make money selling produce and honey and all that stuff. But we're very fortunate that we are old and we're retired. We have some retirement funds. So we don't depend on it to survive. But not having all those bills is not a bad retirement program. Yeah. What I would say is that it offsets a lot of the expenses of the farm and, you know, the equipment and things that we have. So it helps support the lifestyle, which is really about our family and making food for our family, enjoying time together with our family. What do you think is that it's a good thing? Well, that's another thing. I would say know your limits. Because, I mean, I definitely, we did jump into a lot. And it's been more than I can handle a lot of the times, you know. So I have, my daughter's been helping a lot more. And I hired a teenager last year to come a couple days. And that was a tremendous help. This year she's already started. She's been working on Saturdays. And when school's out, she's going to start working two or three days a week and is going to have a friend help her too. So know how much you can do and ways to work within those limitations. But you really won't know that until you try and have your own garden. If you do a 4 by 12 garden and see how long it takes you to do the weeding and to water it and that. So that's really a great place to start. And seriously, there are a ton of good videos out there how to grow everything. I mean, you can learn the best ways to help your soil be good. Best ways to grow tomatoes. I mean, you can learn everything on YouTube. And it's really good information out there. Because that's where I learned a lot of the gardening stuff. And sometimes I think we forget how much we have learned. Yeah. And it just surprises me. People start asking me for chicken advice. It's like, I guess I do know about chickens now. Well, it looks like we should know what we're doing because we're living on a farm. You know, and I've got really thin hair and you have this beautiful silver hair. So it looks like these folks have probably worked on a farm their whole life. Old and wise. Yeah. Well, that's not the case. We're old. Yeah. So that's why one of the reasons why we're doing this video is really not to tout expertise. But it's really building community, sharing enthusiasm and energy over, you know, building your life with food that you grow for yourself. There is something so rewarding about walking down into our larder where we keep all our canned goods. And just seeing the food that we grew that we canned. And now our family is eating. All the grandkids know how to go down in the basement and find jam, find peaches, find applesauce. They can go down and shop in the basement and take food home. Speaking of grandchildren. Which, by the way, we now have nine grandchildren, ranging from four months to 16 years old, almost 17. The grandchildren and the whole family has been the biggest surprise, I think, of coming and buying the farm and doing the homestead. But I don't think we anticipated that they would be here as much as they are. No. But it's been amazing. It really has. I mean, it's fun having them here. We have all kinds of fun farm activities for them. And they're learning. They're learning where their food comes from. Learning about life and death on the farm with animals. Yeah. How to care for animals. All of that. And all their toys and electric buggies and motorbikes, all this stuff is here. So they love coming to the farm. And that gave me the chance to buy a little dirt bike. You know, we all have electric dirt bikes and things. So we have three generations of us driving around the farm on our electric buggies. Yeah, he had to buy one so he could ride with the grandkids. Yeah. You really set that up nice down there because it feels good for you coming downstairs. I love that room. Well, I've always loved old houses. Yeah. And our farmhouse is 180 years old. So it's old. But a lot of it has been, you know, brought up to modern things. But the basement, you can tell it's 180 years old. It looks 180 years old. So I love it down there. Well, and that's the other thing. We do show some remodeling and working in the house. But we don't, and we're not working on an authentic restoration of a 200-year-old farmhouse. You know, first off, it has electricity and plumbing and an HVAC system. So it's not authentic. No. So we're inspired by the old farmhouses. And we try to introduce and keep some of the elements and character of it. But it in no way is authentic. Authentic. As it would have been back in 1840. Yeah. Yeah. No. But we make it like we like it with a lot of old-fashioned touches. I do like old stuff. So it's easy to introduce those things to it. Are you talking about me? Yeah. I do like old stuff, luckily. But, I mean, we're having fun. We are tired a lot of days. Yeah. But it's fun. Well, I hope that comes across to you in our videos, that we enjoy the life that we have here and we enjoy being together and taking this adventure together. So hopefully we encouraged you a little bit and answered a few questions maybe. And I'm sure as we go on forward, if you have other questions that you want to ask below, put them in the comments and we'll try to answer it in future videos. But the biggest thing is, if you want to do it, start somewhere. Start small. Work up to it. You know, and maybe if you haven't been thinking about it, give it a try. See if it is something you enjoy. Because it wasn't our plan all along, but it turned out it was perfect for us. And we would love to hear your story. We read all the comments and they're very encouraging for us. So tell us what you're doing in the homesteading and how you're enjoying it and anything that you've learned. Well, thank you for joining us on the Wardenburg Family Farm. We'll see you in our next video. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
