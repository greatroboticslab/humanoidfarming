Education
 The following is a project supported through the Canadian AgriSafety Applied Science Program administered by AgriVita Canada. Machinery Vibration Farm machinery can expose operators to several hazards including vibration, bumps and jolts. This vibration is tough on a farmer's back and hips but it can also impact balance, reaction time and the brain's ability to process information. This can ultimately contribute to falls from machinery and even collisions. This project is investigating prevention strategies to reduce the impact of vibration with the ultimate goal of keeping farmers healthy and productive. We are conducting trials in our lab-based tractor vibration simulator and with input from agricultural stakeholders, we plan to bring this project into the field and evaluate the real-world benefits.
