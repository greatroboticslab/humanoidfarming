Howto & Style
 So we thought we would show you the difference between our liners and some of the other ones on the market. This is ours. This is a competitor's brand. This, you can see from the light coming through, how much thinner this liner is as compared to ours. Much thicker. Our liners, we specify a minimum of 10 millimeters thickness. And a lot of our customers are going to get at least two years out of this. Some even get more. So that's something to consider when you're purchasing these, how long they're going to last. In the world we have today, you don't want to be replacing things all the time.
