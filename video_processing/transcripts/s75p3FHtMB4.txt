 Hi guys so welcome to farming in Africa. Today we are raking and I want to show you the importance of raking. So two days ago we cut this grass and as you guys can see it looks pretty much dry but it is not. Once I take this grass and turn it upside down you see how fresh the bottom is and if you leave it longer what happens is that it starts to mow. Your hair is not gonna be quality and that is why it is very important for us to rake. This is what I meant by raking. So basically what the rake is doing is turning all the grass upside down so that it can dry properly. This is what we are doing today at the farm. Thank you guys so much for staying to you and I hope you're learning something from what we are doing and you're getting some inspiration. Let me know in the comments below if this inspires you but what we are doing here is basically preparing our animal feed in the rainy season so that in the dry season we have food to feed our goats and cows.
