Howto & Style
 Hello everyone! thank you so much for joining me today today we are going to be tackling this side of the kitchen last video we did the dining room side and so in this video we are going to be doing the tops of the cabinets some things on the countertops the island i have um on top of my pantry we have the garage nook to tackle just little places here and there that i just want to put out some everyday decor to kind of get me ready to transition into spring which is rapidly approaching um we live in ohio here and the weather is kind of starting to change i'm hoping it's going to stay that way we've been in like the high 40s and next week is going to be hitting the 60s so i'm i'm ready um if you've been following me you know i've kind of had a rough start to this year and i just feel like the warmer weather and me getting outside is just going to really kind of help boost my mood um and i just i just i'm just ready for it i'm just so ready for the change so if you do like today's video and you enjoy today's content please make sure to comment like and subscribe and with that being said let's get started doing some little bits um on top of the cabinet and then we'll start working our way down so so so so so so so so so so next i'm going to move down to the other end of the tops of the cabinet and just do a nice little display down here um before when i used to decorate up on there when we first moved in this house i used to decorate in between each one of these beams and i believe there's like five or six different spaces it just got way cluttered and i've only started to do just the two ends and that's just because our ceilings are so high i feel like i need something up there to kind of draw your eye up and with this i just found you know it's just more cozy and inviting when i don't have it so much clutter up there it's just more pleasing to the eye um when you come into my house because this is usually the first room that you see so i just like to have two nice little displays um up here just to kind of tie in with the rest of the kitchen but now i'm going to start working my way down i'm putting these two little wreaths that i got at target dollar spot and then we'll start moving on to the countertops so i don't know if you've seen these beautiful little towels that dollar tree carries now um so impressive and my mom is a dollar tree fanatic she is always getting me searching for the new latest thing from dollar tree and i'm i'm so happy that she found these because they tie in so well with that kind of neutral cottage theme that i go with i just think they're absolutely adorable and i love that i have so many of them that she found that i can switch out throughout the season and um the holidays like the red ones i think would be really pretty for going into fall um but the black and white with the woods tones and the greenery like that's kind of the theme that i've been going with and i think these towels are perfect and they match so well in this little space that i would all say there's not too much when i donít like that poll Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It just smells so good. So I highly recommend that scent if you are ever in need of a new candle. Just because again our ceilings are so high I like to have things kind of a little bit higher to move your eye up. So I just like to have a nice little display up here just so you know kind of make again that space full more warm and inviting. Now we're going to move on to the island and do a nice little vignette over here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I always like to mention to you guys, if you have any questions about where any of the items in today's video come from, just always shoot me a message. A lot of the stuff that I have is from the thrift stores. I'm a huge thrifter. I do want to start getting back into those videos. So if you're interested in more like thrift hauls or thrifting DIYs, I love doing Trash to Treasures. I kind of got away from it for a little bit because I felt like I was just doing so much and I always, I just had so much of everything. And I've been trying to kind of get rid of things that I don't use anymore. And I don't know, when I do a lot of my DIYs at one time, I just have an abundance of stuff and I feel like it clutters up my space. So I kind of backed off of that a little bit. But if you're interested in more DIYs, I would love to. And furniture flipping, I used to do all of that on this channel and I've just been doing a lot of the decorating lately. So if you're interested, just let me know what you guys want to see because I'm always up for any ideas that you have. So, but anyways, I'm going to move on to this area, which is like our garage nook area. This is the area that is seen the most. The door that everybody uses to come in the house, it's right off the garage. So I wanted to make sure this was nice and fun and festive as well, like neutral, just a nice little pretty display over here to kind of tie into when you walk into the kitchen. Anyways, guys, I hope you enjoyed this quick little cottage kitchen kind of refresh, reset, going into the next season, everyday decor, whatever you like to call it, shop your house because I have not bought anything in a very long time. But I hope you guys enjoyed it. And if you did, always make sure to comment, like, and subscribe. That helps me out so much. And I will see you guys in the next video. Bye for now.
