 So when it comes to growing hydroponics the biggest concern is using synthetic nutrients. There's a way to make your own using natural ingredients and here's how you can do it. I started by filling a five gallon bucket with water and then headed off to my worm composter to collect some worm castings. If you don't have access to worm castings you can use two shovels full of finished compost. Place in a mesh bag and let it soak. Afterwards I added dried seaweed which contains a lot of trace minerals. Then I add epsom salt which contains a lot of magnesium, sulfur and oxygen. Let it sit for a minimum of 24 hours. When ready I use about a gallon of this mix with four gallons of water. And lastly you want to make sure that the pH of your water is about five and a half to six and a half.
