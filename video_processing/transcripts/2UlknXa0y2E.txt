 Here are the 8 sentences that taught me more about farming than any agricultural degree ever could. 1. Never complain about the weather. Someone is farming has always seen it worse than it is right now. 2. Never shift livestock with anyone that you're planning on having a serious long-term relationship with. 3. Bail or twine can be used to fix just about anything. Never throw it away and treat it with the respect that it deserves. 4. The chance of livestock dying is directly proportional to the amount of money that you spend on it, so medicate sparingly. 5. You'll never find a 10mm socket when you need one. 6. The phrase don't shit on your own doorstep doesn't apply to cows, especially dairy cows. 7. Working in agriculture will give you a degree in professional swearing, a degree not matched by any other industry. And 8. Your dad is never wrong. Even if you're utterly convinced you're right, you're not. No exceptions.
