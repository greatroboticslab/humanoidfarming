 Governor Kay Ivey is expected to sign the farm bill soon, which is expected to create a bright future for the Hallmark Farms site in Jefferson County and state lawmakers recently approved a bill to establish the board of directors. ABC 3340's Aaron Wise explains what the next steps are for the project. More design work is happening at Hallmark Farm for the nearly $160 million in the other Alabama Farm Center. We had some folks here from Kansas City and Tulsa who are experts in designing farm centers, so they've been had the boots on the ground. Seven members for the board of directors also have to be selected. Jefferson County gets one appointment and they get the board in place. They can actively actively go out and solicit these funds and I know that we at Jefferson County were already working through some of the infrastructure projects. Commission President Jimmy Stevens anticipates the county investing 15 to $17 million. Last September, the Alabama Farmers Federation had identified potential funding sources for 70% of the project. A representative with the organization says the passage of the Farm Center legislation has cleared the way for additional planning, fundraising and organizational steps. Work is currently being done on refining the site plan, finalizing financial support and awaiting appointments. It'll be a destination to come in and have your shows, your horse shows, your livestock shows, your your events, your rodeos, state fairs. Jefferson County Commissioner Joe Knight says the possibilities are endless. We don't know what the scope of it will be, but I think it'll be prolific. I think it's going to mean more jobs. I think it's going to be more growth in North Jefferson County. Knight says the economic benefit won't be contained just a hallmark farm as sewer infrastructure will be extended up Highway 31, making it more open for development.
