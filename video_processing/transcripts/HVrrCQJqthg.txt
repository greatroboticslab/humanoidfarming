 Salve, citizens, and welcome back to a little bit more farm together too. Let's talk about the farmhands union, which I believe you unlock at like level 60. I don't know if it's going to reflect since we built it. No, it doesn't reflect. Anyways, you unlock it around level 60. What it allows you to do is to craft farmhands. You come here and you upgrade it, and every upgrade is going to allow you to create another farmhand. I don't think there's a maximum point you can get to, but you just need metals. And of course, you know, metals take a while to get. But let's go talk about how these farmhands work. Actually, we're pretty close right here, so. Ah, this way. So you can see we have a few farmhands set up here. What I did first was I really got tired of keeping up with trees. So we did shrink it down because there's a limitation to how large these can be. When you look at one, like this one, you can see we go as far as possible, 17. They don't go quite as wide as possible. We go 14 wide because we have it set to where one farmhand handles two plots. But this is still a good number of trees. Let's look and see how many trees it is. We can. Yeah, I believe we're down to 158 or 150. It used to be a little bit higher. So it's still a great number of trees. Each farmhand handles the batch of trees. But let's talk about what all farmhands can do. See here? We did this one to handle just our machinery. And then I put some crop stuff down just to show that. So you can have them do all tasks. You can have them loot flowers and water. Feed and harvest animals. Harvest fish. And then harvest and resupply buildings. Or just harvest buildings. Then you can choose up to four crops to plant. You can change it to be on the corner like our other ones. Or it can be in the center here. Depending on what you have there. There's benefit to either way. So crops you can water, harvest or do nothing. Trees you can harvest or do nothing. Flowers you can water and harvest or simply harvest. Animals can be harvest, feed or feed and harvest. Fish is just simple. Well, then buildings can be either or like we just said. So you need the crops down on the ground like so for them to interact with them. And then they will also water if you need to water. But obviously if you're doing a big crop plot, you should have them set up to water with the sprinklers. But that is farmhands. You have to pay them in metals as well. And it's going to take a while to get built up. But as you can see here, we've got our one, two, three, four farmhands handling all of our crop plots over here for trees. And we're slowly building this out. And we'll be able to eventually shrink this all down a little bit. And hopefully not have to deal with trees every season because that's my number one least favorite thing to do. That's a little bit about farmhands. Again, this is a later game thing. But once you have it set up, if you use it correctly, it really is a nice benefit to how you play the game. Y'all take care and enjoy farm together too.
