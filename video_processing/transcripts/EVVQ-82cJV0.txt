 Hi, I'm Jason with Solutions Pest and Lawn and this is Pest Support, where you ask the questions and we give the answers. Our question today is, how do you manage pesticide resistance? When conducting any pest control treatment, whether you're trying to control insects, weeds, lawn disease, or unwanted in-laws, we often emphasize the importance of using multiple products and for good reason. By properly using products with different modes of action, we're guaranteed to get complete control over any pest. If you consistently use one product over a period of time, your pest can develop pesticide resistance. Pesticide resistance is a serious problem that can cause pesticide applications to repeatedly fail, even when applied at the product's labeled rate. That's why when we're treating insects, we also recommend using multiple products like an insecticide and an insect growth regulator. These products have different modes of action so you're sure to achieve total elimination. Through the use of multiple products and covering different modes of action, we can stop pesticide resistance from developing. Nobody wants to be responsible for creating a super bed bug. Now that's embarrassing. I'm Jason with Solutions Pest and Lawn and this is pest support.
