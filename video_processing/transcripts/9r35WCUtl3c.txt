 So how far should your grow light be from your plants? That depends on a lot of factors, such as the form factor of the light, the grow space, and how much space you're wanting to cover. For example, a Solar System 550 in a grow tent, usually you can put it way up high in the tent, and the reflective walls inside the tent will cause the photons from the light to bounce around, and you'll get great coverage. In an open room, with a SpectraMax Vertical 1000, for example, you probably want to have it a bit closer to your plants so that you're not losing light past the plants, plus the form factor of the light gives you high uniformity at close hanging heights.
