 Thank you. Live new anabium. Good evening everyone. Am I audible to all? Very good evening to all. Please reply whether I am audible, whether the screen is visible or not. So, there was a technical glitch. We were sorting that out. Now, it's right. Okay. So, good evening everyone. Good evening. My class starts only in 2 minutes. Our students are going to be joined live. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. that we can start screaming I look good evening mono good evening everyone good evening of dish I would request all of you to join this session so that we can start okay so I can see that people are joining over here ha ha good evening everyone with a Pelium for complete tulee lecture huh okay Okay, so let's start our session. So ask your fellow to join the session. So let us start. This is a marathon, maha marathon 2. So all you are like all you are set now. So let's start. So let us start some facts to know. Some facts we know. India is a bit of a that ranks first in case of rain-fed agriculture globally. In terms of both. So we talk about area, or value of produce. In both cases, India ranks first in the rain-fed agriculture globally. So how much area is? 95 million hectares. Which is 65% of total arable land. Okay, then if we talk about value of produce, India ranks number one in terms of value of produce in case of rain-fed agriculture. Then, if we look at rain-fed agriculture, you know it accounts 40% of the total food production. So total food production India comes from 40% of your population. So if we look at the data, which is a range-fed agriculture? Which is a range-fed agriculture? That actually feeds 40% of the population. So if we look at data, the national range-fed area authority according. 128 districts in India. Jokey rain-fed is 74 districts in growth-prone districts. Then, one thing that you have to ask. So how important is it? The generous solitary mark in when Ioring the land? That's what the and say multi is coming up here he abhi bhi amad a dry land may be have scope to increase the yield to increase the productivity of the crop so he had a rake me one hectare of irrigated land is equal to three hectares of dial and land in terms of production of cereals grain is that clear to all the jaldi saab mujhe patayi pita jaski session start ho chuka hai ki korn mujhe patayi ga ki sab se pahla jodra farming aapka dry farming research station time inia mein woh kahaan par khula tha aur kawansi year mein kula tha please tell me in the comment section so that I can know you are attentive in the class so my question is aapko batana ki pahla dry farming research station kawansi jagha par khula tha aur kawansi year mein kula tha tell me very fast okay so I can see in the comment section people are responding now let me continue to this marathon map possibility in the comment section. ikea 291 co pahali systemic scientific Jake nor study Judge approach can老師 to tackle the problems of bare farming to dry farming areas type of problem search out kilemy john thug family systemic up concept of me in ак out of the first time of the scientific study started by Tom in 1923 that is in the Pune Maharashtra so I can see that people are responding you are very right with up the go geosey answer demokrat by Dev合 Market to you make from home handbooks so now you have to remember that in 1923 the first systemic approach to tackle the problems of the dry farming and this work passed on in 1926 Kanitkar in 1926 this study was passed on to Kanitkar then you have to remember that the alluvial soils are occupied the largest area in dryland agriculture alluvial soils are occupied the largest area occupy then if we talk about dryland farming now there is a participation proportion of different crops so you can see that 89% of the area of core cereal comes under dryland farming so you can see that nearly 90% the core cereals are dryland farming reasons on rap can you tell me rice can you tell me rice where the last cenota can you tell me Dakar dal threatening going in the comment section leave k What ever you know share head okay so again my oil seeds about the room beta to 69% area 69% of the area of oil seed just make a groundnut rap seed of the mustard or a soya bean about the 69% of the area of these oil seeds you know come under the dryland farming cotton 17件 ב� wenfck��praks larger YES baby passed Zust continuac just me and farming areas all the all the farming areas are located in area and area regions only which means area area area area area area area area area to ask all the farming areas are added in area regions but not all area regions are farming areas area area area area area area area area area area area area is addictedlais temperature and thermal regimes tropical temperature okay then yes you are very right that I have books in the book so if someone can also go through the book which is named as agro soil simplified okay and very soon I will be launching it within one month I will be launching it okay so one month I will launch my new book don't worry about that marathon focus so we will be region rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain rain तो फिर वह अलग अलग कैटेगिरीज हो जाती है वह उनके बारे में बात करेंगे तो हम कह सकते हैं कि जो परोट केसी is agriculture and and and and and and and and and and and and and I and and I I I I I I I I I soils go play both there yes and evil there yeah heavy source code label yes and evil that up with a comment section may but I'm not okay so I'm waiting for your replies now I got a bit of my back room on soon key again of manages the Calvary up for discuss key other in the marathon when he 74 percent or around around 75 percent of the annual precipitation comes from the Southwest monsoon 296 million hectare meter followed by pre monsoon which is around March to May take a 52 million hectare meter pre monsoon say miltay perus kebac 40 million hectare meter a wou hame northeast monsoon say miss a joke October say December tak ja da ya a right or barra a million hectare meter up winter rainfall say aata hai so you can see number one for Southwest monsoon and number two per up cup free monsoon hai number three per up cup northeast monsoon hai or last map the winter rainfall which is around 3% okay so total amara ho jata 400 million hectare meter so I can see that people are attacking sorry so very good bit of heavy 일단 come play a ball tonight start calm Sandy science so this time a reapp worldly LAURES kasih Sandy Swedish well Help me a right then the main point is growing period dry farming less than 75 days okay dry land farming 75-120 days and rain farming more than 120 days so you have to remember crop failures you can see dry farming crop failures are less frequent in case of dry land farming and very few crop failures rain farming because there are no right so humid regions rain farming semi-edited regions mainly dry land farming and added regions basically dry farming follow so you have to remember drainage problem rain farming and we are important here sorry dry farming so dry farming and farming maybe but if you have to drainage problem so we have to drainage to keep okay now now now now we have to know the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific so you can do you can do you can do tell me in the comment section so according to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific Pacific I can see how is it the category and rainfall limit and I am waiting for your replies okay replies replies I know they can check their answers two category United Nations according farming and farming so rainfall range range if 800 mm to farming and 800 mm to rain farming very good again and moisture availability shortage farming enough moisture available moving on growing season 200 farming and rain farming and rain farming but if we talk about it 75 days to dry farming 75 to 120 days and rain farming and farming and farming and growing regions and rain farming consider cropping system single crop and farming and double cropping and limitations and water erosion and farming and water erosion problem not m it is clear to all just comment and tell me very important major events we'll talk about that so I start major events questions you can tell to catch r is established was established was established established was in sub come to a criss crida the Indian Institute of Soil and Water Conservation Indian Institute of Soil and Water Conservation Carbistartua so very right yes Hindu I can see your very good very good so you people are amazing you students are amazing you're giving the right answers this this revision to I hope you will get the top ranks in your examination so so just discuss 2 minutes we'll cover and we'll see this you'll see very good very good very good very good response very delighted to see that so so start youQué má má 3 19 H heart remember about a r L L many are maybe L in 1942 Bombay Land Development Act passed by 1944 Monograph on dry farming in India Kanitkar Dwara did you just like me to ask you to tell me that you have to tell me that you have established in 1959 and you can tell me that you have to tell me in the comment section 1970 made these research centers under the all India coordinator research project Hyderabad start right okay right 23 research centers under the aircraft dryland agriculture Hyderabad start 1972 May be a big reset course start establish which is located at Hyderabad very good फिर अगरम ओर पीस की बात करें की ऑपरेशनल रिसर्च प्रोजेक्स यह 1976 में स्टार्ट वे ठीक है फिर है राप्यातनगर में आपका क्या हुआ के वी के ओपन हुआ अगर झाट तो अभर थे ओस जो के आपका कोब अगया था कहां खोला गयाता अतुंस । मंटेट धरमेंद्र मोनूblic मियू और वी चासी में नहीं नहीं तरफ रहनेंजिक Pues correct answer Central Arid Zone research Institute very good Mono it is in Jodhpur very good Jodhpur my aapka okay then I get a daughter so many books out of the key Pala KVK Khapper so much on the answer to the pondicherry you are very right ring go take it off pondicherry and Mono you both are correct but tell me the year 1972 is wrong farming update has given the right answer 1974 very good so 1974 may Pala KVK pondicherry me very good yeah I am very delighted that you are giving such a good response very good yeah 77 model watershed index Curry beş to 1990 for dryland agriculture Hyderabad in 1985 start or and WDPR in National Watershed Development Program on Rainforest Agriculture government of India to other initiate 1990 or 1991 and May but just states may take it or 1974 may of CSWC RT I'm a club Central soil and water conservation research and training Institute start to up this co-part me can I'm the area Indian Institute of soil and water conservation so 1974 my better yet who are right with Paris no price areas let me say yes connect uhzug in Prime India скet the net 1 donation like without his� HA but NATP 1998 may I and ERP 1979 may I and I to IP 2005 May I always remember this justjungee reopen vehicle Fazio Gh Bombay Okay Kongali.と思ahません, grabbing situation uh toyes 59 foreign right yeah yeah I have already told you this so yeah yeah you can you can you can I can you can you can you can you can you do remember that yes the the correct you can you can have a bit a bit a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a you are turning it using a simple動 should and definition of simple mean deviation is ramdas definition statistical tool use major dispersion deviation so situation rainfall more than the twice of the mean deviation yeah twice of the mean deviation says other deficiency rainfall according to ramdas right American society the period of abnormally dry weather sufficiently prolonged for lack of water to cause a severe hydrological imbalance in the area affected right so abnormal dry weather itina lamba that is water balance imbalance water this was according to the American metrological society before I move on one according to users to do tell me in the comment section according to users to get dot and the irrigation commission of India which which is the area which is the drop to the the the the irrigation commission which is the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the nd the the the farming updates that the first irrigation commission is established in 1901 in your existence I shall be on the basis of on the basis of duration chart I can see according to users hydrological metrological physiological agricultural . So, I have not answer because I have no idea in the slides answer out you can comment so now see according to the duration chart permanent seasonal contingent invisible . So, desert climate basically here we have permanent category and semi-arid zone here here here season and season we have seasonal drought so farmers farmers what should happen when rainfall duration chal right then I can continue drought joky tisra part according to the duration of the area contingent drought humid area mainly humid areas contingent drought accidental drought which can be short period random area covered accidental droughtуется� in the region borderline water deficiency rainfall rainfall rainfall evapotranspiration losses completely compensate and borderline deficiency the crop the crop the invisible draw the crop symptom the answer on the basis of users for the ecological and agricultural and agricultural and very true very good the metrological draw the normal definition of the long-term average long-term average at least 35 years data long-term average so metrological draw in the case 25% deficit to metrological draw 25% deficit moderate and if 50% deficit is more than atmospheric draw and the humidity low and the hot winds blow and the atmospheric draw the road and the road prolonged time or area terms or area to hydrological draw agriculture draw the available soil moisture sufficient losses for p p p complete is soil draw agriculture draw the the definition is 40% total area country moderate or the effect and the rain fall is the most of the year we can see I hope it is clear to all right so you can tell me the one is the amount of rainfall is not the one crop may not be a crop crop but the crop is not as a one is what is what is change all in the prze all misses the season it sees late sees questions ф he was def Confidential Change Ceasins forward I is not that enclosed heart . irrigation you with the पानी को चैनल करने की प्रैक्टिस की लैकिंग की वज़े से अगर कोई राट आता है तो सम्झे शोश्यो एकॉनमिक रॉट हमेशा याद रखना है इसको ठीक है और लास्ट जो रॉट है आपका वाइफ फिजिलोजिकल रॉट मतलब आपके सॉयल में पानी अच्छी से होग को चैनल के रहेगा पानी की कमी का उसमें कोई भी रॉल नहीं होगा मतलब ठीक है ना तो इस नॉट दीडिवीग डिटीट वाट इस अप्लाइज़ देर्टॉ रथे इस दूटी ही था उस्मोटिक प्रैशर ऑफ बी आपकि ए बज़न सॉल्यों और इस दो ने अटिन अच chicken up dot prone area program 1973 to 74 me launch gear take it a minute then dot prone area looking moderate to severe dot of color char consecutive weeks that children during the monsoon your face shake consecutive weeks during the non-monsoon period those come dot manly they had not prone area so monsoon case may char consecutive weeks consider other monsoon period of non-monsoon period of 6 consecutive weeks severe or moderate dot are right so some dot prone area may Анд unfair pedress connect context okay I was excited to wear a bag since i go to look out and I. LOOK at these vatican has a known normal so no not 4.56% So I Drive a 20 to 50% 35 then邪 3% ho disaster. Always remember this when uci m a I I walzen m e . d by p t . period which about the emotion and adequacy index value more than 0.5 nate divided by sewell 0.5어요. product protocol not company value 0.5 возможность 0.25 month and at linear day 0.25 so you see where the category is okay yeah yeah yeah actually actually 50% of potential evapotranspiration is free period that is 50% if I actually evapotranspiration 50% 25% is moderate or if actually less than 25% is a category is a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a margin break yes yeah UK yeah Yeah Imagine that you see that right now So change and get the work at the Kalamiezh ista.com which is or functional modification clients of plants, but coma будут transform if Medicareπα beef should be relevant in particular so this met and we will need if we are If we talk about the crop's ability to grow under the water stress, it is called the drop adaptation. Hopefully, these terms will be clear. We will add more. I will add more. I will add more. When the session is complete, it will be uploaded to you on YouTube. If you want to share it, please share it. Do comment in the comment section. Because we will go live. This is a humble request to all the students that after this session, go through the YouTube video and then there also you comment this. Okay. Thank you, Hindu. For appreciating this lecture and she's saying that, you know, wonderful as always. Thank you very much. So nice of you. Chali. So about the minute. Adaptation.

There was a technical glitch, not technical glitch as such, a network. Technical glitch as such, a network was not coming. But I will run on an even call... Okay so oh so study and It is Way to look Plan So they are just see Florida Don't Ay was faire just see Carbone phosphoenol pyrovic acid carboaxilase but in C3 the first enzyme which is rubisco coal is carbon exilation and oxygenation so if the atmosphere oxygen concentration what do you do they can take up the oxygen and when you take up oxygen then what happens to you then what happens to you oxygen then what happens to you then what happens to you then what happens to you photorespiration starts to happen so remember that if C3 plants photosynthetically efficient not C4 or cam plants more efficient are clear further theיע� I I love music ई the bundle the guardian say about the better increase but do tell me in the comment section I think the screen look at a person actually rainfall give it a four other network issues amara or a high just give me two minutes I'm correcting it job bar bar beta thoda sa amara glitch ri but I'm trying my best to resolve the problem as such as soon as possible network issues are amara okay do tell me I think it is clear now are you okay okay okay guys Toy monies Can we see what is got there but neither doesn't know but good point cellulation acid metabolism is a high lead rod resistant plant open up에 being a classic M plants part John day who David intensive Brunción taught John tail man okay tell me in the comment section chunk I'm waiting for itISA Shalli PTF per so we go bad 808 clients may drop KCO two Gonna I will do anything rather than Rome you know the or so pineapple again Okay, both are correct getting the answer is pineapple again but I think that if you were looking at the screen okay very good So record bird rat Mang второстore organic acid int also is what the inflammation is you okay yeah okay remaining amount okay Kh�도言 they love matter I think I am going on a tolerance higher level of stress hier Dedger is so secure to dress either So bear this and the satisfying apply okay stress high osmotic pressure high amount subущable your high degree of tolerance structure here plastic strain or metabolic Class ville metabolic котором and the plant metabolism so the plant carbon carbon metabolism metabolism so the plant moisture stress so it permanently photosynthesis the plant the high degree of tolerance what are you doing partially open so photosynthesis survive and drought resistance the loss of RNA not the genetic material protein synthesis protein important genetic material young leaves resistant as compared to the older is high protein content plastic strain plant tissue permanent irrevocable loss permanent debt plastic strain so if you the species hole confirm the drug society p is 관 order catch the other thing is that the contribution of the pre-emphasis first flowering the first contribution of the grain less than 20% of the plants except rice, rice it's over 30,40% but if the energy will have an ocean then the pre-emphasis jot assimilation is 50-75% you can keep them enemas if you go Sh status we will continue to Mehran don't worry with me कर दो आ Это कि तो जल्दी से है जंद के लिटा विया क्याना आप 니 हBut I know its원 All which is� Stick to classification of audio video hydro classifications of Hyundai�� S Even if you say could not write it what we say this quiere than thought with classification is based on P index that is the precipitation effective index the index and seasonal distribution of rainfall so P index come get both that precipitation effective index simple and P for annual precipitation E for annual evaporation so P by E into 100 is global 10 P index so climate classify it on the basis of the index on the basis of P index उसने पांच ग्रूप्स दिया है A B C D symbol use के गया 1931 में और इसको अगर हम बात करें बिटर तो एवाले में आता है वेट
