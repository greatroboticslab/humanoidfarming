 Solving My Football Presentation Hey Tractor Chasers! In today's video we are out in the field with Randall Brothers harvesting wheat in Northwestern Ohio. This is a really impressive harvest team to watch. They were running 7 John Deere combines, 3 tractors with grain carts, and an entire fleet of John Deere tractors pulling gravity wagons back to the farm to unload. We're going to watch all this harvesting action and then get in the cab with Lee Randall to find out how wheat harvest is going for them. Let's go check it out! We're up in the cab with Lee Randall and we're harvesting some wheat. How's it going so far, Lee? Well, it was kind of a tough year for wheat. A lot of wet spring that caused the wheat to go down. You have to watch for mildew and light test weight. It's kind of strange that wheat will be down and then right beside it, it's straight up. I always spread it with a fertilizer cart. It does spread even. Around well tile. But you can't change my rotation. Yeah. How do you guys use wheat in your rotation? Well, I like to put wheat in after soybeans and then put it to corn and then to soybeans. Makes a great corn field. Yeah. He's got a neighbor, he's got a farm over here and he's had soybeans for 21 years and he still raises good beans. Oh yeah. He's a good farmer and does good jobs. Is this an earlier wheat harvest for you guys? Yeah, this is about a week early. Usually we just start right after the 4th of July. Yeah. Usually you're cut wheat right over the pin field show. Good. What size headers are on these? Oh, this is a 40 foot John Deere Craper. Yeah. Craper heads seem to be the modern way to go. They say history repeats itself while the old combines had a belt feed. Now they're back to it again. Oh yeah. I know it definitely seems to get a good even flow of material into the combine it seems like. It's a little bit less than it. It starts to rain, you can cut longer than you should. It does seem good. Yeah. What's the moisture running on this now? This here is 14-2. Yeah. I haven't lost any test weight yet. If this rain comes like you're talking about, it will lose test weight. And if you get head sprouted. I always like to raise weed. It's not wet. Usually good weather. Not stuck in the mud. Yeah. Fighting everything. And trying to go out. Yeah. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. But now we need to get hemp sprouted. I always like to raise weed. It's not wet. Usually good weather. It's not stuck in the mud. Yeah. Fighting everything. Drying the corn. We're good. I always think it's nice because you finish the spring rush and then you can kind of have a more relaxed harvest time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like soybeans. You pray for rain all summer long if it doesn't come and when it's time to harvest, it's raining all the time. Yeah. Once it's harvest time, it seems like you get a rain and it's never quite warm enough to dry it back out. Once it starts raining in the fall, you're fighting mud for the rest of the season. And if it stays muddy, you're out there in January, running on frozen dirt, combines break down, your fingers are frozen trying to fix it. Tracks do definitely help keep it floating and make less compact. Yeah. But there's a lot more maintenance to warm too. Yeah. When I was a kid, there was just 5, 10 Masseys and LLs everywhere you looked around here. Yeah. Now the John Deere regime is pretty well-tuned. Yep. I know driving around, you see a lot of Massey Ferguson sitting in the weeds behind barns. I think probably 30 years ago, it would be pretty neat to see what harvest looked like around here. Yeah. Well, it was. The 5, 10 was the ultimate combine. It was good. It had variable speed, cylinder variables. You could do about everything from the cab. Yeah. Quicktatch, Hander, they were first with that. Yeah. Have you guys always run John Deere combines? Or? Oh. Yeah, Dan was, Dan had 25s and 55s. And he rolled on up. Every now and then I'll run red on rotary combines. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, we're going to get up. Every now and then I'll run red on rotary combines. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let me go. Yeah. Yeah. Any右 moves? Oh no. I mean, the two itself was split up by two. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Matt and a Heinle. elves,小 coast Africaninary torque. It wasn't that young one. Yeah, ya, even. Staff or Howard's going. If you're going, that's good and still. Two feet are straight from now. The3 bull going, an bob of tho.
