 My name is Anthony Jones and I'm the CEO of Exaga.com. I'm actually the fourth generation CEO of a family business. We began to see this thing in agriculture where we were all behind the times in marketing and in understanding of the online world. One of the first things we did is we started vetting some of the larger known e-commerce third-party platform networks, Amazon, eBay. And you could quickly see that a bunch of them did not fit what agriculture needed. So we began to dream big that we actually wanted to build Exaga.com as potentially an agricultural Amazon. When you visit our site, we guarantee you'll see transparent and honest pricing on the highest quality products that we can source from across the world. In addition to that, we have a live USA-based team of customer service reps ready to field any question or concern that you have. And on top of that, we're committed to shipping your order fast with same-day shipment on a big percentage of our orders. We've put a lot of work into designing the way that the website flows to ensure that it's easy to use. We make it very simple to sign up for a user account, to fill up a cart full of incredible products, and to make a quick and simple checkout. And we take great pride in being very transparent with our product names and prices so you know exactly what you're buying and what you're paying for it. The original idea for the name or the moniker was Agazon, which was obviously a play on the word Amazon. Agazon spelled backwards, which is Nozaga. And we wanted the term Ag to be in the name, and so we replaced No with Ag, and that's why we call it Ag-Zaga. I mean, our goal is to literally build the best agricultural e-com in the entire United States. But the way that we want to do that is building a customer experience for every single person that comes to our website. One of our catchphrases is the online farm store. But we also built Ag-Zaga.com as the ability to be a full blown marketplace, just like you see with Amazon. So some of our goals there is that Ag-Zaga literally becomes an avenue for agricultural stores, manufacturers, maybe even farmers that have products all throughout the United States. But how do we get them into the online world? And that's where Ag-Zaga.com fits in. So everything that we do, we want the heart of agriculture, but more than that, we want to actually make an impact and an outstanding customer experience for every person that gets to connect with Ag-Zaga.com.
