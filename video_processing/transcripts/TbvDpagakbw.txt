 Hi, so one of the most frequently grown crops at the farm are the groundnuts. From these groundnuts we are making this wood pressed groundnut oil. I would like to break this into three parts. The first is the growing process, the farming. Now these varieties of groundnuts that we grow are called Gunguru Sengdana. They are the indigenous varieties. It's not the hybrid, it's not the modern variety of groundnuts that we grow. The second part is the processing. These groundnuts are processed into the oil by Lakdi Ghana. It's a wood press, it's not refined unlike the modern varieties, the modern processes. The third part is finally the packaging part of it. It's packed in glass bottles and not in plastic bottles. So all three, the farming is organic, the processing is organic and the packaging is in glass bottles. So we've kept it clean throughout. Thank you.
