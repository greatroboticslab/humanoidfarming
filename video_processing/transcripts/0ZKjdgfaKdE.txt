 What's up homestead homies it's off good with Doug and Stacey I'm Doug and today's just another daily vlog about what's going on in the homestead you guys wanted to kind of see these daily things last week we posted them every single day we missed one day this last week because of the Baker's Creek spring planting festival I don't know why I've had to hard time with that one so we did miss Monday because we were coming back and then I had to make the videos and put them up but this was this last week you see we have videos every day we're gonna just keep trying to bring you guys videos every day on the homestead today we're gonna try to continue on with burning the hay that was left over from the sheep sheep and goats waste a lot of hay horses pretty much do too it's just it's just part of you know business I mean it's the cost of doing business you can try to rig up ways to cut back on that but ultimately I mean they're just gonna waste it so I like to rake that up and burn it so I don't have any weed seeds around I don't like to put it in the compost you that you might do it that way this is how we do it here then what I do is that area that would they spread it all out is dead now so I spread out the ashes and then the ashes create new growth and then you know the cycle continues so that's the way we do it here we're gonna fix some blackberry issues that I have with getting them up we're gonna you know just try to do a few things I don't know if I'll be able to burn today again because it's really windy out to absolute gorgeous day in the Midwest so that's going good news for us going for us also we have a visitor coming next Thursday that we're really excited about we're gonna keep you guys informed stay tuned for that that'll be pretty neat and that's it one tip I'm gonna give you right now for aging in place okay aging in place and starting your homestead you get a two for tipper right here before the show even starts one if you're starting your homestead try to plant all your fruiting stuff you know as quick as you can your apple trees your blackberries your blueberries your mulberries your elderberries all that kind of stuff plant it as soon as you can because it takes a little bit of time for the roots to establish and for it to really start producing fruit okay and I'm speaking from experience we did put in some blackberries we waited like two years or so to put in apple trees you know so I'm just encouraging you to learn from our mistakes and try to put those things in sooner rather than later and that you'll greatly benefit from that okay now my other hot tip is aging in place when you put your apple trees and your blackberries and your blueberries and your elderberries and your mulberries when you put all that stuff out keep it kind of close to the house as close as you can if you have 11 acres or 10 acres or 5 acres you don't want to be going an acre away to tend to your fruiting vegetation okay because you'll be competing with birds squirrels rabbits so you want to make sure you keep that in mind also because the older that you get you want to make it more convenient okay I know right now you know you're all full of vigor and it's no problem but as you age in place you just want to keep in mind these conveniences so you can work simple and smart and not as hard okay so we're gonna start the show right now first project we're gonna do on the homestead today in the wind so if you're hearing wind on the microphone you know I just do the best that I can hopefully it's not too bad so I put in these posts to hold up the blackberries and then I put in some wire here and what the problem that we're having is that the wires getting loose that post down at the end isn't staying as sturdy as this one is that's why I always recommend putting in rock in your hole or concrete I think I put a little bit of rock in there but not enough and then I put some dirt in there I figured it would hold but it's not so I'm gonna I'll probably leave this one in because I like the firmness of it I'm gonna take this wire all off and I'm gonna reuse this wire again in future projects and I'm gonna put in some T posts and a cattle panel the tried-true method of you know trellising or holding up any of your plants that need a little help okay so I'm gonna get busy doing that we'll cut back in with you as we show our progress so stay tuned down all that mess I left this post in because it's still in pretty good and I put my T post in one right there one at the end and a little one there to kind of support it and then I tied my blackberries up to the cattle panel which I should have done in the first place but we were just trying something that we had on hand and so I robbed this cattle panel from the back where the sheep have a separation so now I have to go make some repairs on the fence back there that I was putting off and then I'll be moving the sheep from over there to over here so we can get busy at the alpaca house area for putting together the burning the hay that they wasted so we can get that out of here before it starts creating seeds and weeds and all kinds of craziness all right so we'll check you guys in a second all right so we're deep in the forest of the off-grid homestead this is my neighbor's fence I would never claim this fence but it's his fence now there's a rule of thumb in the country if you live in a homestead in the country is that if a fence needs to be repaired the property owners split the cost okay so he'll pay for the left side and I'll pay for the right side down the middle okay so basically that's how you do it so I've been talking with him and it's about time he's going to pay for the materials of his part I think he's gonna pay a little bit more because I'm gonna do all the labor and then I'm gonna come in and clear off an area through here because as you can see he's got trees growing up by here and every other kind of thing and then I'm gonna repair this fence back here but for now because it's his fence I'm just doing these little dog hole repairs okay so like this area right here has been cut away probably before we lived here there were some hunters they used to sneak on this land and they would hunt deer here but now that we've moved here they can't so there's a couple spots where you can see it was compromised by human activity and so I'm gonna get this straightened up because I'm bringing the sheep back over here on this side and I'm gonna let them graze in this wooded area as well so what we're gonna do is we're taking cattle panel are not a cattle panel but a piece of the woven wire fence that I used in the other areas I'll link a video right here about the woven wire fence and basically I just connect it here to where this hole is and then that'll keep them from going from going through the fence one thing about your animals is that you always have to watch your fencing because if your livestock get out let's say you have a cow and your cow gets out and somebody hits it on the road you're responsible for that action you know what I'm saying so keeping your fence in good shape is always a must on the homestead and I was able to utilize a lot of that wire from the last fix up at the blackberries on that same project you know securing the cattle panel to the T post so you can always recycle on the homestead material several different times and actually that wire I got for free that was electric fence wire that a neighbor took down and didn't want anymore so I got a whole school of it to use all right I'll finish getting this secured up and I'm going to show you another spot that I have trouble with that we're going to fix real quick quick to all right real quick I want to talk about water gaps okay because this is the creek that runs from where you saw me do my last fence repair I'll link the video up right there you'll the last video that you saw me do that fence repair because the lamb was getting out this creek comes on down here and then it goes through here to the neighbor's property okay now this is also a water gap okay and I'll just tell you I'm not fond of the tin roofing water gap system okay what it's designed to do is just kind of flap open as the water flows and you know I don't like it because stuff gets stuck in there like you can see right there there's a compromising spot right there where they could go through if they wanted to so I don't really care for this system too much it's much better to have a cattle panel cut to fit the banks of the pond and then put in there and then even maybe run one T post down in the water and then tie it to that and leave it alone a lot of times guys will use the cattle panels and they'll you know they'll just let them kind of swing as well but when they do swing they come right back this swings here and it gets caught now granted it has gotten a little loose over time probably but I'm just not really a fan of this type of a water gap system so in the future we'll probably when when I talk to the neighbor be replacing this water gap system and then I told you guys before in a previous video we have a couple of other water gaps on the property that we're going to be addressing so they can be a lot more secure for our livestock the water gap that I just showed you with the tin the corrugated tin as the water gap so what I found was that the sheep were getting out and then so I had to track down where they were getting out so one thing you guys will want to do if you're having a problem with your animal getting off the homestead is to check your fencing everywhere and then look for tall tail signs right here you can see on these barbs and this wire here where the sheep are going underneath this little area right here to escape to the neighbor side and then they were actually working down the forest to the other water gap and then coming back through the property and in and up out on our horse pasture so I got some of the woven wire again I also have welded wire but I try not to use that I just brought it along in case I didn't have enough and I'm gonna put the woven wire over this area here and then that'll this will stop them from from getting out now of course at first you know I tried the I tried the stick method I put a bunch of sticks here but they obviously just pushed them down and actually made their way out so you know sometimes you're a little lazy on the homestead you know it's just kind of human nature but I will tell you that you know if you if you do things haphazardly it'll come back and get you anyway so they eventually got out anyways so it's best I just go ahead and get this fixed up I'm going to turn them loose in here in a minute and we'll we'll see some more dug and the and the sheep herding system but pretty simple here I'm just going to tie on to the existing fence that's already here and we'll be in good shape this panel is plenty big I won't need to use the welded wire I really try not to use that as if I can all right so I'm going to give you guys another tip these are Klein tools they're kind of used for the electric line guys you know if you're working electric or anything this is an invaluable fencing tool okay you can get them at your local hardware store it's got a cutter right here flatheads right here so you can use it for the wire and then like you're seeing me doing with these repairs I'm just taking the wire wrapping it around what I'm fastening it to bringing it through the wire here grabbing the end trying to get it as tight as I can then I do a twist like that then I cut the wire here and then you just grab your pliers like this and then you just turn that and that'll get it nice and tight so there's your little tip right there they're just Klein tools really good really good thing to have on the homestead now there's they do make a dedicated pair of like pliers for fencing but I find that I use these far more than I do the dedicated pair but they do come in handy as well all right I'm going to throw a couple more pieces of security on here and then we'll go back up front and move the sheep over to the to their other pasture catch you in a minute as yeah way is your arm hit hit alright now that right there is we heard some sheep it's off good with Doug and Stacy we're going to move over to the alpaca house try to get some hay piled up I don't know if we'll be able to burn today but we'll see where we go hang on alright guys so it's really windy out here so I'll probably just get a couple more piles lined up I'm not going to do any burning today and I'll check back with you guys in a minute we'll probably just end this video so just wanted to give you an idea about what was going on over here I'm going to probably get several piles together and get this stuff burned but not today because it's way too windy so alright we'll see you in a second so that was it pretty much for outside work I've got my piles piled up over here a little bit better to stage them for the burn which I might be able to do tomorrow depends on how much wind we got going on and I will say that man you guys you guys are keeping me motivated if I'm trying to make these daily vlogs I am I'm definitely on the go now alright so hopefully you enjoyed this you know they're going to range probably anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes hopefully you glean a little information out of them this is offgrid with Doug and Stacy I'm Doug and we'll see you guys on the next episode
