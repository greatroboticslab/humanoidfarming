 Hello and welcome again to my channel organic and hydroponic urban grow pro. Today in this video we will compare the result of the two method of the sowing. The first one is a conventional method where we saw the tubers to get the turmeric. And another method which we have tried this year to grow the seedling into the pro tray and transfer it upon the maturation. And now as we are taking the crop out we will make some comparative study between both the methods where the yields are good or where the yields are better compared to what inputs we have made. So if you are interested in knowing all this detail please stay connected to the video till the end. Let's start the video. So friends we have saw our turmeric with two ways. The first way is with the tubers of around 35 to 40 grams each. And in another method we have prepared the seedling into pro tray using only 5 to 7 grams of the turmeric rhizomes. And grow the plants up to 8 to 10 inch high and transfer it into the field. For comparing the yield what we will do we will dig out around 10 rhizomes and weigh it from both the methods. We know the inputs. In conventional method we have put 35 to 40 grams of each tuber and in pro tray method we have used only 5 to 7 grams of rhizome pieces. And we will compare the weight what weight or what multiple weight we have got with the as a result. So let's start digging the turmeric from the field. So this is the bed where we have planted the turmeric directly with the rhizomes. So here you can see the rhizomes are there. So now we will dig out 10 rhizomes from it for women purpose. So now you can see that how this rhizome has grown. So this is the original one which is now rotten. And this is the rhizomes which has developed for this year. So this looks like around 8 to 10 times the original rhizomes is there. We will collect this and we will weigh it. So now we have 10 rhizome bunch with us. So we will collect them all and take it for the women. But before women we need to wash them properly. So we will collect them first. This is the base where we have planted our protray nursery plants onto the field. Now here again we will dig 10 plants and take 10 cluster for women. So we will start the digging over here. So you can see that how this tuber has got developed. It has developed well. It is with very healthy rhizome from it. So these are the tubers we got from the only 5 to 7 grams of turmeric rhizome. Now we have got 10 rhizome bunch. We will collect them and take it for the women. We will first wash it and then weigh it. So now we are cleaning it up so that no soils will remain on this any of the tubers. So it will not be counted as a weight. Watch the video till the end.

So that we get the actual net weight for this turmeric. So now we are weighing the turmeric. Initially we are weighing the turmeric which we have grown from the protein nursery. So here we have we have meant. We have made this bucket as a zero. Now we will simply replace this bucket. And you can see that this is around 1200 grams. So we will just note down over here. It is 1200 grams. So now we will weigh the turmeric which is grown from the rice. Grown from the rhizomes. And we can see that. It is around 1175 grams. So it is slightly lower than the. What we have grown from the rhizomes. It is almost equal. But slightly less. Now we will compare. What is the yield from both the turmeric. So now it's time for final conclusion. Here is the turmeric which have grown from the rhizome cuttings and protein method. And this is the turmeric which we have grown from the rhizome itself. Major difference what we can notice is the color. The color of the turmeric which are grown from this seedling or the protein nursery are bright orange in color and longer in the length. While what we have grown from the tuber rhizome. You can see this old rhizome is there. And these are the all the new rhizomes are there. But they are little dull on the color. And also the length of the rhizome is shorter. And that may be the reason. It is slightly lower in the weight. Second. Then when we compare the absolute weight. So these are almost on the same page. Like this is 1200 gram. And this is 1175 grams. But if we compare that input weight. Here we have used. 5 to 7 or 8 gram of this rhizome pieces. So for 10 rhizome. We have consumed 80 grams of turmeric. And we have got the 1200 grams. So roughly. But if we compare the absolute weight gain. Then we must understand that. This is 1200 grams for 10. Approximately 10 rhizomes. So average weight for the. Bunch is 120 grams. And for that 120 grams. We have put only 8 grams. Into the. Seedling. So. We have converted. Almost. 15 times. The turmeric. From this. Small rhizome of the. Turmeric. Whereas. If we compare this. From the rhizomes. Grown turmeric. The rhizomes of weight. Around. 20 to 25 grams. Were there. When we have planted. And in result. We have got. 1175. Grams. Of the turmeric. For the 10. Tubers. So on an average. We got. Around. 120 grams. Of tubers. From. 20 to 25 grams. Of. Turmeric rhizomes. So here. The conversion is. Six times. The. Input weight. So take a overall conclusion. The method of growing. Turmeric. From the. Protre method. And small. Cutting of the rhizome. Is given us. The better result. As a overall. Input. And output. Now. The second part. That. Per unit area. What is the output. So here. If you see. We have put this. Turmeric. Plant. Around. One feet. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. Feet. So per. Eine. Input. modes. So per square feet. We have got. Average. One. Rhizome. That is. Around. 120 grams. So from both. The method. For every 100 square feet. Of the area. We will get. Approximately. 12해야gent of turmeric. From the. Field. So this is. The small comparison. Which have. Taken a trial. This year. So. Tiara.
