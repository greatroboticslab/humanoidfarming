 I've been researching carbon credits probably for the last four or five years, and I was always a little bit skeptical. But, you know, this is the wealthy cowboy show, and profit is pretty important. And I understood from ranch management, sometimes you can do everything right, and you're still not profitable. And so I was always searching for something. You know, when I started TCU Ranch Management Program, they had a picture and said, what is the best mineral program in the state of Texas, and it was an oil well behind a longhorn cow. So I feel like carbon credits are really no different than wind energy or solar. It's a way for you to increase the revenue per acre on your property. But with carbon credits, you don't have to look at an ugly windmill or look at an ugly solar farm.
