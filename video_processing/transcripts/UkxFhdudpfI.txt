Howto & Style
 The five butternut squash is going to be growing vertically on string trellis and you've got to come every two days when doing this and then basically just guide this upward like this right here. Just keep twisting it like that. Just be gentle and that's it. And then you come back the next day and you follow and do the same thing until it grows right up. You're going to have some side shoots. I removed the lower side shoots so the energy don't go sideways. The energy is flowing up. I'm going to leave about at least when you reach about four feet I'm going to leave the side shoots.
