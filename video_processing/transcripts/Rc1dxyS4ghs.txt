 This morning, early this morning, I got my next delivery of organic fruits and veggies. And so I wanted to share with you guys what came in my box, what do I do when it's time for me to prep my veggies for the refrigerator or the freezer, and you know, overall what I think about it, and I'm going to give you guys a discount code that you can use if you're in California to try out Firm First U. Now, I did an initial video for you guys before, but I thought since I'm on, you know, I've been using the service for a while now, I say about five or six months now, I said, I think it's time for me to give you guys an update because, you know, you get, you run across a lot of products and services of people reviewing products on YouTube, but you don't really hear what their update is. Are they still using the product? Do they like it? Has anything changed or improved with the product or service? So I wanted to share that with you today in this video. Firm First U is a company who provides organic, organic fruits and vegetables, and they deliver them to your home or your businesses if you're in California. And so they go, they collectively use local growers in the California area, and sometimes I think Washington State as well too, they'll ship some stuff out to California, but everything is organic. And so that's what I love about, you know, Firm First U. Everything always has arrived fresh. They sometimes, what I hear, is they pick the actual fruits and vegetables the same day at times. So when you get your fruits and vegetables, you may see soil, a little dirt still on it from the soil, and so you want to make sure to clean them off very well. Okay. So what I use is I like to have some throwaway gloves and I get a, I have a large scroll of plastic wrap that I use to wrap all my veggies and I either refrigerate some and then I'll freeze some. And it depends on what I'm going to be cooking with during that week. First thing, the boxes come in really nice boxes that you can actually carry and you recycle the boxes. So for your next delivery, you can hand over the boxes right back to your Farm First delivery guy, or you can leave them right outside your door because the deliveries of your fruits and vegetables really come to your front door and they leave it right there in your stoop. Or if you're around, you know, they can hand your fruits and vegetables to you directly, which I normally do most of the time. And I will go ahead and give them the boxes to recycle. But in each box, you have a inventory sheet like this, and it tells you everything that's in your box. So for my first box, I had broccoli, I had rainbow carrots, I had yellowfin potatoes, I had a globe eggplant, red grapefruit, and two red pomegranates, green leaf lettuce, some cilantro, and I had some lacinado kale. And so in my second box, I got some green grapes, which I absolutely love. I think I had the red ones last two weeks ago. And so now I have the green again. And then I have some baby bok choy. In my box was spaghetti winter squash. I had some collard greens. And I got some green cabbage, which I get pretty much every shipment. I got four Valencia oranges. And then I got me some red potatoes. And I got some sweet potatoes as well. And I put everything that is leafy, like any green leafy vegetables, I make sure to go ahead and soak them, you know, really massage them in that water to get the dirt and mud and every soil out of the green vegetables. And then I go ahead and pat it dry, just like you see me do here with the lettuce. Then I roll it in the plastic wrap. And then from there, I just put it in the refrigerator. And it will keep it crisp for a while. I learned that from one of my seniors that I worked with before. And she told me that. And ever since I learned that little trick, I always use it. Now the same thing for these rainbow carrots. I chopped off the top of all the green, chopped off that. And then I went ahead and rinsed them off very, very well. And then I just roll them right in that plastic wrap and put them in the freezer. Because my carrots, they don't stay as long because, you know, they're fresh, right from the, they're organic. So I make sure to put them in the freezer so I can use them for stews and soups and sometimes I like to saute them just like that, long and stocky and have them with some jasmine rice or a pasta dish. So, ah, they're so good. And the rainbow carrots are so sweet. They're just really nice. You should try them. So another thing I really like about Farm Fresh to you is they give you your inventory of what's in your box, but also they have this pretty cool newsletter. And in the newsletter, it says Farm News and Thaddeus, which is one of the, is the owner of Farm Fresh to you, one of the owners, he really does a great job of giving you an update of what's going on on the farm, how the vegetables are growing, if they're hitting any type of obstacles or how did they resolve an issue with the growing process, how's the land doing, how the environment is doing, how animals and birds and things are reacting to, ah, the fields, the trees, how the wind is blowing. I mean, I just love to read these, ah, Farm News, this Farm News section on the newsletter. And also since spaghetti squash is new, um, into our delivery boxes, we also got some information on spaghetti squash and how you can, uh, cook with it. Also it originated in China. I didn't even know that in 1921 it was introduced to Japan by a Chinese agricultural research firm and then was brought to the United States 15 years later. Who would have thought spaghetti squash? I say I've been more brave with trying different weird looking, uh, vegetables, even fruits, uh, by being on this service. So that's a great benefit. I've learned to cook them and when I tasted them, I was shocked by how pleased and happy I was at how they taste. They really taste great, right? And so that was a benefit. And then I realized, gosh, I get all the vegetables I need that I can customize, um, the week before, uh, our deliveries come on Thursday where I live. So the week before, uh, you get, you get an email from them to pick what you want for your box. You can leave the box. They do put veggies and fruits and vegetables according to whichever box you want in your box. They're going to put stuff in the automatically, but now they have a new way where you can customize your box. So if you don't like radishes, which I don't, and you don't like certain other vegetables or fruits, you can go ahead and take them out. Or if you have too many, many vegetables, certain vegetables from your last delivery or too many fruits from your last delivery, you can take them out and put something else in. So I really, really like the customization because I can really plan my meals on what I'm going to cook, um, that I may want to try a recipe. And so I'll get a vegetable that will complement that recipe. And so that's really, really awesome that I can customize my box. And so I realized that the Monster Box really works for me. I'm only buying, um, I'm the only one cooking up in here, but I find that the Monster Box works for me because being a vegan now, I find that I eat a vegetable and a grain every day. I cook at home every day. I rarely eat out and I can feel the difference. When I eat out, I feel like I have indigestion and my stomach is acting weird. It acts weird. It's strange. But then when I cook at home and I cook my organic vegetables from Farm Fresh to You and put a grain to it or, um, maybe another, uh, a vegan meat alternative, I feel great. But also at a really reasonable price, I'm getting all of these organic fruits and vegetables at a certain price that I know I'm going to pay, um, for every other week's delivery. And I don't have to worry about scrounging through the grocery store produce section, trying to figure out how should I get this vegetable this week? Should I get this vegetable? Oh my gosh, what is that? Should I try that? Is that going to be a good vegetable? I don't have to worry about any of that because, hey, I know what's going to come in my box and I can plan my meals out and it's just so easy. If you want to go ahead and use Farm Fresh to You, I do have a discount code below this video and you can go ahead and when you go to log in, it'll have you create an account. It'll ask you where you're located, put in your zip code and it'll let you know if they will ship, deliver fruits and vegetables to your area. And if they will, um, you can pick your veggies according to your schedule that you want to do. You can go ahead and put in your coupon code, S-E-L-E-8487. That's your discount code and you'll get $10 off your very first box if you have never used Farm Fresh to You before. So you won't get charged for your box until after it arrives. So my box arrived today, so I'll get charged on Sunday for this box and if I had any discount codes or coupon codes, that would be taken off automatically off my bill on Sunday. So it's pretty cool too, right? Because you get to try it first and if you have any issues with your box, you can contact customer support and they'll help you through it. If you didn't get your box, you can call customer support support and they'll help you through it. Um, if you live in an apartment or a condo, um, you can go ahead on and call customer support and let them know and they'll help figure out your key access, how you want them to get into the complex so they can leave your box outside your door. Okay, make sure that you support your local farms by going to your local farmers market because all those local farms, they're, they do hard work growing all of these fruits and veggies for us. And so it's good to support your local farms and really go out there and start even eating more healthy if organic fruits and vegetables is available to you.
