 Hey y'all okay it is 36 hours since we put our seeds in the paper towel ziploc bag so it's been our 36 hours so now we're going to check out how our seeds are doing if they're ready to actually go into soil so here we go we're gonna do a big it's like a big reveal party gender revealed oh yeah like a baby shower whatever anyway whatever the kids are doing these days with babies okay so this is a Thai V so this is a Thai one of my favorite Thai varieties actually crossed with our free the V THCV so this should be a really interesting plant I actually did this back in I think 2020 so these are like five-year-old seeds I have grown a few since then but then here we go what do we got so it's looking like we have a pretty good amount of seeds already popping so the next process here is for me to count how many there are oh by the way you want to have tweezers uh-oh dog disturbance anyway we're gonna keep rolling all right um so anyway definitely get a nice clean pair of tweezers I already dunked them in our favorite hydrogen peroxide and I'm gonna count here we got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen now I'm not going to put you through all of that watching me do 17 of these uh but so all I do I write Thai V and I'm gonna do this obviously 17 times so what we have here is this is really nice um uh Fox Farm Happy Frog so it's not like some super hippie blend that I created uh it's just this really seems to work and it's pretty uniform been using it for years but it's the happy frog it has a higher p ratio so when you put the seed in I'll show you what we do here and I dip my sharpie in hydrogen peroxide and then I make a little little hole just right there okay now we're gonna come in close so I'm gonna grab the longest tail one first grab that nice and gently and now let's see if we can actually is it still in focus yeah I think so here goes the little baby and what I do is I kind of lean them up against the side there and you're not burying your seed it's just going to be just under the surface and then I just push it and there so you've only got there may only be like a millimeter of soil covering the seed but then I've just pushed it in and that is now Thai V so that one's done and by the way these are some other ones I already got started on um yeah we got Peshawar from uh uh Pakistan this is a laughing jack so an old laughing buddha Jack Herrera cross I'm doing some old uh sort of like 90s early 2000s uh heirlooms that I really enjoyed that was a that was a great period like 90s early 2000s cannabis I thought was really great um so anyway that's kind of fun and what we'll do is just in here may we'll come back and look at these again so any seed that is showing any so like this one it's it's popped it's ready to go so that's all we need to do is just get the seed to this point and then the ones that haven't popped yet like here uh we'll just fold them back up and let them cook for another like 12 hours on the heat mat you know covered up in the bag but yeah this one's definitely ready to go but even this this small oh and by the way when you then uh plant them let me just show you one more thing so bump bump I make my little hole by the way get any like debris out of the way if there's like a hard and make sure your tapper it's going down now and then so it's in its little hole and boom now so I don't forget which one I did I'll write tie v boom yeah so now I got two of those so now I just got to do that 15 more times and and then the ones that haven't popped yet I'll fold back up and put them back to cook in their little incubator for like another 12 hours and let's just see for the fun of it it's always exciting so here's some yunan that we grew last year that smells like black pepper amazing plant let's see what these look like whoo all right looks like we've got four up five so and that one's actually going too so one two three four five six now we've got that one's just starting to crack so anyway as you can see we're having a very good success with germination so the ones that haven't popped yet those aren't duds just keep putting them in for 12 hours 12 hours 12 hours until you see them pop and sometimes I've seen plants or seeds older seeds sometimes go for like five days five or six days and then all of a sudden they pop so don't give up on them if they haven't uh popped you know it doesn't hurt to just keep throwing them back uh but then if you ever see your seeds start getting moldy they're toast once you see if you see fuzzy mold start growing they're gone anyway hope that helps and we're going to keep moving oh by the way big fan of heat mats especially to just help your your seeds thrive in the beginning just cold want at this point won't kill them but it'll kind of stall them out so you want to keep uh everything nice and warm so I do the heat mat uh the same way we get our seeds make sure and have your thermostat during the day this won't even come on it's just at night when it gets really cold it will just have a little extra heat source coming up through the soil oh and one other thing a correction uh someone I was calling these four inch pots I think they're they are someone pointed out these are five inch I think these are five inch I'll show you here so we used to use I think this is the four inch pot and it turns out our plant would just grow too fast and you'd have to transplant too quickly and they'd get root bound so this five inch pot this five inch pot size I think is the best and then and then we'll move up to a five gallon pot I don't have any of those in here but then from five gallon pot actually yeah I do I'll show you five gallon really dirty pot but yeah so what typically do is go from this size I'm going to go from this size to then this size and then this size is what we transplant into the garden into our in-ground uh permanent garden so in this way uh you're not wasting a bunch of soil if you get some duds you haven't used a ton of soil but then the plant can actually grow for a while in this and get pre-established before it goes into here anyway hope that makes sense and I got a busy day so I gotta get going I got hundreds and hundreds of seeds I gotta fill all these pots so anyway gotta go but uh hope that's helpful and a little trick sees I don't know if she's helping she's just wandering she's just always around this guy under there oh yeah and then we got lila over there okay yeah oh we got all everyone except rocket so anyway it's a party okay please you
