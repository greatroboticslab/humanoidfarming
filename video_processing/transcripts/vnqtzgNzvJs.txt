 Hi, I'm Tom at Ledgemere. Today's kind of a crummy day outside. Winter's coming, but the point of this video is I want to show you some of the things, the bigger things, that have proved invaluable to the farm and has it just increased my quality of life tenfold. The first thing I'm going to tell you is a side-by-side a UTV, a universal terrain vehicle or whatever you call it. I have no idea what the U means. Somebody tell me, comment down below. I think it's a universal. I don't know. This one's a John Deere and there's there's as many people that make them as there are you know colors in the rainbow. The John Deere dealer close to me has treated me very well over the years. It's like 30 horsepower goes about 40 miles an hour which I'd never go 40 miles an hour even up to the the land trust I might go 25 or 30. When you get one make sure you get a winch because you're going to be either stuck or you're going to be pulling something out and this right here is a I think it's a 3,000 pound winch. So what I can do is I can winch out logs with this thing. It's got a 50 foot cable. I can get myself in a position and if I have to I can drive one of the wheels up against a stump spool out the cable and then pull the the log back to me and I can the way this can work is that you you pull the log to yourself spool out back up pull the log to yourself etc. It's it's not really a you know a logging machine but it gets the job done. Number two a tractor you can buy a used tractor old tractor new tractor does not matter what you get what you feel comfortable with get what you get a good deal on get what you like. I've got a Mahindra dealer close to me this has been a fantastic tractor it's made by Mitsubishi Japan the whole thing is Mitsubishi Japan except for the Loto which was made in the United States but I'm not going to put up a plug in on a particular model or make of tractor other than I love this tractor. If you're going to get a tractor try to get one with the skid steer quick attach on the front because when I show you what else here in a second you're going to see why that's a snow blower. If you live in Maine or any place north where there's a ton of snow you can get a back blade and those work okay but snow blower and yeah you do get a sore neck but I don't actually plow the whole driver with it so I'll explain more about that in a second. This gets the bankings out and gets into places that I can't get otherwise. Again in the north this is a seven foot snow pusher has the skid steer quick connect on the back and it's almost like a box blade on the front with a squeegee under it so you just push all the material use your bucket loader heap it up and pile it. So between this and the snow blower I don't have snow issues. If you do get a tractor unless you're buying more than one tractor buy a tractor with a front end loader already on it because you can't really get a loader later on. Sure you might be able to find an aftermarket one but trying to find a factory loader for a tractor 20 years later forget it and also when you go to trade your tractor it's not going to be worth as much because everybody wants a tractor with a bucket on it. I also recommend full wheel drive because if you're going to be doing a lot of bucket work more so with a small tractor with a big utility tractor like I showed you my brothers you can get away with two wheel drive because it's a big heavy tractor but small tractors you want full wheel drive. Also just the resale value with a full wheel drive and a bucket that's what people want that's what's going to be able to get you out of that machine and to something else when you're ready. Do not cheap out and buy clamp-on pallet forks. I've already been down that road. They go wiggle wobble all over the place. They fall off. They're garbage. Do not buy those. Adjustable forks on it in and out. It's manual but piece of cake. You can hook a chain on this. It's just a real lifesaver for me. I can move round bales, logs, you name it. Forklift. That's what you need. Walking over here. So also some of this equipment you see is going to be proprietary like the land plows here going to Farm Old Cub. They won't really fit anything else. Under here is a fertilizer spreader. It's a pendular spreader. If you have fields to fertilize you're going to put lime down whether you fertilize or not. That works for that. A landscape rake. We call them a york rake. York rake. Landscape rake. Whatever you want to call it. Get one with the gauge wheels on the back and that's what's going to set your depth. Otherwise you're going to have a really wavy work when it's completed. This right here is a three-point hitch round bales spear. Make sure you get the round bales spear with the stabilizer spears. There's one on each side so it's like a three-prong deal. This right here was just a skid steer attached plate with three-point hitch couplings on it and so that's how I converted that. Can you move round bales without it? Yeah. You can chain it to the bucket. You can use your forks but when you've got a whole you know seven thousand pound trailer load with 14 round bales on it the spear is what's going to go in the side and grab it. So they're not that expensive and they're well worth the money. Rolling it out there by hand and then tip the round bale feeder up and put the bale in and tip the round bale feeder back down. Not so much fun and I keep my round bales inside because even with the you know the trash bag on them you're going to lose a percentage of the round bale and if you get the marshmallows well that's baleage so that's a whole different story. In an upcoming video I'll talk about animal handling equipment that you have to have. Some of it is universal whether you have cows, sheep, goats, it's all the same. Some of it will be species specific. It took me a while to get cows. I didn't start out with cows. I grew up with cows but you have to understand the infrastructure for cows is a lot more intense and everything has to be more robust for cows so you're going to have a lot of money up front in cows. Start small, work your way up and that's my plug for that for the moment. Start at the end and work our way back. If you have a small let's say a subcompact tractor you know anything less than 30 horsepower so even with ballasting the tires your loader is probably going to pick up a thousand pounds and it's just not enough. So a weight box you can get these pretty cheaply and this one has category O pins on it for whatever reason. Probably why I got it cheap but you can load that up and then with the loaded tires you're good to go. This here is a combination rake tetter. Separate the drive shaft. I peel the drive shafts apart for the winter and that way the telescoping part doesn't get stuck together. These are farmwall fast hitch plows. Rotor tiller, slip clutch, this here is a finish muller. And the gearboxes are covered up so that's the important part. These are all farmwall specific items. Now a greater blade they have the three point hitch models. This one's the fast hitch for a farmwall. If you don't have a lot of snow this right here is a great item to have for for pulling your snow and you want to pull your snow. You don't want to push it because number one like I said you get a sore neck. Number two it floats so when your ground's not frozen yet you'll end up taking all your surface material off your dirt driveway. If you've got a tar driveway it doesn't matter I guess. But you're still gonna have a sore neck. With this right here you can just drive over it with it angled. Push the snow off. Good to go. Some sort of a dump trailer is always handy. This one goes behind the gator but it's a 21 cubic foot. I don't even know if John Deere makes these anymore. But this right here is like one of my favorite tools because I use it for everything. At least one trailer for hauling stuff. This one I've permanently made it a cattle hauler, sheep hauler. Snow plow for the farmwall. Harrows. The land plows are great if you're every few years I take the plows and turn my whole garden upside down. I basically just switching the top layer with the bottom layer. Some people don't recommend it but it really does a great job for just turning all the trash under and then you can put around the harrows after it. More harrows. This is a bigger plow. It actually has the small points on it for the the small tractors but it was designed for a bigger tractor. Field cultivator. Now I have set this thing on the blocks 300 times and every time it's like this I don't know if the cows come down and turn it over because this is the most miserable rotten tool to put on by yourself. You just can't do it. Now bush hog, shredder, rotary mower, brush hog. There's a thousand names for this. Most people just call it a bush hog even though it's not made by a bush hog. There's a whole story about these that I'm not going to get into about how much horsepower or how wide it should be. We'll save that for later but I will recommend a slip clutch over shear pins any day of the week. The caveat is that you have to know how to adjust and set a slip clutch. And then the last thing I've got down here is potato hillers. That goes on the fast hitch of a tractor as well and that just goes behind the tractor and hills potatoes. So let's go back to the tractor shed and underneath the barn and I'll show you a couple more things. Some of the stuff I've got stored up in my brother's barn so I don't have it here. I just put them in this one area for the winter. I don't let them roam the whole place otherwise they'll tear the fields up something terrible. Tool I do have is these manure forks and I run into the same problem I would have with the clamp-on forks is that they will fall off after a while so you just have to be careful with it. But for cleaning out a free stall this is what you want because otherwise with just a bucket you'll roll all your your bedding up into a mound. This actually pierces it and you can scoop it up a lot better. This right here is a trailer mover for the three-point hitch and I've made a couple of um made a couple of what I call improvements. I've got this right here on it with these chains and so I can take a log chain with the three-point hitch hook onto some pretty decent logs. Pick it up with the three-point hitch and twitch out your logs. And then you've got the the reese hitch here with your ball hitch and then down there you can just put a clevis on it or pin hitch or whatever you need to do. Corn planter have a couple of actually four of them. Flail mower, sickle bar mowers, I think I have six operational ones and I've got a bunch of videos on those with with more to come but sickle bar mowers are great for mowing around ponds, ditches, haying obviously. There's a lot of different kinds of mowers for cutting hay and I'm not going to get into it. I just grew up with sickle mowers. I am comfortable with them and I actually I actually like them. That's a whole another subject too. Other things that is invaluable if you grow row crops like corn you don't use pesticides as a set of cultivators. This right here is the old wood trailer that we had as a kid growing up and it's kind of nostalgic for me so I'm just gonna fix it up a little bit next year and use it for what we always did. It was for hauling firewood. My McCormick trailer is a special parade use only. I really don't haul anything in it except hay it's uh all been restored and I really want to keep it in nice shape. A wood splitter if you do wood you really can't live without one of these and a manure spreader this is a 19 probably late 40s early 50s ground drive manure spreader holds 40 bushels and if you have manure you need a way to get rid of it and so that's how I fertilize my fields. It doesn't matter what kind you get but eventually you're gonna need a truck you can get away with an SUV and a trailer for a little while but at some point you'll need a truck whether it's half ton three quarter one ton flat bed dump body it doesn't matter but you need a truck to haul your stuff around and you are hauling serious amounts of hay and equipment you really need a trailer. You get a gooseneck this one's just a bumper tow so they call it but it's an 18 foot long trailer with ramps and I can haul anything I need to haul on it. So your farm implements may be different than what I have for example if you're just doing vegetables you don't need hay making equipment or animal handling equipment. There's a couple implements I would never buy used. One of them is a brush hog unless it's had almost no use. Brush hogs, push hogs, rotary cutters, shredders, whatever you want to call it, they take a beating and the gearbox, the frame, the chassis, all of it, stove up, you don't want to buy that junk. Buy yourself a good either good used one or a new one. Same thing goes with a rototiller. You can buy a used one just keep an eye open there's a lot of wear points on it but rototillers take a beating too.
