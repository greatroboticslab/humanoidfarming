 This is the biggest mistake when you cut and propagate any houseplant. If you're slicing and dicing your plants and plopping them in water, you're creating an open wound in the plant stem, and so begins a dangerous voyage towards its destined doom of death. If you place a cutting directly in water, there is a high loss of the wound is prone to bacteria in the water, and you will see it turn mushy, rot, and it's chow for now. A simple trick to follow is to let the wound heal for around 24 to 48 hours. This creates a callus on the plant, which prevents the wound from disease.
