Howto & Style
 If you're itching to get back in the garden, now is a great time to start some cool season crops indoors so you're ready to transplant mid-March. To get started, you'll need seeds from a few of your favorite cool season crops like radish, spinach, or beets. Now set the stage for optimal germination. Place your starter pods in the tray and soak it. Drain off any excess water and place a seed into each pod. Cover them with a dome to maintain humidity of 90-95%. You'll want to keep the temperatures of your grow media around 70-80 degrees. Seeds struggle to germinate if the temperatures are too cold, so place a heat mat underneath if necessary. You'll need light, but you don't need to go overboard on expensive fixtures. Most seedlings prefer a light that's blue in spectrum at a low intensity. A simple T5 fixture running at 12 or more hours a day will do just fine. In about 7-10 days, you should see sprouts emerge. Vent or remove the dome. Continue to water the seedlings until it's time to transplant in your garden. You're ready to go.
