 Nowadays, we all feel it. The need to make it perform better. Last longer. To squeeze all the value you can out of your current equipment. Well, there's some good news. It's called the Precision Essentials Package. It's a precision upgrade that bundles three fundamental pieces of hardware into one package with a lower upfront cost. Everything you need to connect your machines, stream your data, and access more advanced precision ag technology. It's an easy way to get more out of your older machines, even if they're not John Deere Green. And it opens the path to more advanced tools that can help you pull more value and productivity out of your current fleet. It starts with a G5 Series display. Whether you choose the 10.1-inch G5 or the 12.8-inch G5 Plus, you're getting a display that will let you see deep into every machine, every field, every operation. Your G5 display not only lets you see more, it lets you do more, too. It's your gateway into advanced technology you can customize according to your current needs. Precision farming also depends on accuracy. That's why we've included a Starfire receiver, SF-RTK accuracy within 2.5 centimeters, 73% faster pull-in times, and long-term repeatability to minimize guidance line, coverage, and boundary drift, season after season. Finally, you're going to need a JDLink modem. A JDLink modem connects you to your entire operation, including your machines, your fields, and your operators. With JDLink, your machine and field data stream automatically to John Deere Operations Center, where you can monitor machine location and performance, send work plans, and analyze results. Once you have the hardware, it's time to add precision technology that can open up advanced guidance and automation tools. Choose from four renewable licenses, each one designed to give you the exact technology you need at the time that's right for your operation. Maybe you're a full-time rancher looking to reduce skips and overlaps, or a specialty crop brower needing more precise applications, or a row crop operator needing to make every pass count. Precision Essentials is an easy way to add more productivity, more value, to the equipment you already have, no matter the color. Technology that's affordable, accessible, adaptable. That's Precision Essentials. That's John Deere.
