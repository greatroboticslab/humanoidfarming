And with the continent spending more than 40 billion US dollars annually on food imports, if there is no intervention, net import levels will likely increase to over 100 billion US dollars by 2025. This means that Africa as a continent will contribute to the creation of more jobs and business opportunities outside than inside the continent. The Department of Rural Economy and Agriculture leads the African Union's efforts to promote agricultural development and sustainable environmental management, as well as support the implementation of initiatives across the continent that focus on sustainable agriculture programs under Agenda 2063. Through its three departmental divisions, the Agriculture and Food Security Division, the Environment, Climate Change, Water and Land Management Division, and the Rural Economy Division. The Department is working to ensure Africa achieves the Agenda 2063 aspiration for a prosperous Africa based on inclusive growth and sustainable development, by driving programs that promote investment in modern agriculture for increased productivity and production, exploiting the vast potential of Africa's Blue Ocean economy, as well as addressing climate change issues and other environmental factors. that pose a great risk to the agricultural sector. Agriculture is the backbone of Africa. Agriculture is the backbone of the African economy. And I would say it's the backbone of the social economy of Africa, because we need to feed our citizens. We need to feed our people. And this is a sector that we can, you know, solve the issue of malnutrition on the continent. And we also can solve the problem of unemployment and poverty. So it has a very huge potential if you invest properly in this sector. The Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program, CADEP, is an Agenda 2063 continental initiative that aims to help African countries eliminate hunger and reduce poverty by raising economic growth through agriculture-led development. Through CADEP, African governments agreed to allocate at least 10% of annual budgets to agriculture and rural development, and to achieve agricultural growth rates of at least 6% per annum. Underlying these investment commitments are targets for reducing poverty and malnutrition, increasing productivity and farm incomes, and improving the sustainability of agricultural production and use of natural resources. CADEP also supports countries to enhance resilience to climate variability through development of disaster preparedness policies and strategies, and early warning response systems and social safety nets. CADEP has four priority areas, namely, extending the area under sustainable land management and reliable water control systems. improving rural infrastructure and trade-related capacities for market access. Increasing food supply, reducing hunger, and improving responses to food emergency crises. Improving agriculture research, technology dissemination, and adoption. What we want is really to align the national investment plan of our member country, to align it with the seven commitments of CADEP. Because this is our common agricultural agenda for the transformation, which is like a serious commitment with the integration through the Maputo declaration. The 10% allocate investing in agriculture, allocating 10% and mobilizing private sector investment in the sector. The third one, it is ending hunger by 2025, because we have the flagship program. We also have a 10 years action plan. And it is under this 10 years action plan that we evaluate our member states in terms of all these commitments. So we have ending hunger by 2025. And when you look at our report, you know, many countries are not on track in terms of their food security. So we need to really, you know, we really need to, you know, work with our member countries. They should align their national investment program with the CADEP principle. And then they will have good results. The Great Green Wall Initiative aims to implement actions to end or reverse land degradation, desertification, loss of biodiversity in African dry lands, and to ensure that ecosystems are resilient to climate change, continue to provide essential services, and contribute to human well-being and the elimination of poverty and hunger. The initiative comprises 21 African countries and aims to support over 425 million Africans living in the dry lands to embrace sustainable land management practices that protect the environment and fight against hunger and poverty. This initiative is important as the cost of inaction leads to forced migration and conflict, reduction of crop yields, unemployment, poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. The key objective of that program is to fight against land degradation, desertification. And in the process of managing that diverse natural resource, we create jobs for women, we create jobs for youth, but more importantly, we manage and control the spread of land.
