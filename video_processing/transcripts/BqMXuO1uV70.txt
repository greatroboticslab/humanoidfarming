 Once the bowls have burst open, the farmers know that their cotton fields are ready for harvest. In Xinjiang, China, it usually takes eight workers over two months to complete the job of manually picking cotton on a 64-hectare plot of land. But with cotton-picking machines, the task is completed in less than a week. Raw cotton arrives at the factory in densely packed bales. The first step is ginning. The harvested cotton bowls are taken to a cotton gin, where the seeds are separated from the fiber. This process leaves us with clean, fluffy cotton lint. It will take a couple more steps to arrive at this point. A beautiful cotton fabric. The fabric undergoes various finishing processes, such as bleaching, dyeing, and printing, to enhance its appearance and texture. The finished product is then packed and ready to be shipped to other manufacturing facilities.
