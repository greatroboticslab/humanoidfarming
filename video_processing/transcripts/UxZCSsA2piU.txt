 When you put a seed in the ground or dig a hole to put a small plant in, you're just trusting that the plant knows what to do and how to grow roots. Doesn't always work out for you though, does it? Plant roots will grow to the path of least resistance. There's a hard, compacted area in the soil, they'll try to grow along it or around it. If the water table is high, like on a wet year or in land close to a river, lake, or stream, the water table in the soil will actually stop plant roots from growing deeper as there's no oxygen for the roots. Some think roots grow towards fertilizer or plant nutrients. They honestly don't know where those nutrients are, but when roots do find them, they certainly expand in those areas. Root expansion also occurs in the presence of beneficial soil microbes that work with the roots to bring food in.
