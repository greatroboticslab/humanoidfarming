 Why do Chinese people blow smoke into the ground? When it comes to farming, the Chinese are incredibly resourceful. When crops are overrun with rats, they use machines to generate chemical smoke. They direct this smoke into rat holes, forcing the rats to come out. A net is then placed over the area to capture them. Since rats can be sold for a high price in Chinese markets, this method not only protects the crops, but also turns the problem into a profitable opportunity.
