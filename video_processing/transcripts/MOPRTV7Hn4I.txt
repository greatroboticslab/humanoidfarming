 It's a regular day at a grocery store in the city of Davis. People are picking up their favorite fruits and vegetables. Many of these foods, however, didn't used to look like the way they do now. Years of selective breeding have changed the way many modern foods look. To see what I mean, let's check out a TED Talk by Dr. Pamela Ronald in 2015. Now, genetic modification is not new. Virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified in some manner. On the left is an image of the ancient ancestor of modern corn. Now take a look at the ancient ancestor of banana. And unappetizing brussels sprouts. An eggplant. So beautiful. Historically, plants like the ones Dr. Ronald talked about have been genetically altered by a practice called selective breeding. This involves choosing a distinguishable trait in a fully grown plant to actively select for. Take height for instance. In this example, the tallest two trees are selected for breeding. This creates offspring that are overall taller than the previous generation.
