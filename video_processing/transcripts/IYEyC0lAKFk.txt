 Humpty Dumpty Come on Humpty, let's all spin Humpty Dumpty jumped on a bale He slipped a bit but did not fail The ducks all laughed, the good cake gave a cheer You're the best egg farmer of the year He planted corn and carrots too Watered them daily just like new With sunshine bright and skies so blue Humpty made the veggies grow true All the farm friends gave a clap Then took a cozy midday nap Humpty smiled with joy and pride I love this farm life far and wide He planted corn and carrots too He planted corn and carrots too Watered them daily just like new With sunshine bright and snow With sunshine bright and skies so blue Humpty made the veggies grow true All the farm friends gave a clap Then took a cozy midday nap Humpty smiled with joy and pride I love this farm life far and wide And wide
