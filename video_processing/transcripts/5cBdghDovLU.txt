Education
 Oregon. No other place matches the density of its diverse agricultural, environmental, and social landscape. As the founding college of Oregon State University for more than 150 years, we have lived out our land-grant mission to serve this state and its people through our research, our teaching, and our outreach. We are scientists. Our tenacious pursuit of the highest form of scientific discovery is collaborative, challenging, and inspiring. Our work results in discoveries that save industries, create new jobs, improve production to feed more people, while reducing our impact on climate and the environment. We are educators committed to the most advanced understanding of both traditional and experiential learning. We aim to open minds and help students pursue their potential. Because revelations are born in discovery and the student's mind is constantly discovering. We are students filled with ambition and fear and possibility. We show up to learn about agriculture and natural resources, as well as ourselves to be a part of something bigger, to be a part of something bigger. We are out there across the state in all 36 counties, all 50 states, and around the world. We stand at the confluence of conservation and production. We are on the coast, working with communities, industry, and public agencies to improve efforts in marine conservation, and gain more access to growing food systems. We are in the city, creating jobs, salaries, and revenue. We are invested in improving market access, enhancing the health of our communities, and creating opportunities for businesses to innovate new products and services. We are in the valley, in the deserts, and in the fields, working with farmers and ranchers to enhance our agricultural competitiveness and make Oregon resilient to inevitable change. We are everywhere. Getting our boots dirty and our gear wet as we aim to develop understanding and sustainability of working in natural landscapes, as well as our coastal ecosystems. In all who we represent, in all the places we show up, we embrace the tension that sparks understanding and creativity. We bring diverse voices to the table and learn from those perspectives. We celebrate our differences. We celebrate our differences. Find common ground and create the bridge. Create the bridge that makes tomorrow better. The bridge that makes tomorrow better. Each of us is part of that vision, here in Oregon and around the world, so that everyone can say, We are the College of Agricultural Sciences at Oregon State University. Let's make tomorrow better.
