 Just a quick update from Sleepy Grove Farms. I wanted to show you some of the tools I've been using to maximize space. These five gallon landscape pots from Amazon have been awesome. I've got my potatoes in them, I've got several tomatoes in them, I've got my pepper as you can see right in there, oh and just for good measure here is Cinderella pumpkins and an artichoke. Hope you guys all have a great weekend!
