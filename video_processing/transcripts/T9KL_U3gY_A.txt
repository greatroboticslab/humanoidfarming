 My name is Tim Downs, an organic farmer from Shropshire, dairy, farm and beef and arable. We're milking 180 dairy cows today with the intention of increasing numbers over the next couple of years. Our milk is sold through the Organic Milk Suppliers Cooperative based in Somerset. We have numerous infield trees and hedgerow trees and also small areas of woodland on farm. We're stood in broad-leaved woodland here which is a mixture of oak and beech and some ash which is a little concern at the moment and some coniferous woodland as well. There's certainly an advantage having trees on farm in terms of shelter, in terms of maintaining wetland areas and drying them out. So utilising their potential to drain fields. And we're also looking at them for browsing benefit for herbs. We're going with the Woodland Trust backing to plant an area of the farm for browsing animals. And this is with a view to improve the animal health. Planting trees such as willow which has been shown to have aspirin properties. And other plants such as cherry, sweet chestnut, all native varieties for animal health purposes. The plants can be pollarded and harvested in the same way as a hedge brushing. And the animals will have access to more feed value that's been brought up from a deeper soil profile. So the minerals will be better for the animals. A so-called riparian planting. We've planted against watercourses to prevent leaching. Any nutrients that we put on the field we want to stay in the field. So they're very beneficial there. And they also maintain the banks of the streams and brooks and rivers on the farm as well. We've done a lot of work planting alongside waterways. Keeping animals away from water. Because the mineral that we put through the water system. We don't want them drinking from other watercourses. That could harbour diseases in particular. That we as an organic farm would find it harder to deal with. Any field corners we felt were unmanageable for machinery. We've planted up with cherry and oak and various different species. And that's worked exceedingly well. That was about 20 years ago now. And they really are maturing nicely. We do an awful lot of hedgerow maintenance. Last winter we were doing hedge laying. And just under 2 kilometres of hedge laying. And we planted just under a kilometre of new hedge as well. Part of the hedgerow removal of trees and such like is put through our biomass boiler. We've had a log boiler that heats the house for many years. But that's always had a backup of oil. It's only in the last 5 years that we've turned completely to heating the farmhouse, the farm office and the flat by timber alone. And that's been very successful. All the timber comes off the farm. Be that through hedge laying and clearing of fallen trees and also clearing of small areas of woodland. We're certainly replacing, I calculated 5 years ago, £2,000 worth of heating oil a year. That will have increased obviously recently. So in that time the money that we would have spent on oil has been able to cover the cost of the installation of our biomass system in the farmhouse. We'll have a big impact on our carbon footprint. We've concentrated more on renewable energy systems. And this is just the whole part of that and reducing our carbon footprint on the farm. You're farming a different part of the farm that you wouldn't have access to otherwise. So it has to be profitable and we're looking at it from a profit making angle.
