 This farm I think has been in the family since 1903. A lot of people think that like the 90 million acres that we grew last year nationwide that's all human food but only 1% of it actually goes directly into the human food supply. Most of it gets sold to either feeders or ethanol plants. If we didn't have ethanol right now, just imagine, if you didn't have that right now and you had all the new varieties of corn over the last 20 years that have come on board and the yields have gone steadily steadily steadily up, you'd have had a constant farm crisis. It would have been an ongoing farm crisis without ethanol because all of that supply would have been sitting either in farmer owned storage or in commercial storage. And it would have been a mess but ethanol was our real savior. We probably have been so low that nobody wants to grow it. And it's probably going to be the lowest plantings, even lower than last year. So, last year was a record. The climate projections are for drier during the summer. So, the extreme heat and warmer temperatures combined with less precipitation is certainly a concern for the growing season. The predictions are also for wetter during the winter and spring. And we had a wet winter and spring this year in 2019. And unfortunately, a product of that was the significant flood that we had. In Nebraska, adapting to drought is never a bad thing to do. Probably adapting to too much rain would be a bigger problem. But, because we'd have to have a different mindset, I guess. Last year was a terrible year for planting because it was so wet. And it was also hard to get trucks up and down this road when it's really muddy. We started getting rain clear back in August of 2018. And we had a hard time getting the crop out. Then we had a hard time getting the crop in. And we're just harvesting as fast as we can because we're afraid it'll start up again. And we saw what happened in North Dakota and South Dakota with all the snow and rain on top of snow. And we've got to go full bore because you never know what will change. Farmers across America, just like Gaye Lush, are producing corn, filling truckloads just like this. Day in and day out, in late October, farmers are moving over 90 million acres of corn annually. Out of those anchors, roughly 30 is devoted to feed, 30 to ethanol, and 30 to industrial uses, such as corn syrup production, human food, and another variety of uses. Because such a high volume of corn is devoted to industrial uses, it is important that farmers, as stewards of the soil, conserve as many resources as possible. And here are some methods farmers are utilizing in order to conserve resources, as well as their place in a consumer-driven market. The new practices that people are using help out a lot, like the cover crops, like during the winter, that would have held a lot of water and soil. And it keeps it from going down into the dam or down the river. It keeps the soil on your ground. And so, I like that. And we try to get them in, but last year, when we need them the most, it was hard to get that stuff all done, because you had a hard time just getting the basics done, getting the crop harvested. But we got a few acres done. And we noticed where the cover crop was, that the corn was doing a little better on. We put the cover crop on the really steep ground in the hills, and that ground was actually making a little more than the better land up on top. So, we might just try that practice on everything, if we can get it done. We might just try that practice. This is 80 acres, and you see, he ran last night until, I don't know what time he broke down, but probably ten o'clock. We usually run on late at night, but especially when you have a good going. Good going. Former Nebraska Senator Roger Werbean, along with his siblings, owns a 2,800-acre plot of land near Plattsmith, Nebraska, where his farming operation grows corn and soybeans. You get bigger equipment, then you've got to have more land. Then you get more land, it's hard to keep it even. Then you get more land, then you've got to have bigger equipment. Now, if you can't find higher to hell, that's not been an issue with us. His family has owned the land since 1873, and the farming operation began with his father in 1936. We're being quite rapidly urbanized. And you really, even if we're at the point now, you couldn't really have a large livestock operation in this area. So I don't, I can't, I quit trying to predict the future. The Werbains practice sustainability methods in their farming, utilizing things like no-till, which is the growing of crops without disturbing the soil through mechanical agitation, and the planting of cover crops to protect the soil. Though they've maintained these practices for years, there are still things that cause concern for the former senator. This is very high-quality farmland up along the river here from Falls City north to Blair, or actually Sioux City. So we're going to be losing that, you know, over time and depending more and more on irrigation. And when we have a fight over water, urban cities are going to win. As the climate varies over time, and then you have these major drought episodes, for example, the 2012 drought caused a depletion of the groundwater in Nebraska from anywhere, the water table dropped anywhere from 5 to 20 feet. It took several years for that to return to pre-drought levels. 2012 was just a brutal year. It was the hottest on record here, and I had to hose the cows off every day. They were overheating, and we had heat stroke in the cattle. I'll never forget it. The Dust Bowl was unique in a number of ways because you had, you know, the plowing up the Great Plains, you know, the taking removal of the grassland and so on, with very little in the way of soil conservation practices and so on. That's one of my mantras is having cover crops. We just finished planting a bunch on this section. It's getting late. It's hard when you get so much rain. It's hard to get it all planted. But relatively speaking, we're not into it too heavy, but it's one of the things you do to try to keep cover on your ground year-round. You know, one of the reasons I think we need to worry about good soil health is water quality. We need to have good water quality and plenty of it long-term. One of the things I'm concerned about, Lincoln east of the Missouri River, is primarily rain-fed ground. It's not irrigated like it is west. The Republican River Valley is probably the most progressive part of the state as far as taking care of our water. Just about everybody's got pivots. Everybody's got meters on their pivots. They know exactly to the inch how much water they use during the year. And a lot of these areas have enough water. We keep going on for 200 or 300 years or forever because we also have recharges. On average, about 20% of all rainfall that falls on the sandhill ends up as recharge. And typically that occurs in the late and mid-spring months. So sort of the March to May months is when the bulk of that recharge goes to the aquifer. The porousness as well as the ability of water to move through that type of material is the key. Also, the sand, it can only support basically the low prairie grasses. And so the demand for water of those is not as high as, say, crops. And so more of that water has a chance to move through the root system and make it to the water table. Whereas in other regions, that water is going to be taken up by the actual plants and kick back to the atmosphere. So in the sandhills, you're looking at about, you know, five to ten years before, you know, a drop of rain on average is going to hit the surface and then actually make it to the water table because it takes that long for it to sort of move through that wave of water through the system. So, you know, if we have good stewardship of the landscape, is that it's going to take a few years for those things to end up showing up in the water table. And so an event like the 2012 drought is that has to propagate through the actual soil profile. So you're going to wet out, or excuse me, you're going to dry down that actual unsaturated zone. You're going to end up with less recharge until sort of you have more, you know, wetter years to build back up that sort of wetness in the actual soil. Drought management is an important aspect of that because drought is a recurring phenomena. Yeah, but under climate change, droughts are becoming more frequent, more severe, longer duration for many regions of the world. Well, there's been attempts in the past at least four, maybe five years, to look at a statewide climate action plan, which is really what's needed in terms of both adaptation to the changes that will come as well as mitigation of future climate change. And that's been unsuccessful in passing. I think that's something that's critical, that absolutely needs to happen. Other states are assessing what sort of impact climate change will have to the different sectors, and they're actively working toward adaptation measures as well as mitigation. So I think that for Nebraska, and given that we're a heavily agricultural state, I think that's something that we need to look at, passing legislation. In Nebraska, I think we've kind of stalled out, you know, in terms of the impact of the 2000 drought mitigation plan that we put together for the state of Nebraska, working with stakeholders. I think there really hasn't been much advancement in that. Farmers obviously continue to adapt to a changing climate, to longer growing seasons, et cetera. Well, long term, I don't know whether a longer growing season, I'm not so sure is so bad. But long term, we're going to be supposedly more like Wichita weather, which would be more humid and more heat days, and maybe more, maybe less rainfall, we're not sure. Some of the things I see will have less rainfall. Others say that we're going to have the same amount of rainfall or maybe more, but we're going to have extreme events. So from my viewpoint, one of the big things on changing climate is we're going to have more extreme events. But globally, there's a lot of progress being made on drought management and drought policies, drought policies that are aimed at risk reduction. I think that's increasingly going to be an issue for producers. The excessively wet conditions that has persisted for much of Nebraska, I think that's prompting people to ask, is this a sign of the future? Is this something that's going to keep happening? Historically, we have seen a trend toward wetter springs, and that's only going to continue. It may be warm enough. The growing season may be quite a bit longer. But the ability to get into the field with heavy equipment is going to be even more of a challenge in the future. In Nebraska, we've warmed overall. For annual average temperature, we've gotten warmer, and that rate of warming is accelerating. And that's something that we can expect in the future, is that rate of warming is only going to increase. By the middle of the century, we could see five-degree warming for an annual average. That means more extreme warm days, like days above 95, days when the nighttime temperatures don't go below 70 or 75 degrees. That's going to probably double compared to what it is now. 65, 75 percent of the fresh water use is used by agriculture. And so relatively small savings of 10 percent, 15 percent or more in agriculture releases a lot more water for use in urban environments. And most people live in cities now, not just in Nebraska, but throughout the world. And the percentage of population that live in large cities is growing tremendously. And so agriculture needs to become much more efficient in water use. And certainly irrigation in Nebraska has become much more water use efficient over the last several decades. We've gotten some reports of, you know, hunters or other people out there saying, you know, certain, you know, lakes out in the sandhills are the fullest they've ever seen them, you know, in the fall period. And so we're still trying to, you know, remove some of that water from the system. As with these elevated water tables, you know, your surface-fed lakes are going to be larger and more sustained over the year. Or if you're, you know, in crop production, is you might have, you know, an impact. Is you have, you know, saturated parts of your field that are going to have lower yield because of that high water table? This year we had so much rain that the ground was already filled up with water. And so it didn't have as good, have as great an effect of mitigating that excess water as it would have in the past. We have had these floods that really affected Nebraska. And so it's important to be able to, to think about it, to respond, to see if, are our levees appropriately built? Are our bridges? We now know, and that's what we've been seeing when we've gone around the state, is that there are levees that are not rebuilt appropriately. There are bridges that have not been fully rebuilt. So we are going to have significant damages in the spring, I believe, if we have any kind of winter similar to last year's winter. It's better to be prepared than to look back and say, why didn't I do something? It's very clear that we're not out of the woods yet. Right now the governor is working with two other governors on the whole Missouri River basin and the flooding that happened there. But we decided as a committee of the legislature to focus inward and look at what's happening to the people in Nebraska in regards to their lives, their homes, their livestock. And the devastation that has occurred is beyond relief. There's a lot of place for smaller farmers, especially close to urban centers for organic and community food-based operations. And there is that opportunity to be able to identify where their food is coming from. That's the kind of farm policy where you really should be focusing on to make sure there's a place for all of them. There's just a real set way what a farmer is and what farming is. And it has to do with anonymous commodities. You grow corn and beans and you dump them at the local co-op and then maybe they go to Asia or Brazil or I don't know, you know, somewhere. Doug Dittman is a former farmer turned restaurateur. His farm-to-table business is an important part of keeping Nebraska sustainable by promoting smaller farms. Everything, you know, everything is like that. As an organic farmer, you really get a sense of that. And in some ways, you get a sense of being responsible for that. If you broaden the equations, water quality, air quality, human health, you know, it's essential. And as food's about the most intimate thing that we do, you know, I mean, is eating. It's just like any relationship. You know, you like to work with people you know and like. And that's the same will become true of food, you know. So really the whole thing is based on relationships. And that's hard, you know, that farmers are already so busy to get out and make those connections. But the thing is, farmers can grow anything. I mean, anything you want, they can grow it. And it's just a matter of the whole thing ultimately is consumer driven. And I think as a farmer, you know, season after season, year after year after year on the land, you begin to see into it. And it becomes clear what you need to do. And then it's just a matter of doing it. If we do have a drought, we've got the aquifer buildup pretty good. But normally you don't have that. It's dry weather that you've got to worry about. We're getting pretty good at managing dry weather. I don't know if we can manage a 1930s style drought. We'll find out. But I'm trying to think ahead and be proactive because I know these things are going to happen from time to time. And the data looks like we're going to have a lot more 2012s. So that had a lasting effect on me. And from that year on, I began doing everything I could at the farm to whatever I could do to mitigate that kind of extreme. And that's where I really stepped up the oak savannah. You have to somehow, we've got to make this place a little cooler and wetter. And we can only do what we can do, each of us. So that's my big concern, that we leave this better than we found it, even if it may or may not be farmed in the future. I mean, some will say, what do you care because it won't be farmed? I think that's too short-sighted at this point. It's kind of like they say about the chaos theory. You do one little thing and it just spreads out and causes problems all around the world. And a couple of tweets have caused a lot of trouble for us. And the only thing that'll save us is probably a big drought in the Great Plains, which is not a thing you want to wish upon yourself. But we'll see. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
