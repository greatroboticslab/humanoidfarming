 Jim, thanks. If only today's weather could have been around in the norm in the early planting season. News Channel 9's Victoria Kellogg shows us why some farmers are still playing catch up with a summer favorite from their fields. The fireworks are ready to pop, but central New York's corn, not so much. Farms around the state, like Abbott's Farms in Baldonsville, are short on height and behind on time. Not exactly the sweetest start. It's been one of the wettest springs. You know, that I can remember. Normally we want to have our corn in the first week of May, and this year we planted this the first week of June. Not only was it cloudy and misty throughout the spring, smoke from the Canadian wildfires added an extra layer of haze, blocking even more sun when it was needed the most. You need sunlight to make sugar. That's the basic building block of life. You know, everything comes from that photosynthetic process and that the green plants are doing. Now they say for corn knee high by 4th of July, but take a look at this. It is kind of towards my knee, but the farmers here tell me that it should be at my shorts. And the Abbott's Farm says that they hope this heat helps this crop catch up. The heat has kicked things into gear, but definitely what helps is sunlight. But Warren is used to playing the hand Mother Nature gives him. Don't look too much to that. Look more to how am I going to adapt to what's going on. I might have to buy corn from somebody else. I might have to buy from New Jersey to get through this year to get to next year because the next year will be different. Not knee high by this 4th, but it's not too late for this season's corn to have a strong finish. In Baldinsville, Victoria Kellogg, News Channel 9. And although it may not be knee high yet, don't count sweet corn out this season. Farmers say their crops will be ready for your table by mid-July.
