Howto & Style
 A lot of different carbons can be used. I mean, I ran into a guy in Ontario that had a dairy, and of course, Ontario has long winters, but he didn't have any trees on his farm, so he wasn't able to get wood chips, which is our carbon of choice here. We got a lot of trees, so we use wood chips, but he didn't have any, so he actually grew a couple of acres of long-stemmed rye every year, and I mean, this stuff will grow, you know, eight feet tall. He let the rye get almost to shatter stage, you know, where it was almost, would shatter out of the seed head. Then he'd bale all this, and that's what he used for carbon, and the beauty was that the seeds to entice the pigs for piggerating was already embedded in it because he was using the rye, and he was happy. It worked really well.
