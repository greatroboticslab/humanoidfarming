 The Liberty Falls Easter Egg has just been beaten in 13 minutes. And here's how you can do the same thing. So there are various skips that you can use in the Easter Egg run to make it much faster. One of them is a canister duplication glitch so you don't need to do the second half of the LTG steps. Another is this really smart little skip that you can use using Aether Shroud to get over this pile of cars. You can also spawn a double points in at the very start of your game, just like B-Dog, the world record holder, is doing here. And you can use those double points to kill all the motel zombies at the start of your game so that you can move out of the spawn area even faster. And you can also use Aether Ella in the boss fight to insta-kill the boss. And if this looks like something you want to try, I've got a full guide for this on my YouTube that you can click through to now.
