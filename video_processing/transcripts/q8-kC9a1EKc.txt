Howto & Style
 Here is a practical way to make organic liquid fertilizer at home at a minimal cost. You will need a 5-gallon bucket and a plant container that fits inside a 5-gallon bucket. Make sure that the container has holes for easy drainage. Fill the container with biodegradable kitchen scraps, preferably fruits and vegetable scraps. Do not include meat scraps because it doesn't ferment the way plant-based scraps do. Fill the container with water to cover the kitchen scraps. Add more kitchen scraps as necessary to fill the bucket. Cover the bucket with a fitting lid. No need to cover it really tight. Let it sit and ferment for 2-3 days or if you want for the liquid to be more potent, wait for 5 days before you drain it out. But make sure to check the content once in a while to be sure that it doesn't have any strong unpleasant smell or maggots' infestation. Drain the liquid out by lifting the container with scraps.
