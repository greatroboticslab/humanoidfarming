 Did you know you can actually have workers deliver product from one property to another? In this particular sample, I will show you my botanist in the sweatshop. He does what he does best, grows that good green, and then once it's ready, he delivers it directly from the sweatshop to my bungalow. And that's right, he actually walks there too. To set this up, grab your clipboard and put your destination to a large storage rack in any other property. This might slow down his production a little bit due to all the walking, but it opens up a lot of possibilities and workflows across your multiple properties.
