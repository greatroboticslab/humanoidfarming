Howto & Style
 Here's how to grow perfect cucumbers from seed to harvest. I'm growing the Gershwin Pickling Cucumber, which is a high yielding option. First, wait until the soil is warm, at least 65 degrees Fahrenheit, before planting your seeds. Then plant cucumber seeds about one inch deep in potting soil in small pots and keep them moist until sprouting. While you wait for the seeds to sprout, amend your garden soil with nitrogen rich fertilizer to make sure it's fertile. After the seedlings sprout, let them grow in full sun for about two weeks until they look something like this. Then find a sunny spot in the garden near a trellis and transplant the seedlings at the same depth they were at in their pots. As the plants grow, train them to climb straight upwards by tying them to your trellis every foot or so. This keeps the plants out of the soil and helps prevent disease. Soon you'll see yellow flowers forming, which insects will help pollinate. Female flowers will have a little baby cucumber attached to the end. And from here, it's just a matter of time to allow the cucumbers to grow. Check the plants regularly, and about 60 days after planting seeds, you can start harvesting your first cucumbers. Make sure to harvest regularly to keep the plants active and productive, and follow us to get more cucumber and other gardening tips.
