 And when it comes to the drought, we can all see the impact of these wildfires, but some of the most impacted people are the people we rely on every day to eat our farmers and ranchers. The lack of rain has depleted the soil of its moisture, so grass isn't growing. And as a result, ranchers are struggling to feed their cattle. Our Krista Spattaccini spoke with local rancher Janie Van Winkle about the financial implications and the emotional toll ag workers are enduring. I'm scared at all. And I will tell you the answer is absolutely yes. I woke up about 4.30, a quarter till 5, and I had the window open in the bedroom and I could hear rain. And it was really interesting because at first I thought, I'm dreaming that it's raining. And, you know, I keep telling everyone if it would just rain, life would be so much better. And as a livestock producer, when you're in a drought, you have two choices. You either buy hay to feed the cattle or the sheep or you sell cattle or sheep. I don't think any of us are going to squeak by this time without selling cows because typically what we're seeing is somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of our normal hay crop. So it will be in the tens of thousands of dollars to buy hay because the challenge is there is no water. If you look at the Colorado River, it's significantly depleted. It's running much lower than it normally would this time of year. And so drought is it definitely takes an emotional toll and a mental toll on on all of us. And is there some grand solution? Probably not. But it impacts our our our world. It it absolutely is a huge impact on on our family. We've had some conversation about what does what what does this mean for us in western Colorado as a family? We've talked about doing do we relocate? And at the end of the day is we're sitting around the dinner table about 1030 at night. The conversation comes back to this is what we signed on for. We know there's tough times. We'll get through it. That was Chris Espaticini reporting.
