 Subsistence farming is a timeless practice where small-scale farmers use intensive techniques to achieve self-sufficiency. In this guide, we'll explore how these methods support sustainable and resilient agricultural systems for communities. Subsistence farming focuses on meeting the needs of the household. Using sustainable practices like crop rotation and natural fertilizers, farmers maximize productivity on small plots while preserving soil health and minimizing environmental impact. Subsistence farming is more than food production. It's a way of life. Rooted in cultural traditions, this practice passes down ancestral knowledge, fostering self-reliance and resilience within the community while promoting food security. Techniques like polyculture, soil conservation, and agroforestry enhance crop diversity and protect soil health. These methods allow farmers to cultivate resilient, sustainable systems, ensuring long-term productivity and environmental harmony. By integrating climate adaptability and sustainable methods, subsistence farmers create resilient food systems that are adaptable to local conditions. This ensures food security and community self-sufficiency, even in challenging environments.
