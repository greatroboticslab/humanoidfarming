 What's up YouTube, it's your boy AP and today we're diving into a harvest strat that pulls in an average of 2 divines per map with only about half a divine cost to run. This is crop rotation powered by the Horan Scarab of Awakening and it is absolutely cracked. First off, what do you need to make this work? If you're not running 8 mod corrupted maps you're leaving a ton of value on the table. We want 8 mod maps because the only two things that scale this strat are quantity and pack size and 8 mods give us the highest values possible for both. To scale even further we'll be using Eater World Alters and we'll buff their impact with specific scarabs to stack as much extra quant as we can. But here's the key, to get those juicy quant alters rolls consistently you'll need to run this strat on Jungle Valley. Why? Because Jungle Valley blocks all boss outcomes from appearing on alters which makes the quantity rolls significantly more frequent. Now if you haven't already watched my farming video from two days back, check the pinned comment below because that strategy is entirely based on how to farm your own 8 mod Jungle Valley maps efficiently alongside of farming a few T17 maps in the process. And honestly it's crucial for making this strategy pop off. I personally keep the other tree on my atlas permanently because most of my strats revolve around using these busted 8 mod maps or T17 maps anyways. Alright let's head in game where I'll show you guys the scarabs I'm using, the map device craft, and then we'll walk through the atlas passage tree as well as how to run the strat. To run this strategy we need 8 mod Corrupted Jungle Valleys. Now I just happen to have a dump tab full of these from the video guide a couple days ago. Again find that in the pinned comment below. So I'm going to use a regex to make sure I can actually run these maps and then we're going to grab some with 20% delirious because those are a little bit easier than say 60%. So now we have a bunch of maps we can run. As for the scarabs, the horn scarab awakening is the centerpiece of the strategy and it is the most expensive part as well. It costs around half a divine here. And what this does is it gives us these imbued crafting options and imbued harvest is overpowered. It gives us a 50% chance for the unchosen crop not to wilt and the more crops that don't wilt when you're doing crop rotation it will drastically increase the rewards. Also harvest of doubling simply duplicates all the rewards so that is a no-brainer it's pretty cheap. The rest of the scarabs are entirely focused on eater of worlds. The way eater of worlds alters work are when you kill a pack of these eater influence monsters they have a chance to spawn the altar based on how many of them you kill in close proximity. So by using influence scarab of hordes we increase their pack size by 40% making us spawn a lot more alters. And then the scarab of monstrous lineage also gives us a lot of increased pack size since these are oftentimes magic monsters. So these three together will will generate more eater of worlds alters and thus we'll have more quantity for our harvest. So yeah you would open the map with the imbued harvest with your harvest tree and as you're clearing through the map you want to full clear and come back to the harvest because as i said you want to get as much quantity from these altars before you run the harvest so that's how you're going to be approaching these maps. And as for the atlas tree um well you can just copy this but the thing that i want to touch on is specifically crop rotation. crop rotation so the way crop rotation works is your harvest plots are going to start off incredibly bad they're just the worst tier one plants ever and then when you clear say a blue plot all the other blue plots are still going to be just as bad but every single yellow and purple plot is going to get upgraded which is why this synergizes so well with the imbued harvest because if some of your plots don't wilt uh you'll just be able to buff your final plot even more and realistically like you start off getting low rewards and then the final plot you open is just going to shower you with so much life force it's insane. Now later on in the league generally speaking yellow life force is worth the most because people gamble with it with div cards but at the time of this video every life force sells for roughly 8 400 for a divine orb. So it doesn't really matter how you prioritize these with what these do or it just shows it will bias towards either blue yellow or purple and at this point in the video i do want to plug my friend chronic painless because he runs crop rotation more than anybody i know he's done extensive testing and simulation and basically you can watch his video for the full results but if you want to get the most yellow crops which is just what we're going to have this default thing set to you would just have one of the yellow nodes unallocated to slightly reduce your chance of getting yellow but this isn't really too important right now since every color is worth approximately the same so at the time or generally even if yellow is worth slightly more i will run this strat trying to get the most total life force possible and the way that you can do this is when you enter the harvest you should look at which color has the most plots so let's say blue has five purple has two and yellow has one i would run all of the blue plots first because then i can possibly buff purple and yellow up to five times if the blue plots don't wilt now once those are buffed five times those are going to be super valuable but all the blue plots wouldn't give us too much because blue cannot buff other blue plots now we're left with purple and yellow and then i'd probably run the purple first because you run two purples it buffs the yellow and then you just have this insane yellow plot at the end and realistically speaking there is some nuance and there's also a lot of gambling involved because as i said earlier like the plots can wilt right there's when you have these plots they're in groups of two and when you run one half of it there is a 40 chance that the other plot wilt and you just don't even get to interact with it so it's sort of a learn by experience and you can use your gut feeling um it's pretty fun because if you gamble and you win you just get showered in so much of the currency and i guess we can end this video with a live stream clip um where i can show you guys me going through this process and uh we end up gambling and getting a bunch of these harvest bosses now if you do end up juicing your final plot high enough it can actually like bump up into a unique monster which can give you a chance at this boss key called sacred blossom um yeah generally speaking every time you buff the uh the plot it just gets better and better and then you just get these crazy rewards if you get lucky enough with not too many plots wilting all right i'll be running this as well live on stream as this goes up because this is a pretty good currency maker i'm having a lot of fun and uh yeah we'll try and make some big bucks doing this that one didn't wilt the things are starting off lucky holy um um do the corpses really explode you can see it it's like a golden like oh my god oh the reason why you don't hear the explosion is because you only hear the explode like the the chaos explosion is this shriek but um what's happening here okay wow that one's saved saved it was like 30 million but i i just want to do a 50 mil 50 mil is i don't trust her gogs math i i feel like there's so many like intricacies in that thing somebody probably like did a number wrong and like i i just do not believe him when he says to do uh 33 million yeah i did 30 million shipments and they were so horrible i did 50 million and they were good so don't use asnath well i like asnath so maybe we can just uh oh i don't know wow both of them survived oh wait yeah they both did survive holy shit um oh we got a boss what does that mean does that mean we should do these first because then we'll get bosses on the yellow because like this can't get that much better can it i actually don't know what if you buff a boss over and over again i'm not sure i don't think it i think you just take it right i should honestly ask chronic painless okay so chat we we have an option here we can do the two yellows to buff that boss more or we could do the boss and maybe buff a boss onto the yellow because we've only done purple so far every time you do a purple thing it buffs everything else else and now we need to choose if we do the yellows the yellows will buff the blues if we do the blues the blues buff the yellows no yellow is actually worth less than blue right now yellow is worth the least um so the way this works is when you choose this this one has a small chance to wilt or not but when you choose this the the everything else that's not blue gets buffed that's how it works um but you see i think we want two bosses if we do this one we can maybe get more bosses i'm gonna go with my gut and do this it didn't wilt so that means we can buff the yellows twice so this was definitely the right call because it didn't wilt although i i'm kind of curious what would have happened if we like over buffed the boss to even be a bit more i'm actually gonna dm my friend who does this and uh ask him like after stream i i'm pretty sure it's not gonna get like much better than just having a boss but i actually don't know he 100 will know maybe we'll experiment at some time but i just uh i would much rather see a second boss here all right so just for fun we'll go see if there's any bosses right now and then we'll go back and do this uh this one does not have a boss but it's getting close to getting a boss and this one has a boss it has two bosses so you you can you can buff a boss even higher well that one have three bosses after the next one that's the question um i want to fight as many bosses as i can spawn oh my god i should have turned off the aloof filter i can see what's happening do you guys think we have three bosses now in that top one we better have a boss here no we only got no we didn't get a boss what about here though no we didn't get a boss oh my stream elements overlay is not working hold on let me replay this thank you for the donos you mother i had my stream overlay off because i was recording a video i appreciate the 420 sorry about that when i record a video i use my obs and i sometimes i get like follows and stuff and it's just distracting for the video all right so if i don't move these things don't explode and we're just safe that's the trick with yellow just don't move just stand still very very still although there's actually no explosions on the ground yet so we can move now if we want to oh we got the boss key let's go they fixed it yeah well actually it was that it was never bugged apparently i don't know um that will only slow me down holy shit i didn't even carry it all guys i think we're gonna get more loot than last map and i even said this was not gonna be so good so i clearly don't know what i'm talking about i think we got really lucky though um huge even when you don't have a boss you still get like a sizable chunk all right we're gonna beat 22 000 oh definitely by a lot yellow is 17 700 red is 100 still and blue is 9700 for a total of 27 000 juice we got a sacred blossom too crazy crazy 8 000 juice is one div so that's over three for one map that costs half a divine or leave you guys and boot up my twist stream i will give you guys the data points on the last 14 maps which i did end up writing down on a spreadsheet so on average the total juice was 17 600 which is slightly more than two divs and accounting for the cost it's about 1.5 div profit obviously there is a little bit of luck and a little bit of skill involved here i'm definitely not the most skilled and i think i am pretty average in terms of luck um so your results should probably be somewhat similar to this again the more you do this the better you will be come at it and you will get higher returns hope you enjoyed the video we farm this live today and uh yeah come watch me blast this goodbye
