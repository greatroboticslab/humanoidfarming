 this is not a political video but we need to talk about how the strikes on iran can affect mortgage rates and the housing market i wanted to do this video because i think you're going to see a lot of bad information i think you're going to hear lenders saying stuff like oh well this is just like 2003 and we saw rates come down in 2003 so if you buy now you can refine a couple months it's just like 2003 and if you're like what's that 2003 was the shock and awe campaign it's when the united states with allies went into iraq because of concerns of weapons of mass destruction also it was to topple a regime also there were 170 000 boots on the ground because this was a legit war like let's not play 2003 was a legit war there was a ton of government spending which invigorated the economy because that was just a couple years after a recession that's why you saw rates come down that's why you saw the housing market go up this is nothing like that okay so if someone's telling you that this is going to be just like 2003 they need a little history lesson here's what's more likely going to happen uh we're not going to see rates come down if anything this makes jerome powell less likely to lower rates why because we have yet another question mark in the inflation category we haven't seen rates come down because there's still concern about inflation with the tariffs not all being ironed out yet there's concerns of how those deals will go and how that will inflict affect inflation okay well guess what iran has a lot of oil and they're threatening that they can disrupt the oil supply so you have people going oh god that's going to increase energy costs and if it increase energy costs well there's inflation again so look we're going to watch the market ebb and flow right and the reason it's going to ebb and flow it's going to ebb and flow based on how serious people think are about iran being able to disrupt the oil supply and the cost of oil so right now as i film this there's less concern that they're actually going to be able to do that but yesterday there was more concern and i think we're going to see it like this but i don't think we're going to see a big dip so really really watch out guys if you're home shopping make sure you can afford the payment look there are no guarantees that rates are going to go down and if inflation starts to pop up you're going to see rates go up so be prepared but just watch out for anyone who's comparing it to 2003 because when you dig in they're totally different animals
