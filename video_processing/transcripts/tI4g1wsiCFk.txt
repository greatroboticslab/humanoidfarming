 Imagine waking up in 1840 as a dedicated farmer facing unparalleled challenges in agrarian life. The first hurdle is the absence of advanced farming technology. Farmers rely heavily on manual labor and simple tools, making crop production arduous. Another significant challenge is societal pressure to yield abundant harvests, vital for both local sustenance and economic stability, while struggling with antiquated agricultural knowledge. Furthermore, unpredictable weather patterns threaten crops, creating an endless cycle of fear regarding droughts or floods that could decimate livelihoods.
