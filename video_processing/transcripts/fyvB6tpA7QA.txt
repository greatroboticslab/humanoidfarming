The hey business is picking trend and most people are opting for it since it's easy to start and easy to manage. There are several steps you need to follow when starting a hey business. These steps are number one, you need to know your market. The first step when starting a hey business is to identify your target market. It may be a group of people that aligns with specific forage quantity and quality that you produce or it may be a geographic area that enables you to meet customer supply and transportation demands. So you need to know who is the target group and then do whatever it takes to meet that group's specific needs. Then number two, there is location consideration. It is advisable to set up your business near a road or an area with many farms. So you need to create a signpost to attract customers to your shop. Then number three, you need to get the necessary licenses. Licenses are very important. Before starting the hey business, you need to get licensed to avoid going against the law. Then number four, price your hey right. Do your homework. Find out how much comparable hey is selling for and be ready to adjust to your prices according to the market demand. Then number five, there is the storage facilities. Hey should only be bailed if it's completely dry. Once bailed, the hey should not be allowed to get wet. Proper storage of hey is extremely important. Wet, tightly packed hey can begin to compost bringing temperatures up so high that it's been known to catch fire. If your property doesn't already have a barn large enough that can store hey, then you'll need to have to figure out a structure into your cost. Selling hey is one thing. Marketing hey is a whole different endeavor, one that requires strategic thinking and market awareness. So, what are some of the guidelines you need to follow when selling hey? The following are specific suggestions to improve marketing. Number one, you need to determine buyer's real interests. What kind of hey does a buyer want? What type of animal is the individual feeding? So, those are some of the questions you need to ask yourself to identify the buyer's real interest. Number two, you need to define terms of pricing. What is the point of sale? Is the price at your barn or stock loaded on buyer's truck or delivered on your truck or something else? Will you accept a counter offer? Then number three, you need to decide on payment terms. What are the payment terms? Is it payment on delivery, one month after delivery or something else? What payment type do you want? Do you want cash? A check? A cashier's check? ETC? Then number four, you need to follow up with your customers. Call the buyer after delivery and ask how your product is being accepted. Is there any room for improvement? This may be the difference between a single sale and several years of business. If a customer is satisfied and you have more hey to sell, ask if customers know of other potential buyers. If you want a full course on the same, visit our website at www.finstompetual.com.au.
