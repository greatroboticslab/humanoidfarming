 So this is not the prettiest food plot you'll ever see, but this was the easiest food plot you'll ever see. Mainly because I had Josh do the work, but we came in here and mowed this back in the summertime. He came back after it started growing again, hit it with a dose of Roundup, and then just broadcast a mixture of brassicas right on top of the ground. We never worked this ground at all. And then we went about six weeks without any significant rain, but we still got a fair amount of tonnage in here for no more preparation work than what we did. So I'm excited with the way it turned out. I'm seeing a few turnips, turnip bulbs. There's a lot of top growth. There'll be deer eating this as soon as it gets cold.
