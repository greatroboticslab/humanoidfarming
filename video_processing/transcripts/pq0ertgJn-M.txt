Howto & Style
 Here's a method my team uses to speed up the process of planting in our large raised bed kitchen gardens. First we place the plants in the spots where we know they're going to grow best and do well in our raised beds. Once placed we remove the plants and dig a long trench the depth of the plants before we start to plant. Once the trench is dug we can quickly unpack the plants stick them in place backfill with soil and compost and water in. This streamlines the process and helps you plant a ton.
