 Good morning to everyone. I call this hearing to order. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you for being here today. Our next witness is Mr. Kevin Bikes. Hikes, I mean. Rhymes with bikes, right? Freudian. The chief... I won't forget your name now. The chief operating officer and co-founder of Intent. I got that one right, correct? A digital agriculture small business in Kansas, in St. Louis, Missouri. Among other services, Intent operates Farmertrials.com, an online platform that allows farmers to sign up for paid field trials with ag tech companies facilitating mutually beneficial relationships. We appreciate your testimony and thank you for being here today. And I understand Dr. Alice Robinson, the chief analytics officer of Intent, is here today also. Right there. Thank you for being here. Appreciate it. Our next witness is Dr. Mark Kester, chief... Did I get that one right, Kester? Excellent. Chief Scientific Officer of AgroSphere's, a biotech startup located in Charlottesville, Virginia. AgroSphere's started as a multidisciplinary student project in the Kester lab at the University of Virginia. After winning several prestigious competitions, it is now a real-world ag tech startup. AgroSphere's works closely with local vineyards to trial its system to degrade pesticides using enzymes. Most fascinating. Six other members of the AgroSphere's team are here, including the two student co-founders are with us today. Right here. The two student co-founders. Excellent. Welcome. And congratulations. And right on cue, the ranking member, Brad Schneider. We're ready for your opening testimony, and you can also introduce Mr. Guthrie as well when you're finished with that. Sorry. No. Okay. Thank you. Good morning. Before we begin, I do want to take a moment to express my condolences to all those who lost loved ones earlier this week in Las Vegas and send our prayers for recovery to those who were wounded. I want them to know that the American people are grieving with all of Las Vegas, all who were hurt and killed. And I'm incredibly grateful for the extraordinary professionalism that we saw and the bravery of our law enforcement and first responders during that attack. Bringing it back to this hearing, I want to thank you all for being here and taking the time to share your thoughts, your perspectives, your insights with us about high-tech agriculture. I also want to thank Chairman Blum for holding this meeting, this hearing today. I think it's very important to use this forum to highlight the technological needs of the agriculture industry. The global population is expected to exceed 9 billion by 2050. While concerns about population growth are not new and warnings of increasing food pressures on global technology has been and will continue to be essential to reducing these concerns, addressing these risks. However, this challenge is exacerbated by a number of problems. The most dramatic and urgent factor is climate change. Agriculture is highly dependent on a stable climate. As we have seen in recent weeks, there is no denying that our planet is experiencing more frequent and more damaging, more powerful natural disasters. We saw it with Hurricane Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Jose, four in less than a single month. The people in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands continue to face scarcity of resources that threaten their lives. We have also seen this with increasing wildfires in the West and California's drought, devastating our farms, ranches, and forests. Extreme weather continues to reverberate off our coasts. These often result in scarce supplies, decreasing nutrient levels, and other factors that threaten the continuing success of the agriculture industry. As the planet warms, weeds, pests, and fungi that thrive in warmer temperatures are expected to force farmers to spend more than $11 billion annually to combat them. However, technology can help us overcome the combined effects of growing demands for food and extreme weather and climate changes. Technology holds the key to remaining competitive, and we should look to it as we consider ways to put food on the table and reduce environmental factors for our nation's small farms. Many experts claim that agriculture technology, or ag tech, can reduce the amount of dependence on fossil fuels, fertilizers, water, and land requirements without, and I'll repeat, without hindering our economic growth. The time is now for the U.S. to show its leadership and invest in ag tech. Doing so not only contributes to rural America, but also engages all aspects of our economy, encouraging job creation and innovation. America has always been a country of invention. We must harness that skill today and find the balance between government oversight and technological advancements without hindering business opportunities. I look forward to today's discussion and to learning more about the challenges facing the agricultural community and the role technology can serve to help our producers thrive. I would like to again thank all of our witnesses for being here today and providing us your insight. And with that, I will turn to the introduction. Correct? Yeah, and we've already done. Okay. So, sorry to make you wait, but it is my honor and great pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Guthrie. Mr. Guthrie is a senior business instructor in the Agricultural Technology Program within the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Virginia Tech. He taught courses on business, communications, and leadership since 2007 and brings over 25 years of agricultural business management experience to the classroom. Through this, he has helped educate a new class of innovators in the agricultural field with the skills and resources they need to succeed. Mr. Guthrie holds a bachelor's degree from Virginia Tech in agricultural economics and a master's degree as a Fulbright scholar from Massey University in New Zealand in agricultural economics and international trade. It is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Guthrie. Thank you for being here. Thank you, Mr. Snyder, and well done on the run. Thank you. I'd just like to take a second to explain our opening statements and the timing lights that you have in front of you. If committee members have an opening statement prepared, I ask that it be submitted for the record. You, the witnesses, will each have five minutes to deliver your testimony. The light will start out as green. When you have one minute remaining, the light will turn yellow. And finally, at the end of the five minutes, it will turn red, and we ask that you try, if possible, to adhere to that time limit. I know you're thinking green, yellow, red. Something in Congress makes sense, correct? And with that, I recognize Dr. Benson for five minutes. Good morning. I want to thank Subcommittee Chairman Blum and Ranking Member Schneider and members of the subcommittee for inviting me to participate in today's hearing. My name is Dr. Lisa Benson, and I am the Director of Rural Development at the American Farm Bureau Federation, which includes 50 state farm bureaus, Puerto Rico Farm Bureau, and nearly 6 million members across the country. In my role, I lead the Farm Bureau's Rural Entrepreneurship Initiative, which provides rural entrepreneurs with world-class business training, networks, and resources to help them succeed. My professional career and research has centered on helping beginning farmers, ranchers, and rural entrepreneurs grow their businesses, overcome obstacles, become more profitable, which is key, and sustain economic development in their rural communities. Farm Bureau created the Rural Development Program and the Rural Entrepreneurship Program because our leadership personally witnessed the decline of their rural communities. Their children weren't returning home after college. Many of the local businesses were closing, and the infrastructure was deteriorating in those communities. Farm Bureau wants to reverse this trend by engaging on policies and creating programs that extend beyond the farm gate. We chose to focus on an area that sustains economic growth, creates jobs, and improves the quality of life for rural Americans. We chose to focus on entrepreneurship. As entrepreneurs grow their businesses, they hire their family, their neighbors, their friends. Entrepreneurs tend to purchase goods and services from local businesses, so as they thrive and prosper, so do those rural communities where they come from. Farm Bureau wanted a program where the rubber meets the road, and a program that highlights the success of businesses that are located in rural America. This led to the creation of the Rural Entrepreneurship Challenge and the Rural Entrepreneurship Initiative. In 2014, we kicked off the challenge, which is the first national business competition that focuses exclusively on rural businesses and ag and food businesses. The competition helps us identify excellent rural entrepreneurs that have unique products and strong business skills. In the first year, we had 95 applications. Now, in our fourth year, we had 471 applications from 47 states and Puerto Rico. Over time, we identified a trend in the competition. The entrepreneurs that had ag tech businesses dominated our winner's circle. These ag tech winners included Scout Pro from Iowa that offers an app to help scout fields, Levrak from Nebraska that developed an expandable storage device to help expand your storage in farm shops, and vertical harvest hydroponics from Alaska, my home state, that created a growing system engineered to withstand Arctic conditions. Many of these ag tech entrepreneurs came from family farms or farming communities. They saw problems on their farms and then created solutions to address those. A hurdle that many of these ag tech entrepreneurs expressed to us was trying to find enough capital to scale up their production, to meet economies of scale. They considered reaching out to investors but were reluctant to give up equity in their businesses and also weren't sure what terms to expect in a deal. To address this challenge, we created the Agriculture Investment Summit and it brings together rural entrepreneurs with venture capital funds and accelerator programs that target rural investments. We brought together 35 rural entrepreneurs and 15 investors representing more than $300 million in investment funds. Two of those entrepreneurs are in negotiations now with investors they met at the summit. Through the Rural Entrepreneurship Initiative, Farm Bureau has supported more than 1,000 rural entrepreneurs from 37 states, including Hawaii and Alaska. We have provided more than $500,000 in startup capital, mentorship, networking with investors and publicity nationwide for those small businesses. Entrepreneurs have used that startup funds to refine their prototypes, to build greenhouses, hire staff, develop online marketplaces and upgrade their production facilities. At Farm Bureau, we believe that supporting rural entrepreneurs is critical to enhancing and strengthening rural communities. We continue to work with rural entrepreneurs and help them overcome their obstacles and help them achieve their dreams for their businesses. Thank you for your time today and I look forward to answering any questions you may have. Thank you, Dr. Mr. Hikes. You are now recognized for five minutes. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Chairman Blum, Ranking Member Schneider and members of the subcommittee for allowing me on behalf of my partners, Dr. Alice Robinson and Randall Barker to be here to talk about digital agriculture. Growing up on my family's farm and ranch in Colorado, I had the pleasure of learning the art of ag. Over the last 20 years, I've had the opportunity to learn about the science and technology of the industry through various experience in different ag tech companies. Intent is a small company. We were started with the simple belief that connecting farmers and businesses doing research grounded in data science was necessary. What makes our company unique is the founding leadership capabilities and our varying skill sets. Our team fuses the art and science of agriculture together into one small business. By working with farmers and agribusiness companies, we combine the strength of both groups through the application of science, data analytics, computer science, engineering, and service to improve how digital agriculture works today. Intent is committed to ensuring farmer success and their engagement in the innovation process. We do this by guiding farmers through the intent product innovation process while capturing their valuable perspective. The most important thing that we've learned in this process is to keep talking to and keep listening to our farmer constituents. Here's what one of our Illinois collaborators, Bill McDonald, shared regarding our company and our process. As both a farmer and a crop consultant, Intent's trialing process is great. It focuses on gathering data in a true commercial production field environment. It's some of the best data that we can use as farmers because it's implemented using realistic production data and it comes from our own farms. Intent supports our clients or agribusinesses by ensuring a rigorous science is applied to all of our trials for both product performance and also customer sentiment. Agribusiness companies need real-time and real-world information to compete and deliver farmer value in this digital and precision-driven world. Rather than more products, companies need better products on the right location or the right fields. Better products are a result of product feedback and also customer perception. The digital and precision world has arrived. We can capture more data and we can move it faster than ever. With each pixel of data and each piece of equipment, we can gather valuable insights, but it has to be managed properly. With the increased digitization of agriculture, more and more opportunities come for other small businesses to deliver solutions that weren't necessarily available yesterday. The number one question that we hear from farmers all the time is how well did this work? How well did product X work on this field last year? Intent establishes paid experiments linking business research with qualified farmers to capture this data, drive insights, and ultimately answer that question that farmers ask us. Since farmers are key to the intent vision, we needed a way to engage and recruit more farmers. When intent began, there wasn't a neutral platform in which farmers could indicate their interest in field trial opportunities. We determined there had to be a better way to engage with farmers interested in participating these field research opportunities, so we created farmer trials. Farmer trials is a simple concept in which a company can connect with agribusinesses and our company connects agribusinesses to farmers. We can and do believe that farmers should be paid for this valuable research that they do at their farm. New technologies need to be evaluated on real farms to understand the value and utility. Farmer trials is a place in which objective data and farmer feedback regarding new technologies can be used to drive faster and better innovation. With regards to the ag tech industry, there are more and more solutions being introduced to the market by startups throughout the U.S. This is significant because ag tech is receiving the capital and resources for needed advancement. To supplement this, data science and full field trials are necessary to understand product performance and efficacy, and we also need to drive user adoption at the farm level. With respect to small business, we believe that small businesses work very well in agriculture. They must be part of the launching pad and also new products and services that are launched. Small business can be agile and move quickly and respond to the complexities that we see in agriculture today. Additionally, some small businesses can engage and expand rural communities by growing businesses, employment opportunities, and also by deploying technology resources. On behalf of our small business intent, thank you for allowing us to be here today to talk about agriculture, technology, and small business. Thank you, Mr. Hikes. Dr. Kester, you're recognized for five minutes. Thank you very much. Good morning, Chairman Bloom, Ranking Member Schneider, and distinguished members of the Small Business Committee. I am Mark Kester, the Chief Scientific Officer of Agrospheres, a biotechnology company in Charlottesville, Virginia. I would like to acknowledge six members of the Agrospheres team behind me, the true student entrepreneurs behind this company who are with me today. We thank you for calling attention to agricultural technology, entrepreneurship, and for inviting us to tell the story of Agrospheres. We would like to share what we have learned from taking this company from a student-run project in my laboratory to a standalone, profit-margined business where we are going to change the way agriculture embraces technology. Agrospheres is a biotechnology company based in Charlottesville, Virginia, working on simply nanotechnology-enabled, environmentally-friendly biocontrols. Let's break it down. All we've done is created a FedEx truck that's designed to deliver on time, all the time, to the plant. Simple as that. What we actually have done is we've taken a bacteria and we've engineered it to make a specific protein. And that protein is a biocontrol that lets plants thrive. Now, when the bacteria makes this protein, we also got the bacteria to divide. But this is where the intellectual property comes in. We got to divide to two cells, not 50-50, but 99 to 1. 99% of one of the cells has all the genetic material. The 1% is just a membrane expressing the protein, the biocontrol, no genetic material. So we made genetically modified organisms without genetics. And we did one other thing. We also got this 1% to actually express certain proteins on the outside that bind to plant. And just as a FedEx truck can deliver on time, all the time, in the back there are packages, and our FedEx trucks, there are packages which are biocontrols. That's the Agritospheres product. So how do we actually develop this really, really quickly? It's said that there's saw new business is one-third, one-third, one-third. It's one-third the gee whiz science, it's one-third the intellectual property, and it's one-third the team. That's the team behind me. They're student entrepreneurs. And in fact, I'm embarrassed now, Piam Portetayari, who actually graduated with pretty much the highest GPA in the engineering school of UVA. He applies to med school. Doesn't get into med school, he gets into MD, PhD programs. Not only will they give him an MD, they'll give him a PhD, and they'll pay him for it. Highest honor in that realm. He gives up that to stay with Agrispheres. That's the passion, that's the entrepreneurship that we expect, that hopefully we will grow with these new student-run businesses as we take them out of universities and take them to real-world applications. The second thing we learned is we have to engage the former early in the process. And we did that. Around UVA, around University of Virginia, Charlottesville, there are multiple vineyards and apple orchards. And we worked with the farmers directly. They said, what is your problem? And the problem for our solution was that they have to put pesticides on their plant, and they cannot harvest that plant, that's called the pre-harvest interval, until the pesticides degrade. And that plant is susceptible to blight, temperature, winds, storms, or if the grapes get too ripe too early, can't harvest. They're at risk. What we've done is we expressed a protein that degrades pesticides. So what Mother Nature does in six to ten weeks, we can do in two hours. Wow. And what we learned from the farmers also is what they really wanted was biocontrols, ways to make the plants thrive using our FedEx trucks. So by engaging the farmer early, that was critical. The other thing, as we actually, since I have now a minute left, what are we asking for? What is our concerns? Where are the positives? Number one, it's brought up before accelerators and incubators. We have an accelerator incubator at UVA. It's called the Innovation Lab, iLab. This gave our students access to space, resources, legal, corporate, financial, and taught them how to be student entrepreneurs and then actually entrepreneurs in the community. That should be strengthened. Number two, we have to work closely with the association partnerships, the trade organizations, et cetera. It's not only at the state level, but at the local level. One of our early grants was from the Virginia Wine Board. Without their funding, we don't have a company today. That is the funding that gets you to the data, which gets you in front of the angel capitalists and venture capitalists and truly can turn you into a real company. And number three, SBIR grants, federal SBIR grants. They're now seeing more in the ag space from DOD, DOE, National Science Foundation, as well as the USDA. What's really important is that we streamline how quickly we can evaluate these grants. When we put a grant in, it can take anywhere from nine months to 18 months to find out if we're truly funded. And when we get a grant and we now want to take it to the next level for higher funding, we have to start all over again and take nine to 18 months to find an answer. That's not a good way to keep a business thriving. So we want to suggest that we can make that process more exponential. Thank you very much. I'd like to thank the committee members for giving me the time to tell you the agrosphere story. Thank you, doctor. Absolutely fascinating. Mr. Guthrie, you recognize for five minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. A few years later, he was driving a tractor with a power of 100 of those horses. By the time he handed the farm off to me, we weren't even plowing fields anymore because we were using zero tillage techniques as a soil conservation measure just to show you how much agriculture has changed in a brief period of time. What will the next 25, 50, or 100 years bring? There's no way for us to tell that any more than people 100 years ago could have foreseen the advances we have now. But there's no question that precision agriculture is an all-important driving force in crop production and it appears that it will be even more important in the future. Precision agriculture is a term used to describe several related technologies used together to decrease input cost and increase yields. Those technologies include soil and yield mapping with GPS, tractor guidance systems that allow for automated tractor operation in fields and variable rate applications of fertilizer, chemicals, and seeds. Unmanned aircraft or drones are also often incorporated for many different applications as well into those systems. A USDA study released last year found that precision agriculture was used on 30 to 50 percent of America's corn and soybean acres in a 2010 to 2012 time frame in which the study was done. No question that those acres have increased substantially since then. To give you an example of the use of precision agriculture and how it's transforming how we farm, I visited a dairy farm in central Virginia last year where one of my students was doing an internship and the farmer said, Joe, come back in a year and you won't see me sitting on the seat of a tractor planting corn. Instead, I'll be sitting at a desk in front of a computer monitor watching five different tractors with no driver on them in five different fields pulling five different corn planters at the same time all using precision agriculture. Each one of those planters, by the way, would be able to change the rate and variety of corn seed to match the precise conditions of the soil the planter is driving over. So the implications of this technology is, as you can tell, staggering and so are the changes it might have on our industry. First, the technology, while designed to improve profits, has been found so far to be only marginally helpful in improving profitability because of the high cost of the technology itself. Another consideration is that the precision agriculture and other advances will make more sense on larger farms and so we would tend to think that we would see more larger farms adapt them more quickly and that we would see a trend towards more large farms and indeed, we are seeing those trends. It's important to keep in mind, however, that even large farms in the U.S. are considered to be small firms and, in fact, most are family-owned. Another important implication of precision ag is a reduction in the number of people needed for farm labor. As you can imagine, in that example I gave, there's no one driving those five different tractors. So that reduction in the need for farm labor is one of the benefits of the technology, but it has serious implications for rural communities. Another example of an innovation is so-called robotic dairies in which nobody actually milks the cows anymore. The cow walks into a stall. She's milked whenever she wants to by a robot. Again, we're seeing implications for that and what that might do to rural communities. We're also seeing larger and larger dairies with fewer people on them and, again, implications of that for our rural communities. Given the time limitations, let me just give you an example of what we're doing at Virginia Tech, we started a precision agriculture class three years ago using material and technology that was donated to us from a manufacturer. In fact, manufacturers are coming to us all the time asking to donate to us so that students can learn on that material and I'd advise that, you know, if you haven't done so already in your land-grant universities to consider that as well. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Guthrie. Very fascinating, fascinating testimony. Thank you very much. I'll recognize myself for five minutes now. I have too many questions and too little time so I'll throw them out to whoever would like to answer them. First of all, I'm a small entrepreneur myself so I love small business because I'm one of them. I was just sitting here thinking about the major corporations that are players in the ag industry like Deer & Company. They're very big in my district, Case, Monsanto, lots of big names. Are they involved at all in any ways with you all? Are they helping? Are they standing in your way? Do you see them as somebody that once your technology catches on that they would purchase your company? I'd just like to hear about the interaction of these mega corporations. Sure. I pointed out with the technology that we're using in the classroom that's being donated to us from some of those major corporations, some of which you named there, we're also seeing not only big corporations but smaller companies that are starting up and are developing and selling technologies, opportunities for college graduates in things such as sales and a lot of different opportunities. And keep in mind, even though those are large companies, they have a local presence as well. And so those companies are hiring people at the local level, at the local dealership. And so we're seeing some benefits from it already in having more professional college graduated students in rural communities as a result of that. Is there encouragement from the mega corporations? Because, you know, I know of situations where it's just the opposite. They try to squash competition sometimes. So let me just add to that. Agrisphere already has a sponsored research agreement with a mid-size ag company. And for a company that's only nine months old, that's pretty awesome. Because I'm a small business and they're a small business, but we want to be a large business. So we have to partner with mid- to large-size ag to really get our product out there. So it's part of our business plan. These eventually, hopefully, will be our partners. We have to watch who we work with and how we work with them. But at the end of the day, it has to be a partnership. Let me just say that John Deere is one of our sponsors for the challenge competition. So there are many of these larger companies that have venture capital wings, and they see innovation working as rising the level of the water for everybody. All the ships rise. And so I think for them, the idea of having new technology gives them the opportunity to see what's coming down the pike, and they may not be as nimble as some of these smaller companies. So there's an opportunity for the entrepreneur to either grow their own business or to think about selling that technology to a larger company that can ramp up production. So for us, we see it as diversifying how that entrepreneur can grow. And I would say that those are our clients. We're linking the multinational agribusinesses to farmers. So the point that you made is exactly right on. There needed to be a neutral platform, and that's the void that our company fills, is how do you provide a neutral platform where multiple companies can work with growers and different assets? And what we try to do is some farm research trials work better for some farmers and some work for different companies. Our job is to link those together. And I would say when you talk about agility in small companies, some of the things that we're doing on the data science things, data science element, we're able to move faster and be more agile in our approach. And so I think small business and working with farmers and linking those agribusinesses is the niche that we're filling. Thank you. Another, we've got a minute left. How interested is venture capitalists, venture capital in agriculture these days? I've read and I've heard that they're increasingly interested in the money out west, Silicon Valley, very interested in ag, but I'd like to hear from you. Yes, very interested, but in my experience, they're still trying to figure out how to adjust to the different horizons that ag investments have. So people that are used to quick turnarounds with software, able to get in and out within three years and have a 10% return, you don't see those kind of returns in that horizon with a business investment. investment, but with the rural business investment companies coming through that are a brand new type of firms, what we're seeing is targeted investment in rural communities. So that has been a real, I think, boon in venture capitals that are trying to go for ag tech and for rural investments. Good to hear. I'm out of time and I'd like to recognize our ranking member, Mr. Snyder, for five minutes. Thank you. And again, thanks everyone for your testimony. I have one question off the panel. It was Ari, you said, right? What did your parents say when you told them you weren't going to med school? But that was a rhetorical question. Oh, yes, great answer. I mean, at first, I was a little heavy thing, but I've been doing a lot, but I've been doing that. You're lucky to have the parents you have. That is a great answer, do what you love. But I do want to touch on some of the things and Dr. Kester, you touched on a couple of things. You talked about accelerators and you talked about trade organizations and having access to connecting the entrepreneurs. And this is something we are working on here in Congress. In fact, we passed a bill earlier this year that I had the privilege of drafting and introducing in 2013 called the Halos Act, trying to allow those entrepreneurs to meet the investors. And we have something, Accelerator Startups Act, another bill introduced, exactly that. We would like to try to do more of that and look for ways to perhaps we can do in this committee to drive that into more agriculture and ag tech where the opportunities in our rural communities are greater. Can you touch a little bit on how you have seen those affect or expand a little on your comments with the incubators? Exactly. So I think the key part is designing them, making them into boutique applications for the ag industry. There are many incubators, Accelerator Trade organizations, et cetera, and they're really geared towards software development. I do a lot of pharmaceutical innovation. I have drugs in the clinic. That's the way most innovation happens in terms of the incubators and Accelerators. We need them directly designed for ag. That's, and we'll see more of it. I mean, I think it's, the outlook is very, very positive. I think I'm going to shift to Mr. Guthrie. I think it's the glamour, if you will, but when you talk about ideas and the term you used, Mr. Guthrie, precision agriculture. It kind of talks, technology is about getting more precise and getting exactly where you want, whether it's in medical technology and computers or agriculture. Could you expand a bit about exactly how precision agriculture technology is changing the techniques of agriculture? And you talked about zero tilling, perhaps. Yeah, sure. And so, what we're finding is a more and more sophisticated agricultural producer in the world today, one that needs to be able to adjust and to adopt ever increasingly more complicated and advanced technologies. The entire point, though, Mr. Schneider, goes back to the most simple principle of economics, which is, you know, revenue minus cost equals profits. And the precision agriculture works on both sides of that side of the income statement in which it is both increasing yields to help us to increase the revenue side and the precision side of it that allows for the decrease in the amount of inputs is helping us to work on on the expense side of it as well. But then we have to offset that with the cost of the technology itself. And so, that's where we really are. And I heard the word risk brought up earlier. And that certainly is something that's important to consider, particularly as you look at, you know, legislation here and the new farm bill that, you know, that has a lot to say about and a lot to do with farm risk is, you know, the risks of this new technology. And Mr. Blum brought that up earlier. We can't have farmers that are, you know, spending a lot of money on technologies that are not going to work and are not going to be productive. And as these things, you know, come out and they're tried, only a certain number of them are going to be successful. I speak as an engineer. Yeah. Part of engineering is trial and error. Sure. And part of trial, you want to find the error quickly in the process rather than at the end of the process after spending a lot of money and certainly want to find it before trying to take it out to the broad market. As you were doing your initial remarks, the diagram I drew in my notes, lowering costs, increasing yields, but much higher capital investment, which is going to increase the size of our farms, larger farms with fewer people working those farms, changes the entire economics within our communities. And that's probably a conversation for another time. I'm almost out of time. I want to give Mr. Hikes and Dr. Benson a chance to touch on these issues. I apologize for not getting it, but if you have just a quick remark. Yeah, quick remark. Thank you for your interest in the accelerators and tech programs because those are necessary. And I would say that as a small business, one of the things that we've identified is that you have to evaluate when is the funding the right option. And I think one of the areas that we've touched on is building a small business is hard, but we have to always remember that we have to add value. And so when you start a business and you're building this, start with the value piece and then think about the investment. So we tell a lot of small companies that as we're getting started. And I came late for a missing introduction. Where in Colorado are you? I grew up in Southern Colorado, La Vida, but now our business is in Lenexta, Kansas and St. Louis, Missouri. Okay. Yeah. And I would just add when you talk about the changing dynamics of when you have larger farms and more mechanization, how does that impact jobs within those rural communities? I would just say there's a diversity of businesses in ag or ag-related businesses that we're starting to see pop up. Craft beverage is a huge industry that's growing. Ag tech is growing. Farm to table and using that through apps and connecting consumers to their growers and to the food in different ways. So while we see a shift happening in maybe traditional farming, we also see new opportunities in the ag production line across the spectrum of the different sectors. So we always are looking to encourage the new types of businesses as well as more traditional. Thank you. And I went too long, but I yield back. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Snyder. As you can see, votes have been called again. This is budget day, so welcome to Washington. It's a crazy time. I just would like, so we're going to conclude our hearing here, but I just want to say that do not interpret the lack of attendance today in this committee meeting as a lack of interest on Capitol Hill and what you all do because it could not be further from the truth. People are extremely interested here. Congressional members are in clean water, pesticides, weather events, plants that can sustain themselves through drought conditions. It's a frequent topic, and I know particularly water quality and runoff is. So people are very interested here. It just happened to be, you happen to be here on one of those days. Where we have many, many budgets that we need to vote on. So once again, I want to thank all the witnesses for their testimony. And as we heard today from our panel, AgTech investment is driving rural revitalization in cities, states, and regions using AgTech Entrepreneur to bring jobs and dollars into our local communities. All stakeholders, and we heard that today over and over again, must work together to make sure that small farms, family farms, can benefit from the many exciting technologies and innovations America's brightest entrepreneurs, such as your students, are developing. I ask unanimous consent that members have five legislative days to submit statements and supporting materials for the record. And I'll encourage members to submit questions to the panel that you can respond to in writing, those members that weren't here. And without objection, our meeting is adjourned. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you grand nogwide. Thank you. Thank you.
