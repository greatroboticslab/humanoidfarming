 Huckman Farms has integrated the manure management practices and the livestock piece of the puzzle so that every place that we can, we want to use natural sources and use those micronutrients that are natural source. So they actually help, they work a lot better in the soil. Yes, from a synthetic standpoint, you know the exact amount, but with the natural source, you get the organic matter, you get some additional microbial activity that works well with the practices that we've got in place with cover crops and with no-till and how our tilling practices go. So we also use cattle movement every place that we can. So 60% of all of our corn acres we're able to cover in a natural sense, and we're really seeing the benefit by building organic matter and then the carbon that comes along with that. The soil organic carbon is increasing. We weren't always sold on that, and we weren't sold on that because we didn't have the science of the data point for how it worked. And as we participated in a soil health partnership through National Corn Growers and the Iowa Soybean Association and some other trade associations, we gained the knowledge and we saw the actual data points that showed we're increasing our carbon and we're increasing our fertility in that soil. And we're actually stabilizing our yields and converting the nutrients into carbohydrates and protein. we're Representative Blue's to learn the Sahara Salt Lake of the On-Sandoval Report from Lynchwood's Hispanic discovering находics and hanño rushing andноеćrienturps and thereated inningbgressions to create a його0205198427 Silver of the Wisconsin Sun examined for the Austria-BIP mismanat flows, Caribbean peripherals to calibrated draw and permanent snapshots of these pieces when res遊phals of Mach prawdafield andridges are sistema grid να rod magnifying the fandad our eargie grant an 어떤 북한ゾ– thatể you might as well with blanc occurring in there to be north einem but we did this rather large and much-relatedourse其図.
