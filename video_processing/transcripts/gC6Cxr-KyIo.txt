 The farmyard's the hub of the farm, but it can also be the place where there's the biggest threat of pollution. Catchment-sensitive farming gives farmers support and financial help towards improvements that can make our waters cleaner and safer. David Mitcham is a mixed farmer in Devon, and for him, containing animals as well as controlling potential environmental dangers, such as slurries and manure, is a constant battle. The problems that we've had in this last 12 months with the excessive amount of rain has caused our system to be under a great deal of tests. We're now in a nitrogen-sensitive zone, which means to say that we have certain spreading periods, we have certain close periods, and all that has really tested us. The question was, what do we ought to do? Catchment-sensitive farming has priority areas, and if a farm's located in one of those areas, then it could qualify for the initiative. Well, the first thing to do when applying for a grant or considering it is to talk to your catchment-sensitive farming officer. They can advise on the grant whether you're in the target area or not. They can help you fill out the application form and discuss the options that you might choose to go for. Every farm presents unique challenges. Farmers, catchment-sensitive farming officers and specialists come together to work out what will be the best changes to make for each individual farm. What we do is understand the farm, understand where the farmer's heading with his farm business. We understand where the farm business is heading in terms of how the cows are managed, how the machinery is managed, where the manure is stacked, where the slurry goes, all that sort of thing. That's the first thing, and that relationship happens first with a catchment-sensitive farming officer. Then it's down to practicalities. Keeping clean and dirty water separate is a priority in a farmyard. The clean water, when it comes on a roof and it's managed and put away into a nearby ditch appropriately, doesn't have to be looked after again. If you've got dirty water, we need to manage it. We need to pump it. We need to move it. We need to do everything to manage that slurry properly. Separating clean and dirty water is where we can start. Through catchment-sensitive area, we've had a number of small roof projects done, which has kept rainwater away from possible contamination. We've had soil sampling and we've also had the soil management visit, which actually identifies what we should be doing and what we shouldn't be doing. And those small changes on farms like David Mitcham's are beginning to have a real impact on a wider scale. In Devon, the main water quality issues are sediment and nutrients running into the watercourse. So we have lovely rivers and very pleasant bathing beaches, and by acting together, farms can make a difference on that water quality. This farm, there's been a difference made, and that's really helped to reduce pollution in this area. But then that expands, then that moves to the next farm, and throughout the catchment, these incremental changes have made quite a difference across catchments and across the country. And the initiative's working well for farmers too. Catchment-sensitive farming has worked very well for us. It's a very simple scheme, and I think it's a scheme that everyone wants to do. It's a very simple scheme that everyone should embrace because of its simplicity.
