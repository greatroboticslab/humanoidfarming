 Indonesia's farmers are finally getting enough water for their crops. In Indonesia, water did not reach many farming communities, resulting in poor harvests, low income for farmers, and food insecurity for the country. Only half of Indonesia's irrigation system was functioning at full capacity. To fix the country's irrigation infrastructure, the government launched its irrigation improvement program 2015-2025. Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture, with funding support from the International Fund for Agricultural Development, is ensuring that the benefits of the irrigation improvements reach farmers and farming communities, providing them with better water services, better access to agribusiness finance, and better post-harvest handling and delivery services. But more remains to be done to address implementation gaps and support the ambitious, decade-long program. In May 2017, ADB committed $500 million to support Indonesia's irrigation improvement program. ASEAN Infrastructure Fund's co-financing is $100 million while World Bank's is $28 million. The financing package will support the program from 2017 to 2024, in delivering sustainable and more productive irrigated agriculture in 74 districts. It will do this by strengthening institutional capacity for sustainable irrigated agriculture, improving irrigation operation, maintenance, and management, and improving irrigation infrastructure. The project has reached several milestones. About 4,500 water user associations, 88 irrigation commissions, and other agencies are now better at managing water resources together. An irrigation asset management information system, in place since December 2019, supports the operations and maintenance of irrigation systems and infrastructure. As of 2023, the program has rehabilitated about 523,000 hectares of irrigation schemes. Indonesia's farmers are now getting more than enough water, enabling them to increase yield and ultimately improve the country's food security. ADB's financing partnerships. helping farmers feed communities, cities, and countries. Thank you.
