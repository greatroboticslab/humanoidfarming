 By running a teaching operation, we're hoping to train folks to be able to do this work with this changing future and to be able to support themselves. Yeah, still be able to work within the food system, whether it's farming or advocacy or just be a part of this and earn a living wage and be able to thrive in this part of the world. So we're doing that on the farm by running our apprenticeship program and then really teaching folk, showing folks different tools you can utilize, strategies you can use to adapt to the changing climate. But then also really showing what it's like to be a part of a larger community and how important it is to be connected to other farmers in your region because we're all learning together.
