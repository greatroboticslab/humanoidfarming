 A lot of people will tell you to prune the suckers off of your tomatoes, but what I end up doing is pruning off the main stems and leaving the suckers to grow. Your tomatoes may not get as big using this method, but the suckers will flower and you'll end up with more tomatoes overall. This will only work on indeterminate tomatoes.
