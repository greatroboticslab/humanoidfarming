Howto & Style
 You may be wondering why all the plants in this raised bed garden right here are white. They've all been sprayed by a product called SurroundWP, which is a special micronized kale and clay product that forms a protective bond on anything you spray it with. And this is a great crop protectant for preventing pests in your vegetable garden. I mean, how is a squash bug or a squash vine borer supposed to penetrate through that clay spray? It makes all those zucchinis in there completely unappetizing to pests. Same thing with all these tomatoes in there. I mean, who would want to eat that? And all these peppers right here. But this spray also works great on fruit trees. Nothing will want to eat these apples or these Asian pears right here. What's also cool is you can use this product as a surfactant of sorts where you can mix it with something like liquid copper or spinacid or BT concentrate, and it will help the insecticides or fungicides better adhere to the leaves of your plants. And of course, this stuff is just clay, so it is completely natural and organic. And if you're worried about the fruit itself, well, for you, you can just rinse off the fruit when you want to eat it. Surround may appear to have a large upfront cost, but that's because it only comes in these big 25 pound bags. So while you will have to spend a little bit of money to get a bag, it will last you a long time. This bag is over two years old and it is still half full. For surround to be effective, you have to maintain the layer of protection on your plants. Heavy rains can start to wash it off. So generally speaking, we will have to spray it roughly every week or so, especially after a heavy rainstorm to maintain that layer of protection.
