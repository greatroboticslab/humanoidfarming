 A lot of guys when they do, let's just say a tractor, they never stick to the life of the loan and they always kind of turn it with leases because you still got equity in there. So if you trade it off and upgrade to another tractor, you can use that and upgrade yourself on a tractor and then you just got to just pay the difference to boot. Well, that's another unique thing and it saves your cash is like don't use your cash on equipment. It's a depreciating asset. Save your cash. Do a lease. There's many benefits to doing a lease. One, you're still preserving your cash. You're using a lease that's not going to show up on your balance sheet and it's going to help you in the long run to get to what you want as far as the equipment that you need for your farm.
