Howto & Style
 And you see we got the solar power compost brewer going here. You see even on my cap I got the screen to keep the mosquitoes out. And this is what I like about this thing. There's actually several different settings, but you can look at my little compost bag here. And we just sit that down up in there. I'm going to take a couple of scoops out of this. Look how beautiful that is. This stuff's been going for about 48 hours. You can move it anywhere around in the garden that you want. And that's pretty much where I like the blue at two and a half gallons.
