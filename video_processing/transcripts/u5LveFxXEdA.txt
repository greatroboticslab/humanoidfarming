 More than 1,200 packets of vegetable, herb, and wildflower seeds from the new Richland County Seed Sanctuary are on their way to Richland County residents. The Seed Sanctuary is a project of the Richland Soil and Water Conservation District and is designed to promote home gardening, pollinator conservation, and environmental awareness throughout the community. Let's check in with Richland Conservation District's Education Assistant Hannah Lindsay to learn what residents should expect when their seed packets arrive. So when you first receive your packet you're going to first see the name of the plant and then the variety of that. So this would be tomato and it's the beefsteak variety. Then you're going to see that it's going to take 85 days after first planting the seed in order for it to harvest on average. And then in these notes down here you're going to see that you should only plant it a fourth of an inch deep, one tomato plant per square foot, and plant it in full sun. What should people do when they receive their seed? As soon as you receive your seed we would love it more than anything if you could take pictures of yourselves and your families getting outside and planting the seeds and then sharing it on any of our social media pages whether it's Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. And then tagging us and using the hashtags, hashtag reseedrichland or hashtag rccsanctuary. To learn more about the program visit our website at www.richlandcountysc.gov Happy gardening!
