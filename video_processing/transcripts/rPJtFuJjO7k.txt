 Bad news, I'm afraid, from Diddly Squat. It's this, this relentless drought. It means we're so busy, moving animals mostly, that we don't have the time to do all the planned press and PR activity to mark the launch of season four on May 23rd, I think. And that's annoying because there was something I wanted to address. There have been loads of reports recently saying that Caleb has been replaced. Well, he hasn't. He's over there now, rolling the dribble of moisture we had yesterday into his mustard. So what happened is this, okay, he went away on his speaking tour for a couple of months because he imagined that after four years, I'd be able to manage on my own. And I didn't. I made a complete mess of everything and had to bring in a young farmer called Harriet, who was brilliant, and looked after the fort till he got back. That's it. That's the story. Got to move the goats now.zę maar richest
