Science & Technology
 My name is Susanne Vogelsang. I'm working at AgroScope and I'm head of the research group extension Arabe Crops. Currently I'm involved in two European projects. There's one Horizon 2020, which is a crop diva, started in 2021, and the other one is called Legendary. It's a Horizon Europe project, which started just this February. And in both projects the main objective is to promote the cultivation of minor crops, which has a big advantage for diversifying the portfolio of the grower. And also because they are more resilient to drought and other stresses, with that we can mitigate climate change. For my research group and for AgroScope as a whole, it's quite important to not only do research that stays in Switzerland, but on a European scale. And what's helpful is that we do with the project, we have complementary expertise from the European partners. And also like it's really great having like those young motivated graduate students and we learn new skills also, which we would not have learned without that project. The participation and the results from those projects, they're extremely valuable for AgroScope as a whole, through the reputation. And for my research group, because we learn new avenues of doing research, we learn new skills, and it broadens our horizon in the true sense. So the advice I could give to new, young researchers who would like to be involved in European projects, go to conferences, talk to people, don't be shy, show your expertise. And when you have a presentation, for example, at the end you could always mention, this is like the next step of my research that I would like to reach. So go out and talk about your priorities. For writing of a proposal, your research was and is highly valuable. I think without their support, we would not have succeeded as good as we did. They looked at the drafts, the different versions, gave us constructive criticism on how to improve the proposal. And also like the status of Switzerland, the framework that you're working in, so you know the rules and don't make a mistake in writing and submitting.
