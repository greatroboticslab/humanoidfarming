 Experts say China's agricultural research institutions have followed General Secretary Xi Jinping's guidance and implement the instruction of the CPC Central Committee over the past five years. And attending delegates agreed that progress is being achieved in the areas of agriculture, science and technological innovation. Three figures could indicate the significant development and progress in agricultural innovation. First, the contribution of science and technology to agricultural growth has reached 56 percent. Mechanized tilling, seeding and harvesting cover 65 percent of the acreage of major crops. And the coverage of improved varieties of major crops has exceeded 96 percent. That's a remarkable achievement. Many delegates also added that there is much more innovative mindset in the agricultural industry now. The central budget allocated 1.34 billion yuan to the development of key departmental laboratories since the last party congress in 2012. Meanwhile, China has also established about 50 scientific and technological innovation alliances dedicated to agriculture with over 1,000 participating agencies and enterprises. General Secretary Xi Jinping has emphasized in the report that issues relating to agriculture, rural areas and rural people are fundamental to China as they concern the country's stability and the people's well-being. It's expected that more efforts will be taken to strengthen the supply-side structural reform and also technological innovation to boost the development of agricultural sector and rural areas.
