 Don't know which crops to plant? Bloomy's got you! Here are the best crops for each season! Starting with spring, strawberries are the obvious choice, but are only available at the egg festival shop. So instead, get yourself some cauliflower in the meantime. You can even buy extra strawberries to get ahead in spring too. For summer, you need to invest a ton of gold into blueberries. Just like strawberries, blueberries regrow and can regrow up to 4 times if you plant them on summer 1. Other options include starfruit, only if you've unlocked the desert, gaining access to Mommy Sandy's shop. Corn is also a great option, since corn both regrows and will continue to grow all throughout summer and fall. The crops are kind of controversial, since there's a big debate over cranberries vs. pumpkins. But I still suggest cranberries, because I'm lazy. You could also plant pumpkins, since pumpkin juice from kegs gives amazing profit. You may think you can't farm in winter, but you're wrong! You can plant winter seeds. You can do this to sell the forageables or even make more winter seeds. Craft green tea saplings and sell the saplings, making winter farming extremely worth it.
