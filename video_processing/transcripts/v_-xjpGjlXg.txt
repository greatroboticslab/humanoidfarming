Travel & Events
 Welcome to Sage Creek Ranch, a Western sanctuary spanning over 8,600 deeded acres in the southwestern corner of Wyoming. Here, high country meadows, wild timbered ridges, and plentiful water sources converge in a landscape that feels as infinite as the sky above. This is a rare convergence of big game habitat, pristine water, and agricultural productivity. Multiple species of world-class big game animals, including mule deer reaching 190 plus inches, significant numbers of elk and antelope, and the occasional black bear, roam freely across this carefully managed ranch. With 10 landowner tags currently in place, and the opportunity for more, the big game hunting on the ranch is nothing short of exceptional. With 18,000 acres of BLM grazing leases and a five-mile boundary along the Wasatch National Forest, Sage Creek Ranch is surrounded by public land, ensuring privacy, permanence, and access to endless recreation. This is a ranch with purpose. The current owner was honored as the 2019 Green River Region Landowner of the Year for outstanding conservation and wildlife habitat enhancement efforts. Over the past 15 years, they have transformed the property by replacing miles of barbed wire with wildlife-friendly fencing, and lightly and strategically grazing cattle while protecting riparian areas. The owners added gravity-fed pivots on the upper portion of the ranch to boost wildlife forage, and introduced three new bottom-release aerated ponds stocked with enormous trout. Also, within the boundaries of the ranch lies Reed Reservoir, a 100-acre private reservoir fed by the year-round flows of Sage Creek and Cottonwood Creek. Beyond irrigation supply that is exclusive to the ranch, it offers world-class stillwater fishing for native cutthroat and tiger trout. Some tipping the scales well over 10 pounds. And it's also a playground for water sports. A five-year habitat restoration project with Trout Unlimited and Wyoming Game and Fish is nearly complete, reviving miles of Sage Creek, which runs through the ranch, supporting Colorado River cutthroat trout, along with a vibrant riparian habitat for generations to come. While the upper portion of the ranch has been thoughtfully managed for recreation and sporting pursuits, Sage Creek Ranch isn't just wild. It works. The lower portion represents a compelling opportunity for income production. With four pivots and additional grazing capacity, this segment can be operated by the owner or leased to a tenant, generating meaningful revenue without compromising the recreational value or management of the upper ranch. The ranch's improvements are both practical and thoughtfully refined. Multiple residences comfortably accommodate a large number of guests, while the well-appointed shooting house features a long-range target setup and clay target course. A modern shop and exceptional facilities round out the offering, designed to support both livestock operations and guest enjoyment with equal ease. This is more than a ranch. It's a Western legacy. Untamed, yet thoughtfully managed. Wild, yet accessible. Functional, yet deeply inspiring. Sage Creek Ranch. Big land. Big game. Big water. And a once-in-a-generation opportunity to own it all.
