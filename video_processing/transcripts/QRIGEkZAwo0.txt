 Because I'm always talking about dry embedments, right? And living soil, feeding your soil, doing all these things, right? Whenever I'm talking about synthetic nutrients, it's not my favorite. So I point out, you know, the flaws in it. Sometimes it sounds like it could be biased. I have my personal opinion, but it's coming from me pointing out facts, right? So the question comes down, is there a purpose for liquid nutrients? The answer to that is yes, 100%. Most important thing is bringing your yield for your crop. I always talk about this. If you do not bring in a crop, you have to go buy medicine for your personal use, right? That's going to cost you more. It's going to make you not possibly enjoy gardening. I don't want that. And on a commercial grow, if you don't bring in the yield or you can't sell it, well, you're going to go out of business. You're going to have to fire employees. Those employees are going to have families. Other problems exist. I don't want that either, right? So I'm not one of those types of people that like, only use dry nutrients. If you don't do it perfect, you're failing at living soil. No, I'm not like that. I have steps. Wouldn't I have to compromise on my value system? First, I do my best to have consistent systems and processes throughout my grow to be able to live a life in line with my values as much as I can do, right? But I'm a realist. I'm not a perfect human being. No one's perfect. That's why God gave us the opportunity to live on this beautiful earth, because he gave us the freedom of choice, right? To decide for ourselves. And then you have to, you know, define your own personal values or growing values, then apply them on a daily basis so that you live a life and produce a product that you can sell to your consumer base, the ones that you market to, right? You're telling them that you have the best living soil. You have all these things. It increases the value of the product, keeps you in the market longer. And by you making decisions in line with your values, it allows you to be able to really preach that word, right? What you're trying to get out there. So using liquid nutrients when you're using dry amendments. Yes. So I would recommend when you use liquid nutrients, try to find something that's been solubilized from like rock sulfate or like from rocks. And they're trying to break those rocks down and make them water soluble or, you know, various guanos, you know, some type of a liquid that is, you know, like you don't have to run out and get a synthetic phosphorus or potassium or something that's a hundred percent salt product. You know, you can look for the derivative of where it's being derived from and try to mash it up as close to something that will feed the soil. And just remember that looking for a product that's in line with your values all the way to using synthetic nutrients. The key to this though, so you don't hurt your soil, your bacteria and shut them down and make them go dormant is you don't want your input to be higher than 800 parts per million. Okay. That is the key. If your bacteria can use synthetic nutrients, your bacteria can use anything. That's their job. I mean, she's proper bacteria is clean and foil spells, right? So that's their job is to break it down and tear it up and do the thing. But, you know, obviously our plants are bioaccumulators. They're going to, you know, if you use like nutrients, there's probably going to be more heavy metals in those products. So your plants are going to take up those type of metals unless you're using drops of balance. And so you want to obviously just be aware of those things, right? And so be aware that the bacteria are going to do their job as long as those parts per million are under 800 parts per million of input. If those salts begin to go above 800 parts per million in your soil, because maybe you're now giving them liquid nutrients every day is you're trying to quickly solve the problem. I would recommend don't do that. You know, give them one feeding of liquid nutrients. Maybe give them a second feeding three or four days later and the problem will slowly start to resolve itself. Especially if you're to the end of your grow, that liquid nutrients is how you're going to be able to get nutrients into your plants quickly. Because if you top dress, it's going to take up to three weeks before that gets down to the soil. So keep it under 800 parts per million. Please remember to like, share, subscribe. Have a great grow, guys.
