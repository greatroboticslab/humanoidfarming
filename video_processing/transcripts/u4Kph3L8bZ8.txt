 You can stick with a hardwired strategy when it comes to investing. Choose the stocks you like one by one. Or select SectorSpider ETFs and add the diversification of an entire sector of the S&P 500, like technology, with liquidity, all-day tradability, and transparency. Ready to add diversification to your equity investments? Before investing, consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses.

If there's one major asset class that's missing from your investment portfolio, I'm going to guess that it's commodities. I'm Ron DeLegge with ETF Guide. Most of us just don't have enough space for a grain elevator or herd of cattle in the backyard. Besides storage issues, though, the other problem with commodities is they have no earnings. They have no dividend yield. And that makes putting an accurate value on them very difficult. So how can you get commodities exposure, a unique asset class, but without buying or investing in a farm? One idea is to invest in industry sectors that are closely linked to commodity prices. Among others is example, Materials Select Sector Spider ETF, ticker symbol XLB. XLB contains exposure to 30 stocks within the S&P 500 that are producers of chemicals, construction materials, containers and packaging, metals and mining, along with paper and forest products. Among the holdings in XLB are blue chips like Dow Chemical, Monsanto and Freeport McLaren. If you're looking to invest in commodities but without buying the physical goods, take a look at Materials. It's a great way to obtain commodities exposure through a basket of stocks closely linked to this major asset class.
