 Good morning and welcome to Tower Gardening Made Easy. This is episode 14 of our podcast called Let's Talk About It because as gardeners y'all know we have lots to talk about. Today I want to get into it. So last Friday I mentioned that I was going to be going to the premiere party of the Newport Rhode Island Flower Show which is kind of a big deal. In the past there have been some fun people that have gone. I did not see them there this year but even Martha Stewart has been known to show up here. So there were a couple even influencers like on TikTok. I won't mention names but I do see them around and they were all there as well. So there had to have been I think over 500 people. The show was sold out. It was an amazing night at Rose Clip which was one of the mansions on Bellevue and they used to call these the summer cottages for the rich back in the early 1900s and they're just they're gorgeous. If you ever come to town clearly you have to say hello to me and let me know your comment but you definitely got to go check out the mansions. You know the oceans and the beaches here are really spectacular. The winters are quiet but boy oh boy Newport is just so much fun. So let's get into the show. So just before we start I want to say that I wasn't really supposed to do a lot of videoing there. They kind of frowned upon it because you're inside the mansion. So I did it kind of on the sly and didn't get arrested. So no one had to bail me out. So here we go. All right so before we start the clip here that I put together of all the different segments it was called a floral fair and this is a picture of Rose Cliff. It's right on Bellevue and it's just a beautiful mansion and then you'll see in a minute when we go in the back side the beautiful lawn that overlooks the water and all of the areas that they put together and brought stuff in to make makeshift little like backyards if you will. But just amazing. The Newport Mansion Society just just a little caveat here they they really do a great job so kudos to them. All right so this is as you first walk in and again I'm not really supposed to be doing that but I was just like kind of secretly just you know filming everything taking pictures. So as you come in they scan your tickets and you walk on through and there are these arrangements that are kind of right there now. This is all judged and I didn't really focus on the winners the losers. I thought everything there was just so well done. There are different garden organizations that obviously contribute and and put their their work for on on you know just to be seen but just beautiful art. Art. So right there you've got some tropicals you know some beautiful you know like hanging tropicals with roses. This is the type of stuff if you've watched my podcast in the in the past you know that I worked on Albany Street in Boston which was the flower market. So these hanging tropicals here I don't remember the specific name of them but this is the stuff that you would see come in from all over the world that you know in the middle of winter. So lots and lots of fun. Loved this one. This looks like you've got some gladiolas and garber daisies and roses and then there's a little flower so if anybody knows the one with the lines I used to it begins with an A. Make sure you comment down below. I loved how they did this and they love the pot the the contrast between the black and the red and just the height of it. Oh just absolutely gorgeous. This is the backyard. This is someone's you know that used to live at Rosecliff. This was the backyard. You can see all of the tents overlooking the massive you know fountain that they had there and so as you walk down the stairs so we went outside first. You'll see like these dancing art you know people that are dressed up as plants. I mean everybody that went to the premier party we were all dressed up. You know hair, the nails, the jewels, the whole nine yards. It really brought out you know the best of the best of Newport. People coming up from New Jersey and New York and all over. Like I said you know Martha Stewart has been known to come to this party and there were tons of influencers there. There's one in particular I don't know her name but I've seen her on TikTok. She's an older woman but really well put together. I want to say maybe it's Mindy or Mitzi. She's from like from Boca. You see her around but she was there with her entourage and they were doing a lot of filming so I'm surprised they didn't get into trouble. So here we go. Let's see it's cute. And this was back on the inside for a quick little second. This this is like um okay so some of the mansions they have these large topiaries that are just they're there and they grow the moss and there's different little flowers that grow on them. So I think they were just kind of emulating that and I kind of named this with My Little Pony but someone put this together it's like a carousel. It's just it's really really pretty. All right so these are those dancing plants. So they the urns are part of the mansion and I'm surprised that they let them do this but they put um little women looks like they were all women and they dressed them up like in green and then they you know they did out the arms and the hands with like vines and that the hair um you know like like a big pot of flowers on top and people were up on the stairs and they were taking pictures with them and they were just dancing and then they had little green people you know they were there too taking pictures now. I don't know how they got the green after but just so much fun. I don't know these people. A lot of fun. And as you can see everybody's really dressed up. All right so now we're back on the lawn and um again they brought all of this stuff in to create little areas little plots of land um in the backyard. So I love this little pot with the agapanthus and it looks like a topiary of rosemary there. Some succulents, some hydrangeas, now they brought in the little picket fences and boxes. All right so now we're back on the inside. I had to kind of split it up so that security wasn't chasing me around. So this is one of the judge things and I don't know what their theme one was but it looks like you know something to do with frogs but so cute. Some curly willy with moss on it. Looks like some gardenias, birds. And a little frog. Again I didn't focus on who won. I just thought everybody should get a gold star here because they did a great job. The lily pads. I think next year I'm going to get involved and do do something. There was one that I didn't photograph and it was like you know they've seen those the heads are kind of cut off and you can put plants in them. They had hair growing out of them. This was my favorite frog. So this is sexual. And again so here's some orchids. One right there is some granules. Looks like it's a piece of wood of some sort. Little vases. So oh right here. So as I'm filming and I think because I was filming near a window there was a security card walking over to me and I was like uh oh because I don't think I was supposed to film like any pictures or windows I think for security purposes. And then the little mini bouquets. These were some of my favorites too. How they got them to stay alive for three or four days. I think they probably had to go in there and change them up. Really pretty. I loved this one. I love to have a fern on the bottom. It's got like some Irish bells. Looks like it's got some like pink stuff. I don't know what that is. But just oh snapdragon in the back. Really pretty. Look at the piano. I think this is where the security guard is coming chasing me around. I was trying to do this as fast as possible. Peonies. More snapdragon. I think there was like four or five of these bouquets. So I swung back my camera and I'll stop it right there. This was my favorite. I thought with the backdrop. See the painting up on the upper left hand side. This is what I wasn't supposed to and it got in the brain. But regardless I loved the pink and the green with the black container. It just works so well in this room. I love the symmetry of this. Of just everything that they had in there between the light pink, medium pink, a little bit darker pink and then the chartreuse green against that black. So pretty. I don't know who won that one but really nice job on this. I love this show. There's my husband in the camera. All right. Okay. So then we move over to like a table demonstration. So they've got some type of... I want to say that's an orchid. Pretty. Pretty. Different. Not for me per se but different. It looks like I had a lot of tropical stuff in there. There's the harvest. More orchids. I just realized I didn't have my earbuds in so I'm sorry if the sound was a little bit off. There's the harvest. There's the harvest. Ferns. Ferns. Now again they brought all of this stuff in. So check out this table that's coming in. I don't know what that... maybe that was... the one that's coming around... you can kind of see the chandelier in a second. Notice the chandelier. All right. So it's gonna pan up a little bit right there. All right. So somebody made a chandelier over this table of vegetables. So you can see zucchini. They did a string of cherry tomatoes. It looks like there's carrots and peppers with a little bit of green and some flowers. But just a lot of work for sure. And then my little pony again. And then back to the backyard. So just all in all, it was a spectacular night. We stayed for a couple hours, had a couple glasses of wine. It was like bars everywhere, food everywhere, like heavy appetizers. And just a really, really good time. The only drag was the parking. So they sold over 500 tickets. They sold out completely. And obviously, the amount of parking, you just couldn't hold there at the mansion. So what they were doing is they were pushing in a nearby mansion and they were shuttling people in and out. So that was a little bit of a drag. We have scooters. We thought about taking scooters over, but I didn't want to have a glass of wine and then ride my scooter, especially in a big dress. So we had to kind of schlep it over there in what I call the loser cruiser, you know, bus shuttle. But regardless of that, we had a really good time. And I'm glad that I didn't get in trouble for taking videos and pictures. And it was just it was quite the quite the crew. So if you if you have an opportunity to go next year, they do it every single year. It is just an incredible event. So let's go ahead and go ahead and move on. All right. So if you haven't had the opportunity to see this video, I just posted this the other day on how to clean your tower garden using one product. Go ahead and see it. But I wanted to we talked a little bit about this last week about it being super, super easy, but it was inspired by this post. And I just want to explain that. So I don't know who this person is, but I totally get it. And I just want people to understand that these towers mean something. But it does come with a little bit of, you know, work. And, you know, so what I would say is, you know, this person wrote, I was excited when I bought my first two towers over a year ago, but I honestly didn't know how hard it would be to clean them and take them apart. So I guess they have a bad back and, you know, they felt disappointed and really thought about selling your towers. And I just in my video, I explain this. This is when you have to enlist a friend, a spouse, a neighbor, even barter. You know, maybe like I did, you'll see in a minute my tomato harvest. You know, I would ask someone to give me a hand in exchange for let me give you all these tomatoes that I grew or some of them anyway. You know, people are willing to help. You just have to ask. And I know sometimes people have a hard time with that. But that was the premise of why I wanted to do this, that it's super easy to take it apart. You know, maybe you've got to clean it out and that can be difficult. But taking those parts apart and not having to scrub them or put them in a bathtub or use a power tool or a power washer. Literally, you'll see me. I don't even scrub them. I literally just I rinsed off the root matter. I stuck them in my dishwasher, took out all the extra, you know, components in the dishwasher to get them all in there. And I put a half a cup of this citric acid. You just have to watch the video to get the right one. And I hit the sanitation button and boom, it was done. And it came out really, really clean. As we get deeper into the podcast, I will share something with you that was a little scary. And that, you know, in itself kind of corrected itself with this particular product and some hydrogen peroxide for the basin. Because that part will not fit in your dishwasher. But that shouldn't be too, too, you know, difficult to clean out. But I just want everyone to know, don't sell your towers. You know, don't give them away. Don't put them in the garage. I just see so many people do that. And it just breaks my heart because they really are a godsend. And, you know, again, I don't want to talk politics, but I don't know if anyone's watching the news right now. But, you know, it seems like we're involved in something that, you know, whether you agree or disagree. I'm glad I have my towers. I'm glad I have my towers. I don't think anything will happen. But to know that, you know, I can grow my own vegetables and, you know, be self-sufficient is important to me. So, again, don't give up. And check out the video. It's a lot of fun. I started out with kind of a, you know, a little hoot. So I'm standing in my dishwasher with the water spinning around. I've gotten very good at, you know, doing some editing to kind of make the videos fun for you guys. So go ahead and check that out. And the next thing that we did, this is pretty impressive. I even pressed myself. So let's go ahead and go to that. All right. So I sped this up. But, you know, when I, let me just stop for a quick second. Before I decided to clean out this tower, I made sure that I had another tower that was already started. So if you watch the video, Clone It Like Heaven, this is when it began. And basically, I cloned some seedlings off of this main tower to plant out the other one. And I already have tomatoes that are ripe that I could pull off right now today to eat. So this tower was, you know, good to go. And then I decided I was cleaning out a different tower. And I took more seedlings. So I have two home small towers, one with ripe and one that have clones on it right now. So I'm going to have plenty of tomatoes. So this one, I was happy to let go. But I was like, well, I'm not going to waste the food. So I went ahead and harvested. I couldn't believe how many tomatoes I pulled off this tower. They were so concentrated, like up in there. I had no idea. And I really stopped pollinating this. I mean, I think I have tomatoes from my entire neighborhood. It was amazing. And I think as I was cleaning out the plant matter, I was still finding tomatoes. But at that point, I had so many, I was just throwing them away because it just it didn't it didn't matter. Okay, so I've harvested everything I could possibly harvest off of the tower that we're going to take apart. And as you can see, I have a lot of cherry tomatoes, some are red, some are yellow and some are green. I'll sort through them later and probably be giving out some of the neighbors because I can't eat all of these. It had to have been about five pounds. Like I had two with those to-go containers filled with tomatoes. And I sorted them out last night with the green. They're on my front porch ripening right now. And the other ones, you know, I picked off the green, rinsed them off. And then believe it or not, I put them into a Ziploc bag and I froze them. You can freeze tomatoes. And I sucked out all the air. So when I open it back up, they will just kind of fall apart. Not the tomato, but just like they're not going to be clustered together. And then you can literally put them into slow cookers or frying pans or whatever and make sauce or, you know, soup, whatever you want to do with them. And so, yeah, I couldn't believe, you know, it probably took me an hour to clean all of these and separate them. That's how much there was. And I still have a tower, my other tower that I cloned that's already ripe. So I'm like, I have more tomatoes than I know what to do with. And I'm very, very happy. So crazy. All right. So let's go on to the important part that I was kind of a surprise to me when I got to the bottom of the, of cleaning out this tower. So, yeah, it was just bad. All right. So let me just explain this. So when I first took all the plant matter out, the first piece at the very, very top is the shower cap. You know, when you take, when you take it apart. And I looked at it and I go, oh, this is not good. So I had not cleaned this tower since November when I put it together, when I started this whole journey. And, you know, tomatoes can go on forever and ever and ever. They're pretty low maintenance. But I learned when I took off the shower cap, I discovered black mold. And we all know that that's toxic. So let me address the tomatoes first. The tomatoes are probably fine. I'm not really even concerned about that. I rinsed them and then I froze them. So if there are any micro whatever, it's dead, you know, once they're frozen. So I'm not concerned with eating those tomatoes. But I am concerned that there's black mold that was in the top. And I was like, whoa, that's not good. So I just kind of kept filming and didn't really even pay attention. I was like, well, I'll just see what happens. I'll just keep going. And so I put that one aside. And then I got to the reservoir where I took off that top part, took off the whole trellis, you know, cage thing. And then I got to the bottom and then I saw this. And I go, oh, not so good. So it was really, really dirty. There wasn't a whole lot of water left. I didn't really even care because I knew they didn't care because I knew that the tower was, you know, getting ripped apart. But what I did not like was the fact that there was so much mold in the reservoir. So I have cleaned out all of my towers, all nine of them, excuse me, all eight. This is number nine. This is the ninth tower that I've used. And I haven't experienced this. So I was like, okay. So, you know, just take a minute. You know, I was filming this, putting it together. I put the shower cap aside. And then I went ahead and, you know, put everything in the dishwasher, kept doing the video. And then I came downstairs. So I took it over into the bathroom and I took, obviously, the plant matter that was in there. You can see the clump of it right there. I pulled it out and got rid of it. But you can see on the pump there's black mold there. So I filled up the sink with water and took some hydrogen peroxide and squirted it on top of the pump. And then just let that sit, put the blue hose inside the water. And I plugged it in so that the pump could actually pump the hydrogen water mixture that I had back into the sink and just clean that out. And I kept it in there, you know, going through that cycle for a few minutes. And then I drained it and then I repeated it again. Now, that part is not in the video. I just kind of felt that I was getting, I was sidestepping what I was trying to do. And then the reservoir. So now I've got everything out of the reservoir with the exception of that water. I left that water in there just for a second. And I took my big bottle of hydrogen peroxide and I squirted it all on the very, very top. And then I scrubbed it with the water that was in there. You know, and once you put the hydrogen peroxide, I dumped a ton in there. You're going to kill. You're going to kill the bacteria. So then I emptied it out. I put some fresh water in again and I did the same thing. Just scrubbed it with a clean cloth. And then just, you know, that was it. I didn't put any soap. I did not put any other cleaner in there because you don't want that, the resin, if you don't get it all out to be there. Now, if you're outside with a hose, that's different, but I'm inside. So I just filled it a little bit, cleaned it, dumped it, filled it, cleaned it, just with the peroxide. Dumped it. And then what I did was I kind of pat dried it. And then I went and I got my sprayer that had alcohol. And I sprayed it really, really, really good. And I let it just kind of sit and dissipate. I took a bunch of paper towels and I got in there and I just wiped it dry. And I left it like that for probably, you know, an hour while the other components were in the dishwasher. And then I came back downstairs. Wiped it. It was all dry. No, no issue. So then I just kind of put my nose in there, smelled it. All the alcohol had dissipated. And then I filled it back up with water and put it back into the other room. At that point, at the end of the video, I, you know, you see in the video that I opened up the dishwasher and I pull out the first compartment. And I hadn't checked it. I was like, oh, God, I hope it's clean. And sure enough, I was like, oh, my God, it's sparkling clean. Yes. As you can see here on the right, my face is like completely relieved. So the citric acid that I use, and again, you can go to towerguardingmadeeasy.com and go to the essentials or nursery essentials, and you'll see the one that I use. Don't just go out and buy any ordinary citric acid. I cannot, you know, I don't know what they put in there, if they put any other elements. I just know that I use this Mrs. Wigs, I think it's called. This specific one is the only one I'll ever use. I used one other one. It was like in a bag, and it didn't really do a whole lot. That's why I was like, oh, this doesn't work. And then I tried this one, and I was like, whoa, this does work. It cleaned the black mold, and I did not scrub it. You'll see that in the video. And I thought about putting some citric acid into the reservoir and scrubbing that, but then I just go, what if there's resin left? Because I know in the dishwasher, it goes through the whole cycle for like an hour or two, and then it continues to rinse. So the hydrogen peroxide and a little bit of alcohol cleaned the reservoir perfectly. So I had no complaints on that. But it's scary the fact that I found black mold because it is toxic. You don't want to be around that. I'm actually going to add a dehumidifier into the grow room now that it's a little humid down there, even with AC on. You don't want that in your house. I had a girlfriend that I did nutrition for and trained her that had lived in a house that had a lot of black mold. And it can really have some health issues. So we definitely don't want that in our home or in our towers. So be aware that it's summertime. It is humid. And especially if you're in the southern states, I'm sure this is nothing new to you guys. So for us northern people, it's a rare, rare thing. So I was a little shocked. But it's clean. I'm going to put her back together today and get her all planted up. So we're going to stay tuned on that. So let's go ahead and move on. All right. So this is the other video that I posted. I got past a new tower. Do this one thing to eliminate. So if you haven't seen it, go ahead and click on it. Take a peek at it. The reason why I did this is because, again, I'm indoors. And I had this little black fly. And I don't understand where it was coming from. And it was driving me crazy. I'm like, where is it coming from? All I can think about is I had the windows open. Obviously, there's screens. But our whole backyard is dug up. And it's just piles of dirt everywhere. So I'm like, it's got to be that. And then I thought, oh, my God, it looks like a fruit fly. So instead of spraying and putting chemicals and things I don't believe in, I decided, hey, why don't I plant some companion plants? So off to the nursery, I went. And I got some marigolds. So now these marigolds have been outside for a long time. I can just tell. And I said to myself, well, if I'm going to bring them in, I'm going to soak them. I'm going to get all the dirt off. I'm going to leave them away from the towers for at least a good four days. So that's what I did. Upstairs, they went, rinsed everything down, left them upstairs. And even after like the second day, I actually found a mini little cricket. So got rid of him, put him back outside. But they were good to go. So then I went downstairs and I put, it wasn't that I just put them in the tower. Okay, the video talks about everybody knows what companion plants are. If you are a gardener, whether you're soil-based or you're hydroponic-based, we all know what they are. But it's how I planted them. You know, I didn't just stick them in the tower going, hey, do your job. I put them on different areas of the tower of that, you know, our stack is our real estate. And again, when I talked, you know, I will talk about in a minute about how you plant things in your tower is really important. The same thing with companion. So that's what I did. So check out that video. And I think that I'm going to go ahead and order the botanical interest, their marigolds and start them in some rock wall and see how they do. And then maybe swap them out. Now, as we go deeper into the podcast, I'm going to show you a few of them. They look a little ratty because once you do transfer to the hydroponic, they all go through a state of like, you know, what am I doing and why am I here? And then they start to grow. So that's what happened with the peppers. That's what's going to happen with the marigolds, even though they still have their tops on with the scent, which is fine by me. You know, do you. You'll come back. I know you will. So definitely check that out. It's a really good, good video. But I'll keep you posted on growing them in the nursery. Okay. Tower garden cauliflower. Let's see. I love this because I know that they do take up a lot of space on the tower, but clearly they must be outside. And I have to say they actually look like they're pretty good sized heads. I'm not a cauliflower girl. I definitely do like broccoli. They're both really, really good for you and they lower estrogen. So definitely eat as much as you possibly can without getting too gassy. It's super, super good for you, especially as you go through different stages of perimenopause and menopause. It helps keep your estrogen down. But love, love this. And they did a really, really, really good job. So kudos to you. And here we go. All right. So this segment was, I'm looking at my dear baby Libby and I don't like to put obviously chemicals on her as well. I do give her heartworm pills. I've got to do that. But when it comes to flea and tick, I don't use anything other than ultra natural stuff. And what I mean by that is you can make it or you can buy it in the stores. It's organic and it's just oil. So it's a combination of citronella and a little bit of like peppermint. And just with that mixture alone, you don't spray it directly on your dog or your cat or, you know, whatever you have outside. You can actually even use it on horses too. Spray it into your hand, rub it together. And then I start kind of like on her ears and on her neck and then just put a little on her tip like right here. And then I kind of comb it through the back and then on her tail and around her little cheekies. That's how you do that. And you do that right before you go for a walk. She'll never have fleas and she'll never get ticks or he whatever. But you can make your own. And for mosquitoes, these are the top 10, you know, citronella, peppermint, lemon balm, lavender, basil, catnip, horse mint, lemon thyme, marigolds. They all repel. So again, you can make your own. You can go right into like a Whole Foods and buy your own oils and mix them. I might put, you know, a little drop of just plain oil in there just to kind of make them not so concentrated. And again, just take a little squirt bottle that you can buy, a couple squirts, rub it on there. And it's good for their coats. If you have horses, you can do the same thing in terms of like around their face so the horse flies don't get them. That instead of having to put the masks on them and then you rub it through their tail, it's really good for their tail because that gets, you know, really, really knotted. So that'll keep those natural oils and keep it from tangling and breaking, especially if those horses are rubbers. So definitely be using some natural stuff. So, you know, that's our summer recipe right there. And let's give a little update on the pumpkin challenge. All right. So I went down there this morning. This is episode 14. So last week was 13. The picture here to the left was last week. It's just a still picture. And then this is just a little bit of a video. And the only difference I did between last week and this week was bump up the nutrients. So the nutrients were hovering around 1.8 and I keep the pH at around 6.5. I'm sorry, 6.0 to 6.5 in that little range right there. But just with the bump of nutrients, you can see that the leaves are much, much bigger. So you can just, we'll get a little bit closer here. Right, right there. So if you look dead on, you know, like kind of like smack dab in the middle of this video and then compare it to the still picture on the left, you can see that it literally, I would say doubled, if not tripled in size in one week with just that bump from 1.8 to about 2.0 is I think where I went. So I'm ready to get down there today or tomorrow and do some testing of the pH and nutrients. We'll see how they're doing. You can see the little shabby miracle right there. She'll pop back up. I'm not concerned. As long as that flower's right there and it's giving off a little bit of a scent, I'm not concerned. It'll pop back. So we'll check the pH and the nutrients. And I probably will keep it, you know, at the 2.0 probably for another week. And then I'll bump it up again to, you know, as I get a little bit bigger. Once I start to see the first flower, you know, right there ready to pop a little bit, I'll go from probably 2.0 to maybe 2.1 or 2.2. I think the high range is 2.4. So I don't want to get there until I have both female and male flowers. But we're getting there. We're getting some really good, good leaves. All right. Here we go. What's on your tower? So I loved this picture. So as I talked about earlier, it's really important to think about how you plant out your tower. So this person did a lot of lettuce, a lot of greens. And the top part looks like it's either Swiss chard or something along that nature. And then the bottom part, which I really love, is they've got some lettuce. And it's just beautiful how it just has that beautiful center crown. And it has those lovely leaves on the outside. So if you use that method, cut and come again, you can check out that video. This would be an absolute perfect example of how to do that. Use the outside leaves first, leave the crown alone, and it will continue to grow outwards. And it's just well done. You've got those compact flowers around the bottom or leaves. Then you have things on the next shelf. They're like, she's got some basil. I don't know what that dead center might be some type of an herb. Those are a little more leggy. And then you have that top part, which looks like wild hair. If you had reversed this, then what would happen is you'd have it really bushy on the bottom and compact on top. I prefer it the other way so that everybody gets the room that they need. Nothing's getting crowded. And you can just pluck off as you need, as you want to eat. So really good job of planting this out. And I love the puppy in the back. So let's go ahead and move on. What happened to my kale? All right. So this is a newbie, you know, first time grower. I get it. You know, you're just kind of confused, kind of going off of what you're seeing in the forums and on other YouTube channels. I totally understand. But this is where we go back to what I continue to say. Master your greens. Now, kale is a green. So clearly we got to take a step back. And there's a couple of things that I can point out here. So it looks like there's just maybe four strands, five strands here. They're way too lucky for kale. And part of the reason is if you look deep on that nut pot, I can say that her tower looks new and it's very clean. So I don't see any mineral buildup or does it need to be taken apart to be cleaned? I think part of the problem is the rock wall that she's using or he's using. Don't know for sure. And they have, it wasn't in the nursery long enough. And, you know, someone had mentioned in the comments below this, move your lights a little bit closer. I don't think that's the issue. I think that the rock wall is covered with algae. It's starving. It can't get the nutrients to really produce. It's just got a long stem and no leaves. So it's not really doing anything. So if this was me, what I would do is I would, well, I try to save it. So what I would do is I would cover the rock wall, either with other pieces of rock wall, or I would use a cone, a piece of those cones or covers that I have that you can find in my nursery essentials and see if that helps because it will kill the algae in a couple days. And then you should start to see, you know, some new growth. I would make sure that your nutrients are on point and your pH is on point. I don't see any issue there yet. And give it a week. And if nothing really changes, then I simply would, I'd pull it out. I'd start over. And I would definitely, a sturdier rock wall, I think, for this. I would not be using, it looks like she's using the tower garden that she got, which will come in and kind of slap her hand. She will come in and kind of slap her hand. So, you know, you can do your best. And, but, you know, I'll only answer a question, you know, only 50 times versus 50,000. And then you've got to outsource people. You've got to get out there and do your research and find the creators that, you know, align with what you're trying to do. And, you know, you don't have to listen to everything they say, but, you know, try to learn. And that's why this video with the rock wall is so important to me. And I think that's why I've delayed it because I just, I need to put every ounce of energy into it because it really is, it's the first thing you do when you're planting something. And if you are using the wrong material, then what you're going to be doing with that, that seedling for the rest of its life that lives in that tower is going to either make or break it. So that's what is important. So I've got a lot of information to share and I, I'm, I'm so excited to bring it to you very soon. During the summer break is something that, you know, I will work on and it will happen. I promise you. I wanted to do the cleaning one first because I just saw that comment and I was like, this woman or person has a backpack and they want to sell the towers. It just, it broke my heart. So don't let that happen to you. Ask a friend. Barter with tomatoes. All right. So of course my pick of the week is this tower. It's just well done, well built and just looks amazing. Um, at every angle, it's so healthy. Um, this person has nailed their greens. So I hope that they're got a second tower and they're going to build out some tomatoes and cucumbers and peppers and all that really, really good stuff. So, um, you know, congratulations to them. And then that brings me to here. All right. So here's what's going to happen. So I'm going to work on that, uh, rock wall video over the next week or so and get that out to you. I also have some other really great ideas, but what I'm going to be doing is spending some time with my family over the next couple of weeks. Um, cause it's summer here in Newport and there's a lot to do. So, um, the podcast is going to take a summer vacation. We will be back in a few weeks, um, with a lot of really great stuff, a lot of great content. Um, but it takes a lot of effort to put this together. And I just want to take a little bit of time and just really come back with the first show, kind of late summer, early fall, um, with beautiful content and, um, some, some fun things to bring to you. So I hope that you guys have a wonderful 4th of July that's safe and you enjoy it. Um, if you didn't catch all of this podcast, go back and watch it on the rewind again, it's episode 14. Um, and, uh, sorry about the earbud thing in the very beginning of the Newport flower show. That was a bummer that I did not do that. It was kind of a busy morning here. So thanks for joining me and we will see you in a few weeks. Enjoy your summer, enjoy your family and be safe.
