 In landscaping, soil is one of the most important factors. It's usually overlooked and probably the root of all problems. So the soil you use is completely situational. For example, if I'm doing a decorative pot or something that's not truly in the ground, I'm using a nice potting mix. My choice is always BM7s, where we grow our own flowers in. It drains very well and has the nutrients I'm looking for. Let's say I'm in a flower bed with a lot of clay soil, but I'm putting a lot of staple piece plants that I expect to stay for a long time. I'm not looking to change that entire flower bed. I'm trying to change around the plant and for it to exist in its clay soil. So all I'm using right there is a compost. When I'm planting a tree, for example, I can't amend the entire soil over like a 12 foot by 12 foot square. Trees would cost $10 million. So what I do is I plant that tree in its native soil and I use a compost or like a soil conditioner to help it grow in its natural environment.
