 If you are to describe a farmer, what is the first thing you are likely to say? I am sure some would say a person who plants and harvests crops. You are not wrong for saying that. Now, we are going to learn the tools used by farmers some years ago, but are no longer in use today. Farm mechanization. How do we describe that? It simply means the application of engineering principles and technology in agricultural production. The way many adults wouldn't use a phone with buttons, instead would rather go for a touchpad phone, is the same way a farmer would rather use some machines on their farms than do the work themselves. What are the advantages of farm mechanization? It saves labor that could otherwise be useful elsewhere. Will you wash your clothes yourself when you have a washing machine at home? No, I don't think so. It reduces health hazards and accidents. Imagine a farmer using cutlass to clear his farm when he could have used a machine for the same purpose to avoid injury. It saves time. It ensures that work is done as soon as possible. There could be some disadvantages in using all these machines. Some of them are It is expensive to buy, hence requiring huge capital investment. Despite the usefulness of these machines, there are other crops that cannot be mechanized. From today's lesson, we can say that farm mechanization is the introduction of technology to agricultural production. See you in the next class. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
