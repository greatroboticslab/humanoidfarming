 Music This week on Aegis Iron we're going to do something special, something I've wanted to come and see for many years. That's Eastern Washington Agricultural Museum in Pomeroy, Washington. My old friend David Ruark, who I've known by telephone and email only for, oh my gosh, well over 10 years, possibly longer than that, has invited me to come out here to see their museum. But this is far larger than I even conceived pulling up. I thought it might be a building, but you've got two buildings plus outdoor displays here. And this all started not that long ago. Seems like 2004 would be forever, but my gosh, that was the inception of it. Tell me, how did it get going? Well, there was a group of about eight of us got together one evening and somebody had kind of planted the seed. But we talked, well, how about some old iron machinery and all here at our fairgrounds? And we think it'll work. And we kind of decide maybe it's worth a go. So here we are several years later. This is in a unique part of the United States. This is the Palouse country. And it's the rolling hills of Eastern Washington. So this museum not only is interesting because of the fact that it's just a great collection of stuff, but you have equipment out here you won't find any other place in the country. You have kind of a rare Harris side hill combine hillside hillside. I'm sorry. I'll get that right one of these days. I'm a midwesterner. It's all side hills back there. Describe that combine because it's unique. You'll never find it outside of this area of the country, would you? Not generally California some, but it's we have steep hills here. And the combine is designed as one side went down, the other side went up. And so Harris leveled more than any of the other makes. And so they were very popular. So the running gear itself would actually literally tilt to go to keep the combine level. Basically the new ones, the axle tilts, but on these one tire would go up and the other go down and they would still stay parallel. This was a horse drawn. Horse drawn originally and later tractor drawn, yes sir. How many horses did it take to pull something like that? Depend on the soil and the terrain, but 33 with head was not uncommon. So a large part of what you're doing here is not only the pleasure of the museum itself and showing these people, it's preserving this equipment then. Yes sir. Because that would have been lost if it hadn't been for efforts such as yours or the members of this group, they've gone out there and found it and then restored it. So David, if they want to get the information, the telephone number to take a tour, they should go to your website then. That's where the great starting point. Yes sir. So we'll return next week to continue our tour of the Eastern Washington Agricultural Museum. Hi, I'm Dave Mowitz. Thanks for watching.
