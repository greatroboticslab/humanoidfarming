 We're out here in Barnsley. We're just checking this place out. Wow. Okay. No rains coming through. Good sign. I want to protect my phone from the rain. This elevator is small. Dang, my hand is getting in the way. I'm just covering it up because, yeah, I just don't want the rain to get on it. It's not marked no trespassing, so. There ain't no way I'm climbing to the top of this hovel. I might. Yo, Leah. I'm going to see if I can climb. Oh, wait. No. Looks blocked off. Look at that. It's blocked. I mean, you see? Yeah, I don't know how he blocked it off. Like, he, I don't even know who this is. Look at those nails. Oh, I've got no clue how he did that. What's that play on? Oh, climbing with one hand. It's a workout. You. What are your thoughts? Pretty cool. There's five here. Very, um... Can I spread a bit of power? Yep. Yeah, this is probably the oldest elevator I've been in. Actually, no, I've been in one that was built in 1905. No, imagine if he actually climbed it. We can't. Oh, really? Yeah, he put a, um, beam there. Uh, yeah. Well, I kind of wasn't really wanting to. No! What's going on? I don't want to take one anyway. This stuff is dikenish cool. I'm going to take some... Oh, look at that. We got rotten boards out here. Oh, second floor! I'm going to, wait, I'm going to... Bro stuff. You're scared? This is literally like, I don't know, horror movie type thing. I break through. I have no one to blame but me. This thing is literally on the brinks of collapsing. Go down! Go down if you don't want to. I'm coming down anyway, like... These boards do not seem stable. Right. Okay. Look at that. Something epic, I suppose. Too bad we can't go to the top because he blocked it off. What? Why did you see me? What? Why did you just see me? Well, I'm going to go outside and take some pictures. What the hell? Why did you see me here? Why are you hanging out here? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do you think? I'm going to go outside and take some pictures. Are you here? What are you doing?
