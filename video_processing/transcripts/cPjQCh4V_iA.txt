 I'm Befi Nakwak, 24 years old. I'm currently under the program of apprenticeship. I'm being trained to become a tractor operator and also a booking agent. I'm also encouraged at the age of 55 I can be able to be in the same league as young and youthful people. They are in their 20s, 30s, I'm at my 50s but I'm also able to do the same tasks that they are able to do. We've been onboarded by Hello Tractors where we link up with a plant owner, a tractor owner, and then we go around plowing, harrowing, ridging and it has been very good because it has motivated me to know that even women can be able to do the operations of a tractor and even we are challenging other women to also join the bandwagon. The corporate tractor is so interesting. When I was able to get a tractor, I was able to build a tractor. I was able to build a tractor. I was able to build a tractor. I was able to build a tractor. In addition to that, if you're able to book 1,325 acres or so, you're able to also acquire a tractor. And that will also empower women who can now be able to join and be in the same league as tractor owners as men and then we also be empowered. So we're also encouraging women to join the program because it is very beneficial. I would like to one day earn income through being a tractor operator and also a booking agent. I wish I had a tractor. Thank you very much. Thank you.
