 and scholars even have this discussion in other books concerning what is the best thing that a person can do in terms of their business and in terms of their livelihood because the prophet said sallallahu alayhi wasalam the best of provision is that which a person has with their own hands right makes with their own hand and the scholars differed because you can do different things with your hands you can farm right you could be a carpenter or do something like that a trade or you could do business all of those are actions that you do with your own hand they differ as to which one of those is best some of the scholars said that transactions and buying going into business is the best of those things and that's because it's something where you're more likely to be self-sufficient and independent another said no it's farming agriculture is the best thing you can do with your own hands because alongside doing things with your hands there is a great amount of to trust in allah that the rain comes trust in allah that your harvest grows trust in allah in all of those things and so it's more than just doing something with your hand it is also trusting in allah subhanahu wa ta'ala
