 Oh, so you got a rusty rounded off bolt that won't fit your sockets and you gotta figure out how to get that thing off there. Look at it, it's just twisting by hand on there. It's not catching anything. It used to be a 10mm. What do you do? Grab one of these gear wrench bolt biters. The flower-like design is also tapered on the inside so it bites into the compromised metal. You do need to give it a little bit of a tap. Nice, and then you just put a socket on that thing and watch this thing come off there. Well, that was pretty darn easy.
