 Well today I'm heading out to a local farm auction. I think they only hold this once a year and it's only about five miles from home so it's worth checking out. I am not looking for anything in particular but it's fun to see what they have. I guess the one thing I'd like to find would be a rotary mower for the B2601. Maybe a 48 inch or 60. 60 might be a little much but anyway we'll see what they have. Could be fun so stick around. So I'm really glad you're here. Tractors as far as we can see. I'm gonna get $20. I'm gonna get $20. Now $10 with a pair of them. $10, $12, $15, $17, $20, $25, $30, $35, $40, $45, $50, $55. I'm gonna get $50, $55, $60, $65, $70, $75, $80, $75, $80. $75, $472. $472 to buy them. Well I've been here about three hours. I can't feel my face. It's really cold today. I found a 48 inch bush hog. Actual bush hog brand. I met a couple ladies who are gonna bid against me if I can get to it. But I'm gonna wait it out and see what happens. I've been ho... I've been... I can't feel my lips. Can't feel my lips. I've been here over three hours and I just remembered I have a hood Well IBC tote just went for a hundred dollars things are going high today Nice clean memory there guys I'm ready guys. We're gonna do give a thousand thousand dollars on the five hundred five hundred five five three four three hundred And a little money now five and five hundred six hundred and five six five six seven No, seven hundred at the here six and a half seven hundred seven hundred and a half seven fifty seven hundred at the here now I've got a here now Seven hundred at the here now six hundred seven hundred at the here now half a level here now eight Eight hundred at the here now seven fifty eight hundred here now seven fifty four seven fifty four Well, I waited around over four hours in the wind and the cold and by cold, I mean Oh, 775. 754, 754. Well, I waited around over four hours in the wind and the cold. And by cold, I mean like 40 degrees with a wind chill of like 30. But that wind is, it gets to you. Anyway, so I found this little four-foot, 48-inch Bushog brand rotary mower. And I looked it up on the internet. And they sell for new for almost $2,000, I think. About $1,900 or so. I looked at some websites where they were being sold, used for $1,000 or more. So I thought, I'm going to bid $750. I set myself up for $750. And it was funny because I had met these two ladies who were very interested in it. In fact, we started talking about it hours ago because they had a question about it. And asked me if I knew anything about Bushogs. So I said, by the way, I'm looking at this too. So I thought they were going to bid against me. Turns out they didn't bid at all. There was another guy bidding. And I started out at $300. And, you know, my strategy for auctions is to, you know, start not high but fair. You know, if I know something's going to go high, especially when you're watching all day long, you can kind of see that things are going high. And I knew this was going to go higher. So I thought, I'm not going to wait and try to start the bidding at like $100 because I know that's not realistic. So, you know, he started out at like asking $1,000. And then, you know, they dropped it to $500. Then he said $3. So I jumped in at $300 and quickly went up to $750. I was not the high bid at $750. The next guy was at $750. So it went from my $700 to his $750. Then they tried to go $800. And I just said no. And they went back and forth a bit. And they dropped it to $775. I jumped in again at $775. And the other guy dropped out. So that's where I landed, $775 plus sales tax. So about an $800 purchase, which I think is fair for that. We'll see. Hopefully it works. I mean, it looks good. It's in really good shape. Barely used at all. It seems to be. So that's where we are. Anyway, I'm going to run home and get the utility trailer. Because even though it's 48 inch, I don't think it'll fit on the truck. And I don't want to scratch up my wheel wells and everything. So I'm close enough to home. I'll go get the utility trailer and they can load it up. Anyway, I like to not leave the auction without anything. Because it seems worthless if you spend the whole day there. So I got something. Well, I'm in the load line. There's about eight trucks ahead of me. So I guess I just give them the receipt and they go get the mower. Load it on the trailer for me. That's nice. It's quite an operation they have here. Really nicely done. Let's push the s 우 h i l o i o i o t o f And stay and keep this up your town So the life and animal lights it in andTraji Yeah really nice and windy. Yeah, really nice. On the road. Yeah. Yeah really nice and coasting yet. Yeah everybody fine. Nice. so So, let's go. So, the corners of the blades are worn off. They're a little bit dull, but not bad. The bottom looks solid. I think it's in good shape. So, let's go. Well, we added a little bit of red to the orange collection. Not too bad. I'm really happy with that purchase. It looks like it's in good shape. I'm not going to try it out until I get to a warmer day. It's getting colder and windier, so I'm going to wrap things up here. But, thanks for watching. I hope you enjoyed today's video.
