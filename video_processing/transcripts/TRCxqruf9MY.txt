 You know what I like about my weed? I basically don't really smoke anyone else's weed. Awesome, thanks Kirk for having us here. You know, last time we were here, the plants were still in the ground and now we have the finished product right in front of us. So tell us about your past history of growing. Okay, well for me, I've always been a fan probably since about 16, 17. And I would come up here in the summertime when my parents divorced and my dad lived here and I would come from the Berry and spend my summer on the lake. The lake always attracted us to Lake County. We had boats and jet skis and sailboats and we worked at the resort in the summer. And at the end of the summer, I would come home and this one kid would bring his weed from his uncles in Santa Cruz and the other kid would bring his weed from his uncles in somewhere else. And then I would bring my Lake County weed. And it was always better than the other ones. We all agreed, you know, even back then. So it just evolved. I really wanted to grow early on in the 90s when people were making a lot of money. And I set up some indoors in San Diego. And that was when I basically just kind of got spotted out and someone broke into the house and robbed my grow. And I wasn't even there at the time. So bam, there's my first bust, 1997. Selling pounds for $5,200 each. You know, a little indoor. But actually, they didn't catch me that day. I ran. I went to Cabo. You know, I had to think about it. Nice. And eventually came back and dealt with that. And continued to grow from there. And eventually bought this property. In 2010, I bought this house. And it's on about 10 acres here. Really good deal. And the house was a mess. It was a dump. Like the first day I got here, I'm bringing plants in the front yard. I have a beautiful picture of the front yard. I can show you just full of plants the first year. That was 2010. Since then, every year I've evolved, experimented, grown in pots. Got rid of the pots because they're just, they use so much water. They're high maintenance. They can fall apart. You know, you bump it with the tractor tire. The thing blows open. It just seems like we have this beautiful obsidian here. And I noticed people, I heard people talking about gopher problems and eating their plants and moles and bulls and all these critters. We didn't have any of those here. So I invested in a tractor and started growing in the ground. I started growing in the ground here in like 2013. And then, low and behold, 2014, they came. Yeah, they raided me. 20 guys came running in here. Basically, they told me, this is too much weed for one person to have. I don't care how many scripts you have, throw that away. We did the 215 as legal as you could be. But ended up kind of winning that case. And while I settled for a community service, where I did time at the cemetery, which wasn't that bad. Yeah. So you experimented for like 10 years. What brought you to eventually go to Advanced Nutrients? Well, here's the thing. I knew about Advanced back then, but it was kind of like out of my reach. And I was up here. There wasn't a lot of options. And everyone stuck to the good old Maxi, you know, here and there. But I always wanted, as we grew, you know, whatever was after I got busted, I could only grow six plants. That was when I learned how to grow like 13 pound plants, you know. And now a lot of that was soil prep and just luck, I guess. I don't know. Some plant foods. But I always had problems with yellowing and stuff finishing correctly, you know. So when I switched to Advanced, which I wanted to all along, your new product line was actually super affordable for us. You know, and I didn't have to think. And the results, the plant, I didn't have a yellow leaf the whole season. Before I had to pay people to yank yellow leaves off. You know, you're buying nutrients that don't even work. And now you're paying people to pull yellow leaves. This year, that wasn't that issue at all. It was the most beautiful site. Yeah. That's awesome. Obviously, I used the Advanced Nutrients, Sensi, Sensi Grow line, the powder line. There was variances in how much food you give them by weighing the material, right? So for me, it was like, Wes, what do I give them? Okay, you're in the beginning. Hit them with the voodoo tablets, right? We got them with the voodoo tablets and the A and B. And I started the nutrient regimen with relatively low numbers. And as we progressed, you know, and I'd send you pictures and Wes would come and check on me in the middle of the growth season pretty much, right? And then again at the end. So with being, have Advanced Nutrients, a company that will come to your farm, answer every single phone call, text you right back with answers. Cause I'm sitting there at the tank mixing stuff half the time. The sun's going down. I'm like, dude, is it 2.7? I can't remember. You know? But anyways, those are the shots that just, it made me able to basically grow that whole field by myself after work. You know? Just taking all that off the plate, trying to figure out your own nutrients, trying to build all these things. Yeah, it's possible and it's a wonderful thing. But I mean, for me, it's just, I don't have that much time in the day. I'd rather, I'd rather use a company that's going to stand behind me, that's going to show up at my doorstep, you know, and hash it out, right? So your cost effective regimen could still produce great products, you know, that we have here right in front of us today. So you want to tell us a little bit about the COAs and how they, you know, they were compared to last year's harvest? Sure, exactly. Well, in the past, we grew seeds mostly and we'd have different phenotypes. So the tests were still around the 25 range for the most part. Last year, I think we're a little bit lower. We, we, we just probably didn't have the quality genetics last year that we wanted. This year we went with the high quality of the genetics and, and the COA for the God's breath was, was, uh, when the lady told me at the local distro here, she goes, yours tested really high. And I go, really? And she said 30, God's breath is 33.58 THC, 40% total cannabinoids and 3.618 for the Terps. Wow. So 33.58, sun grown, outdoor grown in native soil in the ground in obsidian using advanced nutrients. Yeah, there you go. 33.58. That was one of the highest in your entire county, right? I believe so. I was with another group of farmers and, and they actually, one of them asked me, 40% total cannabinoids, dude, really? Like, yeah, I guess. It just showed me that I think I can do that again and again and again and again. And we can get 33 ones. Why can't we hit 35 maybe? Yeah, exactly. With something even higher or maybe shoot higher or maybe just try and stay over 30. If I can grow everything over 30 in this farm in our method, which I believe can, using the advanced with the health of the plant, I think our, our COAs are going to speak for themselves. The products that come out, I know that your product line is designed to be at the specific need of the plant's time. And I think those, you have to hit those nails on the head for that plant to want and to produce what it needs, right? Totally. So besides the fact that we're going to make the field bigger next year because we're, we're, we're through the initial, you know, permitting process. I'm going to do the same thing. I'm going to call you. I'm going to say, Wes, which one's next? And, and, and I believe that we can do it like that. I'm going to keep the planning schedule similar, keep the plant size similar, keep it manageable. It was still a very, very good yielding garden in the peak of the heat of the summer. And then, you know, the, the, the budding cycle was seemed like it was overnight. It's nice to have a local support staff like you guys, because that, that to me, we could have chosen another line, right? But I remember talking about it as a family farm. So it's me and my mom and my brother. And I'm like, who else is going to like come to the farm, dude, and help us? They don't do, companies don't do that. I mean, that's just not part of the, their culture. Your, your guys are, are the cannabis culture. This is what we do with each other. It brings people together. You know what I mean? Who doesn't want to like smoke really good weed? Yeah. You know? Well, Kirk, you seem to crush it this year. You know, you can test it crazy high in THC total cannabinoids and your terpenes are off the chart. And you did it all while, you know, on a cost effective regimen. So I say we put it to the test and let's try it out. Awesome. I just happen to have some slurty three from a Baccio farms, 2022 harvest right here. Let's fire it up. You know what I like about my weed? I basically don't really smoke anyone else's weed. Just kind of like, maybe it's just not good. No, I don't know. But I noticed that my weed gets me high a lot longer, like twice as long. It just seems like, especially if you say you're not supposed to smoke weed somewhere and you smoke weed and like at work maybe, and you just know you still feel high five hours later, like four hours later when the day, you know, whatever. But that's a good thing. Wow. Well, it seems like the entire puzzle has come together and you're hitting good test results. Your product looks great. It smokes great. It hits great. So can't wait to be a part of it next year. Yeah. So let's look for Baccio farms at a dispensary near you. Yes. Soon enough. Yep. Thank you, Wes. Awesome. Thanks, Kurt. Appreciate it. Thank you for all your help. Definitely. Thank you. Great crew. Thank you. Thank you.
