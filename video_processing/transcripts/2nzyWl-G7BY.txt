 Did you know that oats start out as grass and we actually eat its seed? It's a plant grown for its seed and while usually it's humans that eat oatmeal and rolled oats, one of the most common uses is as livestock feed. Cats and dogs can eat it as an alternative to regular grass because it often has pesticides. I actually grew some for my neighbor's cat. But also for endless amounts of oatmeal. When it turns yellowy-brown, the oat kernels have matured and they're ready to harvest. So we still have a few weeks to wait. After all, who doesn't love the creamy texture of an oatmeal? Pull.
