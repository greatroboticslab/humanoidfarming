 I spent a long time running I never knew then what I know I know now that the fruits they always come in but you can't go around just knocking them down it takes a long time to show in we plant the seeds then and we look at them now but the roots are always growing no matter if I'm there or never around whatever grows will grow whatever dies will die whatever works will work whatever flies will fly whatever fails will fail what's meant to soar will soar I am planting seeds nothing more it's like your whole life you've been training for this moment and when the time comes you just disown it meaning you just surrender don't control it not interested in the clay pots and mold it or sitting next to the path trying to unfold it or waiting for the fruits to fall down toward you let it go and now you're flowing feeling quite gorgeous so you take steps away instead of towards it what a rush feeling freedom with nothing to hold we've been taught that what you touch will always turn to gold and now we're learning when we let it go it overflows with no credit to take cause no credit is home a higher power working deeper when the seeds are sold and when the seeds are true then there's seeds of gold but the real gold is joy when life starts to flow and when it does you just smile cause now you know I spent a long time running I never knew then what I know I know now let the fruits they always come in but you can't go around just knocking them down it takes a long time to show in we plant the seeds then and we look at them now but the roots are always growing no matter if I'm there or never around whatever grows will grow whatever dies will die whatever works will work whatever flies will fly whatever dies will die whatever dies will die whatever dies will die what SEOs will I am planting seeds Whatever grows, we'll grow Whatever dies, we'll die Whatever works, it works Whatever flies, we'll fly Whatever fails, we'll fail What's built to soil, what's sold? I am planting seeds And nothing more Whatever grows, we'll grow Whatever dies, we'll die Whatever works, when it works, it works Whatever flies, we'll fly Whatever fails, we'll fail What's built to soil, what's sold? I am planting seeds And nothing more When you smile, you just help someone to know that they're caring about them and that you'll love them
