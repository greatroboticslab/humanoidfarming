 What's up readers, it's Mr. Quarter. The title of our story is The Life Cycle of a Pumpkin, written and read by me, Mr. Quarter. How does a pumpkin come to be? Read along and soon you'll see. Pumpkins start as a little seed planted in the ground. Pumpkins need a lot of water to grow. Then they grow to become a sprout. This is the small beginning of the plant. You can see the arrow pointing to the sprout. After the sprout, the pumpkins become a vine. This is a long green plant that grows on things like a pole or the ground. Next comes a green pumpkin, but it is not done growing yet. Last, the pumpkin turns orange, like the normal ones we see. It usually takes between 45 and 55 days for a pumpkin to grow. After the pumpkin grows, we can carve a funny face into it or use it for food. So that was our story, The Life Cycle of a Pumpkin, all about how a pumpkin comes to be.
