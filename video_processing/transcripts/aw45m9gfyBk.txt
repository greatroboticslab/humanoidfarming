Science & Technology
 We're winter crops, we're cereal, canola and pulses. Lentils are probably the big one through the Wimmer and now the Mallee. Summer weed control obviously is paramount in our area. We see a lot of new products coming out. Overwatch has got that fit around that price tag and in the market. And again it's doing a fantastic job in the paddock. When you've got a product that controls a variety of weed spectrum, it makes sense and it's got a really nice fit. A product like Overwatch standalone is doing a fantastic job in the paddock on rye. Also Biofora to keep the products alive, we just don't want to be overusing them. And I'm sure Overwatch going forward will be one that we want to take as much pressure as we can off it to make sure that there is longevity in the product. Definitely the Group Q, it's going to provide us much more flexibility in what we're doing. Biofora especially being an issue, having that activity under canola for us is fantastic. I think that's where Overwatch, especially under canola, has some real flexibility. Even under wheat and barley, we've seen it 12-13 weeks later and they're still killing Biofora coming through. I think what it's allowed us to do is actually change our options that we normally have in the paddock. You look at Overwatch with a Callisto product from Syngenta and it's giving some great activity on broadleaf weeds as well. And probably more importantly, we're getting the weeds that we're actually targeting which that's what we're all about at the end of the day.
