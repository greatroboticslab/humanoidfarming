 Pest damage on the golf course. Our bulls arrived here in an area which is under attack from birds seeking out larvae, in this case leather jacket larvae crane fly heading into the spring. Now we aim to keep the damage away from the main areas with limited management practices such as greens and other areas but it's not a total solution. Let me see if I can find a larvae for you. So the golf course is a natural environment where we'll find many insects but we can look to natural feeders such as starlings will help but we want to look for the golfer's support and it's understanding there might be periods where there's some damage but it will recover.
