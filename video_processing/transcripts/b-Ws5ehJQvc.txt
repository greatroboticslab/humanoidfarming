 If your last frost day is anywhere in March, it's time to start sweet potato slips. Here's one way to do it. If you have a sunny windowsill, take your sweet potato pointy side down and place it in a cup of water. You want to keep half of the sweet potato at least out of the water so it doesn't rot. As long as the inside temperature of your house is not too cold and the sunlight day length is long enough, it will start sprouting. After three to four weeks, you should start seeing growth at the bottom and your leafy greens up top. These pieces up top are what we call sweet potato slips. You can take these slips and pop them off and put them directly in the soil and give them time to root with lots of moisture and that will create a whole system of sweet potatoes under the ground or if it's still too cold outside because you need your nighttime temps to be 50 or higher consistently, pop this off and root it in water just like this and then when it has developed its own root system, you'll put it straight in the soil and it will grow tubers.
