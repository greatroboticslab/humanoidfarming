Education
 I study agriculture at the University of Alcindy. Here are three reasons why. Number one, I wanted to study biology because life is the most complicated expression of chemistry we have ever seen and the fact that the universe made microbes and animals and plants and silly little primates that invented tax funds is absolutely worth studying. Number two, I wanted to study plants because they're adorable and the basis of every ecosystem on earth. Number three, I wanted to study food because everything in our society requires that we're all adequately fed and we still haven't managed that.
