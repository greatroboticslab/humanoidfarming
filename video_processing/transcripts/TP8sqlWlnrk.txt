Howto & Style
 If I asked you what the pH of your soil was, would you know what it is without testing it? Probably not. There's a lot of testing supplies online. You can even send a soil sample off to know what your pH is. But what if I told you that there's a simple way that I learned from an Amish farmer on how to test your pH by simply looking at it? That's what we're going to talk about. Let's go. So growing up when I was first getting into gardening, as you guys know, I grew up near an Amish community. And a lot of these Amish people, they basically, they center their lives around their farms. So getting to know some of them, I've talked to a lot of them and kind of seen how they farm. And there was a gentleman that I was speaking to. And one day I asked him how he tested his pH. I was simply trying to get an ideal pH for my tomatoes at the time. And what he told me really shocked me. He said, I just look at it. And if I look at it, I can tell you the average pH of what it's going to be. Now, I would always use pH test strips, or I've also sent my soil off to a lab. And I've gotten great results. But this really kind of rocked my world because I could simply look at my soil and tell you a rough pH range. Now, a pH test strip or sending your soil off to a lab is going to be very specific, which if you're looking for very specific, that's the route you probably should go. But he simply told me he could tell a pH range of about one to 1.5 points on a pH scale by simply looking at it. And that's awesome. So when you look at soil, I'm going to kind of explain some of the things you look for, some of the textures you'd look for, and the pH range associated with that. So you can have a better idea of what your pH might be. And then you can then go out and treat it if you want, or start growing right in it if it looks good. So it's pretty cool. Let's go. All right. So the first thing he taught me was to look at the color of the soil. Dark color is an indicator of neutral pH. That's because it has a high presence of organic material. A lot of organic material will tend to buffer the pH to make it more neutral, which is 7. Now it might be slightly acidic. So it might be like 6.5, 6.7. Might be slightly alkaline. If the native soil tends to be more heavy in clay, which we'll talk about, it might be slightly alkaline as well. It might be like 7.0, 7.5. And that has a tendency to be slightly alkaline, but that's your window for very dark soil. Very dark soil, again, just has a high presence of organic material, things like compost. Next thing you want to look at is if your soil is light gray or light red. If it's light gray or light red, that's going to have a presence of clay. If your soil has a high presence of clay, it's going to be slightly alkaline. Now, how alkaline really depends on the concentration of clay, but the slipperier that soil is, like if you get it wet and it becomes very slippery, almost like pottery clay, it's going to be quite alkaline compared to if there's a high presence of clay, but it's been amended over time, might be slightly less alkaline. But regardless, you will find that your soil will have some alkalinity to it. And that's because of all the lime that's found in the, you know, the lime that's found in the clay. That's what makes clay slippery to begin with. And so whether it's gray clay or red clay, you're going to have a pH that's going to be higher than seven. Might be 7.2, might be 7.3, might be 8.0. It just depends on how much there is and how much it's been broken down. But clay soil will always have a slightly alkaline pH. And last but least, acidic soil can be associated with sandy soil. And what he told me is that if you look at your soil and it has that sandy texture to it, if it looks light in color, but you pick it up and it doesn't form a ball, but instead breaks really easily, like this soil does here, that sand is going to have a lower pH. It's going to be more acidic. And that's because of all of the things that are breaking down that sand is made up from, right? So you have silica, which makes up the largest percentage of sand, but you have a lot of sulfides, you have, you know, iron pyrites, and you have quartz and granite and all those things that, that sand is made up from, and they're breaking down. And that has a tendency to have a more acidic nature to it. And so if you look at your soil, it may look, again, like I said, this looks like it might have clay in it. And there is some clay, but we've actually amended this with a fair amount of sandy soil. Because of the root crops that we were growing here, we wanted really good root development. So we amended with some sandier soil. And what you'll notice when we squeeze, yeah, it has similar color to clay soil, but it does not, you couldn't make a ball with this if you tried. Even if this got wet, wouldn't make a ball. And that's because, that's because this soil has more sand in it. And because of that, this soil is going to have a pH that is less than seven. It might be five, 5.5, might even be around 6.5, but all of that is slightly acidic. And so because it's not super dark, it doesn't have a whole lot of organic material in it. We still have to re-amend our soil, by the way. But because it has not been re-amended with lots of compost and organic material, we know that the pH is going to want to revert to its kind of natural pH, which sandy soil, slightly acidic. I can bet you that this soil is slightly acidic. Without even doing a pH test, I would almost guarantee you, if I were to take the pH of this, it'd be right around kind of 5.5. And that's just without even, just by looking at it, without even testing it. So I think it's very fascinating. I think that a lot of you could benefit from this because once you realize that all soil around the world will follow this pretty similar pattern, it gives you a window. That window does not have to be precise. You know, tomatoes, they don't need a pH of exactly something. They just need a pH that is slightly acidic. And so as long as it's slightly acidic, it gives you a good, you know, a good guide that you can go by. If you want to grow something like brassicas that like a more alkaline soil, you know that if it's very, very sandy, you might have some problems. You might need to amend with some compost, or you might need to add some dolomitic lime, something like that, right? To raise the alkalinity up a little bit, right? Raise that pH. And so that's really all I got for you guys today. It's super simple. And again, these are just little tricks that I've picked up throughout my life, different parts of my life that I got to talk to people and absorb their information like sponges, people that make their living and their, you know, their livelihood around farming and agriculture. It's just super cool to learn. And I love to pass these tips on to you guys. So if you did enjoy and you learned something new, give me a like. I appreciate that. I'll spread these videos around.
