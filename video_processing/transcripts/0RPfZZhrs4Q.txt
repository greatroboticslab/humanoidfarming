 If you've driven west on Louisiana's interstates, you've no doubt seen hay transports carrying hay to our neighbors in Texas. Livestock producers there have all but run out of hay due to this year's extreme drought. Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Dr. Mike Strain is urging Louisiana producers who have hay and want to sell that hay to Texas livestock producers to log on to the LSU AgCenter's Market Maker website. Strain said while Texas is in trouble, Louisiana has also had its share of problems related to this year's spring drought. Our friends in Texas are having a desperate time in drought. The LSU AgCenter has just released their drought figures and the losses from the drought on Louisiana producers was in excess of $395 million. And so we're also overall over 17,000 head of cattle were liquidated because there's nothing to feed them. Hay stocks are going to be low because we had an extended drought. We've gotten some rain, but we had to have that growth. We had to have a lot of that growth through August and July and June and that was the driest time. And we had just recently, just recently with the last group of tropical storms gotten sufficient rainfall. They're cutting hay and it looks pretty good, but I can tell you around the 15th of February of 2012, hay is going to be short. Strain said the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development continues to allow large round of hay bales to be transported to abreast.
