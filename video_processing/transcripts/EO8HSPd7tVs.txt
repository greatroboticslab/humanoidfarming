 Inside warehouses across Southeast Asia, a revolution in exotic farming is unfolding. These phytons are carefully bred in climate-controlled facilities. The secret? These animals' moneymakers aren't just bred for their exotic skins. They are part of a market for leather goods, traditional medicine. Curious to learn more? Pythons belong to the Pythonidae family, which includes around 26 species. The ball python, a popular pet, is part of this family. All pythons are non-venomous, meaning they lack venom harmful to humans. Pythons are generally docile, but may bite or constrict in self-defense or when mistaking a hand for food. All python species are constrictors, using their strength to coil around prey and squeeze until its heart stops. In 2013, an African rock python, one of the world's largest snake species, escaped from its enclosure in Canada and tragically killed two young boys. Similarly, in 2009, an 8-foot-long Burmese python in Florida fatally constricted a 2-year-old girl while she slept in her crib. These heartbreaking incidents underscore the potential dangers posed by these massive snake species. Pythons are easy to farm and offer high economic value. In traditional python farming, the enclosure is usually rectangular with a wood or steel frame and wire mesh. The length matches the python's size, while the width and height are designed to allow enough space for the python to move and be properly cared for. Pythons have a hunting behavior where they target moving prey, capturing it by striking and biting, then coiling around the prey until it suffocates before swallowing. Their inward curving teeth and flexible jaw structure allow them to consume large prey. Pythons are typically fed warm-blooded animals like chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, or rats, as well as meat from livestock, poultry, or slaughterhouse byproducts.

Pythons catch their prey and constrict it until it dies before swallowing it. Unlike some animals that bite and tear their prey, pythons swallow it whole. A large python can consume an animal weighing up to 1 kilogram and then may sleep for an entire month before eating again. Pythons usually hunt moving animals, so to get them to eat food that isn't moving, people use a stick to make them as they lay eggs. Before laying, farmers must prepare a nesting area with materials like straw or fabric scraps. A python can lay between 10 to 100 eggs, though the size and weight of the eggs are typically similar. The laying process can take several hours to a few days. After laying the eggs, the female python coils around them, keeping her head raised. Newly hatched pythons typically weigh around 100 grams and measures 40 to 60 centimeters in length. Once they emerge from their eggs, they start moving and familiarizing themselves with their new surroundings. The python oil is used in various fields, mainly in traditional medicine and cosmetics. In medicine, this oil is believed to have anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties, and is used to treat joint and muscle conditions, such as back pain, arthritis, and sprains. It is also used for skin care, helping to soften, moisturize, and improve dry or cracked skin. Python skin is often used to make luxury items like handbags, shoes, and accessories. It is valued for its unique texture, durability, and exotic look. The scales on the skin create a distinctive pattern, making it popular in fashion. The skin is also flexible and strong, allowing it to be made into high-quality, long-lasting products. For the most part,üyorsun is STRA, found in our eBS, and aest.

Did you know that canned tuna once reigned as America's most popular seafood for over 50 years? From 1950 to 2000, more than 85% of American households had a can of tuna stashed away in their pantry. But have you ever wondered what goes into making this beloved snack? In this video, we'll walk you through the production process, showing how tuna is carefully prepared before it reaches your can. Canned tuna emerged as an alternative to canned sardines in the early 1900s. Tuna was initially considered a trash fish, but in 1903, cannery owner Albert Halfhill, facing a sardine shortage, began picking albacore tuna in tins. His first 700 cases sold well, and by 1914, his cannery produced over 400,000 cases annually. The mild, pure flavor of albacore gained popularity, and World War I propelled canned tuna into the mainstream as a portable, non-perishable protein source for soldiers. By the 1920s, canned tuna became a staple in American households, valued for its affordability, nutrition, and convenience. Tuna is an ocean fish that inhabits tropical and temperate waters, where they often form large schools. Tuna fishing is conducted on a large scale, primarily using fishing nets or cranes on specialized fishing vessels. As the fish gather, baited hooks are cast, and tuna are swiftly holed aboard upon biting. These vessels are equipped with refrigeration rooms to preserve the tuna immediately after they are caught. After being stored on the vessels, the tuna is placed in specialized containers and lifted onto trucks using forklifts. From there, the trucks transport the tuna to processing factories, where the fish undergo various processing procedures. Tuna processing starts with workers removing the tail and head using cutting machines. Next, the fish is cut along the spine and divided into four pieces, and the spine is carefully removed. The belly, which is soft and flavorful, is also separated for special use. For specific durations, which are carefully calculated based on the size of the fish, larger tuna require longer cooking times to ensure thorough heating, while smaller ones need shorter durations to avoid overcooking. After being pre-cooked, the tuna is cooled in a room with controlled temperatures to get it ready for the final cleaning steps. Workers remove the skin of fish, then the backbone, small pin bones, and red meat are carefully removed, leaving the tuna loins clean and polished. The clean skipjack loins are usually used to make chunk light tuna, while albacore loins are used for solid white tuna. The process of cleaning tuna requires meticulousness and a large workforce. It not only demands skill, but also requires intense focus to ensure each piece of meat is kept in perfect condition. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
