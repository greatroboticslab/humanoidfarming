 New to seed starting? O'Toole's makes it easy, so let's go shopping. We need some compostable plant pots, some Espoma organic seed starting soil, and plenty of seeds. And while they're not completely necessary, if you want a little extra head start, a heat mat or grow lights, both are really great. On the back of those seed packets, you're going to see instructions for when you should start those seeds and how deep they need to be in your soil. To streamline this process, I like to pre-prep all of my trays and all of my plant pots by filling them with soil and getting them ready to actually plant seeds into. Actually, planting the seeds is very easy. Follow the instructions on the back of the seed packets and note that these will be different for the different types of seeds you're choosing. Personally, I like to start tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, and cabbage. I'm a little extra and have a greenhouse, but you can use plastic covers to keep humidity in as well. As long as they're getting water and sunlight, you should be good to go. Keep them watered and warm and you should see seedlings soon.
