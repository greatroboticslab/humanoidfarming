 Music My name is Christine Terpsma and I'd like to welcome you to Delta, a community situated just about 30 kilometres south of Vancouver, British Columbia. Music Delta is an important area for agricultural production, and farmers here produce an astounding diversity of products, from vegetables such as potatoes, corn, beets, peas and beans, to seasonal berries such as blueberries and cranberries, to dairy and beef production. Delta supplies large quantities of farm products for both domestic and international markets. Music What makes Delta unique, apart from being a farming community close to an urban centre, is the fact that it is also an important area for wildlife. The Lower Fraser River Delta is Canada's top important bird area, and facilitates an influx of birds that use the Delta as a stopover on their migration along the Pacific Flyway. Waterfowl, shorebirds, passerines and raptors are among the variety of species that rely on the Delta for feeding, staging and or breeding habitat. Music Since Delta is a significant area for agriculture and wildlife, our local farming and conservation communities work together to ensure the viability of both. One example of farmers and conservationists working together is through the Delta Farmland and Wildlife Trust. Established in 1993, the Delta Farmland and Wildlife Trust, or the Trust, is a not-for-profit, charitable organization, whose mission is to promote the preservation of farmland and associated wildlife habitat in the Fraser River Delta through sustainable farming and land stewardship. Music The Trust offers six stewardship programs to farmers, all of which involve managing agricultural land in a way that promotes good soil stewardship and also maintains wildlife habitat. The program we will be speaking about today is the Trust's Hedgerow Program. A hedgerow is often described as a linear barrier of native trees and shrubs. The Trust plants hedgerows on Delta farms to benefit both the farming operation as well as create wildlife habitat. On a farm, hedgerows provide windbreaks, buffer zones to roadways, and can assist with drainage control. Hedgerows also function as wildlife corridors that connect habitat fragments and improve habitat diversity. Music Since 1993, the Delta Farmland and Wildlife Trust has planted a total area of over five acres of hedgerow habitat in partnership with Delta farms. In 2013, the Trust partnered with UBC to do some of its first research to formally quantify the benefits of hedgerows. Specifically, the Trust wanted to know, which ecosystem goods and services do hedgerows really provide? Music My name is Bryana Teal and I'm a Master's student at the University of British Columbia. And I've been working with the Trust to answer one part of that question. Specifically, I've been working with a team to look at how hedgerows might be able to mitigate or lessen the effect of climate change. Music There's an important relationship between climate change and agriculture. As climate events become more volatile, farmers will face sizeable challenges to continue to grow enough food to meet a growing population. At the same time, agriculture produces approximately 15 to 30 percent of the human produced greenhouse gas emissions around the world every year. Music These emissions come mainly from fertilizer use, from animal production, and from agricultural expansion. Changes in agricultural practices are helping reduce emissions, and there is great potential for further reductions. Another option is to offset emissions on the farm through sequestering carbon in agricultural soils and perennial vegetation. It's possible that agricultural landscapes could one day be a net sink for greenhouse gases. Though there are many different management options that would enable agriculture to mitigate climate change, likely many will have to be used simultaneously to be effective. Music The planting of hedgerows, which are perennial grasses, shrubs, and trees on the edges of farm fields, is one such management option to mitigate climate change. As the plants in the hedgerows grow, they sequester carbon in their leaves and stems over time. Organic materials from these hedgerows build up in the soil, which stores carbon. In this way, the hedgerows can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions that come from other sources. Music The UBC Delta Farmland and Wildlife Trust Research Project investigated how hedgerows could be used to mitigate climate change across the entire Delta region. We did this by looking at three management options available to the Trust. First, should the Trust continue planting their hedgerows? Second, should they investigate remnant hedgerows, which is existing vegetation on farms that could be protected? Or should they look at the option of a combination of these two activities? Music For one year, we monitored eight farms in Delta to quantify mitigation potential of planted and remnant hedgerows. We measured the emissions of the three main agricultural greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, using simple chambers. We also quantified the carbon stored in the soil under the hedgerows down to one meter. And the carbon stored in the woody biomass of trees and shrubs in the hedgerows. We have also analyzed satellite imagery to determine how much perennial vegetation there is on farmland in the Delta. And by how much this area could be increased by planting edges of farm fields with hedgerows. Music Preliminary results of our research indicate that planting hedgerows could store more carbon than protecting existing ones. But at the same time, losses of existing hedgerows could result in greater greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Our analysis shows that there is approximately 1,800 hectares of perennial vegetation currently on Delta farmland. We have also estimated that there is potential to plant an additional 160 hectares of vegetation to help improve climate change mitigation in the region. Music The results of these analyses will inform the Trust about the ecosystem goods and services provided by hedgerows. And the total climate change mitigation potential of this vegetation on farmland in Delta. Music The research conducted in partnership with UBC will help the Delta Farmland and Wildlife Trust continue to refine the management of its hedgerow program. Should the Trust continue to plant new hedgerows or should it shift its focus to protecting existing hedgerows in the agricultural landscape?
