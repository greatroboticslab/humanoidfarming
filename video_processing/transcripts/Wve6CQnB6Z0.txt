 Hi, my name is Emmanuel Uchechukula-Nemu and I'm building an agricultural leasing service specifically for smallholder farmers here in Nigeria. Our services allow farmers to rent tractors, harvesters and other modern equipments at an affordable rate. Without the upfront cost of purchasing by providing access to better tools, we help farmers increase their crop yields and income. Many Nigerian farmers still rely on labor intense methods which, to be honest with you, limit productivity. Our solutions make modern farming accessible and help boost food security. The business will be particularly attractive to smallholder farmers, cooperatives and local government organizations. Thank you so much for your time.
