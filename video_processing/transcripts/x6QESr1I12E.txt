 Crop farming or livestock farming? Which of the two should you be doing? So you've probably already made up your mind that you really want to go into some form of farming. But which of the two does make sense? In this video, that's what we're going to be talking about. So we're going to be talking about three things. First of all, what is it? What is crop farming? What is livestock farming? Secondly, I'll be giving you guys some major facts about the two things. And then finally, we're going to be going into the differences between the two that are going to help inform your decision between crop and animal farming. And hopefully by the end of the video, you have decided with a lot of clarity on which one you're going to be going with. So stick around right through to the end of the video. Now just in case this is your very first time on the channel, I'm Dr. Daniel, a retired medical doctor who is very passionate about farming. I said farming about six years ago with just 800 chickens. Currently, I've been able to grow this current farm that I own to 12,000 chickens. And I've also been able to, you know, start other farms, do cattle, goats, sheep, and all, you know, these kinds of things. So what I'm telling you right now is actually something that I do understand. I've also grown a lot of crops. I've grown a lot of maize from over 200 acres. I've grown quite an amount of crops. And I can tell you with a lot of confidence that you're going to get the right information. Not only theoretic information, but practical information from things that I have personally implemented. So if this is your very first time on the channel and you want to learn anything about farming, come on, you're in the right place. Just hit the subscribe button, smash the notification bell. That way, you'll never miss out on an upload. So we'll start with crop farming. What is crop farming? Crop farming is the production of crops on a large scale. Now, again, we are talking commercial here. So crop farming could be anything. I mean, you could have your few pots somewhere and you grow food. But we are talking about growing food, growing crops. Not only food, but growing crops on a large scale. And generally, it usually involves using pesticides and herbicides. Now, if you want to grow organic, then you will grow crops without using pesticides and herbicides. When it does come to crop farming, it is very likely affected by the climate of the area and the soils in the area. Some soils in particular areas just don't allow particular things to grow. Because crops, depending on the type of crop, requires particular presence of particular minerals in the soil. Maybe the acidity, that is the pH of the soil. Maybe some crops require some soils to be alkaline or acidic. So maybe the crops could grow there, but you can't get exactly what you need. So particular crops require particular types of soils. Same exact thing when it does come to the climate. Particular crops require particular climates to grow. For me, for example, over here in Uganda, you're not going to find us growing apples. You'll see some people growing apples, but the apples are not tasty. They're not as nice as apples that are grown in a bit cooler areas. Because generally, my country which I'm in is a bit hotter. Same exact thing. You're not going to go to Europe or to lots of parts of North America and find them with fruits like pineapples or mangoes. A lot of them are just going to import them from tropical countries. where the temperature and the climate allows for these things. So the temperature affects so much what is grown. For example, in Uganda, we don't grow a lot of wheat. There's one particular wheat region where they plant a lot of wheat. Because the environment in that area, you would really call it a microenvironment. Because in the whole country, it's only that area that has that kind of environment. And over there, you'll find that the climate allows for wheat to grow. But generally, you don't. Yet, wheat is the most consumed thing in the entire world. So anyone would want to grow it. But I mean, people have tried growing it. And it can grow, but it just won't give you what you want. So the weather very greatly affects what you're able to grow. Livestock farming on the other side is the production of animal products. So there are different types of animal products. Sometimes it is the meat from the animals themselves. Sometimes it is milk. Those are the two most common things. When it does come to birds, you also do have eggs. Then we also have other products like wool from sheep. Feathers from chickens. Manure that does come from animals. All those animal products are generally produced from livestock farming. Now secondly, we're going to some facts for you to understand. This is very important depending on who you are. And what you're hell-bent on to choose when it does come to choosing what type of farming to do. When it does come to animal farming, you need to understand that animal farming uses generally, number one, more water than crop farming. Because animals are going to drink a lot of water and drink a lot of water every day. Unlike crops where you can just water for particular times, and some days you're not going to be water, you're not going to pour water. Especially if you're using technology and you can be quite precise about where you pour the water, you're generally going to use less water when it does come to animal farming. Secondly, animal farming produces more greenhouse gases. So greenhouse gases are gases that people say lead to global warming. You know, those gases. So gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, gases like ammonia, gases like sulfur. All that is going to be produced way more in animals than plants. Because generally it's the worst products, you know, that come from the animal farming. The crop farming on the other side generally produces a better impact on the environment. Now, of course, you have things like the machinery, the tractors, all that that are going to be working inside the crops. They're going to also release a lot of gases. But then you also have the plants themselves trapping a lot of these gases. Especially the carbon dioxide for the environment. So if you're the kind of person who wants to do farming and you're very, very skeptical about the environment, you're like, whoa, global warming and all these kind of things, then animal farming is not the thing for you. Certainly, you should probably be going for crop farming. And then finally, when it does come to the final fact, animal farming generally delivers way more protein than crop farming. So crop farming will generally give you way more nutrition, way more nutrients than animal farming. So most of the other nutrients are going to be coming from crops. The animals are mainly going to be giving you some vitamins like vitamin B, you know, B12 and some things like that. And then generally, they're going to be giving you, you know, mainly proteins. But in terms of nutrition, general nutrition availability, the crops give you way more nutrients than animal farming. Now we'll dive into the differences. The major differences. And I'm going to give you guys nine major differences that are going to help you inform the decision on which of the two that you should be going for. And I'm also going to be sharing with you guys why I personally chose to go with, you know, livestock or animal farming and not crop farming. First, we shall start with the weather dependency. So generally, crop farming is very, very dependent on the weather. So if you have rains, like very heavy rains, if you have hailstones, if you have storms, if you have hurricanes, if you have droughts, all these factors are generally going to affect what crops you grow or where you can grow the crops or if you can even grow crops. Most of these adverse conditions are going to affect your crops. It doesn't matter where you are. So it doesn't matter whether you're growing apples or you're growing vegetables, whether you're growing mangoes, if you have, you know, hailstones, if you have storms, that are generally going to destroy your crops. There is greenhouse farming where people grow crops in more controlled weather and more controlled environments. But that accounts for a very small, tiny percentage of generally what is grown all around the world. You're not going to grow 100 acres of wheat or, you know, 10 square miles of wheat and a greenhouse. You're going to grow it outside. And whilst you might be able to deal with, for example, the irrigation, you might not be able to deal with a hurricane, you might not be able to deal with a storm that could come and generally destroy your flock and you have completely no control over it, you have no prediction over it. On the flip side, animal farming is very marginally affected by, you know, the weather. Now, of course, things like storms and hurricanes can also affect farms like cattle farms and maybe chicken farms and things like that. They can destroy the structures. But generally, because first of all, animals are way more steady. So it doesn't matter whether there is a storm or not. Your cattle are going to probably wither out the storm. Your goats and sheep are going to wither out the storm and they'll be fine at the end of the storm. Secondly, a lot of times, animals can be kept indoors. So for example, you guys can see I have chickens right here. So whether it shines a lot or it rains a lot, they are kind of protected. If I have a very big storm, recently we had hailstone around the farm and it destroyed a lot of my banana plantation. In the background right there, I do have a banana plantation and it destroyed a lot of it. You know, it destroyed even the trees, the flowers, things I had planted around. Of course, it takes time for them to come back. They came back, but a lot of them were destroyed. But the animals continued like nothing did happen, yeah, because they are inside houses. So generally speaking, in animal husbandry, you have less impact of the weather. In addition to that, in a lot of the houses, we even have environmentally controlled houses. So for chickens, for example, people can farm chickens in environmentally controlled houses. These are what we call SC houses. So it doesn't matter whether it's shining, whether it's raining, the temperature inside will be the same all the way through. So if you're wanting to start a farm and you want to start the kind of farm that's not affected at all by the weather, whether it's raining or shining, then the perfect thing for you to do is to start animal farming. Number two will be the time requirements, yeah? So when you do decide to start an animal farm, you have decided to bond yourself, yeah? So animals generally are going to necessitate care, especially if you're going to keep them in humane conditions, in conditions that are favorable for them to produce very well. And you know, to keep them healthy, you're going to need time. And time means physical presence, yeah? So it doesn't matter whether it's Christmas Day, whether it's Eads, whether it is, I don't know, Independence Day, whatever day that it is, animals are going to have to be fed. My chickens over here are going to have to be fed. If you have cattle, you're going to have to milk them. If you're doing rabbits, you're going to have to feed them. It doesn't matter what it is. On every day, time has to be sacrificed, to be present for the farm. On animal farming, though, you only choose to work, or you can only work on particular days. So you can go three, four, five days, or even a week, or even two weeks without doing anything on your farm. Because you'll probably only plant, then maybe spray, then maybe weed, maybe a second weeding, maybe harvesting. And you know, that will probably happen over three months, four months, maybe a year, depending on the type of crop that you're doing. But you don't need to be working every day, yeah? So if you're the kind of person who wants to work, or who wants to start a farm, and you're very certain that you can't be present, you know, every day, or you can't find a way of making sure that people are present every day, because me, for example, I'm not consistently present on the farm, but I do hire people, and these people are consistently present on the farm. So if you're the kind of person who can't be certain that, you know, you can always have people around on the farm to manage the farm, then maybe crop farming is for you. If you can sacrifice and get time, either personally being present, or hiring people to be present on the farm, then animal farming is the thing for you. Unfortunately, though, people cannot be trusted, yeah? So the good thing with crop farming is that since you don't need to be present every time, you can tell yourself that you're going to be present every time something is happening. So during the planting, you'll be present. During the wedding, you'll be present. During the praying, or, you know, whatever kind of spraying, you'll be present. During the harvesting, you'll be present. And that's just, you know, moments, maybe two, three days for each one of them. Unfortunately, when it does come to animal farming, things happen every day. So you're not going to be present each and every day if you're the boss. And so if you don't have good people or people who you can trust, then it might be quite chaotic, yeah? The next step is the physical labor that is required. Now, this is very subjective depending on what kind of animal husband you're doing or what kind of crop farming that you're doing. But generally speaking, crop farming, depending on the part of the world that you're in, is generally less labor intensive compared to animal farming because there has been a lot of machinery that has been developed for crop farming. So, in terms of planting, there are planters. In terms of harvesting, there are harvesters. Even weeding, there are machines. There's extra machines for everything. In terms of spraying the crops, you can use, you know, drones for spraying the crops. So, there's too much mechanization when it does come to crop farming, especially doing it on a commercial level. You're going to be doing it on a really commercial level. Same exact thing when it does come to animal farming, but again, a lot of the things are still going to need some form of human labor, yeah? A lot of it has still been mechanized. For me, for example, I'm using a lot of unmechanized kind of farming. You can see my houses. I'm using a deep litter system. There's very little automation. There's a bit of automation in terms of the drinking system, but again, there's very little automation for the rest of the things. There are farms where with the press of a bat on a computer, you just run everything. I mean, the eggs go in there, the feed goes in there, the water goes in there, the vaccination, everything can just be done on a computer. The eggs get collected onto belts and everything all using a computer and maybe a few people to just carry the trays away and things like that. But generally speaking, you're going to require a bit more physical labor when it does come to animal farming, depending on the kind of farm that you're doing compared to crop farming. Now, of course, crop farming also has a lot of types of farming that require a lot of manual labor, especially picking. So a lot of types of crop farming where you need to pick fruits, for example, picking coffee from trees, picking grapes from trees. A lot of that is very difficult to do with machines. They have tried to do some of it and some of it is being done, but most of it is not. In terms of harvesting, you know, particular things, particular things which grow on trees and you're picking up small tiny things. A lot of those are quite difficult to do with, you know, mechanization. Another one is rice farming, for example. Very difficult to do rice farming with mechanization. You can do a bit of it, but still very difficult. So again, it depends on what particular thing that you're going to be doing. So if you're the kind of person who is very hell-bent on using very little labor, maybe crop farming, depending on the kind of crop, might be better for you. Or you go and mechanize your farm if you're doing animal farming. Now, the fourth factor to consider is the market price variability. So the thing that you need to understand is that farming generally has very volatile markets. The prices don't remain the same. And the reason is the prices are very much affected by the weather. Now, of course, everything's price varies based on demand and supply. And that wouldn't be an issue because almost everything else is the same. You know, vehicles, houses, and everything. The problem there is that in farming, the factors change a lot, especially since the weather is like the main thing in the background. So because of that, the prices in crop farming are very volatile because of the weather. You have the demand and supply bit, but then you also have the weather affecting them. So the prices will be volatile. But it's even much worse when it does come to animal farming because in animal farming, not only do you have the prices being affected by, you know, simply demand and supply, but you also have the prices being affected by the price of the feed, which feed is a crop. Yeah. So for me, for example, currently, I do have chickens and the price of my maize that I'm using as the mainstay for the feed has doubled from Jan till now. It's double what I was paying in Jan. So that's such a huge fluctuation, a very, very huge fluctuation. And that simply means that the final product of the product that you're going to be producing is also going to be very variable, very, very variable. So if you're kind of person who wants something more consistent, generally speaking, you know, you don't want to deal with a lot of price fluctuation, both in supply of, you know, the ingredients that you need, all the raw materials and the product, then crop farming would be more stable. Yeah. But again, sometimes the price of the product in animal farming might not fluctuate even when the price of the feed fluctuates. Yeah. Because in the end, the biggest factor is demand and supply. But generally speaking, you're going to have your prices even fluctuate more when it does come to the animal side compared to the crop side. The next thing is storage. What do I mean when it comes to storage? Storage simply means how long you're able to keep your product. Yeah. So generally, when it does come to crop farming, people can keep their products for a really long time. A lot of times in silos. I mean, someone can have a farm and even, they don't even need to have a silo. They can keep their maize, their grain whatsoever on their farm until the price changes. They can keep it for two months, three months, five months, even eight months or even a year for the price to get better. In animal farming, you can keep your products for some time but not for so long. If you have an animal and it has reached the time for slaughtering, for example, a chicken, it has reached time for slaughtering, you're not going to do so much in trying to keep it. Every time you keep it, you're going to be getting into losses because you're still feeding it and you're having these costs of looking after it every day. So generally, the products, when it does come to crop farming, are more manageable, you know? Of course, unless you're doing like vegetables which are more perishable and things like that. But most of the other products you can keep for much longer. So that way, you can even deal with the unstable market or the unstable prices much better. In animal farming, it's much, much more difficult for you to do that. Even I can keep eggs but I can't keep them for so long. Now, in some things, you might be able to, for example, if it's milk, you might be able to build storage and keep it up in your fridges or freezers. That's really expensive though, unlike a lot of crops where you don't need to put in too much money to do storage. You're going to be using electricity and all these kinds of things to kind of do storage. So generally speaking, in terms of storage, the crops actually take the note. Point number six are the input costs. So generally, how much do you put in when it does come to starting the farm? And when it does come to that, generally, it's much cheaper for crops compared to animals. Much, much cheaper for crops compared to animals because animal farming involves a lot of infrastructure. As you guys can see, yeah? Now, this is like the cheapest you can ever go if you're going to be doing chickens. Yeah? This is one of the cheapest you'll ever do. The kind of harvest are built using paws, using ants, sheeting on the side, using mesh and things like that. But they also still cost a lot of money. For me, it cost me about $6,000 to build one of these houses. I do have four of them. And that's also because I'm in a location where it's quite cheap for me to get a lot of these materials. The poles, the iron sheeting, the cement, everything I use to build this house, I'm like almost perfectly located to be able to get them at the cheapest prices. Currently, all recently, I was helping someone. I have someone who is part of the Farm-Up Academy and by the way, if you don't know what the Farm-Up Academy is, this is a course I personally built to help train people on how to start and build a profitable poultry farm. One that can bring you anything between $5,000 to $15,000 every month. And I have people coming in there every month. They are getting trainings, courses, all the templates that they require when they start their farms. And a lot of them have gone outside there and started their farms and they have been very successful. So if you do want to join and you want to consider joining the Farm-Up Academy, you can join. I'll leave a link in the description of this video where you can join the Farm-Up Academy. It's very beautiful. Trust me, you won't regret joining. Anyway, I have one of my students in the Farm-Up Academy. He wanted to start a farm and he's not available. He's not in the country. He wants to start his farm in Uganda and so I had to help him to coordinate to start a farm somewhere which is quite a distance from here. But the prices are much different from how much it cost me. If he was building the same house, it would probably cost him, you know, maybe $8,000 or $9,000 for which it cost me $6,000. So that's about $3,000 extra. But again, that's still a lot of money for people starting out. So if you have, let's say $6,000, a lot of people you can actually start your farm. If you do have land, you can start farming with $6,000 and do something really sensible. Yet, if you want to do an animal farm, $6,000, if you do already have the land, $6,000 is only going to build you a chicken house. You can imagine. So it's much, much more expensive to start an animal farm compared to a crop farm. Next up is scalability. Same exact thing. So scaling a crop farm is much easier also because a lot of the things that go into managing, you know, and handling a farm in terms of crops are easier when it does come to, you know, crop farming. A lot of the things. So as long as you do have the land, it's much easier. So as long as you do have the land, you do last season's crop, get profit. You can just decide to till a bit more land and plant a bit more land. Yeah. When it does come to animals, scaling it is a bit more complicated. You have to put up more structures, more infrastructure, more of everything. So it's more expensive. It's much more difficult to scale an animal farm compared to a crop farm. Point number eight is the management complexity. So if you've been watching the video, you can certainly tell that it's way more complex to manage an animal farm than a crop farm. So first of all, you know, you have to put up structures. You have to know how to put up the structures. You have to consider, you know, how to do it cheaper and all these kinds of things. Then you're going to have to probably use way more physical labor inside there. So that's also something you're going to have to deal with. You're going to have to deal with making sure that you're present each and every day. So that means training people if you're not going to be present. That means you yourself learning about how to do it. So generally, the complexity of managing it, you have to train people, you have to train yourself. I mean, you have to go through a lot for you to actually manage an animal farm. Remember that you're dealing with living animals. Yeah, living animals that could pick up diseases, die anytime. If you don't feed them today, they're in trouble tomorrow. So it's way more complex to manage an animal farm compared to a crop farm where you can do these things way, way easier. And then finally, profitability. Yeah. So in most circumstances, animal farming is going to be more profitable than crop farming. Why? Because the barrier to entry is much higher. As you can tell from the video, from all the points, almost everything is more advantageous on the crop farming side. Almost everything. It's much cheaper to start, much cheaper to end. to expand on. You know, it needs less time. It needs less physical labor. Generally, everything is easier on the crop side. And what that means is that it's much easier for people to start crop farms than it is to do animal farms. And also because it's more complex to start animal farms, the risk is much higher in terms of, you know, potential losses. And like we've already said, what affects crop farming, especially in terms of like, you know, the harvesting and the prices of what you harvest are directly going to affect your animal farm. because you're going to need a lot of crop inputs in your animal farm. So because of that, I mean, it just means that doing everything on an animal farm is generally going to be a little bit more difficult than doing things on a crop farm. And that simply means that, I mean, if you're going to be doing it and you manage to do it well, then the crop farm is going to be a bit, you know, less cheaper or not as profitable compared to an animal farm. An animal farm is certainly going to be way more, I wouldn't say way more, it really depends on what you're doing, but it's certainly going to be more profitable. Now, it also depends on what kind of crops you're doing. Some crops, if you're doing very high value crops, maybe some types of spices or some types of crops that are quite difficult to grow, then that can also be very, very profitable. So as you can already see, the profitability really depends on how rare the crop is, how complicated growing it is because then most people will not be able to grow it and then you're going to be able to get your profit from inside there. So generally, what would I advise you or what would you consider if you want to start an animal farm or a crop farm? It really depends on, you know, who you are. So your preferences in terms of your availability, how available are you going to be, how skillful or how trained are you to handle the thing, yeah? How much money do you have available to you and also how much profit do you want to get, yeah? Those are the factors that are going to help you determine. I personally, I'll tell you that the reason I chose animal farming over crop farming is because first of all, animal farming for the type of animal I wanted to grow which was chickens requires way less land compared to a lot of things. I started an animal farm on my dad's land and I mean, he just gave me a small section to use, less than a quarter of an acre and on there I put up a structure that takes up 15 meters by 8 meters. That's what he, that's all he gave me, 15 meters by 8 meters I put up a structure and the chickens grew and then after I started getting money then I got money to buy my own land which is where I am right now, yeah? But I just started with that small structure. Now if I wanted to start a crop farm and get substantial money that can give me enough money to buy land, I would have needed to use way more land, way more land which I certainly don't have. My dad doesn't have, no one had at that time, yeah? So generally speaking, that was the main reason but also I love money and I know that animal farming is more profitable, yeah? Livestock farming is way more profitable. So generally I chose that because first of all, I would be able to make more profit and I'm certainly a hard working person so I really didn't care that it requires a lot of input for me as long as at some point I'm able to get the profit and I've been able to get the profit so I've been justified, yeah? I hope you guys have enjoyed the video. Don't forget to hit the subscribe button, smash the notification bell, catch you very soon with another one. Lots of love. Bye-bye!
