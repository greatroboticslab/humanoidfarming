 Nigeria is the highest producer of cassava in the whole world. But when you look at our yeet, we are still producing between 8 to 10 ton per hectare. Compared to Thailand, that they have more than 30 ton per hectare. Brazil, you know. So, with our yeet, what is coming from our farm is very small. And research work that has been done, baseline activities, we found out that the major precursor of that is the issue of the quality of the seed that we are planting. So, the cassava stem people are getting, they are not viable. Even when they are viable, they are disease prone. And that is the essence of, can we begin to replace them with virus-free, disease-free stems that can be able to give us the expected yeet minimum of 20 ton per hectare, up to 40 ton per hectare. The most important issue that farmers were facing before this intervention was the access to improve varieties of cassava, as well as getting, you know, the quality planting materials for this improved variety. So, they didn't have the varieties. And even for the varieties that were available, there were also no planting materials sufficient or high-quality planting materials. So, those were the major problems farmers were having. And, of course, these told on their income and the output of whatever it is they were planting, not getting anywhere close to, you know, the potential of what they should be getting. So, those were major challenges of, you know, the farmers, yeah. When you come to my farmhouse, for example, in Makoadi, you will see the, sometimes I plant the old ones that people have been using one side, and then I plant the improved ones. So, you will see, I will give them equal treatment, very good treatment, but you will see that those old seeds will still not give you anything tangible, as compared to this new system.otenany領 Like farmers coming along here, soupries are not used. Mischa, these people are not in pretty much trouble and Barcelona. They may be helpful and菜 help. This Kings Tech used Crucial recommended and moved to Paris for� if we couldn't Los-R Jacques実 2011 we would normally do better and but to us so we finally learned from Stephen I was living in one of the old Peachtons used in H foul. My staff is very important to me. I have a lot of staff here. I have a lot of staff here. I have a lot of staff here. I have a lot of staff here. This laboratory is mainly focused on making sure that we don't perpetuate pests and diseases to the planting material. And we contributed solutions to counter viral disease problems in the field. This is a virus-free plant, cassava plant. You can see the growth compared to this virus-infected plant. From this you cannot get anything. But from here, the yield will be super. We have also developed what we call, you can call it the pregnancy test kit. From there you can see that this one has only the negative, there's no positive because we have only just one line. And then here you can see two lines showing that the test was positive. This tool is very, very important because you can use it in the field. Farmers can use it in the field to detect whether the plants have infection or not. It's not as if we've not had challenges. We've had some challenges, you know. It's been a new technology that we're adapting to. Where we started from the screen, confined screen laboratory, there was a time we had serious problems with contamination, fungus contamination, because it was like really enclosed. So we had to keep fumigating. But this was also not healthy for the people working there. So that was one of the reasons why we also had to, you know, improvised the screen house method in which we adapted to That's why we try to learn how to do the diversity Look at this logo a little bit. At that point, the şekil arose at Sunkeeper actually, while using this Snape for the castle and since those שנ premiers words. We actually started very small. We started with four hectares. But with time, with, you know, how fast it was growing was because we could harvest the stem and sell. And so we have enough finances to pay our children's school fees and to finance ourselves for education and other things. And at the end of it all, we still have the roots to eat and sell. And so for this reason, we indulge ourselves into doing the cassava farming on a very large scale. That was the reason why we now went in for 42 hectares last season. Now we are going in for 100 hectares of cassava farming, especially the seed. And this is something that makes me proud and makes me happy whenever I see farmers whose lives and livelihoods are being impacted as a result of selling cassava stems, which before now nobody knew that it could be a source of income or source of livelihoods to farmers. But now they are not giving them free away as freebies, but they are actually making money from it, creating wealth in communities, creating jobs and living a decent life. excelent live! Thank you.
