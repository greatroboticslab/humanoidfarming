Nonprofits & Activism
 My name is Lee Bryan, I work for Rocky Mountain Equipment and I'm an agriculture equipment technician. An agriculture equipment technician works specifically on agriculture equipment such as combine harvesters, crop sprayers, tractors, balers, hay equipment. I work in the shop with a team of mechanics to assess customers needs, service and repair and diagnose equipment. So I started with John Deere as an apprentice technician and actually ended up getting recruited to Rocky Mountain Equipment to work for Case IH and I finished my apprenticeship program through Rocky Mountain Equipment and I'm now a journeyman technician. I've been working here just shy of 13 years. What is your advice for? Practical thinking I think is probably the biggest requirement and patience as well. Make sure not to rush anything and just try to take your time to figure out your path. What is your advice for? I guess the best piece of advice is to have an open mind and try anything new. Try to figure out the specific way that you want to go as a mechanic since there's so many different branches of being a mechanic. There's marine, there's on-road, off-road, automotive and agriculture. Coming from a farm family, so I'm used to operating and servicing agriculture equipment. The best part of my job is actually seeing a long, hard job come to fulfillment and to see that the customer is actually out using it.
