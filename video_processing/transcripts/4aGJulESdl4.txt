 This here is called the Rotoped Tracks. It has six elongated track sections that are approximately equal in length to the diameter of the wheel. In order to maintain the track's position on the wheel, an oval frame or a sequence of chains is implemented on the interior of the track, as opposed to using numerous shorter sections. Here is a two-wheels tractor, and I don't have an explanation for this one. This is the Erdvark Bush Rake. The attachment is mounted on a frame that is attached to the back of a tractor and can be raised or lowered using the hydraulic system of the tractor. Operating the rotary bush rake is simple. The tractor driver drives slowly through the area, while the blades or flails of the rake rotate rapidly, pushing the debris to the side for it to be collected by another machine later. Back in the days before the four-wheel drive tractors, engineers focused on enhancing the traction of the two rear wheels. They devised a solution known as strakes, which involved fitting extendable lugs around the tire's edge. These lugs would protrude outwards and firmly grip the soil, thereby providing extra traction. Once the fieldwork was completed, the lugs could be retracted to the circumference of the wheel for safe and easy travel on the road. This is a water pump that is powered by a tractor. Being attached to the tractor, it offers a convenient alternative to traditional stationary pumps. With the hydraulic system allowing for effortless adjustments to its direction. Overall, this water pump is an efficient and effective choice for any irrigation needs. This is the delving tool. It's basically a heavy-duty shank that helps to penetrate the soil really deep, up to 12 to 20 inches depending on the type of soil. Once you've got it in the soil, all you have to do is pull your tractor forward and let the tool work its magic. The shank breaks up and loosens the soil, creating little channels for air, water, and nutrients to move around. This means your plants can grow better roots and get all the nutrients they need to thrive. This is a Kras truck pulling a seven-furrow plow. Kras truck is a robust and rugged truck built by Avto Kras. It's specifically designed to transport heavy loads and military equipment through challenging environmental conditions. This behemoth of a vehicle can carry up to 20 tons, has a diesel engine with 330 horsepower, an excellent off-road ability with its 6x6 drive. This is a soil ridger, also known as a row cultivator or hiller, is an equipment used to create ridges or hills in soil for planting crops such as potatoes or other vegetables. As the soil ridger moves through the field, the shanks cut through the soil and move it to the sides, creating a ridge in the center of the row. The ridges help to protect the plants from weather elements and provide better drainage for the soil. Thank you.
