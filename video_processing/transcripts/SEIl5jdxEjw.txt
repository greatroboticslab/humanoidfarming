Howto & Style
 Welcome to the so so today is march 14th we're two days away from these birds being six weeks old this is probably about the earliest i would want to start chicks in zone 7ab because we got a 15 degree night two nights ago and honestly i would have loved to get these birds out at about five weeks onto the ground out here but it was just too cold and i saw that cold snap coming by the time we get our next cold snap usually we'll we'll get another one in april they will be big enough to be able to handle it just fine um last night was in the went down to 40. i feel like 40 is kind of the line for a five to six week bird you want to make sure that they have all of their full adult feathers tonight it'll be about 49 degrees so that's the perfect first night for them i think you'll notice i did change my coop slightly i just added this landscape fabric and in the place where they roost i did not cut any slits so that there's not a ton of airflow there it'll remain warmer but there is airflow everywhere else beneath the coop and then on the sides if wind blows through to keep it cool in the summer and it's just a very inexpensive way this was free for me to keep the draft and you know cold wind off them and rain off them and provide a little bit of extra heat for the babies here and i'm going to come back tonight and i will put the babies up on the roost to teach them that that's where they're supposed to go at night so every night i'll do that for about a week and then eventually they'll all understand that and then that will train them for life that they need to go up on a roost and they'll we're just training them psychologically to do that and i'm sure many of you know who raise chickens it's annoying when they go other places to sleep at night where you don't want them i think probably for the next hour i'm just going to let them walk around this area and get used to it get used to all these surroundings before i let out the big chickens to free range with them now this isn't a super ideal situation i feel like the 12 birds that i have in this eight by four coop is pretty maxed out but these chickens are still small and they're going to be okay because they're only in this coop at night and the early morning i let them out and they're free-ranging the whole day and the other reason i feel like i'm okay to do this or the reason it might be dangerous is that these are very small birds very delicate and if you have an aggressive rooster or if you have aggressive hens that are really you know hen pecky um they could attack or you know try to hurt one of the baby birds initially as they try to establish a pecking order um if you have an aggressive bird so just you know watch out for that watch them i'd say watch them for the first hour see how they interact so you can like stop it if something does happen but my hands in this rooster are extremely gentle um so that's why i feel that there's no issue to do this also there's no risk of disease or anything like that i've had these chickens isolated in their own little area for six weeks so if they did have some sort of illness from the hatchery they all these birds would be dead already so i'm not worried about some sort of cross-contamination between these birds of course all of these birds are on a k and f korean after farming regimen in their water so they're always getting all of their minerals uh tons of different medicinal nutrients as well so let's come back in an hour and we'll check on how what they're doing and then we'll let out the big birds and see what happens these chickens are very nice and gentle and no issues so what i'm gonna do is just run them like this i'm gonna keep the net hot i'm not gonna let them fully free range like i normally do they'll just stay in the pen here and then i'll probably do that for at least a day maybe two or three days just to get the babies really used to understanding that this is their home this is where they sleep this is where they go every single night and the young ones are also they're gonna copy what the older ones are doing they're gonna learn a lot just by observing them so we're about 30 minutes from darkness right now here's the situation with the birds so the babies are a little confused and i think part of the reason is that they're scared of the bigger birds too i think that may be part of the issue oh dang it so see how the that chicken just stepped through so even at this six week um age they can get through the poultry netting so just be aware of that a lot of people won't run the nets hot while they're still this size so they don't keep getting shocked okay so i had to get all the birds in by hand which typically that's normally what's going to happen the first couple nights as they get used to everything one of the birds i put up on the perch is still staying there and the rest just want to stay in the ground i've already stressed them out enough so they're going to be completely fine just sleeping on the ground tonight and i'll just keep working on training them every day getting them to sit up there so the baby chicks are now seven weeks old and i'm going to give you the rest of the tips that i think you're going to need for the rest of their life oh and since summer is coming you guys you're going to need a good quality sun hat and i finally found a company that i wanted to work with on this this is farmer's defense and if you want to get 10 off on any of their products use the code nature's always right and you can pick yourself up one it's got a nice tight weave it's got the pattern underneath that i found this really helps to protect the straw from breaking over time so go down to the link in the description if you'd like to pick one up or look at all the different links down there if there's something that you need for your garden or your farm drip irrigation seeds tools if you buy through any of those links you'll either get a discount or it's a way that you can help support my channel at no cost to you so thank you so much for using those links so since the chicks are seven weeks old they are in a grower developer feed which is a slightly higher percentage of protein than the layer ration that the big girls would get but that's okay i'm just feeding it to all the birds so we're airing on the side of giving the baby chicks the exact protein ratio that they need they're getting a little bit more protein it's not a big deal it's only a couple more dollars per bag right now i'm not fermenting their feed just because it's a lot easier i just dump the food in here right to do that in the future i need to get like a galvanized trough or something that i can easily dump out the fermented feed in this doesn't work very well for fermented feed now in their water um in my chick raising video i talked about some natural solutions like apple cider vinegar putting chopped garlic in the water what i'm doing is putting my korean natural farming inputs in here so i have fermented plant juice brown rice vinegar wca wcp seawater labs and ohn and i try to have that in there every time i refill the water i'm not always perfect on that but because these birds are free-ranging anything that's lacking in their diet they're going to go find that so now when it comes to supplements there's a lot of things that you can do and here's the things that i do and recommend this bucket contains calcium and chicken grit they need calcium to build really strong eggshells so you can do that in the form of dead coral or oyster shells crab meal all of that would work great a free source of calcium is of course from their own eggs and what you can do with them is just crunch them up and feed it back to them most people recommend to heat heat it all up destroy all the organic material make it um sterile then crunch it up and then give it to them for me i didn't want to deal with that you know you buy a 40 pound bag of of oyster shell and it lasts you for 10 years you know so it's really not worth the extra effort in my opinion but go ahead and go for it i just throw all my eggshells into compost or i'd feed it to my pigs now minerals minerals are huge now seawater is something that everybody could use okay all you do is you take 35 grams of salt okay zero out your container put 35 grams of salt in that container on a scale and then add water until that the total volume of everything equals a thousand grams that is seawater now take seawater and dilute that 30 to 1. the 30 to 1 dilution is what goes in the chicken's water seawater has all the minerals that is necessary for humans plants and animals another mineral i like to feed is kelp meal i just sprinkle that into here as part of their mix and that also provides them tons of minerals and nutrition so another great supplement that you can give your chickens is just dried bugs you can buy mealworms or soldier fly larva you can buy them live larva as well that could get expensive you can also raise your own which would allow you to raise your chickens much more cheaply and i have experimented with that in the past if you want to go see my past video on soldier fly and i've messed with mealworms and maggots and all of that has a lot of promise and i'd like to get back to experimenting with that again and then in the floor of the coop here guys i'm just adding in hay maybe every two weeks or so once it gets a little bit nastier just to keep the floor a little bit cleaner in here but as you know these chickens go out immediately in the morning and they're not hanging out and that's important for the young birds if you are going to keep young birds and old birds together you better make sure you come out at the beginning of the morning so that you can let them all out and they're not in here fighting or possibly damaging each other so yeah guys i still recommend this dog kennel coop it's an eight by four i think i paid two 250 for it and it's gonna last forever i can use it for chickens i can use it for other animals i can use it as a temporary quarantine coop in the future when i have my mobile coops it's worked out fantastically so i still would recommend this as either a temporary or even a permanent coop using it like i am where you release them immediately in the morning so speaking of coops that's their protection right so the other thing you need to keep in mind going in to summer is all the different predators that you might need to worry about so your main predators are going to be hawks if you're free-ranging so keep an eye out for that having a dog outside can definitely help having a rooster can also help with hawks because the rooster is constantly looking and warning the girls coyotes possums raccoons skunks all of those can kill chickens and i have witnessed them kill chickens because i didn't close the door at night or i came home late before i could close the door and i come home to an animal feasting on one of my chickens so the number one rule you double or even triple check at night that you've closed this door even if it means coming out at 12 o'clock right before you go to bed because you've got that itch in the back of your mind did i really close it you better double check and dealing with most of those predators except for the hawks they're going to be a nighttime predator so as long as you've ensured that your coop is enclosed there's no secret access somewhere that they can get in they're going to be fine so be sure to check out my old video about my automatic chicken coop that i designed back in san diego that is the coop if you're in a backyard that i would build every single time i love that coop and i want to incorporate some of those time-saving things that i did into my mobile coop so you guys will see that soon but if you haven't seen that video i think it will really help you tie together all these different concepts that i've been talking about in these previous videos and then finally and one of the most important things remember that your chickens are a tool for you you can use them to disturb land you can use them to eat up bugs that you don't like you can use them to fertilize an area to take out a garden to keep the grass low for you so you don't have to mow i just encourage all of you who have thought about getting chickens to do it this year this is the year you have to get this done it's so important that you have a protein source besides your vegetables that you have available to eat and i just you know without scaring anybody food prices are going to increase incredibly going into the future i've talked about this for a long time encouraged you guys to grow your own food for a long time
