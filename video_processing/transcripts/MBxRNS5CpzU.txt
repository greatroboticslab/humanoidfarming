 Hello my friends, you are probably familiar with the sight of agricultural machinery working in the fields. In the future, we will probably see that image even more, because according to forecasts, the agricultural equipment market will be worth more than $189 billion by 2030. So how exactly do farmers use modern agricultural machinery? Let's find out in this video. Did you know that today farmers can use lasers to kill weeds? This is such a machine. First, the laser weeder will scan the entire plant area to clearly distinguish between crop and weed. Then, the machine will emit a high intensity laser beam onto the weeds. The rapidly increase in temperature damages the cell tissue, preventing weeds from continuing to grow. Each shot lasts only a few milliseconds, ensuring no impact on the crops. One such laser weeder can remove 80 times faster than humans. Farmers use automatic sprayers to spray pesticides or liquid fertilizers. This is the XAG R1 5-0 UGV sprayer. Although the machine looks quite small, it has an extremely large tank capacity of around 100 litres. When operating, the pump system will draw the solution from the tank and push it into the nozzles arranged along the body of the machine. The control system will automatically adjust the flow rate and spray pattern based on the machine's travel speed, ensuring even coverage over the cultivated area. This machine can achieve a maximum efficiency of up to 5 hectares per hour. This is hemp. Hemp plants are tall and grow close together, so harvesting by machine is often preferred over manual harvesting. In operating, the cutting unit at the front will use rotating blades to cut across the base of the plants. Immediately after, the stalks are fed into the processing unit via an integrated conveyor system. The special feature lies in the cutting unit inside. Instead of multiple blades, the system uses only one large, fast-rotating blade to cut the stalks into sections 12 to 24 inches long. This method is suitable for the tough and fibrous nature of hemp, helping the process to be smoother and more efficient. To improve soil fertility and support more stable plant growth, farmers often use treated liquid manure spreaders on their land. When in position, the pump system on the vehicle will be activated to create pressure and push the manure out. The liquid manure is then led through a system of pipes and sprayed out by nozzles evenly arranged along the horizontal length of the machine. This machine can operate day and night without stopping. With a capacity of up to 17,000 gallons, this equipment can carry a large amount of liquid manure, sufficient to irrigate dozens of hectares of fields. In the fields, rows of tomatoes are ready for harvest. While the machine moves along the tomato rows, the conveyor belt gently lifts and pulls the tomato rows from the ground. At this point, the tomatoes are led by the conveyor belts to the machine, which shakes them to remove soil and leaves and to clean the fruit. Then a farm will be responsible for removing any crushed, bruised or rotten tomatoes. The quality tomatoes are pushed onto the conveyor belt and poured into containers. It is estimated that the global volume of processed tomatoes in 2024 is 45.7 million tonnes. Next, we will talk about potato planties. First, the tillage unit at the front of the machine will continuously till the soil, creating loose and even planting rows. Immediately after, the automatic planting system will place seed tubers into each row, one by one. Finally, the machine performs healing. Soil is pushed up to cover the seed tubers, forming high ridges that help the tubers grow better and reduce pests and diseases. In just one pass, the machine can plant eight rows of potatoes simultaneously, much faster and more efficient than manual planting. One way to clear weeds in the fields is to use a mini brush cutter. The machine has a track system that helps it grip firmly on steep and rough terrain, even in places with slopes up to 55 degrees tall. The cutting head is placed between two tracks. The cutting head is placed between two tracks. The rotating cutting blades, made of hardened steel, will cut and shred the grass and vegetation on the ground. The cutting height can be flexibly adjusted, usually from two to seven point three inches, suitable for many different purposes. In the US, there are some extremely arid regions. Farmers have to hire rock pickers to clear the soil surface before they can cultivate. This machine has a sturdy metal frame, designed to withstand the great impact force when working on hard and rock soil. As the machine moves, the steel teeth attached to the machine frame rake and toss rocks, gravel and other obstacles onto the conveyor belt. The soil and rocks, after being lifted by the conveyor belt, will be poured into a large container inside the machine body. In addition, many farmers prefer small tillers, such as this tiller TM1050B. This is because they are more affordable and easier to use. They just need to start the engine and push the machine towards the front area of the land. When the machine is pushed, the blades will rotate at high speed, digging into the soil, cutting and turning the soil over, making it much looser. In Malatavan in south-eastern France, the lavender fields have bloomed, ready for harvest. The harvester moves along the flower rows, its head gently lifting the flowers and feeding them into the machine to cut the flower stalks. After being processed, the flowers are transferred through a duct and poured directly into the container above the machine body. Today, the area of lavender cultivation in France is around 28,000 hectares. In Canada, bales of hay harvested at the end of the season are put into a haybuster for further reuse. Haybusters on small and medium-sized farms usually have one container. Inside the container is a system of high-speed rotating blades responsible for grinding and chopping the hay that is fed in. It takes only around two minutes for the machine to process a large bale of hay. Farmers usually cut straw into two sizes, three inches for bedding and smaller for livestock feed. In the field, farmers are preparing to harvest tulip bulbs. First, the water is filled into the container in the vehicle. After the machine is started, the digging blades will dig up the soil containing the tulip bulbs. Dirt and leaves will be removed from the bulbs by a vibrating screen system. And then they'll be poured back into the water container in the vehicle for around two more washes. After being thoroughly cleaned, the tulip bulbs will be conveyed up a conveyor belt and poured into another wagon, before being transported to the factory to be prepared for consumption. The water is filled with water. Lemons are one of the most consumed fruits in the world, with an estimated production of around 10.2 million tons in 2024. Besides manual lemon harvesting, farmers also use modern machinery. The machine moves along the rows. The front of the machine is designed to weave between the trees and the rotating shafts at the front continuously rotate, gliding with branches and gently knocking the ripe lemons off the branches. The harvested lemons are stored in a trough before being poured into containers. The machine can also be used to harvest apples. Recently, a kiwi pollination machine has also been invented. First, the pollen is mixed with water, and the liquid mixture is then sprayed onto the female flowers using nozzles similar to spraying pesticides. The system will automatically direct the pollen to the blooming female flowers to ensure a successful pollination. The machine moves slowly at a speed of 1-2 km per hour around the orchard until all of the flowers are pollinated. Machine pollination can solve many problems, such as a shortage of natural pollinating insects or uneven pollination. A handle has also been added to use this machine for harvesting kiwis. This is an agricultural plastic film-laying machine. The farmer will attach a roll of black plastic mulch to the roller at the rear of the machine. As the machine moves, the roll of mulch will slowly unwind and spread evenly over the surface of the tilled soil beds. The two edges of the mulch will be buried in the soil by wheels, helping to secure the film firmly and preventing wind or water from lifting it. Such mulching helps to retain moisture in the soil. Today, advanced technology not only boosts productivity, but also turns every harvest season into a more exciting journey. In today's video, we will introduce you to some of the most amazing agricultural technologies. Did you know that American farmers harvest 84.2 million pounds of Brussels sprouts every year? Modern machinery helps them carry out the harvesting process with incredible precision. Sharp blades neatly cut the stalks at their base. Farmers operating the machines skillfully lift each plant and place it into an integrated separation system. Here, the tiny sprouts are detached from the stalks and transferred into storage bins. Advanced technologies have enabled US farmers to produce over 8.889 million pounds of mushrooms annually. Sharp blades trim the base to neatly ensure the caps and stems remain intact. After trimming, the mushrooms are sent on our conveyor belts to an automated sorting system with advanced sensors. Mushrooms that meet quality standards are sent to the packing area. The apple market surged to $1.1 billion in 2024. Some large farms are using robots to harvest thousands of apples per hour. These robots are equipped with image sensors and intelligent algorithms that enables them to analyze the color and size of each apple to determine its ripeness with precision. From November to March, Spanish farmers harvest broccoli. Harvesting machines use sharp cutting systems to cut the broccoli right at the base. The broccoli is then transported via conveyor belts to storage bins. Some machines are even equipped with sensors to determine the size and ripeness of the broccoli. And this better meets market demands. Farmers operate the machines along rows of hops. The machines move past each hop plant with pulling mechanisms stripping the hops from the branches. The hops are transferred through a conveyor system and into storage bins. Thanks to the harvesting technology, Oregon farmers can produce around 8 to 11 million pounds of hops annually. On vast fields, cabbage harvesters steadily move along the rows, using automatic cutting blades to quickly and precisely harvest each cabbage. The machine removes damaged leaves and workers standing on the machines inspect and nearly organize the cabbages. In 2024, Wisconsin produced around 32 million pounds of corn silage. Farmers typically harvest corn in October, when the moisture content is high enough to ensure quality fermentation. These machines are designed to cut the entire corn plant. Including stalks, leaves and ears into small pieces suitable for silage feed. The Robomax JD machine is equipped with advanced cutting technology that cuts and transfers grass to the conveyor belt efficiently. Once the conveyor is full, robotic arms automatically grab five grass bales and stack them neatly onto pallets. The automated compression system tightly packs the bales onto a stable pyramid shape, making them easier to transport. For forage grass, farmers use Krone rotary mowers for quick and efficient harvesting. These machines are capable of working on large areas, with designs that adapt well to the terrain and are easy to operate. Equipped with powerful cutting blades, they cut the grass into small, uniform pieces, ensuring high quality livestock feed. Farmers walk along the rows of ripe melons, picking each one carefully and gently placing them onto the bandit elevator. This elevator is positioned close to the ground, running along the rows of melons to collect them quickly and efficiently. The bandit elevator automatically lifts the melons from the ground to the sorting area. This process saves labor, and reduces the time needed for manual transportation. Next, let's move to the pumpkin fields. From September to October, Illinois farmers are busy harvesting pumpkins. The Multi KX4 Hydro is the most powerful pumpkin seed harvester to date. It combines advanced technology with superior efficiency. Capable of processing up to 5,500 pounds of seeds per hour. Additionally, if farmers need whole pumpkins for making jack-o'-lanterns, the Nicholson Pumpkin Harvester is the better choice. This large machine moves along the rows, carefully collecting each pumpkin from the fields and transferring them into a spacious container. Pumpkins intended for jack-o'-lanterns are lined up for collection by the harvester. The Xpand R590 is equipped with a specialized trailer featuring a retractable tarp. Under the machine's shaking mechanism, fruit falls onto the tarp where they are then sorted and cleared of debris. With this technology, only two people are needed to handle up to 660 pounds of fruit per session. Making it 80% more efficient than other harvesting systems. This massive machine runs along the rows of carrots at an impressive speed. First, the front cutting system gently lifts the soil, exposing the fresh carrots underneath. Then, parallel conveyor belts grip the carrot tops and smoothly pull them out of the ground. Excess dirt is shaken off with a vibrating system, ensuring the carrots arrive clean and ready on the conveyor belt. Finally, the carrots are transferred directly to the rear container, ready for sorting and packaging. In large-scale vineyards across France, harvesting machines are often used to ensure high productivity and timeliness. These machines can replace dozens of workers working for hours. Modern harvesters use GPS and sensors to precisely locate grapevines and optimize their movement across the fields. A large storage tank reduces the need for frequent stops to unload grapes. The harvesters also feature a quick-release mechanism to transfer the grapes into large trunks. Around September, across sugar beet fields in Russia, farmers begin the harvest. They harvest 24,000 pounds of sugar beets per hour. The Roper Tiger 6 harvester moves effortlessly across vast fields, using sophisticated mechanical arms to uproot the sugar beets without damaging the crops. The machine instantly removes excess soil, then transports the beets via an automated conveyor into storage bins. In addition, the sugar beet cleaning machine is an essential tool in the handling and processing workflow. It is designed to remove soil, stones and other impurities attached to the sugar beets. The system's hydraulic spring shafts ensure safe handling for the sugar beet loader. Beets are passed through conveyor belts and scrubbing machines to remove dirt and debris. The machine also has the capability to sort beets by size, ensuring high-quality products on the spot. This system helps American farmers harvest 40,000 acres of cranberries annually, making the US the global leader in cranberry production. The process of vacuuming berries into the machine is carried out using powerful suction systems, which cause the berries to float on water and then be collected into storage bins. Here, the cranberries are cleaned using water jets to remove dust and debris. The SU Tech Onion Loader is quickly becoming a vital assistant for farmers in Ashburton, New Zealand during onion harvesting season. As the machine moves across the field, its automatic cutting blades slice the onion roots, while simultaneously lifting the onions and place them neatly into individual baskets. Farmers only need to monitor and check the quality of the onions after harvesting. Eliminating the need for labor-intensive processes of bending down to pick each bulb manually. Smart technology robots can predict the ideal time to pick a ripe strawberry. These robots classify strawberries into five levels of ripeness, based on color observation. Arnold eye, the upcoming Mechanical sunflower harvesting has become the primary method in large-scale farming in Russia. When the sunflower petals begin to dry and fall to the ground, it signals the perfect time for farmers to start the harvest. As the combine moves, its stalk lifters grab the sunflower heads and cut them off the stalks, before transferring the heads into the combine's threshing chamber. The sunflower seeds are then collected into the transport vehicle's storage bin. The corn harvest in California runs from June till October. California sweet corn is highly regarded for its freshness and flavor, primarily harvested when the kernels are in the milk stage, ensuring sweetness and tenderness. The cutting head of the harvester is adjusted to the appropriate height and position for the plant size and row spacing. From there, the corn harvester cuts the stalks while the rollers feed them into the machine. This technology makes the harvesting process fully automated. The machine is designed to move through chicken coops, using gentle mechanical arms to guide the chickens into harvest cages without harming them. The front of the robot features an automatic chicken-catching device, with a 360-degree rotating table that lifts the chickens. A conveyor belt then distributes the chickens into holding cages. The harvester is operated via a safe and convenient remote control. Poultry are loaded into cages at an impressive speed of 1,000 to 1,500 birds per hour. This helps to facilitate transportation. The cage technology is revolutionizing the egg harvesting process in the U.S. poultry industry. The cages are equipped with smart sensors and conveyor systems that automatically collect eggs as they are laid, without requiring human intervention. The eggs are transferred onto a conveyor belt, where they are automatically sorted and sent into individual stalls. The milk machines gently attach milking clusters to the dairy industry. Cows are guided into the milking area, where they are automatically sorted and placed into individual stalls. The milk machine helps stock their DNs, while a reorganizationấy or conventional antics administer collectors.
