 There's a really high level of technology required when you're working with agricultural equipment on today's farms. The agri-food industry is incredibly important not only to this region, but the entire province. People need to understand that there are really exciting career paths within the ag industry, and working on sophisticated equipment is just one of those career paths. We're very excited at the college because we have some agricultural programming that's going to support farms in this region, and they're going to be focused very much on technology. So the programs are designed to bridge people into really exciting careers in agriculture, include maintenance of equipment and some of the theory around the ag equipment, and culminate in the operation of equipment, everything from traditional tractors right through the entire seasonal spectrum. This will be a tremendous program for people who are looking to start into agriculture. It's also a tremendous program for people that are looking to increase their skill sets, who may already be working in an agricultural sector.
