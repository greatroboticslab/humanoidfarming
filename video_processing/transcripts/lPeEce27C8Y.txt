 So under the farm category, this is all tax deductible. And you want to put your stuff that you know is going to be tax deductible in this. I have in here feed. So if I have chickens, if I have rabbits, if I have goats, sheep, donkeys, cattle, in my case it's cattle and chickens, then anything you buy farm-wise for your farm is tax exempt. So feed, fuel, livestock, go to the butcher shop. You can put your butcher fees in here, kill fees and butcher fees and everything along those lines. Repairs, supplies and then the veterinarian bills. All right. So that is the farm categories. All tax deductible. Okay. All tax deductible.
