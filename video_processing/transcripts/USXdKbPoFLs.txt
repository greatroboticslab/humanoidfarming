 of the barn it's spacious this is the first story it's one of my favorites so if you look at this table you can remove it and you can open and close the gates oh it's for it's another way for the animals to enter the barn is that the barn design we also created the windows here so that your child can just pick in at the back you can open it and close it yeah so you can see that my boy is quite rough and yeah the the window is able to withstand his roughness concern of is whether this barn is prickly we want to assure you that there is a layer of varnish it is gentle to touch
