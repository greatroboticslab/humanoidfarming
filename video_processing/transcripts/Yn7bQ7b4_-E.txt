 The pages of the Baker Creek catalog are filled with gorgeous and amazing veggies from around the world. And our customers are gardening fanatics and discerning gourmands. Here's a list of the top 10 best-selling seeds at Baker Creek. Number 10. Lemon Spice Jalapeno. This bright little pepper is one of the wonderful jalapeno varieties developed at New Mexico State University's pepper breeding program. It's a great ornamental thanks to its sunny color and its fruity hot flavor is terrific in salsas. Number 9. Dragon Tongue Bush Bean. The big tender pods of dragon tongue bean are splashed with plum on golden colored skin. They are the finest tasting of all beans, a result of masterful plant breeding in the Netherlands. Number 8. Sugar Snap Pea. These peas are so versatile. Picked immature, the pods are sublime, eaten raw right from the vine. They are great as a snap pea, or they can be shelled like garden peas. They are terrific in stir fries and salads, and they freeze really well. Number 7. Bloomsdale Long Standing Spinach. This timeless variety has reigned supreme in gardens since its introduction in the 1800s, and for good reason. Gardeners appreciate its rugged tolerance to both cold and heat. The classic flavor of its glossy, deep green leaves makes it a favorite in the kitchen. Number 6. Black Nebula Carrot. From skin to core, this carrot is one of the darkest you'll find. It makes a stunning purple juice that turns bright pink when you add a squeeze of lemon, and it can be used to make dye. This anthocyanin-rich carrot retains its color after cooking. Number 5. Chinese multi-color spinach. Chinese multi-color spinach isn't really a spinach. It's an amaranth. The lime-colored foliage, splashed with magenta, makes a riot of color in the garden and on the plate. Even in the heat and humidity of summer, Chinese spinach resists bolting, and the nutty, sweet leaves stay supremely succulent. As a bonus, it's fast maturing, ready to harvest in just 30 to 40 days from sowing. Number 4. Purple Lady bok choy is easy to grow, and its brilliant purple leaves and green stems really pop in the garden. This antioxidant-rich green loves cool weather. It is truly one of the best-tasting leafy vegetables you can grow. Number 3. Mongolian giant sunflower is a variety that lives up to its name. Its behemoth heads can grow to a foot and a half across on 14-foot-tall stalks. The highly nutritious seeds are more than twice the size of an average sunflower seed. Birds and humans alike love them. Number 2. Chinese pink celery. The bubblegum pink stalks of this rare and treasured variety from northern China add beauty to the garden and the dinner table. And it's much easier to grow than traditional European celery. We think it's the most amazing celery of all time. Number 1. Brad's Atomic Grape. A masterpiece from tomato breeder Brad Gates. Atomic Grape is the all-time best-selling variety at Baker Creek. They're crazy beautiful, with their lavender and purple stripes that ripen to olive green, red, and blue-brown stripes. But they are not just eye candy. These tomatoes are rugged and productive, not to mention extraordinarily sweet. They're against staringĩists. They're against the highstopes. Next Spic Ü Chronicles.
