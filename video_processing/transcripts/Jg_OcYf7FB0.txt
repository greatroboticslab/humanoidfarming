 The most crucial part of any electric fencing system for livestock is your ground rod. Per one joule of fence energizer, you need three foot of ground rod. So a one joule fence energizer, you need three foot of ground rod in the ground. If you have a two joule fence energizer, you need six foot of ground rod in the ground. This is a solar energizer that we use with our electric fencing for our sheep as well as for our chickens. And this is our primary and only defense system to keep predators out and a properly managed fence with an adequate energizer and the proper amount of ground rods is ultimately going to keep your animals in as well as predators out.
