 So I'm David here to introduce you to a part of my project which is organics in hydroponics. So there are multiple organic matters that could be used in hydroponic production. And the most famous one would be aquaponics. It has been introduced to you if you were there last semester. And there are other areas that were researched to reproduce substrate or nutrient solutions for hydroponics. Such as compost, compost tea, vermicompost, vermicompost leachate, municipal waste matter, wastewater also, and urine and some anaerobic digestion. All these residual organic matter go with the principle to reuse nutrients for biomass production. But nutrient cycling is a complex world as you might know. So why would you use organics? Well, that means research says that using organic matter increases the yield of some crops. There's been research made on tomatoes grown hydroponically. It covers waste. But to take residual waste nutrients into biomass production, they need to be not destroyed but degraded by matter. Like microorganisms as worms would be able to do this. And also, you might have heard that phosphorus nutrient global reserves is declining. And it says that in 100 years, we could have issues to produce phosphorus as a new nutrient. So we need to recycle it. So it could be interesting to research these topics to recycle phosphorus. I have to make issues. Okay, here we go. Just for today's topic, we'll focus on vermicompost because I love vermicompost. Everybody loves it. And there has been some research to prove that using vermicompost as a substrate and or as an nutrient solution could increase some very important compounds in tomatoes. So, say, vitamin C, filling compounds, carotenoins, etched around. Here you can see the other plant in brown tomatoes. So let's just look at a result from one of the studies. Here, different colors being different state of the tomato. The red would be the fully-ripped tomato and yellow would be the not-ripped tomato. So here we're looking at the fruit number of different plants according to different substrate. I won't go through every one, but let's look at these guys up there who have 75% vermicompost and 25% teat in their substrate. And they will be amongst the highest fruit-yielding substrate for hydroclonic production. One of the other interesting results, looking at organic substrate, is that the use of vermicompost and teat, again, would be the highest, would be the biggest fruit in a long time. So these are interesting results that can be used to promote the use of organic matter in hydroclonic production. So, as for my research, I want to use different organic nutrient solutions and test in my system, which is a hydroclonic, which looks kind of straight male because it's kind of, yeah, that's how it looks. And there's an interesting interaction in the rezone of plants with bacterial activity. And some hypothesis tell us that there might be an advantage for the plants to have organic matter in the rezone, because they would resist better stress. So my goal would be to compare two different nutrient solutions, one organic and one more classable, in two different systems, one that can be induced more stress. So you can have a result like that. So why would I stick on vermicompost? Well, because vermicompost is a fast way to degrade matter, and it's fast, it's reliable, and yeah, you can make it out. So that's pretty easy. Finally, there's still a lot of many research to do on organic hydroponics, because there's a lot of different subsurgeant solutions that can be made. And there's still like patterns in control that is an issue on large scale, because when you use organic matter, that is maybe waste, you can have some contaminants in there that can be very harmful. And there's many opportunities because organic matter is everywhere. So finally, thank you to my reviewer, and I will be ready to receive your questions. So, I'll see you next time. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
