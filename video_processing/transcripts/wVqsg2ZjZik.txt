 Hello, I'm Detective Scott. Detectives look for clues to solve puzzles. Did you know that readers and writers also look for clues? When we do this, we become word detectives. Words have clues that can help us figure out their meanings. Prefixes are word parts that come at the beginning of a word. Every prefix has its own meaning. When added to a word, the prefix changes the meaning of that word. Today, we are going to explore a prefix that you have seen in many words. Un. The prefix un means not. Let's look at how the prefix un can change a word. Ralph was able to kick the soccer ball into the goal. He was happy when he helped his team win the match. When Ralph hurt his ankle, he was not able to kick the soccer ball into the goal. He was unable to help his team. He was not happy when his team lost the match. Ralph was unhappy. He was happy. You have a reason to forgive him. He was happy. He was unhappy. He was unhappy. We are happy. Word detectives, we know that prefixes attach to root words and roots. They change the meaning of words. Let's build some words together with the prefix un. Remember, it means not. Use the prefix un to change the root word in each sentence so that the sentence makes sense. Ralph tried to divide his cookie into equal parts to share with his friends, but one was bigger than the others. The cookie was divided in a way that was... Use the prefix un to change the root word equal so that it makes sense. If you said the cookie was divided in a way that was unequal, you are right. Unequal means not equal. Let's try another one. Ralph was sick with the flu. He was not healthy and he had to stay home from school. Ralph was... Use the prefix un to change the root word in each sentence so that the sentence makes sense. If you said Ralph was unhealthy, you are right. Unhealthy means not healthy. Let's try one more. Ralph felt silly after he had cut his hair and noticed that his bangs were choppy and not even. Ralph's haircut was... Use the prefix un to change the root word in each sentence so that the sentence makes sense. Ralph's room was... If you said uneven, you figured it out, detective. Uneven means not even. Let's play a matching game. Match the un word to the picture. Ralph's room was... Ralph's room was... Ralph's room was a mess. Ralph's room was a mess. His clothes were thrown everywhere. His bed was not made and his trash can was overflowing. Ralph's room was... and we're... And... Music Hood's room was... Once you ever felt untidy, we went through it and talked about... The proof things had been Pardon me. Unclear means not clear or difficult to see, hear, or understand. The root word is clear, which means easy to see, hear, or understand. Unclear means not clear. A window could be unclear, or an idea could be unclear if it is confusing. Unleasy means troubled or worried. The root word is easy, which can mean calm or simple. Uneasy means not calm. A person could be uneasy if he or she is worried about something. Sometimes the sea or ocean might be described as uneasy if the water is very rough. Let's do another one. Match the un-word to the picture. Detective was astonished when his friends threw him a surprise party. He had no idea they were planning it. The surprise party was unexpected, uncertain, unwise. If you said unexpected, you are right, Detective. Unexpected means surprising. The root word is expected or likely to happen. Unexpected means not expected, like Ralph's surprise party. He had no idea it was going to happen. It was unexpected. Uncertain means not reliable or not known for sure. The root word is certain, which means known for sure. Uncertain means not known for sure. A weather forecast could be uncertain if the meteorologist is not sure about whether or not it will rain. You might feel uncertain in class if you are not sure about an answer to a question. Unwise means foolish. The root word is wise, which means having good judgment. Unwise means not having good judgment or being foolish or silly. An action could be unwise, if it is silly or likely to cause harm. It is unwise to run on the deck of a swimming pool because you could slip. So word detectives, today you have learned that prefixes can change the meaning of words. Remember that a prefix always comes at the beginning of a word. The prefix un- means not. You can use this to help you figure out the meanings of many, many words when you read. So detectives, keep looking for clues when you're reading. You can use what you know about prefixes to help you understand the meanings of many words.
