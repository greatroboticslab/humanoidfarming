 See how Chinese farmers earn millions by cultivating papaya. Papaya is cultivated on a large scale in China because papaya has many uses. When papaya is raw, it is eaten as a vegetable and salad. Not only this, its milk, which is called latex, is extracted and used in many types of medical products and medicines. And when the papaya ripens, it is harvested and sold directly in the market. That means profit of fruit, vegetable and medicine from a single crop. Got it? Chinese food.
