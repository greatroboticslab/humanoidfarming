 The great thing about planting perennial bulbs is that they will bloom year after year. Here's what you need to know. Spring is the best time to plant tender bulbs like gladiolus, dahlias, caladium, and elephant ears. In the fall, plant hardy bulbs like tulips, irises, daffodils, hyacinths, and crocuses. Before you plant, plan your design. You can plant a formal garden or scatter the bulbs around your landscape for a natural look. And think about color. How will the blooms blend with each other and the surrounding area? Now prepare the soil. It should be loose and well-drained. It's good to mix in organic material like compost or peat moss. You can also add a special bulb fertilizer. Just follow the package directions. It's important to plant your bulbs at the right depth. This helps them start to grow at the right time. Generally, you plant two to three times as deep as the bulb is tall, but check the package instructions. Dig the hole and place the bulb, nose up or roots down. Then cover with soil. In the fall, cover the hardy bulbs with about two inches of mulch to protect the roots during the cold winter months. In harsh climates, you may want to dig out and store tender bulbs over the winter. Once they're planted, be sure to give your bulbs plenty of water. Then, next spring and summer, watch your yard come alive with color. Want more great ideas and how-tos? Go to lowes.com slash how-to or just click to subscribe.
