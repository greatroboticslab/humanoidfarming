Howto & Style
 Super excited. We have two summer squash right here. These are also known as the golden zucchini. You can see the fruit, which is the yellow one, and then up top, that's going to be a flower. And the bottom right here, these guys, these are the male, the little tin, skinnier stem with also that's going to be a flower. If you don't have bees, you're going to need to hand pollinate later on as the plant gets bigger. You take pollen from the male and apply it to the female using a paint brush. Now coming up in the next video, I'm going to show you how I'm going to be growing this vertically and prune it. Why I prune it? Because here we have a short growing season. We cannot afford to just grow all leaves. And why I grow it vertically? To save tons of space so I can plant more.
