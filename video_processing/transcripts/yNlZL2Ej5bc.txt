 Good morning, Michael Walsh here, Norwalk Farm. Thank you for joining us today. If you haven't already, please subscribe and ring the notification bell and hit the like button. That helps our video channel more than you can know. And make a comment and share this with a friend. We're going to move the pasture fence today. We've moved them up to the dry lot. It was raining a couple days ago, thank goodness. But anyway, we have to do some tagging and some vaccinating. So we just put them in dry lot. We're going to shift pastures now. We have to take down fence here and then the one that goes across the wetlands. So we'll take this down and then we're going to shift them up there to where the portable shade is. And we'll probably do that tomorrow. So anyway, let's get started. This section of fence was put up as a two strand originally and the dog started getting out. So that's when we realized we needed at least three to four strands. So we had to go back and weave some extra strands into it. That's why it's taking longer to take this down. But anyway, it's coming down pretty nice. We'll get it for next time. String pulled up. Now we gather the posts. This is where hooked onto the super fence too. And that goes around the base of this and up the hill. So we'll take the post back up and then we'll have to come down and finish. Just finished recoiling this. There it's all gathered up. And there's another one. It goes up the hill and over to the gate just right of the tractor there. So we'll get that done. And we got the second one rolled up. We're up here at the top of the gate. And that's the dog food feeding pen and feeder. Mineral feeder. Water tank is over there. So we're going to move everything over to the next pasture. We've got the mineral feeder and two of the super fence twos and the dog feeder panel. And there's a chain on this right here. We just hook onto that and we tow it to where we want it to be. Water tank, hose, and the fence posts on the front end. So we're ready to go set up. We've got the feeder and water tank set up. Mineral feeder. We're going to set the fence now. So this hose has to go over to that fence post straight across right there. We're short a little bit of hose. We'll have to add another section of hose that'll reach. But let's get the fence up. So we're going to get the fence up. You loosen this knob here. Actually this way it loosens it. And that allows us to stretch out the coils. Bring out a post. You would stretch it out. And put it into the ground. We just step in. Like so. And we take the anchor wire or rope. There we go. And then this will wrap around the post. So there's the first post secured. And then we just step this out. And I'll probably use some blue post in between the black post on this fence to keep the wires rolling. Alright, there's the first strand strung. And we have to tighten this knob. Good job. Now we'll crank it to tension the fence. That's probably pretty good. And we take the... Little... Rope here. Stretch that. Stick it in the ground. And this is what keeps the top supported. Then the next section will go across here. Right across there. Using these blue posts in between the black post on the super fence. You can see there's a little bit of a rut here. Which makes that wire a little higher. And the dogs like to go under those. So I use the fence post to adjust the height in those areas. So I actually put it down a little bit lower there. And then it goes back up to the regular height. So we'll go the whole length and use a blue post in between. Set this up temporarily. It goes over to that other coil over there. Because we're going to be driving them down through that gate up there. So when they come down we want them to make the turn and go up into the pasture. Once they're there, then we'll just take this up again. And then we'll stretch it all the way across the end there. And they'll be in their paddock. sonica sonica sonica sonica sonica sonica sonica sonica sonica
