 My name is Sergei Mikhailovich Chudnov. I am the head of a peasant farm enterprise. We are in the Babkinsky rural settlement of the Chastinsky district of the Perm region in the village of Bugru. We have been engaged in agriculture since 2014 with total livestock of 180 animals. We have a double direction, herefords and a dairy herd. We plan to increase the number of livestock, but before that we need to consider which machine should we use to harvest to feed stuff. For us, the best option is the KMPZ plant. The line HALAGE in packaging is more suitable than these large heavy silage combines, which all are very energy intensive. Firstly, we save a ton on diesel fuel with this technology. It took 800 liters of diesel fuel to refuel all the equipment. Every day, 800 liters, and this is money. Therefore, it is this technology because even if we have three MTZ tractors going into the field, 50 liters for each, that is, they work for 150 liters all day. Secondly, it is an opportunity to work in small sections. That is, when one part of the grass has ripened, we go in, mole, harvest. If not, we wait for the next part. If any, then we go to the next section, which is already suitable by vegetation. We go there to make better feed quality, but we didn't succeed in it with a silo harvester since it is intended for a large volume. You couldn't make a small hill, you still needed to count for not less than 500 tons, and you had to wait in order to lay a large volume since the quality of the feed is lost. And with this technology, we went and took, went and took, when ripe, we went and took. Firstly, high quality feeds are obtained. And secondly, there are no such runs, because this technology implies that a small amount is harvested. Next time a small amount is harvested, as the saying goes, every little bit helps. You work and harvest all summer. We decided to purchase three units at once, because this is the technology. The baler is rolling, the wrapper is packing, the cutter is cutting. After all, this bale of 800 kilograms cannot be thrown into the mixer. But you still need to chop it. Cut it before feeding. So we purchased the entire line. Today, September 23rd, the forage harvesting season is over. In fact, we have only corn left. Nevertheless, we packed 80 tons of haylage. Consider that it's of good quality. It's clear that this year we're practicing, studying and learning the machinery. We're practicing so that we can come back next year using this technology, and the machine operators will have got used to the machinery. In connection with this weather, we have now harvested hay 40% of what we would like, but I think we will succeed at the haylage. Now, if we consider the preparation of haylage and packaging and hay, then today, I think, the weather has taught everyone that, roughly speaking, you can mow and pack haylage right away. But when mowing, it is not so simple, and you have to wait. And here, as it turns out, the haylage has slightly dried. It is okay. Twist it, roll it up, and it will be safe in the package. Even if you compare the silo and haylage, if, for example, the deadlines are tight, then take this baler, move it directly to the field so that the shoulder was short for logistics, and directly in the field on the edge wrap the haylage and that's all. In winter, the haylage will be safe, and you'll quietly move it out. I have chosen the Krasnokomsky RMZ machine because the neighbors have been working with the baler for quite some time, and they say that the machine is really good. They purchased a high-speed packer because they can save half on film. This is the most important factor. The cutter means the same technology. For example, you can't throw the same bale into the mixer. You still need to cut the feed so that it is of a certain length. We bought the machinery on Friday. On Friday evening, we unloaded the machinery. On Saturday, all the specialists were already here. That is, this is a service department. By the way, the employee traveled with us all day, and I drove him to the field and everywhere. And the technologist arrived a little later, already at the time of rolling and packing. He showed everything. Told, explained what, how, where, and why. After all, people, all the same, understand where quality feed is and where the economy is. Of course, saving film is the first and is due to just a speed bale wrapper. Saving diesel fuel is the second, and this is the most important thing. I think if a farm director is smart, he is sure to buy such a line. I've made a choice for myself. A high-speed packer and the whole cycle. I've been talking duel is the third, I think.
