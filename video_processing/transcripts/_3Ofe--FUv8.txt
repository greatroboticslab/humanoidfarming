 Parts that are observable on the outside of a plant are called external structures. These include roots, stems, leaves, flowers and fruits. Roots are usually the external structures that grow down into the soil. The primary function of the roots is to take in the water and nutrients the plant needs to survive and grow. The water moves from the soil through the roots and stem to the leaves, where it is used in the food making process of photosynthesis. Another important function of roots is to hold the plant firmly in the soil in which it grows. This helps to prevent them from being washed away by water or blown away by wind. There are two main types of roots. Some plants have roots that are shallow and branch out to cover a large area. These roots are called fibrous roots. These roots help the plant to take up lots of water when it rains. Other plants have one main root, called a tap root, which grows deep into the soil. This helps to reach water deeper underground.
