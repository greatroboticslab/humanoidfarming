 Hey guys Jacob and John here for Nelson Reynolds Center in the new location right across from Dagger Center. And today we wanted to talk to you a little bit about all the products we have here to help make your food plot planting go a little bit smoother. John why don't you tell us about our brush mowers. Okay we have a selection of different mowers here. These are our walk behind billy goat mowers. Self-propelled, real easy to use, got the Honda engines on them. For helping knock down they'll cut pretty much anything they'll run over. So that's your first option. Then you move over to the it's a 44 inch rough cut mower, good behind a small tractor, UTV, ATV, real heavy duty built, got the got the Honda engine on it again. Works real well for for cutting down tall grasses and brush all in preparation for for the next step of spraying. This one's been a customer favorite for sure this year. Yes, yes, yes, been a very good rental item. And then we move over to the to a little bit bigger option. This is a 66 inch skid steer. It's got the dual hydraulic motors on it. It does have a roller sensor on the back so you have to keep it down on the ground. But great universal attachment. You don't need high flow so works really really good on all different kinds of skid steers. So John, after a customer gets done cutting it might be a good idea to do some spraying, is that right? Absolutely, absolutely. A nice way to kill that off, get a nice nice good kill. And it's it goes a lot faster if you do mow that off real nice and clean, spray it real good. And then once the grass does die off, you're ready to move on to the next step. So this here is a gas power, is that right? Gas powered spray? That is correct. Yep. 40 gallon capacity. Got a good engine, good spray spray pattern on it to do what you need. So after you get done spraying, the next step would be is to get some tillage done. And John, why don't you tell us about the different tillage equipment we have here for people to rent? Okay. First of all, as a bigger option, we do have a this is a 72 inch three point mounted rototiller. This is also a tractor that we rent. It's a 47 horse Kubota, four wheel drive, got the bucket on the front if you need to do a little dirt moving or whatever. And then we do have other attachments that go on as well. And then another option that we have a little smaller size, this is an 18 inch BCS brand tiller, got the got the Honda engine on it again. If you're doing a smaller food plot, this this might be a better better option for you, but works works real well. And then we do move on to some discs, some disc options that we have. This is a 42 inch ATV UTV disc. It is adjustable as far as aggressiveness. So you can go, you know, less aggressive, more aggressive for churning up, churning up that sod for you. It does have high speed bearing, so you can hook it to a bull hitch and tow it right down the road. Pretty good option. And then we move over to a little, a little more advanced option with the ATV disc cultipacker combo. So you can also set the, set the aggressiveness and then the cultipacker will help smooth out those clods of dirt and make for a nice seed bed. So John, for a guy that's got an ATV or UTV, if you've got any recommendations on size, if a guy shows up with a 500 cc four wheeler, will he be able to use either one of these options? Yeah, we would, we would recommend 500 or bigger for sure. They do, if you set them real aggressive, they do pull pretty hard. So definitely 500 would be the absolute smallest that you'd want to use. Most people nowadays do have the bigger UTVs, which, which should pull it just fine. Small tractor as well. So if the ground's been worked up before, usually one pass with either one of these options do, but if a guy's doing new sod, he's going to have to take two, three passes to get that ground turned over, but it will do it, right? Definitely. Definitely. It will cut through that sod and, and like Jacob said, more passes if you got, if you're breaking sod. So. So after you get done with your tillage, the next step is seeding. And John, why don't you tell us a little bit about the different options we have for seeding applications? Okay. As far as spreaders go, we do have a handheld over here, an ATV mounted that we can use a push style. We got a three point cone style and a Tobol, Tobol spreader. This Tobol one, that'll do seed or fertilizer or lime, right? That's correct. Yes. Yes. Yes. Both of these will. Then jumping down here, we do have a two row corn planter slash soybean planter. So there is a little electric winch on here that you can control this up and down. You can set your depths. There's different plates in here for different kernel size, bean plates, corn plates. So it might be a little late yet this year to get those products in, but definitely a really nice option for the guy that wants to just use an ATV, UTV, or even a small tractor just to get a small food plot planted. What do we got for a three point option down here, John? Okay. What we have over here is a three point brilliant style coltipacker seeder. It'll drop a bunch of different style seeds. There's a feed, a seed chart right inside there. It'll penetrate the ground a little bit. It does a real nice job. Been a very popular rental item for us. I can attest, I used this this spring and we planted some DNR road and trail mix on a new farm and this worked really well. So that's a great option for somebody. Then after you get your seeding done, some guys would like to drag that seed in and we did add an eight foot drag into our rental lineup this year. Works great behind a lawn tractor, a four-wheeler small tractor as well. So if you do need to get that seed depth a little bit deeper, that'll drag it in real nice for you. You can flip it a couple different ways to get the aggressiveness as you need. So this is our food plot rental equipment lineup. We have lots of other equipment for rent.
