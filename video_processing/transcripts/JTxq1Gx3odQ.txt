 The End His name is Enniton. Please take care of her son. It's just until we finish our studies. Do you want to be mommy's favorite? The End We're not out of electric, we've got to do is ask him to smile. Like up the old bleeding street. You're vermin. Filthy disease. I'm gonna step you out. The End Did you ever have any dreams of what you wanted to be growing up as a boy, any? Black, paper, clean and white. You're a pet. Tilbury Skins. Tilbury Skins. Tilbury Skins. Tilbury Skins. Tilbury Skins. You've been running with them you'll grow skins, isn't it? You've beaten up your own kind, thinking they want you. You ain't like them. You're better. They took everything that boy had. Look at his face. They fear their own kind. I cannot know all that you have been through. But everyday, we get to make a new choice. We get to make a new choice. Oh, hallelujah. Bang me up for sacred love. Your sacred love. Your sacred love. Your sacred love. You're sacred love. You're sacred love. You're sacred love. You're sacred love. I know all that you have been through. You know all that you have been through. But everyday, we get to make a new choice. You are burning up for sacred love. You're sacred love. You're sacred love. You're sacred love. Sacred love
