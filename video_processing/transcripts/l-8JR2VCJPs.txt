 If you go back 50 or 100 years ago on the farm, there basically was one way to do things – that was full-scale tillage on everything. You tried to get all the residue down below the soil surface, and what that did is that gave a better planting surface, so it was easier to plant the crop. It also allowed many farmers to kill the weeds, the insects, the diseases, reduce some of the compaction they'd created the previous year. There were a lot of benefits to tillage, but the problem was it destroyed a lot of the organic matter in the soil, and then on top of that we saw a lot of erosion of soil as well. So, to counteract that, people went to no-till, or we'll also talk about this strip-till concept as well.
