 I want to talk to you about the top 10 tax deductions for farmers. Don't go anywhere. Welcome, my folks, to another edition of The Awesome Souriqui Show. How are you today? I hope you are doing fantastic. I'm doing marvelous if you were to ask me. If you are doing as great as I am, go grab a cup of coffee or tea or vodka and let's roll. In today's video, I want to talk to you about the top 10 tax deductions for farmers. Now, this video has three sections, three key sections. First, I'm going to walk you through an overview of farming taxes. So all the taxation that relates to farming. And then in the second section, I will give you the top 10 tax deductions for farmers. And in section three, very important. Also, I'm going to share with you some key tax information for farmers and farming businesses in the United States. So if you are just interested in the top 10 tax deductions, I would say you want to skip forward. You want to forward to section two. Now, let's talk about section one, an overview of farming taxes. You really need to know whether your farming activity counts, because in the eyes of the IRS, not all activities, not all farming activities qualify as farming. So who does the IRS consider a farmer, really? So if you grow veggies in your backyard, garden or on the side and you sell them at a roadside farm stand, does that qualify? Does that qualify you as a farmer? Really? The IRS says that you are a farmer if you cultivate, operate or manage a farm for profit, either as an owner or a tenant. So farms include plantations, ranches, rangers, archers and groves. And you can actually raise livestock, fish or poultry or grow fruits and vegetables. But your backyard produce sales probably won't qualify you as a farmer for tax purposes, especially if you also work a full time job that is not farming related. Right. Because the IRS will probably see that you're just doing this on the side. And rather, the IRS will likely consider the money you make from your victory garden as hobby income, since you don't depend on that income for your life for your livelihood. As a result, you will not have access to the tax breaks the IRS affords farmers. And you need you need to know what you must claim as income. So as a farmer, you're likely to have multiple streams of income. And there may be some sources that you didn't know you needed to report. So to help, let me give you a quick list of farming income you may have to report. So you have sales of livestock and other resale items. Sales of livestock, produce, grains and other products you raised. Distributions from a cooperative. Agricultural program payments. Commodity credit corporation, the triple C loan proceeds. You can choose to count this as income if you pledge part of part or all of your production to secure the loan. Crop insurance proceeds. Federal crop disaster payments. Income you received from custom hire or machine work. Gasoline or fuel tax credits or refunds. If you own a farm operated by a tenant and you didn't materially participate in the farm's management or operation, guess what? You will also need to report rental income based on crop or livestock shares the tenant produces. But you won't have to pay self-employment tax on the rental income. That's pretty cool. So, and the thing I want to also say here is that as a farmer, you may have many sources of taxable income, including bartering, canceled debt, prices from livestock competitions and more. So if you want to have more, you know, you want to have a clear idea of what I'm talking about, you can see publication, IRS publication 225. You can learn more about farm income. Because there are so many different income sources you must report, it is therefore important to keep thorough records throughout the year to make it easier to file your return correctly. And you will report the income along with your expenses on Schedule F of Form 1040. We have already focused on Schedule F in another show, so I'm not going to go in length here. And you also need to know what expenses you can and cannot deduct. So farmers get a lot of deductions for the expenses they incur, but that doesn't mean that you have a blank check. It doesn't mean you can't deduct everything. Here are a few expenses. Here are a few expenses that you cannot deduct. So personal or living expenses that don't produce farm income. Example, the cost of repairing your home. You cannot deduct that. Expenses of raising anything you or your family used. For example, if your farm business is growing vegetables, but you raised hens for your family, the cost of raising those chickens is non-deductibles. All right. So the value of raised animals that died. Inventory losses and personal losses. Number four. And speaking about the. I want you to take advantage of other tax breaks. If you are a farmer or you operate a farming business, there are other tax breaks you can take advantage of. So in addition to deduct your expenses, there may be other deductions and credits you can take as a farmer. So you have the home office deduction. I will be talking about that a little one, but you may be able to deduct certain expenses using the home office deduction. If you use your home to conduct a farming business in order to qualify there, you must have used part of your home exclusively and regularly as the principal place of business for your farming operation. And you cannot have another fixed location from which you managed and administered your business. All right. Again, you want to read publication 225. If you need more info, you can also deduct net operating loss. You're no, you're annual. So for farming, as we all know, can be an unpredictable business. Right. So one year you may have a bumper crop and make a tidy profit while the next year sees a drought and disease eroding your income. So when deductible losses for when deductible losses from operating your farm exceed your other income for the year or you experience a personal or a business loss that was more than your income, you can see a net operating loss. And when that happens, the IRA says that you may be able to carry the loss back up to two years. All right. That's back. That's a carry back. And you did. And you can deduct the expense from income you had in those years. So if you carry the loss back, you may be able to get a refund for all or some of the income tax you paid for that past year. Alternatively, you can choose to carry the net operating loss forward for up to 20 years. So that's what we call the carry forwards. Okay. You can also claim fuel credit. So if you use a gasoline or other fuels for farming purposes, you might be able to claim a credit or refund on the excise taxes you paid. Note, however, that you cannot get a credit or refund for taxes paid on dyed diesel fuel and dyed kerosene. But you can claim a fuel credit. And this is very important. But before you do, be sure you understand the rules, requirements and limitations for doing so. Again, publication 225. Very important. And I want to also talk about earned income tax credit. Although this one, the EITC, is not specifically designed for farmers, the earned income tax credit may be available to you if you meet the qualifications. So the credit is designed for working people with low to moderate income. So you may not be eligible if your net form profits actually exceed a certain amount. I'll be right back. But after this, don't go anywhere. Welcome back, folks, to another section of the awesome Sweetie Kiwi Show. How are you today? I hope you're still enjoying this show. I'm going to give you now the top 10 tax deductions for farmers. Number one, car and truck expenses. So farmers like other business owners have the option to either deduct the actual cost of operating a truck or car in their business. That's option number one. Or deduct the standard mileage rate for each mile of business use. Option number two. So let's sort of dig a little deeper here. So the actual cost, what you have to do is that you can deduct those expenses related to the business use of the vehicle. So I'm just referring to gasoline, oil, repairs, license, tax, insurance, and depreciation. Of course, subject to certain limits. Or you can go with the standard mileage rate. And as of 2020, it was 57.5 cents per mile. And the IRS allows you to do that. In 2021, the rate will be 56.5 cents per mile. And basically what you have to do is you just have to log your miles. Very important to keep track of your miles. And at the end of the year, you just multiply the number of miles you ran for business by the standard mileage rate. Tax deduction number two. Conservation. So active farmers may be able to presently deduct the cost of conservation practices implemented as part of an NRCS approved or comparable state approved plan. And farmers can elect the IRC 175 soil and water conservation deduction, which is taken in the year the improvements are made for conservation expenditures in an amount up to 25% of the farmer's gross income from farming. Okay. This is very important. Now, I want you to remember that the deduction can only can only be taken for improvements made on land used for farming. And excess amounts may be carried forward to future tax years. And basically, once the farmer makes the expense election, it is the only method available to claim soil and conservation expenses. And if the farmer stops farming or dies before the full cost has been deducted, any unused deduction is lost. It cannot be capitalized to reduce any gain upon the sale of the farm. Okay. Okay. And land owners who are not eligible for the deduction must capitalize their expenses and add them to the basis of the property. So what are the eligible expenses? So the IRS allows the IRC Internal Revenue Code 175, Section 175, allows eligible taxpayers to deduct certain expenses for soil or water conservation, prevention of erosion of land using farming, or endangered species recovery. Specifically, these expenses can include the treatment or movement of earth, including leveling, conditioning, grading, terracing, contour furrowing, and the restoration of soil fertility. The construction, control, and protection of diversion channels, drainage ditches, irrigation ditches, earthen dams, and watercourses, outlets, and ponds. The eradication of brush. The planting of windbreaks. So if you have more questions about conservation expenses, you want to check out publication 225. Deduction number three. We have here a depreciation and cost recovery. So as a farmer, you are allowed by law to depreciate assets over a period of years based upon a recovery period for each type of asset. It really depends. And the modified, the makers, there is a method called makers. Modified accelerated cost recovery system is used to recover the basis of most business and investment property placed in service after 1986. And the makers consist of the general depreciation system, the GDS, and the alternative depreciation system, ADS. And the farming taxpayers use DDS, GDS, the general depreciation system, unless they are required to use ADS, most typically because they have opted out of the uniform capitalization rules. All right. So this is very important to know. And I want to show you right now on the screen. You can see here table seven. You want to check out table seven farm property recovery periods, depending upon the equipment, the assets. So you can see here for you can see the assets in one column, the recovery period in years. You have GDS, ADS. So for instance, agricultural structures like single purpose, you can depreciate them over 10 years under GDS and 15 years under ADS. So and so on and so forth. All right. And you also have section 179 that you really need to be aware of. And basically section 179 deduction applies to both new and used business equipment. And because it applies to 15 year property or less, it does not apply to farm buildings, but can be used for single purpose agricultural structures such as a hog barn. And you also have something called the additional first year depreciation, which is the bonus depreciation. This is something that was introduced by the TJCA, the Tax and Job Cuts Act, which increased additional first year depreciation, also called the bonus depreciation, by increasing the allowable amount to 100% with a phase down to sunset in 2026. So under this provision, though, producers can claim an additional first year tax deduction equal to 100% of the value of qualifying property placed into service after September 27, 2017 through December 31st, 2022. So you really want to you really want to check out this. It could be interesting for your operation. You might want to talk to a local tax accountant or a CPA or an EA to learn more about this. Deduction number four, we have fertilizer and lime. So taxpayer, if you are engaged in the business of farming, you may elect to immediately expense the cost of fertilizer and lime and basically where the benefits last substantially more than one year rather than to capitalize the expense and depreciate it over the term of its useful life. So the election here is for one year only. But once such an election is made by reporting the fertilizer and lime deduction on Schedule F, it may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS. This is very important to remember. OK, so this provision actually applies both to tenants and landlords if the rent is based upon production. And cash rent landlords who do not materially participate in the farming operation may not take advantage of this tax benefit. It's also kind of important to know that this deduction, the fertilizer and lime deduction applies only to land used in farming, which is defined as land used by the taxpayer or his tenants for the production of crops, fruits or other agricultural products or for the sustenance of livestock. So initial land preparation costs cannot be deducted. This is very important. I also want you to note that the amount of the fertilizer and lime deduction may be limited by the rule that restricts deductions for prepaid farm supplies to 50% of all other deductible farm expenses for the year. Number five, we have interest. So interest paid on farm mortgages or other farming related loans is deductible on on Schedule F as an ordinary and necessary business expense. So for cash method and accrual method farmers, interest is deductible in the year it is paid or accrued, respectively. Number six, we have rent or lease payment. So cash land rent paid by a tenant is generally deductible on line 24B of Schedule F in the year it is paid. This is kind of important. And a crop share rent is not deductible. This is an important distinction to be to be made here. And equipment rental payments made by a farmer are deductible on line 24A of Schedule B. So those are the kind of rent and lease payments that are fully deductible. Number seven, when it comes to tax deductions for farmers, we have supplies, repairs and maintenance. So as a farmer, you can generally deduct the cost of material, cost of materials and supplies in the year in which you purchase them. OK, so this will include things like deducting the cost of fuel, tools and feed. And you can also deduct most expenses incurred for the repair and maintenance of your farm property. And this will include things like repairing the roof of a farm building, for example, or painting a fence. So expenditures that substantially prolong the life of property, restore, increase its value, betterment or adapt it to a different use. However, must generally be capitalized, not deducted. In other words, there are added their cost there. The expense is added to the value to the cash, to the value of the prop of the property. So distinguishing capital expenditures from supplies, repairs, maintenance and other deductible business expenses is sometimes a difficult process, which is why I always we always advise here at Sweet Kiwi Show to have a an accountant, a local CPA or EA look over your operations. Number eight, there is something very interesting. It's called the minimus safe harbor on the tangible property regulations. And basically, in a couple of years ago, the IRS issued the tangible property regulation, the TD 9636, and to distinguish capital expenditures from supplies, repairs, maintenance and other deductible business expenses. So basically, the thing here is that you're able to elect to apply a de minimus safe harbor to emancipate to acquire or produce tangible property. So if you make this selection, you don't need to determine whether every small dollar expenditure for the acquisition of property is properly deductible or capitalized under the complex acquisition and improvement rules of the regulation. So this is a little complex. This part of the law is a little complex. The bottom line I want to say here is that you can deduct as an expense most low figure costs that you actually undertake or that you actually incur in the operation of your farm. Now, if you have more question about the de minimus safe harbor under tangible property regulations, you can either leave us a comment below or you can just reach out to a local CPA. All right. If you leave us a comment, if you leave us a comment below, we will certainly get back to you. Our team will certainly get back to you. Number nine, seeds and plants. So as a farmer, you can generally deduct the cost of seeds and plants used to produce a crop for sale. And this deduction is taken on on schedule F also. I believe it's on line 26. And this rule does not apply to plants with a preproductive period of more than two years. For example, trees and vines and cost of this types of plants must generally be capitalized, not deducted as an ordinary business income. All right. So under the tax cut and jobs act, farmers with gross incomes of $26 million or less in 2020 are not subject to the UNICAP rules under IRC 263. All right. And this is very important. Number 10, taxes. Taxes are very important. So as a farmer, you can generally deduct the following types of taxes on your schedule F. So you have, and this is, I believe, around line 29. Okay. So you have, you can deduct real estate and personal property taxes on farm business assets. It has to be only on farm business assets. Very, very important. You can deduct FICA taxes paid to match the amount with health for employees. Federal unemployment taxes on farm employees. Federal use taxes paid on highway motor vehicles used for farming. Note that states or local states tax imposed on the purchase of capital assets for use in farming operations must be capitalized, not deducted. Because again, when you, when you buy a piece of equipment, you basically are paying the whole, you're making the, you are paying the vendor the, the gross, the price of the asset plus the sales tax. So the sales tax in this, in this case is considered part of the, the final sales price. So you have to capitalize them. You have to capitalize that cost in your, in your accounting books. All right. I'll be right back. Right after this. Don't go anywhere. Welcome back folks to another session of the awesome Sweetie Kiwi show. I promised you that we had three sections in this show. And right now I want to give you some important tax information for farmers and farming business. So I'm showing you right now. There is a comprehensive list of deductible farm expenses on a schedule F part two. You can see this right now on the screen. The reason why I'm showing you this is because besides the top 10 tax deductions for farmers, there is a constellation of other expenses that you might qualify for depending on your situation, which is why I wanted to show this to you. All right. So this is, you can see on the screen right now, you can see it. So we go from car and truck expenses on line 10, all the way to a line 32, where you can actually specify other expenses. Really depending upon your situation. So I want to give you some time to look at this. Right. So this is the schedule F I was just talking to you about earlier. As a matter of fact, we have covered the schedule F on another show. You might want to go and actually check out that, that show to, uh, you know, learn more about the, uh, the learn more about schedule F. I also want to talk about prepaying expenses. You know, prepaying expenses is a very important thing. One thing I also wanted to say before I talk about prepaying expenses, that insurance other than health is deductible. All right. It is deductible. So cash method taxpayers generally can deduct their expenses for the year in which they pay them. So as a farmer, you can actually deduct expenses for the year in which you pay them. Some limits to do, uh, some limits to deduction, however, occur with respect to the prepayment of expenses. So you have something called a 50% limit. So cash basis farmers are generally allowed to prepay the cost of farm supplies, such as feed, seed, and fertilizer by purchasing them in one year, even though they will not use the supplies until the following year. And this allows farmers to shift deductions to an earlier tax year. And the amount of the allowable deduction for prepaid expenses is limited by, uh, internal revenue code 464. So, uh, which says that the prepaid farm expenses may not exceed 50% of other deductible farm expenses, including depreciation, unless one of the following exceptions is met. So there are five exceptions. So we're going to put them on the, on the screen. So the prepaid farm supplies expenses is more than 50% of the other deductible farm expenses because of a change in business operation caused by unusual circumstances. Exception number two, the total prepaid farm supplies expense for the preceding three tax years is less than 50% of the total other deductible farm expenses for those three tax years. So to qualify for an exception, the taxpayer must also be farm related, meaning that one of the following three, this is why two plus three makes five, the following three must apply. So we have taxpayers, principal residence is on a farm, taxpayers, principal occupation of farming, or taxpayer is a member of the family of a taxpayer who meets one of the above requirements. So basically what I'm trying to say here is that if the prepaid farm supply expenses exceed 50% of all other expenses and an exception does not apply, the amount of the expense deduction in excess of 50% must be deducted in the later tax year. Very important. In other words, the excess must not be deducted when the supplies are actually used or consumed. Another thing that I also want to mention quickly here when we have a conversation about taxation of farming activities is something called farm syndicates. So remember, farm syndicates are not allowed to deduct seed, feed, fertilizer, or other similar farm supplies until actually used or consumed. So the Internal Revenue Service actually defines farm syndicate as a partnership or any other enterprise other than a corporation, which is not an ex-corporation engaged in the trade or business of farming. If at any time interest in such partnership or enterprise have been offered for sale in an offering required to be registered with any federal or state agency, have an authority to regulate the offering of securities for sale. So that's option one for a farm syndicate. The second definition is that a farm syndicate can be a partnership or any other enterprise other than a corporation, which is not an ex-corporation engaged in the trade or business of farming. If more than 35% of the losses during any period are allocable to limited partners or limited entrepreneurs. Okay. So the term farming for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code 464 that I mentioned earlier, means that there is a cultivation of land or the raising or harvesting of any agricultural or horticultural commodity, including the raising, sharing, sharing, not sharing, sharing, feeding, caring for, training, and management of animals. So farming does not include timber for this purpose. Okay. So farming does not include timber for this purpose. Okay. Okay. Okay. And the IRS also requires that cash method farmers deduct interest only in the year accrued and paid. There are other requirements. So in addition to the above limitation, the cost of supplies bought in the current year for use in the following year is deductible by cash basis taxpayer in the current year only. Okay. Okay. If the expenditure is a payment for the purchase rather than a mere deposit or the prepayment is made for a business purpose and not merely for tax avoidance. And three, the deduction in the taxable year of prepayment does not result in a material distortion of income. All right, folks, this is it for today's conversation. I really appreciated your attention. I was talking to you about the top 10 deductions for farmers. And the video, as I said earlier, is divided in three sections. So section one, you have overview of farming taxes. You need to know whether your farming activity counts. You need to know what you must claim as income. You need to know what expenses you can and cannot deduct. You need to take advantage of other tax breaks. Section number two, the top 10 tax deductions for farmers. Number one, car and truck expenses. Number two, conservation. Number three, depreciation and cost recovery. Number four, fertilizer and lime. Number five, interest. Number six, rent or lease payments. Number seven, supplies, repairs and maintenance. Number eight, de minimis, safe harbor on the tangible property. Number nine, seeds and plants. And number 10, taxes. And the third section has important tax information for farmers and farming businesses, including part two of schedule F, which actually indicates all the farm expenses. Thank you so much for your attention. Once again, I will see you next time. But until then, remember, stay tuned. More. All right. Thank you. . . . . . . . . Tool determinationfollow
