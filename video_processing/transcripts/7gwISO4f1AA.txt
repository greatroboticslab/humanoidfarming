Science & Technology
 The food crop that you're growing, it loves and needs available calcium and phosphorus. Those are the two minerals needed to start the process. Once you have available calcium and phosphorus, then the plant wants to make sure it has carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Those five things, calcium, phosphorus, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen make up the basis of what a plant is made of. Guess what a weed doesn't like? It doesn't like available calcium. It doesn't like available phosphorus. And it does not like carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen in elevated levels that your crop does. So when you see a weed growing, you can say, oh, we must have a calcium deficiency or a phosphorus deficiency or a carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen deficiency that allows that medicinal, not nutritional, but medicinal weed to grow.
