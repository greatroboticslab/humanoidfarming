 So as any as no farming, there's always amounting of work being done. In today's video I think I'm going to point out a few jobs that I'm wanting to get done. Hopefully then it will encourage me to actually get them done, because he's usually fit to hold me to it. So this wee boy has just walked away. One of the things I want to do with him, I want to get him a halter trained. One of the reasons I actually want to get this boy halter trained is simply I haven't done it in a while. It has been quite a while since I've actually broke an animal in. It was always something I loved doing growing up. Got them broke in, standing at nights, combing them, working with them. I did get real enjoyment out of it. Just haven't had the time this last few years. It just hasn't really been happening. Because we sell all the bulls at home out of the yard, we're not taking them to sales. We never bother getting them ready to show her that. So this boy probably won't end up in a sale. I would like to think I'll get him sold out of the yard. Still, it would be nice just to keep my hand in the game and have a go at breaking them in. So hopefully I'll get a video showing you the sort of process of it. It will take a few days. One of the first things I will do is basically try and get the bull familiar with me. I haven't been in the pen. The only time I'm in with him is if he's getting shifted to get cleaned out. So one of the first things I'll do, which probably won't go too successful here, is a little brush. If I can get my hand on him, just start combing him. Once I start scratching him, it will relax him. The bull likes getting scratched. He'll learn then to come to you to get a scratch. So we'll give it a go. So you're not worried about combing his hair or getting him sort of all dressed up as such. You're literally just getting the comb on him to get him used to it. Get that scratch started. And already you can see he's definitely enjoying getting his back scratched anyway. You see the head going like that. So it's as simple as that. Obviously the beast has to be quiet to begin with. If you have a real flighty beast, he ain't going to stand to let you get your hand on him. It will just a matter then, a couple of days, I'll just do this in the pen. Give him a wee comb, scratch. Then I'll put him up the crush and I'll put a hulter on him. So basically that is my very first starting point. Breaking in an animal is getting them familiar. Getting them used to you being beside them. Scratching them. The more familiar they are with you, the less abuse you're going to be giving them when you go to hulter training. You'll also notice this boy is a bit dirty. And the dung is sticking to him. So I had this pen. Basically I had a bit of bedding at the back. I had wood chip in. I could not get him to lie on it. He just kept picking a wet spot or dirty spot in the pen to lie. Hence you see now the whole floor basically is covered in straw. He's just one of them bulls that just, he just lies somewhere awkward where he shouldn't. But this way the whole floor is clean. Hopefully I'll get him clean. Again once I get him hulter broke, I'll give him a bit of a wash. A lot of that should come off handy enough. Give his tail a bit of a clip and tidy him up. But that's a video for another day. I'll not be starting today because I'll be heading into work shortly. So another obvious job on the list about this place, if you've seen the other videos. The yard needs tidied. The yard's a bit of a mess. Stuff parked everywhere. Need to get everything in to its spot. Get the yard tidied up. Behind me, this shed before lambing at the start of the year. I was putting the tin up in the shed. And that was as far as I got. It was a bit of a panic. We're working away, trying to get the timbers and tin up for the sheep coming into lamb. Got it to that stage, they're still tending to go in the front of her. That was as far as I got. It should have been done. I took on putting the shed up myself. Saving a few pounds, which was great. Just got to that stage, lambing kicked in. Everything else took over. We'll get it done. But now you know it's to be done. You can give me grief if I haven't. Even the likes of the straw sitting in this shed. It obviously isn't where it's to be kept all winter. It'll be going over into another shed. Another thing I haven't got round to. So these gates. Each bay here will have sheep in them. The one thing these gates the sheep can get through. And I have, you see this next pen is actually carpet over the gates there to keep the sheep in. Which really is a temporary solution. Also when these gates come round, there's not much ground clearance there at the minute. When they come round shut to the gate. It raises up. They could sort of go underneath even if you have something hanging over. So I want to get, basically I want to get wee things made. That I can hook on to the gate. And then if I want to shut the gate round. I can lift up. And the gate will swing with them hung on it. Just another one to add to the list. Another job needing done as probably sooner rather than later. Is me spouting. If you can see up there. I had a bit of pipe on that. Didn't work. Sort of put it at a slight angle. Wasn't a good job. We rushed that wee bit. Need to get a bit of flexy pipe. That there will be coming down into this drinker. Bit of pipe connected up there. Have to kind of secure it tight in this wall. Because we would have cattle and stuff in here at times. And the drinker, there were drubs. So we might have to put like a wee bolt, wee bracket to support that on. Shed behind me. Missing tin there. And I'm missing tin here. And I'm also missing a door. So basically the door had rotted. In bad shape. Then broke off the hinges. Need to get a new door made. These blocks. Need to get them ripped off. Basically these ones here. Knock them down. Put them on their flat. Build this up a bit thicker and stronger. Because that's where the door will be bolted to. The tin. Not going to be spending a lot of money buying tin. I have three sheets on the far side. Which will fill the bottom gap. And these two gaps. That bit there, I'd rather leave it open. And have that there side secured. I like having that corner kind of opened up actually. And it lets a good breeze through the cattle. Behind me we have one of the rashest gating systems. Which is a pain in the back of the car. Just a bit. That's not a bit. One child. I'm smoking a lot. But that's not a bit. The other side. I'm smoking a lot of green. Because I'm smoking a little bit. I'm smoking a little bit. Don't get a little bit. I'm smoking a little bit. It's a bit. I'm smoking a little bit. I'm smoking a little bit. But the other side is smoking a little bit. breeze through the cattle. Behind me we have one of the rashest gating systems which is a pain in the backside. You can't really call that a gating system when it's just every bits and pieces put together. Every time you want to go in and out round the back you have to use the Merlot to shift the buck rake and the grab. We also have a Cleo. So a Cleo is not really much use for a gate. I need to get that sorted, get gates hung there, get this corner tidied up. So another job, I don't know, the light's maybe not as great in here. The big girl, the big 2205, she needs new knives in her and she needs a couple other wee bits. I can't even mind what they're called. Basically in at the shear bar there's a couple of wee cones and bolts needed. It's to give that flex but to keep the stability in her just when you're moving and tightening her up. So that in theory should be this winter's project. Touchwood, the harvester's gone really well for me. She needs the new knives and there's wee waffler plates behind to help throw the grass up. They need to go on. I want to get that done as soon as possible because when it comes first cut next year I want to be fit to just go boom at it and get a couple of days weather, get it done. I need Big Bud, brother and I to do this. So this will probably be done the day before I am for cutting silage. He'll be working at it. So I have to find a way to get him g'd up and get that done. There's parts and all sitting there already in the house so I have to get him cornered someday. Another gate on the list is this here behind me. As you can see she's rotting away down at the bottom. It's an old rusty gate. It's been patched before basically I need that sorted anyway. The sheep, I would put the sheep up the crush. She can get through that so I want to get a proper gate made that'll keep cattle and sheep both in. I'm not going to bore yous with all the jobs on the list to do because it'll be endless and I'll not get half of them done anyway. Other job just now when I see it is the hay bub. Next year I would like to try and get a wee bit of hay mead myself. Hay bub needs new tines and springs. There's tines nearly in all of them but the springs is kind of gone. There's a lot of the tines is bent. I have the stuff sitting there. Just one of them things. I have to get around to it. These bits are blowing in the wind at the minute. This is the idea I mean for between the gates and other sheepshed. These brackets I can lower them down to this one and that keeps the ground completely secured or if I want to open the gate then we're set back up to there. We also have the general tractors and Merlot could do with a good wash. A few other bits of machinery probably could do with a bit of a bit of a spring or winter clean and just check everything over make sure everything's going all right. Post driver sitting in this ground is not in any sort of condition for me to be getting at that. That is one of the biggest things I really do want to get caught up on is the fencing. I have been getting through it not too bad but fencing and gateways, new gates in, make things handier for my dad, make things handier if I have to come in late from work early in the morning I can get up, shift cattle stock, no hassle, no breakouts, not chasing around after things. Also to manage the ground better. At the minute there I have four failures sheep running over trumping in and out through gateways, no use at all between no gates, no fences. Things like foot rot that'll just spread you know the sheep take that one past trumping round round in and out them gateways. At the minute it's with being away all day in the job you're basically farming in the dark in the morning and dark at night so you're just kind of keeping the thing ticking over getting daylight hours to actually get some of them other jobs done is tricky. Your weekends basically is when you're your only opportunity to do it and you're nearly always sure something goes wrong or something breaks something else happens on a Saturday which gets you tied up. But for what stress it is trying to have the job and the farm as well I know it's the right option for me to do. It's just going to take me a while to get settled in the routine of managing the 40 hour week plus this place plus all our family commitments and whatnot. But I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't love it. So if you're still watching thank you very much for the support.
