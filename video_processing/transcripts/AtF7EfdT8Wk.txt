 This is the legendary hay and grain feeder from Sioux Steel Company. It's made tough as they come. 16 gauge steel on the top, 18 gauge on the pan. Perfect for any operation that you have, whether it's cattle, horses, or even in the pasture. This is the legendary V-bar system. You can literally put a round or a square bale in this. The V-bar system allows the hay to fall down straight into the pan for easier access for your cattle. It eliminates 50% of your waste. Not only is the hay and grain feeder built to last, it also weighs 600 pounds. It's not going anywhere. It's built for cattle, horses, anything that you put in it. If they start jacking around with it, it's not going to move. Not only is it approved by most ranchers and cattle people, it's cowgirl approved.
