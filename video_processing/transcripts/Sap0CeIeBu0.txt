Howto & Style
 Insects can be a nuisance in the garden, but they play an important role in the ecosystem. They provide food for birds, they help pollinate our gardens, and they help break down organic matter into nutritious soil that our plants can use. So when you use a pesticide, no matter how organic it claims to be, you are still affecting the ecosystem. So I'm going to show you some ways that you can control pests without using any pesticides. Hi, I'm Kristina with Forever Food Forest, a channel where we explore ways of growing food without the use of pesticides, herbicides, or commercial fertilizers. And instead, we rely on creating symbiotic ecosystems that are good for the garden and good for the planet. Let's get into it. In this video, I'm going to show you how I keep pests under control in my garden naturally. First rule of pest-free plants is happy and healthy plants. And right behind me is my number one secret for happy and healthy plants, and that is a compost pile. Compost is an excellent soil amendment, and it works over time at keeping your plants happy and thriving. In my personal gardening, I found that whenever I lay a top layer of about one inch of compost, magically the pests stay away from those plants. Now I'm going to get really scientific here, so I want you to stay with me because I'm going to explain how. You see, when plants are stressed, they attract pests. Over-fertilization, an excess of fertilizer, is one such source of stress. What happens is, as plants take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water, they synthesize that into carbohydrates. And then those carbohydrates, with the aid of nitrogen, either from the soil or through foliar feeding, is converted into amino acids and essentially protein, like plant protein, right? When there is an imbalance of minerals in the soil or watering issues or pH issues, plants become stressed because they're not able to synthesize these molecules properly. And the result is a stressed plant with excess sugar and excess nitrogen. The plant is not going to look anemic or sickly. Instead, it'll look really green and lush, like excessively green. Basically, your plants get fat. And to an aphid, that sickly plant looks like a slice of cake and a sea of kale. Excess nitrogen is a magnet for aphids. They feed off of it, have lots of babies, and then create an infestation that sucks the life out of your plants. Did you know that plants have natural defenses that make them taste terrible to insects? Nitrogen is responsible for the green growth in plants. But the problem is, when there's too much nitrogen, the plant puts all of its energy towards growing and putting out green growth, and it neglects its natural defenses. Compost, rich in decomposed organic matter, provides plants with all the nutrients they need to boost their natural defenses. Healthy plants are rarely attacked by pests because their natural immune system makes them indigestible to insects. The difference between compost and synthetic fertilizers is like the difference between eating whole organic foods and a diet consisting of only multivitamins. Soil that contains compost is full of beneficial fungi, and fungi help keep plants healthy by out-competing disease-causing organisms and by creating symbiotic relationship with plant roots. So what happens is the fungus or fungi, through their massive mycelium network, tap into the roots of the plants. And because of this massive network, they can get nutrients and water where water is not readily available for the plants. So they can transport the water to the plant, and in exchange, the plant provides them with sugars. And if you think about it, it's in the best interest of the fungus to keep plants happy and healthy because they provide them with sugars. Now what I'm about to say is that the plant is a plant that can help you to help you with your natural plants. And you can use it to communicate with each other and share resources. So if one plant gets attacked by caterpillars, that information is sent to all the plants in the network, along with the resources needed to boost up their immune system and fight off the attack. Isn't that cool? And that's why I am huge into practicing permaculture and the no-dig method, because when you disturb the soil, you're also disturbing that natural mycelium network. You might be thinking to yourself, I want to grow food now. I don't have time to wait until my compost is finished. So here are some other ways to keep pests off your plants. Let's talk about trap crops. Trap crops are another resource you can grow. to keep pests from destroying your garden. Trap crops are sacrificial plants that you grow with the intention of attracting insects. And once they get infested, you remove the plant and the pests along with it. Examples of trap crops are nasturtiums. They're a cool season flower that is excellent at attracting aphids. You can grow it in borders or going up a trellis because it is a vining plant. And the flowers and the leaves are also edible. So you can make a really delicious garnish or a pesto. Another example of a trap crop is calendula. Calendula is literally nature's sticky trap. The stems of this medicinal herb are covered in a sticky resin. And when pests sit in that resin, they get stuck and can't leave. So they can't spread to your other plants. I plant calendula along borders as a ground cover and in between my tomatoes and my strawberries. Radishes are excellent at attracting all kinds of pests. They are pest magnets and farmers have been using them for centuries as sacrificial trap crops. I plant radishes to save my broccoli. Right here I have my broccoli that I'm going to eat. And back there I have my trap crop of radishes that are completely infested. And check this out. The broccoli is amazingly pest free. And I did add a little bit of compost before I planted it. So that might have something to do with the health of this broccoli. However, our temperatures have been in the 90s. It's practically summer here and broccoli is a cool weather crop. So the fact that it's doing so well is a testament that compost and trap crops really do work. I am utterly disturbed by the amount of aphids on this. They're shedding. That is, oh that's disgusting. We're going to compost these. Ladybugs are a natural aphid predator. They love aphids. They just go nom nom nom nom nom nom nom. It's like a buffet for them. Predatory insects are insects that feed on other insects and they don't harm your plants. One example is ladybugs. Ladybugs eat aphids. So wherever you see aphids just keep an eye out because you might see some ladybugs. Oh there's a ladybug here. You can also order ladybugs online and release them in your garden. But if you don't have a food source for them they will leave. So what I like to do is get them for free through mother nature by growing plants that attract ladybugs naturally. And some of those plants are herbs such as dill, cilantro, and parsley. So if you want to attract beneficial insects that are going to do the pest control for you, make sure to grow dill, parsley, and cilantro in your garden as well as basil. Basil has other benefits. It repels a lot of pests. So growing a combination of herbs and attracting beneficial insects and using compost will help minimize pests in your garden. But what do you do about large insects like caterpillars and grasshoppers? Well, you attract their natural predators, birds. So how do you attract birds to your garden? Grow berries and seeds that birds can eat. Plant shrubs where birds can hide. Provide them with a source of clean water. Birds are some of nature's most voracious predators and by attracting them to our garden they are going to do all the work for us. If you live in the southeast you're probably familiar with these little guys. They're anolis and they're awesome. They are a gardener's friend and an important part of the ecosystem here in Florida because if there is one thing that we're famous for other than their beaches and theme parks it's our insects and these little guys love to eat the insects. So if you have them around they're a good thing to have and if you have too many of them don't worry. Owls are their natural predators and they will eat them and then you'll have owls. Although pests can be a nuisance they are an important part of the ecosystem. Insects provide food for birds as well as other animals and by using pesticides you are essentially getting rid of these insects indiscriminately. So you're not only getting rid of the pests you are also getting rid of the beneficial insects and insects that provide food for maybe some rare and endangered species and thus causing irreparable damage to the ecosystem. So what I want to do is I want to encourage you to try growing food without using pesticides and let me know how it goes in the comments below. And remember the whole idea behind permaculture gardening is to create a symbiotic ecosystem where plants animals and insects live in balance. Hopefully this was informative.

And now let's roll the bloopers reel of me getting eaten by bugs while trying to make this video. Until next time, f*** off bugs! If you have an idea for a topic or something that you want to learn more about. I'm going to be able to get out. And normally, oh my god, they're crawling all over me. What the f*** is that? F***ing cicadas! F***ing cicadas! F***ing cicadas! I'm covered in catnip. And that's going to protect me from all the bugs that are out today.
