 So how often should you water your tomato plants? This is going to vary depending on a lot of factors like how hot it is outside, the type of soil you have, the kind of tomato, and if you're mulching or not mulching. Deeper watering is key so that those tomato roots will go deeper into the soil which will also require less watering. To accomplish that I highly recommend if you can install some sort of drip irrigation system which is what I have here and this has been a game changer for me this season. I should have done this years ago. Right now it's fall time so it's not that hot so I'm running this system two times a week set at one hour. A key indicator that your plants need more water is if they're drooping and they don't recover by evening time. Sometimes they're just drooping because it's just too hot outside but if they don't recover by evening that means they're drooping because they don't have enough water. In that case you might have to adjust how often you're watering maybe go more than two times a week. You will just have to experiment with your garden and figure out what works best for your plants.
