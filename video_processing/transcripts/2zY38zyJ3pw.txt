Howto & Style
 This is a soilless cultivation greenhouse. The person here picks a handful of lettuce and takes a big bite, seemingly proving that the vegetables grown here are completely green and pollution-free. The water used for cultivating the vegetables is purified to meet direct drinking standards, ensuring the accurate proportion of nutrients in the nutrient solution and avoiding interference from the original minerals in the water. This soilless cultivation technology can prevent soil-borne pests and diseases, reducing the use of pesticides, but the price is relatively higher.
