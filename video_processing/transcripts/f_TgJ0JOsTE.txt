 In today's class, we are going to go over Agricultural Mechanization. Under this, we are going to talk about what is meant by Agricultural Mechanization, the aims and objectives of Agricultural Mechanization, and the source of power in agriculture. The big question is what is meant by Agricultural Mechanization. In simple terms, Agricultural Mechanization refers to the application of engineering principles for operating farm machines with a view to increasing farm operations and output. What is meant by Engineering Principle? What are those engineering principles that we apply on the farm to increase the farm operations and output? This engineering principle includes mechanical advantage, wheel and axle, lever and pulley system. We are going to talk about more of this engineering principle as we delve into this particular topic. You understand? So, in simple terms, the application of engineering principle for operating farm machines with a view to increase farm operations and output is what we call Agricultural Mechanization. You understand? Do you understand? If you don't understand, reverse the video and listen to the explanation again. Okay? Now, having to understand what is meant by Agricultural Mechanization, why do we need all these machines? Why do we need to refarm? You understand? Why do we employ machines on the farm? The first point is to increase efficiency of production. Ok? To increase efficiency of production. To increase efficiency of production. What? To increase efficient efficiency of production. utilized to boost agricultural and food production you understand that's another definition the use of machines okay so now having to understand what is meant by agricultural mechanization why is it important on the farm what is the aim why do we employ machines on the farm the first point is to increase efficiency of production okay to increase efficiency of production you see one of the importance of agricultural mechanization is to increase the efficiency of production that is it helps to minimize wasted time and effort you understand it helps to minimize wasted time and effort for example let's say a farmer want to cultivate um if i want to cultivate one hectare of land if that farmer will employ manual labor it will very it will consume a lot of time you understand but if machines such as tractor and other um other machines are used you see that within a short period of time the land is already done you understand so that's one of the that's one of the importance and the aims and objective of agricultural mechanization it helps to it increase the efficiency of production you understand it enables the farmer to cultivate large areas of land within short period of time you understand that is one of the important also you know if mansion is employed mansion is substituted for labor so it's significant significantly reduce the numbers of labor used on the farm that is what efficiency of production talks about reduction in time loss and effort you understand so that's it another aims of employing machine on the farm is to reduce farm drogery and hazard you see farm mechanization makes farm work easier and interesting because it helps in performing power intensive tasks you understand example is that let's say if i want to cultivate 28 hectares of land you understand now imagine using cutlers to weed 28 hectares of land that one is so demanding you understand that one is power intensive so in an attempt to reduce the stress we employed farm machines you understand so it has to perform those farm drogery and um those farm drogery work those work on the farm that required intense power you understand that is what we call um drogery work on the farm i pay attention so that's one of the importance of um agricultural mechanization do you understand okay so let's move to number three it encourages families of farm operation as i've stated earlier that's one of the things that efficiency talks about mechanization ensure that the farm work is carried out very fast you understand i pay attention for example i will say let's just cite another example now let's say even you yourself you want to cultivate maybe 500 hectares of land no matter the amount of numbers of labor that you employ it will not be as effective as using a farm machine you understand so it's encouraged and ensures that farm work is carried out very faster i pay attention and you know that the timeliness of farm operation has assumed greater significance in obtaining optimum yield because the the time that you're supposed to use to um we and do um used to do other um other work on the farm because of already employed machine you're still going to use those time to do another important thing you understand you're still going to use that those time to do another significant things on the farm are you paying attention so that is one of the importance of agricultural mechanization do you understand okay another point is that it helps to increase productivity you understand how does farm mechanization helped us to increase productivity farm mechanization helps to increase productivity by enabling the farmer to cultivate large areas of land within a short period of time you understand and in that case the uh the output that is gotten from farm will be increased you understand another objective and aim of agricultural mechanization is that it encourages farmers to practice life-scale farming mechanization results in a shift from subsistence farming to life-scale farming because you know when you have a lot of resources that can cover a lot of uh the lot of uh for example you have machines that you can use to weed hectares of land that you can you have planter you have a bester you will want to move from cultivating small areas of land to cultivating large areas of land that is large scale farming i pay attention and this shift of course mainly due to the need for more land and capital to be associated with farmers in order to reap the full technology benefits for example let's say a farmer is cultivating one plot of land before now when the farmer gets resources he has machine that that is able to cultivate more than one plot of land in an attempt to reap the full benefits of the machines that he has he's going to try expanding the farm you understand that is one of the importance and the aims of agricultural mechanization do you understand okay i want you to note one important thing mechanization can be partial or complete when we talk about partial mechanization when part of the farm work is being done by farm machine that is called partial mechanization i pay attention and for complete mechanization all the farm work is being done by the farm machine you understand okay let's move to the source of power in agriculture power refers to the time rate at which work is done in the farm you understand now power is the time rate of doing work i pay attention that means work cannot be done without power i pay attention so adding we are going to be talking about how farmers source power on the farm to perform various jobs and activities on the farm on a daily basis i pay attention so let's start with the first one we have the human power the human power is provided by human being i pay attention it is the most common source of power in the farm operations i pay attention man too is intelligent can perform activities on the farm such as flooding arguing region planting harvesting and other other activities like that but the one of the disadvantages of human power is that it consumes a lot of time you understand it consumes a lot of time and energy okay let's talk about the advantages of human power and the disadvantages okay let's look at the advantages of human power the first one there is that it is easily available in all farm operating you see i discover on my farm that um one of my farm machine is 40 and i need to weigh some parts of the farm so in that case i make use of my hands with the use of some basic tools such as um what last i pay attention so that is it use of labor on the farm to carry out some farm operation is known as human power you understand so that is one of the advantages of human power and also the second advantage there is that it is it is it is easy to control you understand of course you can easily control your laborers on the farm but eventually if you didn't want them to do some things you will tell them that they shouldn't do it that's one of the advantage of human power okay let's look at the disadvantage of human power the first point is that it cannot perform tedious farm work tedious farm work are those farm work that is not interested those are farm work that is slow another disadvantage is that human power consumes a lot of time and energy you understand you know the time rate of doing work is what we call power so if you employ human power on your farm the time which human will use to carry out the activities will not be the same time which you are going to use to do it using your farm machines you understand so human power consume a lot of time and energy another one is efficiency decreases with age you understand that is it uh you cannot compare the work that um a young man would do with the work that an old man would do you understand so the efficiency which is the time rate the time at which work is done decreases the output which you got the result the time at which the activities is being carried out is done decreases with age as the age of human increases there is a limit to the activities that such person can do on the farm you understand so uh the efficiency decreases with age having talked about the advantage and disadvantage of human power those advantage are also their characteristic you understand those advantage that i gave you those advantage and disadvantage they are the characteristic of human power they are mostly primitive highly inefficient highly energy consumption low cultivated area and others like that okay there is one point that i want to give you under this human power the horsepower the power rating the power rating please pay attention the power rating is 0.1 horsepower hp means horsepower you understand that is one of the points that i want to give you you understand you can see that it is very low are you pay attention it is very low so um that is why it is time consuming and energy consumption you understand imagine 0.1 of uh the power rating of human power being 0.1 horsepower there is limit to which there is limit to the activity that can be done on daily to day basis on the farm you understand so that is the those are the characteristic advantage and disadvantages of human power okay let's talk about the hanima power this is the power derived from farm animals which are used to perform some farm operations you know we've talked about human power now we are moving to another source of power on the farm which is what animal power hanima power now i'm giving you the explanation the definition of animal power they are power derived from farm animals which are used to perform some farm operations on the farm example include bulls you know bulls are used for pulling plow you understand they are used to pull farm machines such as plow harbors and planters you understand so even camel are used to carry load you understand so that is one of the uh those are the animals that perform some operations on the farm we have the bulls for moving some uh machines such as arrows planters and plows we have the camel and horse and donkey which are used for transportation of farm produce you understand okay let's look at the characteristic of animal power the first characteristic that i want to talk about is the power rating the power rating of animal power is 1.5 okay the power rating of animal power is 1.5 horsepower you can see now even comparing even human power to animal power animal power is still more efficient compared to human power you understand so that is it okay so it is 1.5 horsepower that is the power rating of animal power you understand okay another statistic is that it is better than manual or human power you can see now it is better than manual or human power another characteristic is that it has higher capacity for animal drawn tools you know in this uh in this source of power for farm operation we use animal to pull machines such as planters plow so these animals have higher capacity to draw tools you understand another characteristic of animal power is that they are prone to satisfy infestation you know this animal that you are using to perform one or two functions on the farm they are also susceptible to peters fly you understand they are also susceptible to some uh some insects example is the peters fly are you paying attention so that those are the characteristics now from this characteristic you can easily identify the advantage and disadvantage for example we want to talk about the advantage the advantage is that animal power is better than um human power another advantage is that they um they have an hyper power rating compared to human power you understand that is another advantage so and disadvantage is that this animal are susceptible to petersla infestation you understand i pay attention so that is it let's talk about the mechanical power okay mechanical power that is the third power source on the fan mechanical power mechanical power mechanical power please kindly pay attention to the explanation okay now mechanical power the power rating in mechanical power is 10 to 200 horsepower you understand the power rating the power the power power rating is 10 to 200 horsepower you can see that um this one will have an advantage over the other source of power even looking at the power rating i pay attention so the power rating is 10 to 200 uh horsepower let's try let me explain what's the mechanical power on the pan they are the power derived from machines you understand this power is derived from machines you know i told you that human power is derived from human even being like me and you animal power is derived from animal using animal to put some machines on the pan such as planter and other machines like that another another source of fan power now is mechanical power you understand so we're going to talk about this mechanical power are those power that is derived from fan machines machines these for machines include planter arrows harvesters ridges flowers etc you understand so let's look at the characteristic of mechanical power the first characteristic is their power rating the power rating of mechanical power is 10 to 200 horsepower okay the second point here is that with the with the the eighth of mechanical power it is very uh it makes it easier for the farmer to cover more areas of land of cultivation you understand to cultivate large areas of land point three is that it is highly efficient okay compared to the human power and the animal power mechanical power is highly efficient it reduces time rate of doing work and also and as productivity that is the first point then the sixth point there don't forget that we are not looking at the advantage now we are talking about their characteristic if you know their characteristic you can easily know the advantage and disadvantage are you paying attention so the fourth point okay the fifth point now is that it is expensive okay it is highly expensive imagine what's the cost of tractor now you want to get the tractor even to bubble are you paying attention so it is expensive now the fifth point is that it requires skilled labor you you cannot drive a tractor you cannot operate this farm machine if you are not skilled you understand and this uh another point here is that it requires high maintenance cost if one of the spare parts is damaged the cost of maintaining the part of these farm machines is expensive you understand okay another point is that it can lead to unemployment of the people you know that when you is when you as a farmer you substitute the work that labor are supposed to do for farm machine those labor will not be able to uh do anything hence there is unemployment for example let's say the work that 200 laborers are supposed to do you just use tractor or any other farm machines to do the job you can see now so because the farm machine has substitute the work that humans are supposed to do this leads to unemployment you understand okay another source of power that we're gonna talk about is solar power okay solar power that is the third power source on the farm solar oh sorry that is the fourth one fourth solar power okay solar power okay let's look at the uh the meaning of solar power this is the power derived from radiation light and heat reacting the earth from the sun you see that is it that is the simplest definition of solar power when we talk about solar we're talking about the energy the power derived from the sun but this energy doesn't just we didn't just derive it from the sun is translated into radiation light and heat i pay attention which is reaching the earth from the sun that is what we call solar power characteristic is that it is useful for space heating water heating and crop drying example is that if you want to produce let's say uh you want to preserve your crop you can sun dry them you understand that is one of the characteristics characteristic another characteristic is that it is free of course some um everybody provided that you are on this earth you can use the sun you can use it for builder's purposes example is what we just talked about over eating i mean eating of the farm produce sun drying i pay attention another another point is that it is cheap source of power it is easily available also it is only available during the day you understand it is only available during the day okay so it cannot be controlled adjusted or stored that is it that is also one of the uh that's also one of the characteristics it cannot be controlled also it's from treating supply okay it's from treating supply for example uh you might have a day that the weather is uh the sun is harsh and you might also have a day that you know the weather is cool you understand so that is it is from treat and supply so those are the characteristics of solar power another power that i'm gonna talk about is the wind power this the fifth power source is the wind power wind power okay another power source on the farm is the wind power wind power is the power generated by the wind movement you understand it is used in wind mill to generate power by wind and also used in pumping water out of the bottle that is the simplest definition of wind power wind power refers to power generated from the wind let's look at the characteristic number one it is used with wind beam okay what is the function of wind beam the function of wind beam is to show the direction of the wind you understand okay another point here is that it is available everywhere okay it cannot be stored and it is difficult to control those are the characteristics of wind power you understand the next source of power that we're going to talk about 100 sources of power in agriculture is the nuclear power you understand the nuclear power nuclear power will pass to the power directly from nuclear energy you understand are you pay attention so that is it and the characteristic is that it is clean source of power and this and this source of power is easy to control you understand those are the characteristics of nuclear power okay so we have six source of power in agriculture we have the human power we have the human power with power rating of 0.1 horsepower and we have the second animal power with power rating of 1.5 horsepower we have the mechanical power which is the most efficient though it is expensive with the power rating of 10 to 200 horsepower and we have the solar wind and nuclear power you understand so that will be all for this class in this class we talk about the definition of agricultural mechanization we talk about the aims and objectives of agricultural mechanization and we talk about the sources of power for various agricultural activities on the farm okay that will be all for this class see you in the next class to watch the next class kindly check the description of this video we are going to see a link there click on that link or you should check the playlist on this channel okay see you in the next class
