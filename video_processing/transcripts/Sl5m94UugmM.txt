 Golden wheat plains stretch across the horizon in Australia's eastern state wheat belt. Farmer Alexander Madden is one of many farmers ecstatic with this year's outstanding crop. His farm outside the town of Moree, about seven hours from Sydney, was hit by a devastating three-year drought. But now this region is leading an agricultural recovery, heralding Australia's third biggest wheat crop in 30 years, according to government forecasts. It's pleasing just to know that we're harvesting wheat crops again. Yeah, money in the bank pretty much, what you're looking at if you can get off in time. Yeah, it just makes everyone very happy, the family, not only our family, just all the farming families around the community. But for some farmers, it's a race against the clock, as they rush to strip the crop before the rain. Already, several crops have been affected by the wet, downgrading their quality. Australia is forecast to produce 29 million tonnes across the continent. No better timing, as like most economies, Australia has been pushed deep into deficit by the coronavirus pandemic. We can certainly start to enjoy life a bit better now. Yeah, whether it's just going around to a nice place and having a few beers around there, going to have a hit of golf in town in Moree. And that money generated by the harvest will flow straight back into rural Australia, bringing a new buzz to the town and new jobs for casual workers. Aestelsius AestCould AestJi Aest
