 When Jordan and I first started challenging ourselves to eat only food that we've grown and foraged, we quickly realized we were going to have to change our garden planning big time. Instead of focusing on the glamorous, expensive fresh produce like tomatoes and salad greens, we started dedicating more and more of our growing space to staple crops. And the most life-changing one of those for us has been grain corn. We grow several kinds of grain corn every year, both at our house and our community garden plots. Some of it we do in large blocks while others we do in the traditional three sisters mounds. Regardless of how we set up our corn plots, we always put in some dry beans and squash or pumpkin vines because all together they do such a great job of producing lots of food in a small space. and those trophies are also very, pretty short.

Haworth歌 Lps We make all kinds of meals from our corn, but probably the first thing we make every year is tortillas. To do this, we first nishtimalize the corn, which changes the texture and flavor and makes it more nutritious. The nishtimalized corn gives off a warm, indescribable aroma that fills the whole house and gets our mouths watering. After that, it's ready to grind into masa and form the tortillas. And it's so crazy how quickly the smell changes. It already smells like tortillas. You can see how the color of some of the corn is changing. Most of this was blue and red, and now it's all just kind of turning yellow, which is pretty strange. So far, you wouldn't move to the Corn and dinner unless you have a rendition.
