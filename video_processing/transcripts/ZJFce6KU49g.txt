Our Hay Cutting Weapons - Sickle Mower Haybine & Discbine

 Well I'm on the farm today and thought I'd do just a real quick video. We've got all our hay cutters mounted to tractors and I thought I'd show those to you. And I've got another related video that'll come out no time soon but it covers some of the same stuff I'm talking about now with a little different subject matter in regards to it. But we have three weapons that we use to cut hay with. One of them is a sickle bar, the other one is a sickle mower conditioner or as people call them a hay bind. And then we have a disc mower conditioner that a lot of people call a disc bind. So the first one here is the old Massey 32 sickle mower. It's a seven foot mower mounted to the Model 50 Massey. And this was our original hay cutter here, at least for me. And of course I've got a big wad of grass around the PTO. Normally I have a welcome mat or something like that underneath here. And I didn't and I got into some stems passing over some other grass. That's kind of annoying. But I was ready to quit when I noticed it was wrapped up like that. But in any event, this is a Pittman drive sickle mower. There's the Pittman arm. And this has been a great cutter on the farm. And I still use it to cut some of these small patches and a few other things. I wouldn't mind having a drum mower or a straight disc mower to replace this at some point. But we'll see. We moved away from this as a primary tool because we found that in stemmy hay, we were not getting a good dry down for horse quality hay. So we needed something to break or crush that stem. And so we moved on to a sickle mower conditioner. And by the way, how we knew we needed to make a change was we'd make some beautiful horse quality hay. And you'd take the bale and throw it down on the ground and a little puff of dust would come off of it. And it wasn't mechanical dust. That's different. It was just white, just a little bit of white mold. And it was enough to turn off the horse hay customer. And that's our highest dollar hay. So we had to make a change. So the second mower that we have, our weapon on the farm, is this Heston 1110. And I've got the doors open here. I'm going to be doing a video on just a review of this Heston and some of the features. But it's a really nice, even though it's old and kind of shows its age, it's actually a really nice hay cutter. It's got rubber on steel rollers. They crimp instead of crush. And it is a sickle type. It's seven feet. And what that did, it gave us the conditioning that we needed, crimping those stems such that our horse quality hay was completely dry. There was no mold, dust, or anything. And it's been a really good machine. But it is seven feet wide. Now, we still use it, but we moved away from it to a disc mower conditioner, which is our third weapon of choice when we're cutting hay. And we'll take a quick look and see at that. So the third weapon we have as far as cutting hay is our Krone 2801 CV. And I've got it on the Mansley Ferguson 1105. And it's been a great machine. Somewhere on this channel, I did a review on the Krone. If you look it up, you'll find it. This thing is a disc mower conditioner with impeller tines. It's just a really well-engineered machine. There are no belts. It's all gear drive. The hay gets pitched up against that conditioning hood, and then it rubs together as it passes through. The dry down on grass hay is just really impressive. And Krone's conditioning tines, see how they're hooked like that? They're very aggressive in moving the hay. So, you know, the reason we went to this thing was a couple reasons. With my day job, there's only so many hours in the day. And as you know, if you use a sickle mower, if you get a lot of dew or you're trying to mow right after rain. I mean, how many times have I been on this farm, and it rained all morning. And I get up here, and the grass is just soaked. But I got the rest of the day, and then I got a nice window of maybe a three-day window. And if I can just get the hay on the ground, then we'll have dry hay in time to bale before the next shower comes a few days later. And invariably, especially in heavy hay, the sickle mower conditioner would clog. And, you know, if you have those, you know that's just kind of part of the game. But what this thing does, it allows us to mow any time in the rain, in the dark, in the heaviest of dews. That's where I think we can mow in the snow. So this is nine feet. If I can go three and a half, four miles an hour on the sickle mower and the Heston mower conditioner, I can go seven in the heaviest of hay in this. And the only reason I don't go faster is because with our bumpy fields, it's kind of hard to stay in the seat on the big Massey. So between the additional width and the additional speed, we pretty much cut our time in half when we're mowing, you know, when we're mowing with this. So from a day job standpoint, I can get up here and I can cut. If the dew comes, I can continue to cut. If nightfall comes, I can continue to cut. If I come up here and it has rained, or even if it's raining, but it's going to break off and I want to go ahead and cut, nothing stops the chrome. And I believe, if I haven't said it already, I think I could mow in the snow with this thing. It's just a fantastic machine. And so, and it, knock on wood, it's reliable. When we start cutting hay, we have very high confidence we're going to be able to finish. And when we're selling horse quality hay, being able to get in, cut the hay, get the hay off the field and into the bale is essential. So this is an integral tool to that and does a nice job conditioning hay. We don't have any legumes, so the impellers are just fine for what we're doing. So that's just kind of a rundown of our hay cutters, our weapons that we use to cut hay, a sickle mower, sickle mower conditioner, and then our crone here. And we have different places. We use all three of them for different reasons. But, hope you enjoyed the video. It's going to be a beautiful day. And we'll talk to you later. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. Thank you.
