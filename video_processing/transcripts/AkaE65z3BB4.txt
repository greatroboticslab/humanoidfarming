 Three things I've done this summer to help my garden thrive and be productive in this crazy Texas heat. I've got 40% shade cloth over almost all of the garden, except for the peppers, okra, and corn, and even in my shallow beds I'm mulching 2-3 inches deep, along with my oyas that help my more sensitive plants in between watering, and then either using even the cheapest drip irrigation you can find on a regular schedule, or hand watering on a regular schedule. Your plants remember when they get watered, so it helps them thrive.
