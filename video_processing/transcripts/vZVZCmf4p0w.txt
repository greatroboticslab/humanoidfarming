 Exposure to pesticides has been linked to various health problems including hormone disruption, reproductive issues, and an increased risk of certain cancers. Studies have shown that even low levels of pesticide exposure can have significant health impacts over time. Doctors and scientists are increasingly concerned about the cumulative effects of these chemicals on our bodies. GMOs are plants or animals whose genetic makeup has been altered in a laboratory setting. This genetic modification is done to achieve specific traits that are not naturally found in the species. The process involves inserting genes from one organism into another, creating a new genetic combination. This is often done to introduce traits such as resistance to herbicides or insects. For example, some GMO crops are designed to withstand direct applications of herbicides, allowing farmers to control weeds without damaging the crops. Others are engineered to produce their own insecticides, reducing the need for chemical sprays.
