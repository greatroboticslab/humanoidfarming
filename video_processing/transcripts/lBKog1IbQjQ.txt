 In this whole area it's a general consensus that we're 70% off our normal production rates. I'm Alan Sen, I'm a hay producer in Upshur County, Texas. This field, this is the second cutting. We have some fields that we're fixing to do the third cutting. We get 90 to 100 rolls per cutting. I think the first cutting on this field we were a little over 50 rolls, which was still better than some. May and June were just awful. We got very little if any rain. And then in July to date we've gotten 4.2 inches, which is why this field looks the way it does. But we're working for it. But we're very fortunate to have the hay that we've got on this field. There's a lot of hay grows out there that's working hard to deliver a quality product. And it's getting harder to make the production and make the ends meet. This year, being so far behind, we've gotten on our computer and we've searched for fertilized hay that we could buy and bring in here. And there's just not much out there. And now we've got the rain, so we've got good grass growing at the moment. But the forecast is 100 to 105 degrees for the next two weeks. So if we don't get some rain in there, it's not going to last long. Hmm. Bismarck 5 면에서
