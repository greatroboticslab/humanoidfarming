 all right folks so welcome back to the channel if you guys are new around here my name is Brandon and this is our newest addition to Norman's equipment rental this is newest addition to our equipment rental fleet it's a Kubota BX 23s on the front we got a bucket with a quick attach I got a set of pallet forks with it and some other little additions I got with it also was they loaded the rear tires with beet juice and the pads on the outriggers are metal but on the bottom of the metal they got pieces of rubber so you can use it on concrete and put your outriggers down without scratching it all to pieces and something else we also got with it was an adjustable thumb on the back of itself pull the pin out move it adjust it to wherever you want it repin it and you're good to go and you can use it as you want I also got the three-point hitch stuff with it which I probably would not rent it out with a three-point hitch attachments on it it'll just be renting out with the tobacco and the bucket or a set of forks on the front and I also got the other set of pads that these normally come with the feet for the outriggers that are just metal and you can use them for dirt I assume which you can use these on dirt tube you'd most likely probably not want to use them on dirt because you wouldn't want to get rocks and stuff in there if you had to use them on concrete so that way it doesn't scratch up your concrete now enough about the little bx here and on to some other things I've had a lot of messages and comments emails asking about startup cost and how did I get my loans on my equipment did I get a business loan and things like that so starting out I set up my business account and I put a thousand dollars of my personal money my savings in my business account now part of that thousand dollars went to some things like my first payment on insurance was like right around five hundred dollars and some other things that I had some cost in up front was I had some fuel running around looking at equipment and running around picking up equipment like my new trailer and the mini excavator I traveled like an hour one way so two hours total to get my trailer but I also went down one day and looked at it so that was another two hours and then I went about an hour and a half away and picked up my excavator so it I had about a thousand dollars give or take a little bit and startup cost of my own money but other than that I've not put any more money into the equipment rental business out of my own pocket so it's all just been paying for itself rolling over as of right now hopefully it keeps continuing to do that but other than that I haven't put any more money out of my pocket into it and as far as like business loans and stuff like that go I was not able to get a business loan because most banks they usually want you to be in business two to three years from what all of them have been telling me but I was able to get a business credit card so that way it'll help build my credit up so I may be able to get a business loan a little bit sooner hopefully now this is just my experience here some of you folks out there that have a business it might be different like there might be some things that I just don't know about but I tried getting a business loan on some equipment on my trailer that I bought but I just couldn't make it happen because I didn't have no tax returns no proof of income or anything like that through my business because I was just getting started so on my equipment my excavator my trailer and this Kubota BX 23s here I just end up getting personal loans on everything just through my name because that was the only way I could really make this happen luckily I do have I did have good credit my credit's pretty decent and that was one thing that really benefited me starting up this equipment rental business now I know a lot of people I mean you might sit on the other side of this screen here watching this video kind of like I did I used to like people starting businesses up you guys might see all this equipment that I've been buying the excavator this backhoe and the trailer and things like that think man this guy's loaded or he's got some rich parents or some uh in-laws or he hit the lottery or something like that now that's not the case I can tell you 100% I don't have a whole lot of money I didn't hit the lottery or anything like that I've just got good credit so I've just been financing everything and right now things are going good and if I didn't rent any of this stuff out at all I'd probably go broke so I'm taking a big risk here I'm basically uh gambling with my money but it's a little bit better than buying scratch off tickets or anything like that yeah I know a lot of folks are nervous uh starting up businesses because you just never do know people's situation like if they did like inherit some money or anything like that but I haven't inherited money I put a thousand dollars in this whole business but just keep in mind I did have all my ducks in a row all my chickens it was all kind of in a row when I got this business started I went and set my LLC up I called about insurance and everything and I had everything all lined up ready to go so that way when I bought a piece of equipment I could start renting it out immediately so like when I bought that trailer and that excavator I started posting stuff on Facebook and things like that just getting the word out there advertising on Craigslist that way I could just try to get this stuff rented out and start making its money back so that way I didn't have to pay no payments out of my pocket so it's all worked out so far I haven't had to pay no payments out of my pocket I have paid one trailer payment out of my own pocket by accident that was kind of a misunderstanding through my bank but I got that all taken care of so now it's just coming straight out of my business account which that was only like another two hundred dollars so I'm gonna say if you guys are interested in getting a a business started up just go for it just try to get you some uh get your LLC set up get your insurance and all that stuff in line before you go buy a piece of equipment and if you got some halfway decent credit I'd say you guys could probably go finance some equipment so when I was uh looking at buying some equipment I was kind of comparing the new versus used prices I was for instance let's take my kaboda u17 I'm in that thing for about 35 000 and uh I was looking up some users I found one that was a couple years old it looked like it was in pretty good shape I mean it was it was really really good shape for them however many hours was on it I think it was like right around 1700 hours and these people was asking 21 000 for it so I got to doing some math in my head breaking it up and saying if I rented my kaboda u17 out for 1700 hours it will have uh paid itself completely off by then and these people were asking 21 000 for that kaboda u17 another thing that kind of steered me away from used equipment was I'm usually I travel a lot for my job my work and I'm usually I'm usually late getting home leaving house early mornings things like that so I didn't want to come home and have to be working on equipment in the evenings stuff breaking down and things like that so that's another reason why I just went ahead and went with some new equipment and another thing was like I didn't have money to I didn't have cash money to just go out and buy a bunch of equipment so I was going to be financing stuff and usually your interest rates on used equipment is a lot higher like six seven eight nine ten up to fifteen percent even probably but on this here I got zero percent interest for 84 months zero money down on this little bx here and on my u17 I got like 2.99 percent interest rate or something on that so not too bad that's something to keep in mind and think about before you guys just start going out and buying some things if you guys got cash money and plenty of time I'd say used equipment might be a good option just to kind of figure out if you guys are going to stick with this equipment rental business or anything like that but anyway folks if you guys made it this far in the video I'd like to thank you guys for watching and give me that big thumbs up if you guys like this video if
