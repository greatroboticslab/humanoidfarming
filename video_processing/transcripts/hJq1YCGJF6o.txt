 Hello, my name is Jason Walthers with Ag Equipment Finance. Today I'd like to visit with you about Ag Equipment Leasing. 5-4-24. Ag Equipment Finance offers a five-minute application, backed up with a four-hour credit decision, and payment to dealer in 24 hours or less. It does not get any simpler than this. When structured properly, an agriculture equipment lease can be classified as an operating expense, where you can actually write off your annual payment and that is your expense. Consult your tax advisor for details. Ag Equipment Finance originates five to seven-year leases along with a three-year pro lease. On our three-year pro leases, the residual is higher, which would create an additional cash flow and increase your margins within your operation. This is done with a higher residual. We're able to lease all rolling stock equipment, depending on the model and the year. So, when it comes time to saving some money and creating some alternative tax savings options, please look to Ag Equipment Finance to assist you within your operation. At Ag Equipment Finance, we know nothing happens until your iron hits the ground.
