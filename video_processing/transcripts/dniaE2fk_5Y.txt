Howto & Style
 Did you know if you grab a mango, cut all the fruit off until you're left with the husk, then use a sharp knife to create a little slit in the middle. Grab a butter knife and carefully pry it open. Inside of it you'll find a baby maple seed. Soak the seed in a bowl of water for one hour. Then grab a pot with soil, grab the seed and plant it to the side where it curves. Water it. Cover it with a bottle or a bag for humidity. Pretty soon it'll start to sprout. When it grows to at least six inches long, plant it in a bigger pot and grow a mango tree. And yes, it might take some time to grow, but in the end when you taste your own homegrown food, it's all worth it.
