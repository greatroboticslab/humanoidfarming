 We are pleased to welcome back Drumrammer Farm, a dairy and sheep farm outside Ahokal in County Antrim. Home to 500 cows, the herd is mainly Holstein along with some Jersey and Ayrshire cattle. The farm is special in that it uses 8 robots to milk its cows, something that the owners recognise is a bit different and the children attending past open farm weekends agree is something worth seeing. Three full-time staff work alongside the Turtle family who have owned the farm for the past 91 years and hopefully for many more years to come. They participate in Bank of Ireland Open Farm Weekend as farming is a way of life to them and they feel lucky to have grown up on a farm and want to share their knowledge and experience with the general public. They understand the importance of the local supply chain, are passionate about the quality of Northern Ireland farm produce and want to encourage everyone to buy local where possible. They enjoy talking with non-rural families and sharing the work they do, their farming story and farming activities they take for granted. Pretty soon, dressagesenzials and guides are added.
