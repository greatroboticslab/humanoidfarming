Howto & Style
 Let's grow some wheatgrass and barley grass. First soak your seeds for 24 hours. Once you finish spreading out your medium, I'm using Pro-Mix, then we're going to saturate it well with water. Alright, now we're gonna spread out our seed. I'm using 7 ounces per 10 by 20 tray of both wheat and barley grass. Once your seeds are spread out, we're gonna go ahead and give them another good saturation. Now we're gonna stack them, put on a cover tray, and now they're gonna go into germination for the next few days.
