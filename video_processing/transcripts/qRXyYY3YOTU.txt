 Welcome to my Agriturismo experience. Welcome to my Agriturismo experience. Welcome to my Agriturismo experience. Welcome to my Agriturismo experience. Welcome to my Agriturismo experience. Hi guys, welcome to the LensCup Chronicles. My name's Amanda and in this video, I aim to inspire you to bucket list a rustic and raw experience in Italy called Agriturismo. Agriturismo is a concept that's worldwide but it heralded here in Italy roughly 20 to 30 years ago. The word is obviously an Italian mix of agriculture and tourism and the two combined allow guests and visitors to stay on site in farms around the country and experience life on the land amongst the hills and the countryside. It's really a way of involving yourself in local authentic Italian life. My journey to discovery of Agriturismo actually came about quite incidentally. I've recently just been watching a couple of videos based in the Italian countryside, particularly winery regions and of course a couple of others based in France. I just wanted to go and spend some time in Italy away from all the crazy crowds and big cities and just experience life with a local or as a local. I found this website called Agriturismo.it and I'll put the link here somewhere which completely opened my mind to this concept of Agriturism. And it allows you to select whichever area in Italy you'd like to go and then it will give you a whole heap of ideas and examples of places you can stay Agriturismo or farm stays in that area. What I was hoping for was an experience where I'd be taken in and shown some incredible experiences that were quite unique and individual. I am staying in the northeastern area in Butrio, Friuli in Italy, and it's quite close to the Slovenian border. So you can either drive in from Slovenia or you could fly into Venice and drive up. One of the major drawcards to Agriturismo is the vast number of personalised and individual experiences you can actually have when staying here. So different places will offer you different things, horse riding or walking through a vineyard, hiking, cooking classes or the local cuisine. And just being taken in to enjoy family life either with the family or with their pets, hanging out with the chickens in the backyard coop. The unique feature of Agriturismo is that it can only be practised by farmers or on farms. And it's actually helped to save quite a few old historic farmyards and farmlands that were struggling to make ends meet during difficult seasons. It's allowed the influx of tourism funds to help save some of these exquisite and incredible properties, which I find so uplifting as a tourist to be able to help and give back in some form. It's actually becoming a really popular method of travel and accommodation for people. There seems to be a bit of a move away from urbanisation and the huge cities and people are looking for a simple escape from the busyness of life. And that is what Agriturismo can offer. The Agriturismo experience is hugely personalised. You'll feel like you are meeting the owners, the real people behind the place. You can literally go onto the website and read excerpts from the owners. They explain how and why they opened their place and then you can click on a link to their specific Agriturismo. It's so personal and you'll meet the face behind the place. You'll feel a sense of human connection. So I used the website to pin down the place that I'd like to stay and I came across Agriturismo Scatia Pensieri, which is where I've decided to stay. It's quite a simple but beautiful two-storey brick stone home with a restaurant on the base overlooking St. Pinot Grigio fields just outside the window. Just a tip, if you do book yourself in an Agriturismo, it's really helpful to reach out ahead of time to the owners because a lot of the experiences need to be pre-booked. They're privatised, individualised, unique for you. So you need to arrange a time together that suits you both so that it fits in with your itinerary and theirs and you'll have a great time. These family-run accommodations obviously need to close once in a while for them to have a rest. So occasionally if they have a restaurant on site, it may be closed one or two days of a week. So just make sure ahead of time that you check this out. One thing I am so looking forward to is just getting up in the morning early and going for a walk as the sun rises, through the laneways, overlooking the hills and the vineyards, transported away into another time and place. As well as a few of the other experiences I've teed up including a couple of wine tastings, a castle visit and a very special picnic. If you are interested in staying in the northeastern part of Italy, in Fiole, in this wine region, then I'm going to make another video that I'll put a link to here. So you can check out all the things you might like to do in that region if you stay here. It's simply beautiful so let's go on a tour so I can show you everything Scazzia Fensieri has to offer. We'll see you next time. Bye. Bye. My Little Jones Boots I've just arrived and dropped my luggage off, but only a few minutes drive up the road. A lovely picnic awaits. Oh my gosh, this looks amazing. I think it's a private picnic just for me. Thank you. Maybe you can help me. Yeah, I think here's nice. This is so beautiful. It's lovely. Thank you so much. Now that I'm inside Villager Goni, I have no words. It is so beautiful in here and it's so calm and tranquil and I'm the only one here. There is no one else here. They've brought me out this incredible basket, this picnic basket, and they've told me that the gate has an automatic open and closing. So whenever I want to leave, I can and no one is going to interrupt me. This is one of the larger estates in the region and you can hire it for weddings. It's occasionally open as a restaurant. I am feeling like a princess. They've laid out a waterproof covering on the grass because it was raining earlier, but it's absolutely stunning now. We've got the blue sky and it's warm. I don't have a jacket on anymore. Let's check it out. Let's see what's inside. Oh, first off the ranks. I wonder what this could be. Mmm. I like meatballs. Oh, they're delicious. So fresh. The grounds here at Villa Goni are simply divine. They're sprawled out across a huge grass area with seating dotted throughout and these beautiful trees. There's a couple of sculptures and there's a central path leading all the way to the villa itself. Oh my gosh. I love they're in such cute jars. Look at this. It's like a couscous and vegetable mix. And a potato salad. And I'll grab some some... cutlery. Very handy. And some breadsticks. Some breadsticks. We are in the region of Friuli and Friuli is well known for their wines. And Villa Goni actually lies within the Marina Daniella Estate, which is a winery and here's a bottle of their wine in the picnic basket. Let's try it out! Let's try it out. Cheers Villa Drigoni and thank you for this magical experience. Delicioso. The floorboards in the main event space are made of old Venetian gondolas and the frescoes on the walls in here make you feel like you've stepped into a time past. Open the area Thank you so much Villa Drogoni and the Marina Daniella Winery for this incredible experience. I feel like an absolute princess and I've had such a great time here. The building is amazing and the gardens are so tranquil. You are absolutely going to love it. If you come here, I'd highly recommend you can stay here so do look that up. But for me now, back to Agriturismo Scaccia Pensieri. Music Well, I didn't want to out say my welcome at Villa Drogoni and I've finally made my way back. It's heading soon into sunset. It's around 4.30pm. So in another hour, these skies should look absolutely beautiful. I'm just going to be chilling out, relaxing, reading my book for the next hour or so until dinner. Italy, you have my heart. Music Music Music Thank you. Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Well what a day I need a word that describes being so full of happiness and joy and food. Music So full of food and joy. If anyone's got a word for this in their native tongue or country, please let me know because that is me. I am so content with my day in Italy today, delicious food, delicious wine, beautiful beautiful surroundings, culture that spans centuries. And now I'm in a super warm room. My eyes are on the way out, ready for some sleep. I have truly enjoyed being off the grid in somewhere that's a little bit less well known. Good night, guys. I'll see you in the morning. Good night. Good morning from Scatia Pensieri. What a delightful sleep last night. The room was super cozy and warm. The temperature did actually drop quite low last night, so it was super lovely all rugged up under the covers. I've woken up to a beautiful day today. The sun is shining. There was a gorgeous sunrise, pinks, purples across the vineyards and just listening to the birds chirping. The lovely caretaker yesterday asked me what time I'd like my brookie, 8am. So let's head down there and see what she's prepared for me. Good morning. How are you? Hey, good day. Thank you. Lovely. This looks lovely. This looks lovely. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Now one thing you must try when in this region of the world, you see local pork cold cuts and cheese. They go so well together and they're served at almost every breakfast and they're an option at almost every meal, whether it's a starter at dinner or lunch. So let's tuck in and this looks so good. Wow, the ham is so good. She has laid out the most beautiful spread and the best thing is all locally sourced from Northern Italy. So I'm trying all of the local delicacies. I've even got a cute little boiled egg in a cup, local pastries, croissants, handmade jams. It is divine. Natala! Very sour. I'm scared I have chocolate on my lips. Okay, so plan for today. Well, I really wanted to just go for a walk in the countryside by the vineyard. So that is definitely on the cards. I'll be heading to a wine tasting at the Marina Daniella estate. I'm also going to head into the main town around 20 minutes from here called Udin. And this is an old Venetian city inland from Venice with an incredible piazza and some great structures around. I'll show you more of that. And then I'm hoping to head to Butrio Castle which looks absolutely incredible up on the hill surveying the lands and then just coming back and relaxing. Let's see how the day pans out. There we are. Come back throughout, present here's the wedding kit you wanna come. Lots of it is fun off. Yeah, we just go with the palm of the green circle. It's a nice design. Yeah, it's actually fun. I think this is a cut. So much. Yeah. Salute. From the moment I was brooded at the gate by the lovely Margot to the wine and to the production tour and then the final wine tasting in the historic room with three varietals and the promise of more if I wanted them. I have had the best time and I'm so thankful for this experience. I even got to meet Marina Daniele herself. If you do want to come to visit Marina Daniele, I'd highly recommend it. And lastly, the reason why I chose the bottle of Friulano from Marina Daniele is because Marco, you mentioned it reminded you of home and that was in South Italy. So given that it was such a personal tour and I love my own home, I really wanted to celebrate with something very personal. So thank you for that. I'm going to think of South Italy when I drink this wine. Thank you so much to the guys at Marina Daniele for an incredible time. I'll see you next time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for the fresh eggs. Thanks so much for watching this video.
