 So this is the planter, okay? This planter is for that small truck. It is the planter just like that other planter that I was explaining about, out there. You do planting and fetters application at the same time. Oh! With this. Okay? Yes. Like this. It has got compartments where you can put your fetters and seeds. Yes. Yes. Okay. Let's go into what we have inside. Okay. Welcome inside. So here, as you can see, or as I said earlier, we do this different implement. So from land preparation, when we come to planting, crop protection, then after that, we go to harvesting, then processing and post-harvest. Oh, yeah. Okay? So we have every machine. Okay. So at the beginning, I talked about, you know, Smoskeo farmers. Yes. This tractor is ideal for Smoskeo farmers. It is also a tractor just like those other tractors. Okay? And it has got implements that it goes with. It has got the plow, lot of data, planta, lipa, avesta, everything. This. So we have got two types here. Okay? I'll show you the, you know, the plow and the lot of data that are used on this tractor. And initially, it's just used to come on it from without that whole thing. But we had to modify it, making it comfortable. So even for ladies to operate this kind of a machine. The mode of operation is different. Yes, but it's very affordable. Really affordable? Exactly. Oh, I see. Oh, there's even a seat there. Exactly. So that when someone is, so that when, you know, the way, the way we used to operate it before, it was meant to be working, you're just pushing it like this. Uh-huh. Going forward, you couple your, your plow, planter, whatever you want to couple it there. But now, after making this, the operator is able to see it. Oh. Controlling this tractor. It's very comfortable. You can even operate with one hand as you are moving. Yes. Oh, that's good. So you can use it when planting. You just put your equipment behind there, just like the way it is on the picture there. You see that green thing? That's a plow. So it will be moving like that. Yes, exactly. That's how it works. So you can put your plow, planter, leepers, everything behind. Even these small tractors, what the leepers are designed to work with, this. Whatever you can do with the big tractor, even with this one, you can do. Yeah. Just show you some of the implements that cause this smaller tractor. So this is the planter. Okay. Okay. This planter is for that small tract. It is the planter just like that other planter that I was explaining about out there. You do planting and fertilize application at the same time. With this. Okay. I see that. Yes. Like this. It has got compartments where you can put your fertilize and seeds. Oh. Yes. Okay. You see that? Mm-hmm. Oh, it has all these mechanisms. Exactly. All the settings that I was explaining outside there, you can do it here. Also, the line spacing you can adjust. Oh. It has got those provisions. You can set the distance between lines and everything, please. Okay. Just a plant like any other plant. So the small scale guys are not left out? No, no, no. Everyone is... Okay. Okay. Good. This is our avest. You can use it on that same small tractor to avest your maize. Okay. That you can just go home with screen maize. This is the Swap Beans Reaper. You use it for avesting Swap Beans. This one. As you can see, yes. It will avest your Swap Beans and put it in one single proper line where you can just get it and go wherever you want to take it. Yeah. It's a very interesting thing. Then here, we have the leaper. That thing that we are seeing is a leaper for that small tractor. It's a conservation leap as well. Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. Then when it comes to proper processing for small scale farmers, we have those. Those are mini maize shellards. Those red ones. Then the blue ones. These are mini hammer mules. Okay. Oh, this is a mini. This is a mini seller. It's very, very effective. Then this is a mini hammer mule. As you can see, you can put it wherever you want it to be. We have engine driven. We also have the motor driven. This motor driven is a single phase, very easy. Even in your house, you can use it. Oh, okay. So basically, you put your grains here? Yes. Yes. You can even put them there or there or the same. Okay. Yes. Oh, okay. And then they come out from that point? Yes. Yes. Yes. From there. Okay. Mm-hmm. Then I have got another. Just to be clear on this. So you can basically use power on this or engine? Engine. Engine. Yes. Petro engine or normal power. Okay. And it's single phase. So everywhere it can work. Okay. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is a peanut butter making machine. Ah, the famous one. Yes. So we have got different sizes. So when it comes to processing, you want to have proper peanut butter, this one. This one is done by a three phase motor, but we have those that work on a single phase motor. This is just basically an example of a peanut butter making machine. Just put your peanuts there and everything will be done. Your finished product will be coming from this end here. Yes. It's a very powerful implement. Okay. Yeah. Wonderful. Exactly. Then I have another exciting machine that I want to show you. This one. This is a milk, milking machine. Okay. For those with animals. You don't need to milk your animals. You're using your hands. You just have to use this machine. Straight. It's very nice. This one. Exactly. So it comes with a lot of accessories. You have got the teeth like I am here. Like this. You just put this your animal. Then we just do this one. I'll show you how it is. Yes. This is what goes on there. The teeth. On the teeth. Yes. Exactly. I see. Then since the animals got four, so each teeth has got each one line. Then the milk will be flowing through these pipes up to the can. Exactly. Yeah. It's very interesting. Very clever. Mm-hmm. Okay. And the front of the motor. Yes. So we have got those that are engine driven also. We have got some that work on a motor and engine. You can just put whatever you want. But this one is specifically motor driven. Oh. Okay. Then here there's something interesting. Okay. Again when it comes to power backup. We have got plenty of engines. You know with this issue of load trading everything is made easy. We have got different size of engines. Apart from engines we also have got the solar um solar and inverter. system that we use. So they have different sizes here. So we have got those that are petrol driven. Uh also we have got say you know diesel propelled. Okay. Yes we have got motorbikes. Here we have got hammer mills. Okay. So hammer mills have got those single piston, double piston and also electrical. When it comes to electrical we have got that current by 15 horsepower motor and 20 horsepower motor. Now here I've got more interesting machines. You know people are doing a lot of fun flour. This is what we call the um oil mill. Okay. So yes exactly. This one and all these these are oil mills. Or if you want to do your cooking oil you just use this my these machines. We have got those that um like these are electrical but also of those that are engine are driven in different sizes. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So yeah these are oil uh mills. These are the halas. If you want you know how people make the famous breakfast meal. Yes. So they first make meal sample. So you make your meal sample using this machine. Oh okay. Then from this machine then you you take into your hammer mill. Then you do breakfast meal. So you can just use this machine just to make the meal sample for home consumption or for setting or for whatever you want to do use this. Okay. So we also have different sizes of these kind of things. Now before I introduce the next thing I want to talk you know about. Remember I talked about the oil I mean why where you do your your cooking oil. So you can make your cooking oil you're using soybeans, groundnuts and the famous sunflower. Now if it's sunflower there's what we call sunflower kekai. They buy product of whatever you are making. Apart from that when you are making a meal sample there's the maize plant those that come out or in our local language we call them gaga okay. So now people use a soya a a a a a a a flour kek and the the gaga the maize plant to make feed for animals or for your beds. Now for you to mix those things properly you know during this feed that we buy in these other shops it is made of different ingredients right? Yes. Those things are mixed properly maybe it has got four or five ingredients. So now if you want to make feed because again it is not advisable for your chicken just to be having let's say sunflower cake on it or the feed which is rich in sunflower cake on it to affect the growth of your beds or even your animals. Your animals or your beds will have a lot of fats so it has to be mixed properly okay. So now mixing the sunflower cake and the maize plant that's why we use now this big machine called the feed mixer. The broofing. Okay. This machine will help you to mix whatever feed that you want to make properly. So if you go to these guys that are specialized in making this feed they will tell you to say this feed is the combination of five items like there is soya beans we take a sunflower cake you have got maize plant you have got moringa stones and salt. Now they don't say this thing has got maybe 20 grams of salt 10 kg of soya sunflower cake then 20 kg of maize plant. So for you to mix those things properly you use this machine the feed mixer because if you just mix with hands your feed will be reaching a sunflower cake of which your animals or your beds will be eating a lot of fats which can give them problems. So that's why you use this. So that's why you use this. The feed mix. The brew machine. It's very very effective very powerful. We have got those that are motor driven and those that are engine driven and we have got you know different production power. We have got those that can do 0.5 tons. We have got those that can do one ton per hour up to two tons per hour different you know sizes. Now there's another ingesting machine that I want to introduce after this or that works hand in hand with this. After you mix your feed you can also make pellets okay. For your beds or for your animals. So we have got different pellet making machines here. So this. Okay so these two here are the feed pellet making machines. This will help you to mod your feed into different sizes that you want. We have got adjustments where you can just change the mod there or the dye. Then you can make your feed fits for the beds. You can make the grower the starter grower finisher and whatever you you can call it you can make using this. If it's for the beds you if it's for animals you just change the dye there then you make bigger particles for your animals. So even these are what those are electrical driven and engine driven. And this one in particular is motor so this is electric. So all these are electrical the only difference is the their capacity the production per hour. So these are very good machines. So these are very good machines. And it will you know this also you know they prevent you the help you from wasting a lot of feed whenever you are using animals or beds. Because the feed is already you know modelled into those smaller that was where by your it will be easy for animals to to pick even for the beds to pick. So this is what we have here. Exactly. We have plenty of things. So this is what we have here. We have plenty of machines. Some of them are not finished. We have plenty of machines. Yes. So but for more people can contact us for any technical help, any technical advice. We are always available for them.
