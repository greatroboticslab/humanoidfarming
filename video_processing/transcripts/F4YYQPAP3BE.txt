 Welcome to another installment of African Farming Digital Series. Now you heard a lot of people say you're either business minded or you're not. However business skills is something that can be taught. Here at Le Monde Agricultural Services they can teach you to become business minded. We're going to be talking to Sylvester Lubambo who's going to tell us about the Agri Business Management Skills course they have. Let's go and hear what he has to say. So, Bablu Bambo, I see we are under a new structure here at Le Monde. I mean last time I was here this didn't exist. Tell us more about this. Yeah this is an investment in the learning of our students. Basically we want to teach them how to plant and control environment and generally to plant in all seasons. Not only in summer but also in winter because it's a bit of a controlled environment. So that's the idea. And also by doing this, by planting in a controlled environment that means that you actually do not lose momentum or and then you can always sell at whenever. Is that correct? Yeah and increasing your turnover by increasing your profits. Now speaking of profits, let's talk about the course that you guys offer Agribusiness Management. Tell me more about this. What does it entail and what's in the course? It's the business of agriculture because look, although one needs to go into a farm and technically be involved but the bottom line is it is a business. So it needs to be treated like a business. So what does it entail? It will cover your marketing, input control as well as your stock control and the general management of your finances as well as how to prepare or read your financial statements. So Bablu Momba, one thing I've noticed, I'm talking to myself also is that we tend to become complacent. You know you have your salary. You are relaxed and then you're like, ah, why do I need to go and learn for what? I'm sorted. But why is it always important to further your studies, especially in the agricultural sector? Yeah, especially, you're right, when you say, especially in the agricultural sector, because there's a lot of variables. Technology changes, you need to keep up to date with what is the latest technology in the market because it has a direct effect on your profits, money that you get. And that's the first thing. And the second thing is, again, climate change. Agriculture has been impacted the most. How do we navigate these troubled times of climate change? So where can you get these skills if you do not identify a learning institution and go there and learn from the facilitators, but most importantly from your other learners that are there sharing knowledge? So it's quite important. So one will never reach a stage where one is saying, I'm enough now with acquiring knowledge. Babs Sylvester, thank you so much for this. And this is quite insightful actually. No, thank you. You're welcome. So when are we planting? In here? When are we planting in here? How? When are we planting in here? No, anytime from, you see, we're already preparing. We're already putting these plastics as our cover. And at any time, we will be putting plants in here. M'zansi, knowledge has no expiry date. So keep on learning to empower yourselves. For more on this course, please visit www.abri.co.za and you go to Le Mans Agricultural Services. Remember, we farm better together.
