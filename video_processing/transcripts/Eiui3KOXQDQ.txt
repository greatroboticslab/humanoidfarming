 Sustainability is all about keeping the land good for the future generations. There is not words to describe how proud I am to come from a family that farms. We are the people feeding the world and without that the world wouldn't go around. They're taking care of the soil and these plants that come from a little tiny seed and they're doing it in a way that the soil in 50 years here will hopefully still be able to feed as many people as it is now. The population keeps growing so that means we have to produce more food to feed more people and if we can't do that then your farm isn't sustainable.
