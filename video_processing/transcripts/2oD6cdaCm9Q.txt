 My my. Quite the weather we're having here this morning. It's only gonna get worse I think. Hey Toby dog. How's it going buddy boy? Hey buddy. How's it going? How's it going? So today is gonna be one of those working indoors days for the most part for me. So I'm really excited about this one guys. So in today's video I want to take you through a special spreadsheet I've built that tells me down to the penny exactly how much money we made farming this year and I'm going to show you guys all the numbers and go through all the nitty-gritty costs and revenue and all that good stuff. But before all of that let's release a quacken! Yeah unfortunately ducks don't have four-wheel drive. How's it going this morning guys? You look like a big old polar bear buddy boy. Release the geese! Very graceful Justin. So this is a part of the farm that you guys don't usually get to see and experience but right now we are standing in my office. I probably spend most of my waking hours indoors inside this part of the farmhouse. I'm really lucky to have this office. Let me give you a quick tour. This is my gigantic collection of books. I love my books. This is where I keep all my camera equipment. I've been trying to keep myself semi-organized. This is my writing desk where I do a lot of my writing and thinking and quiet reflection. This is my comfy chair. It's where I like to read comic books and nap. And then this is my computer setup where I end up doing all of my editing and computer work. And as I'm working from home I'm working from right here. And since you guys wanted to find out just how much money I made farming this year I guess it's time to bring on the spreadsheets, huh? Formulas are my formula formula. So on our farm we have like four or five different businesses depending on how you want to count them. Specifically we have raising ducks for eggs. We have raising geese for meat. We have raising ducklings and goslings for sale like where we sell the live baby bird as well as some of the adults. We sell hatching eggs for ducks and geese and maybe even chickens in the future. And then we also do a little bit of nursery sales for perennial tree crops so like chestnuts and black locusts and oaks. And so I see all of those activities as different agricultural businesses. We also have all of the the YouTube and social media and podcast and content type stuff which we do actually earn money on as well. But I'm going to hold that stuff separate. That's like almost a whole separate video to explain some of the complexity as well as where we get some of the revenue on those things. But today what I'm going to do is break down for you what we are earning on each of those businesses and how we're making that money and what that picture looks like. Because I get a lot of questions from viewers around like well how do you make it all work and how much can you possibly earn? And so what I'm going to try to do is give you the snapshot of what we've earned in 2020. I'm also going to try to talk a little bit about some of our plans for 2021 and how we expect to expand and grow the farm. Because after the year that we've had this year in 2020 I feel like we're ready to make a leap. But before we do that let's take a close look at 2020. Now what I'm going to do is dive into each line of business and give you a quick snapshot of what that business looked like for the year. So we'll start with the first business on our farm which was our eating eggs and selling eggs for people to eat. As we sell these eggs we really only do it locally here in the greater Peachum, St. Johnsbury area. We were selling eggs through the Peachum Farmers Market this summer. They had a really nice program that let us actually just drop off the product and we didn't have to go work the farmers market. So from a labor perspective it was so modest it made sense to do. We also sell eggs to neighbors and friends in the local area. It's a really really minuscule part of our farm business. So as you can see in this spreadsheet here right we sell a dozen eating eggs for six dollars a pop. What we've settled on is selling a half dozen eating eggs for four dollars a pop. Over the course of the year we have sold about 16 dozen packages as well as 33 half dozen packages. From a revenue standpoint that means that made about 96 dollars for the dozen or 132 for the half so about 228 dollars total cash came in just from selling those eating eggs. I get all of my eggs cartons for free so packaging expenses aren't there but there are certain expenses. I wanted to try to assign a certain portion of the duck feed to the egg enterprise. There was also a charge that I had to pay to the Peachum Farmers Market. This is again rough numbers. One of the things that you're going to see is the theme as I go through all of this information is some of my information is a little sketchy because it's it's you know using things that are leveraged across a number of enterprises. So for example animal feed is used for my goose operation, my duck operation, my duck egg operation, my ducklings, my goslings. Like it's all so commingled. The same goes for infrastructure things like animal bedding and the housing and security stuff and so it gets a little bit sketchy and if I was even doing this more accurately I'd be charging certain things like assigning Toby's feed bill to enterprises like this and they'd each have their own like cost chunk. But at this stage of the game I'm talking such small dollars and the energy required to figure that one out isn't quite there yet. That's not to say though as I think about scaling up my farm enterprise I'm not thinking about how I manage these costs because a big part of having a successful farm business is trying to balance these things. So when you subtract that $31 of expense from the revenue you're left with $196 in net income. So that's the profit. That's what the egg operation generated. Now you guys are probably watching this and saying wow there's no way that selling eating eggs at least at the scale that this guy is doing is ever going to amount to anything and that's 100% true. And at this point I realize that it's probably not going to be a major part of our farm business but since I love the ducks and I love working with the ducks the ducks will always be a part of the farm business. And especially because when I start to look at certain things like the hatching that's a really profitable business. So the hatching eggs business was really sort of an offshoot. You know I realized that there were a lot of folks out there who were interested in duck eggs and even geese eggs for hatching purposes and so I decided to start offering that through our website. Gosh when did I start doing that? I guess it was last winter and it's been doing really well for us. This year so far we've sold 38 packs of hatching eggs for ducks. I sell the duck hatching eggs in packs of 12. We also sold four packs of goose hatching eggs and I sold those in packs of four. In terms of revenue for the hatching eggs it made me about $1800 in revenue. That came though with a fair amount of expense between the shipping costs and then certain things I need to do to maintain some approvals and certifications that really work to about $630 of total expense. And then as I look at the net income side of things that's $1200 that this business made for me which I'm very happy with. I'm really hoping to grow it in 2021. It's relatively easy work to do and really it's only limited by what sort of audience I can reach. And so if you guys are out there and seeing this video and want your own hatching eggs, you know reach out to Gold Shaw Farm. We have them available on our website. Now the biggest business enterprise that we had on the farm for 2020 was by far raising the geese for meat. We brought on about 40 goslings in the spring. We lost two of those goslings during brooding. One was actually killed in shipping. Another one died after two or three days. Other than that they've been really resilient and really healthy birds. I set 10 of those birds aside and I'm actually using them for breeding stock for future birds. But at the same time I harvested about 28 of those birds and that's what I was able to sell. What you're seeing here in this spreadsheet is this is actually tracking the weight per bird on harvest. This is the weight of the bird after we butchered it, took out its organs, plucked it, everything, and this is what it was sold for. So that's the sales cost weight. Now in terms of cost for the the meat geese, there were a number of expenses that we had to incur for this part of the business. I only spent about $600 in feeding the meat geese this year and that includes the 10 that I set aside for breeding stock and I just basically took the dollars that it cost me to feed them and I distributed that cost around the 28 that I sold so I could get a better sense of the bottom line picture of things. There was an infrastructure charge that I sent to this. There was about $100 I used to buy some of the supplies for the giant goose tractor that my buddy Bruce the goose is now living in. The biggest expense that I'd love to get rid of was it cost me about $15 per gosling. So when I bought the birds from the hatchery there was a $15 charge I had to incur to bring them onto the farm. As we get more and more into breeding and hatching our own birds, I'm really hoping that the future of my meat goose program is going to be based on birds that I've hatched myself. So I can take this $15 charge and set it aside. And while I have found meat geese to be rather profitable, that will make them even more profitable. In terms of the sale costs, you know, there were just costs that I had in terms of, you know, doing the butchering and packaging and kind of all of that. And so I assigned, you know, about a $375 charge for each bird there. And then the sale price obviously varies based on weight. I was selling these birds for $9 a pound, which I think is a really decent price. I think it's high when you compare it to say chicken or turkeys. But if you're actually looking out there more broadly, when it comes to pasture raised goose that lives this great life might have actually been undercharging just a little bit. I've been doing more research to see what other people charge. I'm realizing I'm somewhat on the cheaper end of the spectrum. And so I might want to boost up my prices for future years. So if you take all the revenue I generated from the sale of the geese and then subtract it from the expenses that came from the raising of the geese, you're left with a final profit of about $1,300, which feels pretty good. I know a lot of people are going to be like, that's it. People are going to be shocked to see that that number is like my bottom line. I'm not feeling that bad about it. And again, part of what I'm trying to do here is I'm working on an extremely small scale on my farm because I'm trying to find a way to be profitable and raise animals in a way that's both sustainable, humane, and ultimately profitable. And getting all those pieces to work together is hard. And what I'd rather do is fail on a smaller scale than fail at a large scale. So let's answer that question I teed up at the beginning of the video. How much money did I make here on the farm in 2020? If you take the $196 from the egg sales and the $1,333 from the meat sales, and you add in the $1,240 that came in from selling the hatching eggs. On top of that, I've also been selling live goslings and even a few adult birds here and there. When I hatched out all of those goslings back in April, we made a fair amount of money selling baby goslings to folks in the area. And so because I can actually charge a decent price for those live birds and there's such little work involved, I think selling live birds is going to be something I continue to do too. I don't have any interest in selling live birds by mail. And I know I get a lot of emails from folks saying, Hey, can you send me birds and can you ship them to me here in Indiana? Guys, just so you know, I'm not going to be in that business. I have no interest in it. I'm happy to ship hatching eggs, but I'm not happy to ship live birds. So I'm not going to be doing it, but I will be selling locally here live birds. And so if you're willing to come to the farm to pick them up, we might be able to work something out where I can sell you some live birds in the spring. So that's going to continue to be a business I'm going to be in. And I made about $580 from selling hatchlings, both duck and goose hatchlings, as well as a few adults that were sold in there as well. So when you add that together, plus I've made about $1,700 in various other side hustles here on the farm. In particular, selling tree seedlings has been very good for me. And I'm going to continue to do more and more of that, particularly as the permaculture orchard grows bigger and particularly as I just get better at propagating tree crops and sprouting different trees, whether they're chestnuts or hazelnuts or apple or walnut or black locust. There really seems to be a market for that. I might even start getting into shipping of that and including it on my website. So at the end of the day, when all said and done, drum roll please, I made $5,087.75 in 2020 farming. I'm proud of you. You know that. I hope you do. That's maybe not a final, final, final number because the year's not closed out yet, but pretty much all of my farm businesses have ground to a halt and I don't expect them to really pick up significantly. I actually, right before I started recording this video, went and looked at some of my past year records. I made $180 in 2018. 2018 was that first year that I started raising ducks and I sold several of those ducks for meat when I harvested my drakes and that's what gave me that profit. In 2019, I made $493 net of all my expenses and everything. I have done now about 10 times that here in 2020 and so I'm a little excited about it. Obviously $5,000 is not enough to live on. It's actually not even if I look at the farm LLC, its final bottom line because I have both a lot of infrastructure costs that I've assigned to other parts of the farm and other parts of the farm enterprise, as well as the fact that I have revenue from things like YouTube and t-shirt sales coming in. Now I know $5,000 does not seem like a lot of money at all, but if I look at it this way, according to the USDA in 2019, the median income from farming income for a household that filed a Schedule F, which is the tax form that farmers file, was only $296. And for the average farming household in America, roughly 80% of their income usually comes from off-farm activities. So when you think about it from that perspective, I feel like my $5,000 is pretty darn good. And so with that, I think we can kind of close the book on what 2020 is going to look like for our farm. And I want to just take a minute or two to talk about what 2021 is going to be all about. So I actually have some big dreams for 2021. I am going to be taking sort of the next step with the growth of our farm. Now I know I've talked a lot about the idea of adding additional animal enterprises and really trying to go slowly when I do it. And as you can see with the progression we've been on, we've been doing that. Well, for 2021, I've made the decision that we're going to be getting into cattle. And specifically, that means raising cattle for beef. I don't have any animals purchased yet, but my plan is sometime in the spring or summer, or maybe even fall, we're going to be buying a small herd of Dexter cattle. And so when that happens, that's going to be adding another layer onto our farm business. And now one thing you guys are going to probably be wondering about is if I've only made $5,000 farming this year, where am I going to get the money to buy cattle, especially a herd of cattle? Then on top of it all, where am I going to get the money to build the infrastructure necessary for maintaining that cattle herd? And well, I've actually come up with a little idea for that. So, you know, I really do feel lucky that people actually care about our YouTube videos and want to watch our progress here on the farm. And I've always found that it's been so cool to have the revenue from AdSense help support our farm. Well, on top of that, all we're going to be taking on a couple of sponsors here on the farm in the not too distant future, where I'm going to be working with a few companies that I feel really good about companies that I've been either using for years or I absolutely love their product. And I'm going to be sharing them with you guys. Companies are going to actually be paying me money to do this, which I think is kind of weird, but I'm totally cool with. And so as I get the money that comes in from some of these sponsorships, I'm going to be setting that money aside and using that to buy the cattle. I know it's totally weird and not a conventional approach to farming, but at the same time here at Gold Shaw Farm, we've always been totally weird and not a conventional approach to farming. And I'm kind of proud of that fact. And so the idea that we're going to be using sponsors to buy cows, I feel like that's kind of just following suit. So stay tuned because a lot more is going to be happening here at Gold Shaw Farm. And I want to say thank you to all of you guys who've been watching us for so long. It just means the world to me that you care enough about our farm. And it's because of all of your support, even if it's just taking the time to watch an ad on a stupid video. And all of that means something to us here at the farm. And that support, we're actually using it to further build our farm. I really am so thankful for it. I really am humbled by it. And so thank you for that support. Thank you for being our partners here on the farm. And stick with us here because it's going to be exciting what happens next.
