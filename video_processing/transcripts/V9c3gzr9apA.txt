 So how much does it cost to actually start a small-scale market farm? I'm going to get a lot of backlash on what I'm about to say, but you cannot start a farm with no money. I would say at a minimum, you need $15,000, if not up to $50,000. That just depends on what you're wanting to do, where your market is, and the infrastructure needed based upon your location. I'm all for the bootstrappers, but there's got to be a fine line between bootstrapping it and actually spending money on your business.
