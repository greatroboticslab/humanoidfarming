 After searching the whole field for her dad's lost phone, they finally heard a faint ringing coming from inside one of the hay bales. Okay. Her dad had just bought it less than 24 hours earlier, but lost it while baling out in the field. Since it was stuck deep in the middle of the bale, they had to unroll the whole thing. At least the hungry cows got a snack out of it.
