 Music My name is Adam Reid, I'm the Director of Marketing for Buehler Industries, right now representing Versatile. Versatile was the first to mass-produce 4-wheel drive tractors starting back in 1966. And so obviously 2016 is our 50th anniversary. We've got some exciting things that we're doing to promote our anniversary. One of which is the Retro Tractor, which we're calling the Legendary Limited Edition. And we're only building 50 articulated units like this. So it's got a special paint job, it's got a chrome exhaust, it's got a special custom embroidered seat with the 50th anniversary logo. And each customer that buys one of these will have a plaque on the back of the tractor that says it was their tractor, it was delivered to them, and it'll be a special serial number. We're only building 50 so there'll be special serial number breaks for those tractors. So we've had a lot of excitement about that. In conjunction with that, anyone that buys one of these tractors gets a trip for two to tour the factory in Winnipeg, which sounds really exotic but it's going to be a great time, it's going to be in the summertime. We're then going to go to our test facility out in Sanford where we're going to have all 50 of these tractors lined up. And we'll do a presentation to each one of the owners. The other thing that we're doing this year, among other things, is we're restoring Big Roy. Now the Versatile 1080 was developed in 1977. It was a four axle tractor and a lot of people around the world know of this tractor. It was nicknamed Big Roy after Roy Robinson, one of the founders of Versatile. And so we brought it back, it's been at the Austin Manitoba Thresherman's Museum in Austin. And so we're bringing that back to Winnipeg, it's being completely restored, and we're going to take it on the show circuit with us this year, this summer. So it's a one of a kind tractor. People from around the world travel to Austin, Manitoba to go to the Ag Museum just to see Big Roy. So it's pretty cool, we're partnering with the museum to get it redone. So at the event where we deliver these 50 tractors, we'll have Big Roy there. We'll have a 1966 D100 Versatile, which is the first Versatile. So it's going to be a really exciting event for those customers. The other thing that we're doing, one of the other things that we're doing, is we've got a 1966 Chevy C10, which we've dubbed the Versatile C10. And we're going to give that away at the end of the year. So customers can enter at trade shows, and we'll do a random draw at each trade show. And then customers that purchase a Versatile tractor will be entered for the draw. Customers that buy one of the limited editions will be entered for the draw. And we'll do something on social media. So there'll be 10 finalists that are going to come to Winnipeg in November for our dealer meeting. And one of them is going to get to take home that 1966 truck. Obviously with its custom paint job and custom seat and a few of the custom touches. So it's going to be a really exciting year. We've been in continuous production since 1966. Always at the same factory in Winnipeg. And actually the build philosophy is very much the same. We want to build a tractor that's simple, reliable, and easy to service and maintain. And we still follow that design philosophy today. I hope you have aFA cost. But if you are using that sort ofetermine philosophy, We're trying to trade your own Denon. плат� Fl Funnel is not using a way to drive these Yi-Z
