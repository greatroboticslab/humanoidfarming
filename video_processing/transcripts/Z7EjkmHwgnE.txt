 Hi I'm Ben Buckley from Farmhand and I'm here with the Big M 450. We're here in the north of Ireland doing demonstrations with the Big M as part of the Mowing the Country campaign. So the reason Farmhand decided to send out a demonstrator model of the 450 was to spread it just to spread a bit more awareness about how much more convenient it is to mow with a 450. Like I think in Ireland there's a lack of understanding of how much more productive you could be with the Big M. I know certainly I came from a background with two sets of triple mowers and I thought that was the only way to mow and then I sat up into this machine and you wouldn't even look at the three mowers anymore on the tractor. So I think it's all to do with spreading awareness and getting fellas into the seat and then they can really see the benefits for themselves.
