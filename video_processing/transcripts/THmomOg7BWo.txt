 and 14 and we reached out to those producers from March 24th through April 6th and then in addition to the survey work of course there is the administrative data that we use specifically we typically call it the utilization data as you can see particularly in Florida from the Florida citrus administrative committee it really represents the quantity of fruit that's packed or processed and obviously was produced that becomes a pretty valuable tool for us particularly this late in the season so without further ado if we can make the slide move there we go let me go ahead and share the new forecast for you for citrus this month I would also point out before I talk about the new numbers April's also the month when we have an opportunity to revise the previous season as well and so there are some revisions to the previous year that are factored in here as well when you look at the percent change from the previous year but with that said let's look at the new forecast for this season we'll start with oranges for now forecasting all orange production at 3.79 million tons you can see that's up just three tenths of a percent from last month it is still down 13.7 percent from last year's now revised total so the change from last month only three tenths of a percent but a lot of movement happening there among the states so in Florida actually down three million boxes from last month's forecast that's all in the Valencia portion of the crop same story we've been talking about all year small size large drop it's just even smaller size even larger drop than what we had previously seen so as a result three million bucks reduction there uh but then in California actually up 3.7 million boxes from what we had previously forecast there so overall that mostly washes out and you see a fairly small change nationally uh from last month looking specifically at the non-Valencia versus the Valencia you can see again the non-Valencia is 2.55 million tons that's up 6.6 percent from the previous forecast still down 6.1 percent year over year the Valencia is down 10.6 percent from previous months so now we're down 26 percent year over year on that portion of the orange crop looking at the grapefruit 397 000 tons now forecast that's up 7.3 percent from last month's forecast it is still down 9.4 percent from what was produced last season looking state by state from the previous forecast Florida down 300 000 boxes California up 600 000 boxes and a slight increase in Texas as well and that's what's leading to the overall change to that crop lemons you can see we're now forecasting 980 000 tons that's up just four tenths of a percent from what we were previously forecasting actually up 17.5 percent from last season that's the only citrus crop you see on here that is actually larger this year compared to last and then last but not least the tangerines 878 000 tons no change from the previous forecast but down sharply from what was produced last season and with that said we'll move on to some of the upcoming reports uh next week you can see the crop production historical track records it's kind of an underrated report i think because it's not new information but pretty valuable information that shows how the numbers subtract throughout the seasons over time cattle on feed on the 22nd local foods that'll be a big day as well long-awaited report there on april 28th ag prices at the end of the month of course on may 2nd as usual our monthly care reports may 4th will be our annual non-citrus and then of course may 12th and next crop production report as well as our final cotton numbers and of course that will also feature uh the first yield and production forecast of the season for our winter wheat crop uh just a few uh reminders for folks as we wrap up on the last side of things here at one o'clock as joe alluded to in the intro i'll be out on twitter hosting our regular stat chat series uh taking any questions that folks might have about today's report and in just a just a couple short weeks we'll be back in chicago that's right back in chicago for the data users meeting there will still be a virtual option as well and so folks aren't making sure about there they still get an opportunity to sign up and follow along online with us and then last but not least for reminders that is a census year and so we're gearing up to get all of those forms out into the mail by the end of the year so still an opportunity for some folks to make sure you're on the list if you haven't already made sure that is happening so that is the last slide that i have for you i'll be happy to stick around after mark's finished to take any questions you might have so mark i'll turn it over to you let me just make sure this thing is working and it is uh good afternoon seth and i won't be quite as quick as lance was but as you know um april you know tends not to be a super busy month for us in terms of new um new information uh focus is still on the old crop year um in may so next month we'll roll out new new year uh new year outlook so that'll be a big one for us uh but we do have of course a lot of new information to report to incorporate anyway into this april uh version including the grain stocks reports came out uh in rice stocks and quarterly hogs and pigs so we're focused on that and then of course um uh foreign production as well right now we gotta have a big focus on brazil second crop corn uh we're kind of in the middle of the growing season there april weather is critical and we increased the area this month uh yield is unchanged but looking very good and production will be up sharply from last year we'll talk a little bit more about that as we get to that part uh starting out with weak uh uh global production uh you know small increase in production this month um mainly based on uh truing up some data uh increased argentina as you can see there by half a million tons uh that's really based largely on the fact their export pace has been so strong uh just suggested their crop must have been larger than uh uh than we had been assuming uh and then also eu uh truing updated air based on several countries um and just uh uh as uh as those new new estimates come out so some offsetting changes there between argentina and the eu global balance sheet uh tightening up a little bit this month as you can see uh starting out with the uh beginning beginning stocks actually we raised a bit this month based on some changes in uh pakistan brazil argentina and saudi arabia that also reflects that larger crop that we're um uh that we're forecasting back for uh for argentina um other uh important items to note trade uh wheat trade cut this month by three million tons several uh several um countries playing into that of course kind of at the top of the uh attention here is ukraine which we cut by a million tons um also cut u.s exports eu exports uh that million tons in ukraine that it largely goes into stocks and um in fsi uh holding ukraine now about 19 million tons of exports with the majority of that already shipped um uh offsetting so uh cuts in as i mentioned ukraine us eu offsetting increases in russia brazil and argentina um ending stocks uh tightening up there that'll be a five-year low uh also just worth noting those tighter stocks uh increased our fsi estimate for india based on uh some food distribution programs there which is which are drawing down their stocks to some degree uh us wheat balance sheet uh some changes here again incorporating the march 1 stocks estimates that were that were uh reported on march 31st um suggesting uh you know a little uh tightening up there in our feed and residual use forecast uh also reduced our export forecast for wheat um again they our prices are very high not competitive um so we've just seen that slow down in pace uh that 15 million bushel reduction is split between uh 10 million bushel reduction for hrw 5 million for uh software in winter um uh exports there that we're that we currently have you can see the big reduction year over year and those would be the lowest exports since uh 2015-16 and indeed the lowest export us export volume second lowest export volume in 50 years um so uh raised our market price there as you can see by 10 cents a bushel uh at this point that crop is mostly marketed but we did see some um we've seen a lot of price strength uh recently and including uh february nas prices that came in at a pretty strong nine dollars and sixteen cents a bushel moving into rice uh small changes here and on the production side uh brazil cut brazil for uh production forecast uh again this month that just reflects as we've been talking many uh months in a row now about the drought especially in southern brazil where most of the uh most of the rice there is produced uh in uh into indonesia uh cut by a million uh tons as well that's been that's an area change and where what we've been seeing is some shifting of area into corn and out of rice so corn area up rice area down reflected in that uh reduced production forecast and then uh global balance sheet uh production down we talked about that that's led of course by indonesia uh ending stocks now again forecast a record high uh held about about 56 percent of those ending stocks held by china 22 percent by india uh trade up this month as well uh that uh it would also be record rice trade um higher exports out of india pakistan thailand and burma and also just worth noting here that we raised our china imports of rice uh by 600 000 tons to 5.2 million and we've been seeing a lot um a lot more uh imports by china a broken rice from india likely uh for feed use so that is uh behind that strong demand and the adjustment this month u.s balance sheet not much going on here it would it would appear at first glance nothing uh uh none of the major uh categories changed but there are some kind of offsetting changes behind the scenes here uh domestic use unchanged but uh some offsetting changes between long grain uh use which is up two million hundred weight medium short grain down two million hundred weight and that just reflects the uh information we got from the rice stocks report last week uh average average market price we reduced uh 20 cents per hundred weight uh just really based on the recent mass data uh mass price data uh from february and um you know again forecasting recognizing that we have five months left in that marketing year achieve that season average price moving into corn uh corn production area uh corn production up about up a bit this month uh focusing here on brazil uh up two million tons this month that is entirely based on area again we held yield unchanged yields are expected to be good i'll give you a few slides to make that case here in just a minute uh european union increased as well just basically truing up some data there uh that mainly reflects increased crops out of uh germany germany and romania but back to brazil real quick uh so you know at this time of year we're really focused on that second crop saprina crop the larger uh uh crop for brazil we're right in the middle of uh of the growing season april weather is critical this is about equivalent to july in the united states so we're watching it closely and uh and in terms of the uh center west monte grosso area we're we're past the peak of the normal peak of the rainfall so on that downhill part of the curve but worth noting that the corn as you know went in early this year very good conditions plenty of plenty of rain plenty of moisture uh rainfall trace here this is so part of the sorry part of that title got cut out that's monte grosso rainfall trace uh abundant range well above average throughout the year um and then this one it looks like the uh title also got cut off but that's parana again the thing to point out here is that um you'll recall it parana had had been dry uh especially that that impact of the soybean crop but they really had a pretty strong recovery in rainfall uh here you know just in the past uh you know a few weeks and months really brought them back up to up toward average so the corn went in the rain started so the conditions are looking quite good for the second crop corn in parana as of right now of course still early and april is is critical okay so uh corn balance sheet um uh beginning stocks up a bit this month just based on some back year adjustments to eu to the eu and several other small producers um uh what else should i focus on here um trade foreign exports down uh 2.9 million tons this month so behind that number is a four four and a half million ton cut in ukraine's exports which is just like we did last month split between feed use or fsi feed residual and ending stocks also a one million ton cut in serbia's exports interesting one there that's just based on their export restrictions so um that's policy driven uh reduction in in in uh in serbia's exports offset you know these are offset to to some degree by higher exports from brazil canada and india um also we lower china's corn imports by 3 million tons and uh that is uh that offsets much of that feed use increase that i talked about related to ukraine which is why we see here feed use down this month by uh by 800 000 tons and so let's talk about the u.s balance sheet real quick uh again you know just like without the rest of the commodities no new information on the production side but uh feed and residual adjusted lower by 25 million bushels that is again based on the march one grain stocks report ethanol corn use for ethanol use up by 25 million bushels so those perfectly offset lower feed and residual higher ethanol and that higher ethanol uh use is again you know based on eia data as well as we've seen some uh good exports and none of this is too surprising given the strength we've been seeing in the energy prices which is supporting demand for uh uh for ethanol supporting prices and uh and supporting production uh raised our season average market price 15 cents per bushel um and uh yeah it should be no surprise there you've seen the price strength recently typically we have about two-thirds of the crop market at this time of the year moving into soybeans um production side again focused on on south america and this is a continuation of the story that we've had several months in a row now uh just regarding the drought in that southern part of brazil also into into paraguay that entire region so cut our brazil soybean production estimate again this month by two million tons uh cut paraguay as well and just you know it's notable uh pretty uh sharp year over year declines for both brazil and paraguay um uh you know tightening up those supplies year over year world uh world world balance sheet uh beginning stocks just um uh did some adjustments to brazil's back year crop uh to increase increase carrying supplies there a bit uh the rest of uh this of largely a china story here uh crush uh down 2.3 million tons this month that's mostly reduced crush in china note also we reduced china's imports by three uh three million tons just again reflecting that lower crush demand uh trade down 3.3 million tons and that is largely uh reduced exports out of brazil and paraguay and ending stocks global lending stocks tightening up just a bit as you can see see u rest balance sheet um uh exports up uh again this might not be too surprising uh you've you've seen the sales coming through recent strength in exports uh very good outstanding sales picking up a lot of business from brazil uh in their relatively uh tight crop there so raised our forecast still down year over year but it's certainly been strengthening lately uh average market price didn't change it this this month uh typically we have about three quarters of the crop market at this time of year and we need prices to stay at about 15 16 dollars farm level for the balance of the year to achieve that 13.25 moving into cotton very small changes in cotton this month uh uh slight increase in production globally um led by pakistan and that's just based on uh information we got from post and also you know not listed here on on the slide but the other country that we increased with was uh greece also based on information from folks um supply and demand uh mostly a china uh the uh half a million bail cut in consumption uh that uh reflects a cut in china's consumption for some time now china is you know there's been kind of building macroeconomic concerns in china uh raising some you know some questions about their continued strength and demand those have only been exacerbated by the recent lockdowns due to coronavirus and etc so uh so cut that uh cut their consumption and um that is also reflected in the um uh reduction in trade and uh and and the increase in china's ending stocks so mostly china story in terms of the uh global cotton balance sheet this month uh u.s cotton balance sheet uh not much to say in terms of the um supply and use components but we did increase um season average price again 91 cents per pound last time we increased it to 90 cents it was in october um but those prices have been strong especially in the last two months uh so this of course would be a record uh a record uh farm price season average farm price based on the data that we have and um uh and recent price strength has certainly supported it moving into sugar um uh kind of a lot going on here in the sugar uh balance sheet this month uh starting with production we cut production as you can see for both beets and cane the beat uh the beat uh sugar beet production uh sugar beet production decrease is based on processor data a lot of that is uh due to a reduction in michigan where they are experiencing pretty low sucrose recovery and really kind of starting to realize the impacts of what was a very bad wet harvest so that crop went in and it's just uh you know it was harvested but under poor conditions and now it just isn't yielding the kind of uh sugar recovery that they would hope at the same time also the red river valley uh the the process processing is expected to extend into june and so given that it's going to continue that late into the year there's concerns about the beat pile and and uh shrink just because weather's going to be warming up so uh so between those two we uh we cut the beat production by 51 uh thousand tons as you can see and then cane we also cut cane and that primarily reflects uh kind of the realization of the damage in florida from the freezes we saw in january so we're just really now learning what the impact of those freezes were uh that's the production side um uh imports uh high tier imports we raised again this month 15 000 short tons that's based on raw sugar that entered into the country in january and february so that directly um drives that number uh domestic deliveries we increased as well that's based on the observed pace of deliveries from beat processors and also direct consumption imports and then when you work all the way through the balance sheet um that book the supply and demand side you see we're tightening up the uh ending stocks quite a bit and reducing that stocks use ratio uh to 12.5 percent this month mexico uh increased production there and uh that is that reflects uh strong yields and very good recovery uh data coming in so there is reduced area but uh the strong yields and and good recovery uh more of an offset the reduced area to increase production or to uh have have us forecast and increase the production for this year uh that increased production of course uh the way mexico operates that all goes into exports sending stocks are unchanged um all this is really saying you can see the strong increase year over year production for mexico as well all this is uh you know the key point to take home here is that the mexico will certainly have enough sugar on hand to fulfill their export business let's move into livestock kind of a lot going here going on here as well uh beef production up 140 million pounds this month and so this is a little bit of a complicated story uh what we're really seeing here is given the drought conditions um in the plains that's pulling cattle into feedlots and also cow slaughter is high so we're seeing near-term increases in production but that's going to come back later as much tighter supplies into next year but as of right now that's reflected in higher production and uh and reflected in that increased production forecast for this month uh pork on the other hand reduced that by 250 million pounds uh we're reflecting both the slaughter pace um that we've been observing and also the hogs and pigs report which as you know um last month showed pretty slow growth in pigs per litter and tightening up supplies generally uh broiler production also down based on slaughter pace and turkey production down there at as you can see and that mainly reflects um bird calls due to hpai so uh starting to see some impact from that um prices uh steer prices small change this month uh up a bit and kind of some offsetting um offsetting impacts there lower prices in the first quarter but strengthening toward the end of the year higher in the fourth uh fourth quarter um hog prices uh adjusted upward again this month as uh really just based on tighter supplies and observed price strength uh and uh price strength across uh the poultry complex as well broilers up strong demand relatively slow production growth that we're observing there so the you know price the higher price is not too surprising and also uh increased our turkey price forecast based as well on tighter supplies and just uh to point out and again i apologize this slide the uh heading got cut off but what this slide is showing you is uh u.s cow slaughter excluding dairies this is cattle uh slot cow slaughter uh other cattle just to point out the high level of cow slaughter that we've uh been observing uh observing uh this year relative to past years way above where we've been the past couple years um and that so that's contributing to the near-term increase in beef supplies but also raising concerns longer term for tightening up uh tightening up supplies further down the line uh meat trade uh no change in beef and our beef export forecast this month you can see though down year over year uh pork export forecast we pulled back uh mainly reflecting here just the fact that we're our prices are strong we're starting to lose some competitiveness so higher u.s prices while we got increased competition lower um demand by china so just tougher competition for all those remaining markets and with our prices we're seeing some uh some slippage in our uh in our in our own export prospects um boiler boilers on the other hand uh raised our export forecast strong demand uh especially in the first quarter might be weakening in the second half but uh for now that demand remains strong despite the high prices and um and we're just seeing that in uh in very strong export case turkey uh exports on the other hand uh reduced this month as you can see 85 million pounds and that primarily reflects um both lower production and hpi hpai discoveries that um uh have uh you know restricted exports from several important uh turkey producing states including indiana um beef imports uh raised it raised this month uh again and uh just seeing a lot of strength high usb prices strength and processing grade demand um okay moving into dairy uh raised our dairy production forecast uh this this month um uh uh that uh reflects higher cow numbers so the data is actually showing um you know higher count numbers and we had been expecting which maybe is not too surprising the strong prices are are slowing that liquidation of the herds that we have been seeing and had been expecting so higher count numbers still lower year over year but um but that liquidation is is now happening at a slower pace so um imports and exports uh fat basis so reduced our import forecast that mainly reflects lower imports of butter and cheese while higher exports of butter fat products and cheese um so small change to our skim solid basis exports uh that uh that's all reflecting um um they're primarily reflecting increased exports of whey and skim milk powder here are product prices to kind of wrap things up here um as you can see we raised prices for most of the products again this month strong demand tighter supplies tighter stocks um dry way being the only product uh on this chart that we reduced this month and really all but really what that's doing is just making us a little bit more competitive in the export market and uh and that's consistent with the uh increased export uh forecast that you saw on the previous slides on previous slide uh dairy prices by class so uh up across the board class three price we have uh strong cheese prices offsetting this uh slight reduction in driveway uh class four price up and all milk price up again this month to another new record 25 dollars and 80 cents per hundred weight and that is all i have in terms of the data for this month swosdy a couple other things that are just worth noting um again may may 12th is will be uh the first assessment of the new crop year so i hope everyone uh tunes in again that's a big month for us that first look out that's when we'll be incorporating the um prospective planting prospective plantings data that we got last week um and with that also just want to point out that we have david busios in the back of the room today is david busios's last day with us at the world board uh he's been a been a key member of our team uh been helping out for several years now with this presentation among many of the other things that he's helped out with with the uh world board behind the scenes uh so uh we wish him the best and um he leaves us with some uh big shoes to fill and with that i'd just like to thank everyone for tuning in this uh this month uh thank you for watching hope you hope i provided you with some insight and i look forward to seeing you next month and with that i'll turn it over to seth if you have any questions
