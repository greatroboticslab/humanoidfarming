 The stress of following strict crop rotation guidelines is enough to make any gardener's head explode. So I couldn't help but wonder what would happen if we just didn't rotate our crops. To answer this question I ignored crop rotation in three cases last season. Here's what happened. This bed of plum tomatoes produced 244 pounds for us in year one and in year two the same tomato variety planted in the same bed yielded 244 pounds once again. This spring crop of heading broccoli gave us 1.8 pounds per plant and it was immediately followed with a second crop of broccoli which yielded 1.7 pounds per plant in the fall. And a final trial tested sweet corn grown in the same bed in consecutive years. In year one it produced 43.2 pounds and in year two the same bed gave us 42.9 pounds. In each case the quality of food remained high and the total yield did not suffer. Now there are still reasons to rotate some crops but these trials show us that you don't need to stress about rotating everything all the time. Instead focus your energy on controlling the five core variables and trust your plants to do the rest.
