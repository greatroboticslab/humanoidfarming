Howto & Style
 Welcome to my allotment. Today I'm going to be talking about crop rotation and how I rotate my crops. If you've not already subscribed to my channel, if you could please do so because you'll get lots of helpful hints and tips all throughout the year from my home garden, my allotment and also my home kitchen. Now although I rotate some of my crops, there are some things that you don't rotate. They stay where they are because they're established. Things like my rhubarb, you know, I don't move that. That stays there year after year. My globe artichokes, they're exactly the same. They stay where they are year after year as do my fruit trees and my fruit canes, like my raspberries, my blackcurrants, my blackberries, my gooseberries, that sort of thing. So they all stay where they are. You never rotate them because the longer they're in the ground, the more they establish and the better they, you know, the more fruit they produce. So there are some things that I don't rotate up at the allotment because I grow things up at the allotment. I grow things at home as well. So things like my tomatoes, my peppers and my aubergines, I keep all those at home. I keep them at home for a few reasons. One, I think they need a little bit more care. Two, I grow so much I couldn't actually fit it all into the allotment. My back garden's a little bit like a sun trap. So those kinds of plants do really, really well there. And we also get a lot of blight up at the allotment. Now while I manage to always save my potatoes every year, the tomatoes really struggle to keep the blight away from them up at the allotment here. So I keep them back at home because they're easier to take care of them and I find that I get a much better crop. So as we move down, I'll show you my crop rotation system. So adding them down. Last year I had my brassicas here, you know, so things like my kale, my broccoli, my cabbages, that sort of thing. They were all here this year. So moving in a clockwise direction, they will come over here. So all the brassicas will be in this top quarter here. And this quarter last year had things like my squashes, my courgettes and my pumpkins, and I had my legumes. So my French beans, my runner beans, and my broad beans, all those sorts of things were spread out in this area. So that's really good. One of the reasons why brassicas, if you can, will always follow things like your legumes, is they put a lot of nitrogen back into the soil and your brassicas will really love you for it. So as we move down, all those squashes and courgettes and legumes will all move down into this area here. So if I've put any sweet corn in, I will try and fit that in here, but I'm not sure I'm going to have space this year. So like I said, all their beans and the squashes and the pumpkins and that sort of thing will go here. Now last year I had my potatoes and my root vegetables here. So this year moving in a clockwise direction, they will be in this quarter here, give or take. I've already got a couple of rows of potatoes in. I'm going to be putting some more potatoes in and my root vegetables, things like carrots, beetroots, radishes, parsnips, that sort of thing, are all going to be in this quarter here. So I'm just going to move up to the other area. Now I realise this isn't the only crop rotation system out there. And before I started this video, this is the one I've been using for quite a few years and it works really, really well for me. But there are some other ones out there. So if you want to explore and have a little bit of a look on the internet and see which ones might work better for you. Because if you want to grow all your tomatoes and your peppers on your allotment as well, you might want to do a slightly different rotation. So I'd really love to hear what other people are doing, the way they rotate their vegetables as well. So as we move up, like I said, I had all my onions and my leeks and my garlic all in this bottom section last year. So again, in a clockwise direction, we move up and all my onions and leeks and garlic and that sort of thing will be in this direction. As you can see, I've got my over-orienting onions in there already, so they've already been rotated in. My spring ones are in and also my garlic are in. So yeah, so it moves it up and then so it all then rotates back around again, all in the same circle. So it's really easy to keep track of where everything could be. Now what you might find is nothing, all the different things you've got won't exactly fit into every single square. So some years you'll have some extra roots you need to plant or you can't find anywhere to put your lettuces. So, and the reality is, is you will just have to put them where you've got a gap and don't beat yourself up about it. Nearly every year, although I have my quarter rotation system, I can guarantee you that I'll have something that I haven't got space in the right box for. So I just have to pop it in where I can. It's not a dreadful thing, so don't worry about it at all. You just have to do the best you can, unless you've got like two allotments maybe, you're going to have to just do the best you can with where you put things. Now, I really hope that you've all found that really interesting. It's going to inspire you to do some form of crop rotation, because it does make life a lot simpler when you're thinking of where you're going to put everything. And I'd love to hear what you're all getting up to as well.
