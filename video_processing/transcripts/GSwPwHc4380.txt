Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. a peecutter and how it works. This is a small machine which has a small vent in it. The machine can be opened and a little amount of nano salt has to be put inside the machine. It has to be closed and it just has to be switched on. By itself, it will attract the clouds by sucking the air around itself which will cause an attraction of clouds as I mentioned before. Then after sensing the presence of clouds, it will release this nano salt which is three times better than normal salt. After this salt spray, this salt will gather inside the clouds. It will attract all the water droplets inside these small, small clouds and it will soon make the clouds heavier by attracting a lot of water people inside them. This will cause the clouds to burst open and it will rain in small parts throughout the mountain range when the terrace farm is done.
