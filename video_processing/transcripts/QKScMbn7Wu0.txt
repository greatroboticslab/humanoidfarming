 If you've ever created a new world, you've probably made a simple farm to get some food or breed animals. But if your farm looks like this, then you're farming wrong. While the crops on this farm will eventually grow, it will take a really long time. But if you make a few simple changes, your crops will grow way faster. First of all, you should plant your crops in alternate rows so each row of crops is next to a different type of crop. This actually causes the crops to grow faster, and the game even hints that you should do this with the farms and villages having alternating crops. You should also bring some bees to your farm and put beehives on one side and flowers on the other. Bees will get pollen from the flowers, and when they fly back to the beehives, they have a chance of pollinating the crops, causing them to grow.
