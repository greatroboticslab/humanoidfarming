 Are you new to greenhouse growing? Here's a couple things I've learned so far. The first is that during the day, whatever the temperature is outside, it's probably at least 10 degrees Celsius higher inside your greenhouse. However, at night, the temperature outdoors is the same temperature indoors. So if it's going to be cold that night, you're going to have to use a space heater. I just use a cheap electric one. It's nothing fancy, but it does the trick. Before you commit to putting all of your precious seedlings outside, especially while there's still going to be some negative temperatures in the forecast, you want to test ahead of time, how hot your heater can keep your greenhouse overnight before you have any plants inside. I hope this gives you the confidence to start bringing things out into your own greenhouse. Follow for more gardening tips.
