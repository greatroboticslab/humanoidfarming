 Welcome to Tend, the next generation of farm management software. Designed for farmers of all scales and specialties, Tend integrates everything you need from seed to sale in one powerful platform. With AI-powered tools, Tend automates data entry, predicts problems before they arise, and delivers actionable insights to help your farm thrive. It's flexible, intuitive, and cloud-based, so you can manage your farm from anywhere, even in the field. Tend makes mapping your farm simple and efficient. Whether you're planning growing areas, infrastructure, or livestock zones, you can create a detailed and shareable map tailored to your unique operation. Start by mapping your growing locations. Use satellite imagery or enter dimensions manually, and Tend helps you customize everything from bed widths to planting paths. Set valid from and valid to dates to track your farm's history and maintain accurate records season after season. Next, map out farm features like irrigation systems, natural resource zones, truck routes, or public spaces. Tend centralizes all your infrastructure, making your map a valuable tool for your team, visitors, and certification reporting. Your farm map is more than a visualization. It's a management hub. Click on any location to view records like past plantings, soil test results, and tasks. Managing multiple sites? Tend lets you toggle between locations effortlessly. Your crop library is the heart of Tend. Here, you can create a personalized catalog of all the crops you grow and how you grow them, including annuals, perennials, and even custom varieties. Tend's database of over 39,000 crops makes it easy to start fast. Each crop comes preloaded with key data like spacing, yield, and growing timelines, which you can fully customize to match your farm's practices. Tend will use them to automatically generate your tasks each season. Quickly set up task templates to save hours on repetitive task scheduling. Add rich detail to your templates, including instructions, tools and equipment, inputs and application rates, and estimated labor times. Set up your task templates just once, and Tend will use them to automatically generate your tasks each season. Tend's visual crop planner gives you an intuitive workspace to create crop plans tailored to your goals. Add plantings individually or in succession, generating them by area, yield, revenue, number of plants, or to maximize production in a specific location. For each planting, Tend automatically calculates yield and revenue, generates your tasks, and estimates labor time. Use the bed space finder to quickly identify available growing space, helping you optimize every square foot of your farm. And when plans change, as they often do, make quick updates to planting, harvest, or termination dates. And Tend updates all related tasks, records, and inputs instantly, saving you hours of manual work. Keep your team aligned and productive with task management. Tend lets you assign tasks, track progress, and capture important notes like weather conditions or pest observations, all in real time. With Tend, rescheduling tasks is easy with a quick drag and drop. When you update one task, all dependent tasks and calculations are automatically updated. Whether you're in the field or at your desk, Tend ensures that your crew always knows what needs to be done. Optimize your harvest workflows with Tend's Harvest Planner, where you can see storage inventory, field availability, and pending orders side by side. Assign harvest tasks and communicate important instructions to your crew, such as which plants to harvest from and which bins to use. After the harvest is complete, compare estimated and actual labor time and yields, helping you analyze your efficiencies. Manage your inventory dynamically, with real-time updates linked to your crop plan. Track what's on hand, committed, or incoming, and allocate inventory to sales channels seamlessly.
