 Extreme weather conditions, climatic changes and environmental impacts are some of the challenges faced by the agriculture industry in meeting the growing food demands, and IoT has been helping to tackle these challenges. Smart farming is a high-tech, efficient and sustainable approach to agriculture. This is achieved by applying connected devices and innovative technologies within the agriculture process. From preparing the soil for planting to harvesting mature crops and integrating them with the cloud to provide valuable real-time insight for farmers. The IoT system can detect real-time weather conditions like humidity, rainfall, temperature and wind conditions very accurately. The data collected helps choose the right crops to grow and sustain and allows farmers to quickly act if weather conditions become unfavourable. Apart from that, IoT applications are also being used for precise farming. Livestock monitoring, vehicle tracking, field observation and inventory monitoring all animal farmers to analyse information and take informed and quick decisions. Farmers can also analyse soil, water and nutrient conditions to increase the farming effectiveness and efficiency. IOT applications in the agriculture industry has made farming more efficient, effective and sustainable, ensuring humankind's growing demand for food are always met. The IoT systems are always met. The IoT systems are always met.
