Howto & Style
 Here's how to grow cucumbers in 60 seconds. First, start your seeds indoors. Use three-inch seed cells, a worm-casting seedling mix, and five seeds per cell. As the cucumbers begin to grow indoors, prepare the soil. I like a combination of 75% compost and 25% vermiculite. Third, wait until the nighttime low temperature is at least 12 Celsius or 50 Fahrenheit before beginning to harden them off. Just before planting them into the garden, put either a teepee or A-frame trellis in place so they can grow vertically. Transplant the cucumber babies using our worm castings and superfood. They're big eaters and drinkers, so this will give them everything they need to thrive. Next, remove all of the first flowers that show up on the plant. This is always heartbreaking, but it will allow the plant to focus on foliage growth, resulting in more cucumbers through the season. The second last tip is to water heavily. Cucumbers are more than 90% water, so tons of water is needed to help them absolutely thrive. And lastly, harvest early and harvest often. This will allow the plant to create more flowers and cucumbers while you enjoy those that you've harvested either fresh or pickled.
