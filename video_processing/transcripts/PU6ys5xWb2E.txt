 Hi, my name is Christine Brown. I'm a field crop sustainability specialist with OMAFA, based out of Woodstock. We're here today, we're assessing the field in preparation for our soil management workshop on the 27th of August. And as we're walking here, we see a lot of the safe problems that are on farms across the province. This field specifically has a lot of erosion, there's topography, it's a big field, there's a lot of water movement, and so we're seeing some of the effects on that. We're seeing some of the effects of a rotation that is limited in some of the crops that it grows. So we're hoping in the day to look at what are some of the solutions that farmers can look at for improving their soil structure, for improving erosion control, and talking with one another because sometimes farmers have strategies on their own farms that really work well. And so we're hoping to have a day where we can share some of those. There's a lot that we can do with some really high tech stuff in the lab and in research, but what we want to be is practical. So what we're going to do is we're going to use shovels, we're going to use our eyes, and we're going to visualize different things within the soil that's going to tell us an indication of how healthy that soil is. We're going to pull that soil apart, look at the aggregation, look for earthworms, look for a ranch growing there. We're going to really get down and dirty and evaluate this soil structure within the topsoil in this field. So you'll be able to see in person how a soil health test works, and learn about opportunities that you can get one done on your own farm. We'll also be talking about some of the aspects of soil health, like organic matter and aggregate stability, and what you can do on your farm to see results in a couple years. There's not a lot of soil focused events in Ontario that are of this caliber. We've got a huge collaboration between a lot of experts that are going to not only be professionals, but also farmer experts that are going to really make this event great and create great discussion and allow for learning not only from these experts, but also peer-to-peer learning, which is going to be absolutely awesome. So see you on August 27th.
