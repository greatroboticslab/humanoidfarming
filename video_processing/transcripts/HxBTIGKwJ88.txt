Nonprofits & Activism
 The current food and agriculture system puts a huge strain on the environment. Smallholder farmers across the globe are trapped in a vicious cycle. They face the increasing pressure to produce more, while lacking access to the resources they need. They suffer from the effects of climate change, yet they lack the tools and techniques to cope with the risks this presents. The negative impacts of climate change are already being felt. With changing cycles and more frequent extreme weather events affecting crops and livestock alike, smallholder farmers struggle to make a living, let alone a profit from their hard work. Our ability to grow food from existing natural resources without destroying those resources is the key to sustainably feeding the world. So, what if? What if, rather than clearing more and more land for farming, we regenerate exhausted soils so that they become productive again? What if we use agricultural waste to make valuable products, like organic fertiliser, and make a business out of it? What if farmers could heal the planet as they feed the world? What if we invest in local circular systems, regenerative and fair systems, so that farming and agroentrepreneurship become an opportunity for a better life? By working together and daring to be different, we can make it happen. What if we could use this success to inspire change for farming communities across the globe, and together shape a brighter future? what is your health care? and just keep in mind the future. You
