Nonprofits & Activism
 Okay, so I'm going to talk a little bit about the farm and eco-villages in general. I've been giving this slideshow as part of a general introduction to eco-villages around the world. And I am drawing on this history of the farm, which is familiar to some people and other people don't know much about it. And it comes out of the 1960s, Haight-Ashbury era. But if you look at American history, it's had an abundance of weird, religious, utopian experiments. And they seem to come in waves. And, you know, you get the Shakers and the Moravians and the Amana Society and the Oneidas and so on. And the 1960s were a very fertile period, a wave that came through. At one time, the Wall Street Journal said there were 5,000 communes in the United States. And they called the farm the General Motors of American communes. So what were the driving factors that created the farm? It was, you know, the 1950s sort of repressive button-down man in a gray flannel suit giving way to the liberation of the 60s and the pill and the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War and the protests to it. And all of these different factors, women's liberation, Native American rights and so forth, that were coming forward and giving us a sense that we could do what we really wanted to do. That we could change our culture. And so you started having these discussions about overshoot and collapse and peak everything, even back then, but in a different sort of way. We all thought that the thing would collapse simply because of the empire reaching its limits in Vietnam and being splintered and knocked apart by that. Well, we were wrong. But other things we were right about, like there was this change in consciousness that occurred. And you can attribute that to lots of things, whether it was the drugs or the sex or the rock and roll. But there was a major cultural shift underway at that point. The hippie philosophy was not particularly complicated. I mean, people look for what are the demands in the Occupy movement. And in the hippie movement, there wasn't very much in the way of demands either. You know, just make love, not war, have a better place, keep on trucking. Simple phrases like that. In San Francisco, there was a college professor named Stephen Gaskin. And he started giving experimental college classes. And he was sort of of the beat generation of the bongos and turtlenecks. And he noticed all these hippies, flower children, and the tie-dyes and whatnot. And he started seeing that they were interesting and they were onto this thing, but they were not very well grounded. They didn't know about Zen. They didn't know about beat poetry or any of the kinds of things that were the intellectual underpinnings that he felt for cultural change. So he started having classes. And the classes were very wide-ranging, freewheeling events where people could come and discuss whatever came to mind. The first classes were a dozen people at the straight theater. And then they lost the lease on that. They had to go to the gallery lounge. And from there, they went to the Glide Memorial Church. They got too big for the Glide. And they were going to a place on the beach called the Family Dog. It was a rock hall every Monday night. And they would go, maybe 2,000 people would show up every Monday night and have this open-ended discussion. No microphones, just a back-and-forth, round-robin, what are people tripping on this week, what are they feeling, what's going through. And so it was sort of a digesting, a processing of the zeitgeist. Well, at one of those meetings, the American Academy of Religion was having its annual convention in San Francisco. And a bunch of the academics and seminarians and so forth came to the class and stood in the back and said, Wow, this is a new American religion. And so they asked Stephen, would you come and talk at our college or our seminary or our church or whatever? And they set up a series of speaking engagements for him. He said, okay, I'm going to recess the class. I'm going to go on the road. At that time, he was living in a school bus. And so he said, it's easy for me. I just let go of the emergency brake, roll down the hill and hope it starts. And then I'm off on the road. And people said, well, can I come? And he said, sure, get yourself a bus. So this is the shot of the virus escaping the laboratory. And into the veins of North America for nine months, traveling around about 80 buses, 40 states, lots of interesting stops being met by state police at each border, escorted to the state parks and so forth. And my first encounter with this was in Union Square State Park or Union Square Park in New York City. I was standing in line for the all-night version of War and Peace at the Bleecker Street Cinema. And I started noticing these buses, these white buses coming up to the corner, stopping for the light and then proceeding. And after I'd seen about 40 of those, I said, what is that? Is this a circus in town? What is this? And so I got out of line, went up to the corner, and they said, well, we're at Monday night class, and we'll be staying at Union Park. Please come by and see us. We're going to do a sunrise service. Well, I fell asleep in the Battle of Borodino. And I just remember the Troikas. And anyway, I overslept and missed the Sunday service. So that was kind of my glancing view of the caravan. But they got back to San Francisco, and they couldn't find a place to park, no surprise there, and decided that they really wanted to stay together rather than go back to separate apartments and coming together on Monday nights as a class and form a community, find some place with some land. And so they had a driver's meeting, and they decided to launch back to the middle of the country and start looking for land, looking for land in Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, where land was cheap. This is the first settlement. It was the middle of a forest in Tennessee, and it was given to them for $1 per year as rental, which sounded like a pretty good deal until you found out that this was like an old hillbilly feud, and this is what one neighbor was doing to the other. And the neighbor who had it done to him cut off the road going in. So it was just stuck inside the land, and we had to go buy a couple of Belgian mares from the nearby Amish and build a sled and carry the laundry out and the groceries in and eventually build our own road out so we could get all the buses back out of there. And then bought this nice little piece next door for $70 an acre. And it had been one family farm with 75 cows replaced by 350 hippies. And the next year they added another 1,000 acres or 750 acres. First year it was 1,000, then it was 750. So that was kind of the freehold of the farm for the first 20 years of its existence. And our skill set was pretty small. These were liberal arts majors and fine arts majors, and nobody really knew farming or carpentry. A few good bus mechanics. But, you know, one skill we had was having meetings, right? Been doing that, you know? Three years, four years, five years at that point, going back to 67. And so meetings actually turns out to be a valuable skill. Because if you can get the group head together, you can begin to think like a group head. And you can begin to make good decisions about what are the basic needs, water, sanitation, food, housing. And you begin to allocate and divide resources and say what are people's skills. Well, the original housing that we came in on was, you know, the rolling stock. And so that became the original housing on the farm. And they started popping up roofs. We also went out and got army tents. We could get the Korean War vintage army tents, $15 for a 16 by 32. And that became the houses. You started to gradually putting in wooden floors rather than dirt floors. You'd pop out greenhouses. You'd put, this is passive solar. You would have tin roofs on and some insulation start going in, frame them in. And gradually they became whole buildings. We also went in with local sawyer to make timber out of our forest. And to, you know, make houses of timber frame and that sort of thing. And gradually build up enough to house everybody. You know, that sawmill, the guy was this old Tennessee moonshiner. And he was very fond of racial jokes. And so we would send, you know, black people to work on his crew. And then he couldn't tell those kinds of jokes. And he would start telling jokes about Native Americans. And we'd send Native Americans to work on his crew. Asians. We could send Asians, you know. So any kind of humor that he'd come up with, we could counter it. We gradually trained him. So Adobe was another one. We didn't know much about this. And we didn't know much about how to work with Tennessee mud. But we had some ideas that it could be done. We built this large apartment house. 150 people lived in this. And we got up to a certain point where the Adobe was not really good enough for holding the bearing walls. And so we, because we were not very good at making Adobe. And so we just built oak from there up. About 10 years pass. And then you start noticing as you walk through this house that there's sawdust showering down on you as you walk. We didn't know about termites. Okay. So the termites came right up through the Adobe into the oak. And then they were into the roof. And that was the end of 150 rooms in that building. But we also were good at scrap wrecking. We went out and got houses on the hoof. Tennessee, like many places, throws away perfectly good houses. And you can get them before they're torn down and just pull them away from the site. Sometimes we bought them at auction if they were in the way of a dam or something. And also alternative building. You know, low-cost yurts, straw bale. Lately we've been doing a lot more of this kind of thing as we learn more and give courses now in natural building. So we work with cob and earth bag and slip form clay and various different kinds of natural building techniques. This is the house I live in today. It is a passive house. It does have active solar photovoltaics for power. LED lighting and everything inside is very efficient. Super insulated with triple pane windows and a living roof. And it's all made from throwaway scrap wood from the Amish sawmill. So they have leftover mill ends when they're sawing logs. And we take that and use this. Because the insulation is blown cellulose from used dollar bills from the Kentucky Mint. So I actually have a house made of money. It's like Scrooge in his money bin. Yeah, this is building that building and putting the clay walls on the inside. Clay has a very nice effect in the Tennessee summers because it absorbs the moisture out of the air. Brings it to 50% humidity. Water system, very important. We needed water. So we worked out with a railroad company that was throwing away this water tower. We got it for a dollar, brought it back. We had to make this pickup truck out of one of the caravan buses. And we actually had the benefit of an engineer, a graduate of MIT. And we said, okay, you're the guy. Figure out how to do this. He rented the crane. He figured out the trigonometry, how to do this whole raising of the water tower. And this picture was taken about three seconds before that tower broke loose and fell down and broke the bus in half. And they built the bus back with oak from the cab back. And they got the water tower up. And the only problem we had was we had bent the guy's crane. So we filled up the bus with dirt. And then we lifted up the, we hooked it to the crane and tried to lift it up until we straightened the crane. So water systems, getting in plumbing, more water towers in regions and neighborhoods on hilltops. And getting old equipment and fixing it up. Transportation, early transportation was just mostly foot. Hauling stuff around in wagons and horses to some extent. We also went out and scrapped that, you know, just like we scrapped houses. Went out looking for old cars and cleaned up people, cleaned up the neighbor's yards out to about 80 miles. And brought all this stuff back. And some of the scrap metal we sold and some of it we used ourselves. Transportation was, then grew into bicycles. We started a bike shop and started making bicycles and put the whole show on the road. Bicycles has always been very big for us. Also started into golf carts. Experimenting with charging golf carts. I ran a golf cart in the World's Fair in 1982 in Knoxville. Solar powered golf cart through that site. This is my car today. One of my cars. And that's another one that's the neighbors. Charging off of our solar arrays. So, food. Okay. Now we're high on the Cumberland Plateau. We're actually the Highland Rim. And we have only a fraction of an inch, maybe a quarter inch of topsoil. And it's been badly eroded, overgrazed. 50 inches of annual rainfall. The dirt is about the color of, you know, yellowish, clayish stuff. And so, we had to first build soil before we could build food. And building soil became something that was actually easier than most people think. People are told that, you know, it takes 10,000 years to build an inch of soil. No. If you know about composting, if you know about how to save organic material, recycle it, put it through aerobic processes, you can actually build soil. And we built soil over about 200 acres to a good depth. And we were able to, within three years, feed ourselves. We grew pretty much everything we ate. And we ate pretty much everything we grew. And the only things we had to buy were things like light bulbs and toilet paper and things that we couldn't make ourselves. This is liberal arts majors, right? And it's a matter of educating yourself and learning from the Amish and our neighbors and how to do some of these things. Learning some, re-skilling. Learning old skills. If you're going to do horses, you need to do horse crafts. You need to know how to do, be a farrier. And also, sweetener. How do you get sugar in Tennessee? You don't, you can't go out and buy white sugar. What are you going to do? So, we made sorghum. Sorghum molasses. And learn how to do that on wood fires. And make our own molasses for the winter months. And be able to put that up. We had a product we called Old Beatnik, Pure Lewis County Sorghum. It was like a black molasses. It was very sweet. So, this is our kind of our farming operation in those years. Very labor intensive. We had lots of hands, lots of people. And people came all the time. The first year started with 300. Next year it was 500. Next year was 800. Next year 1,000. Next year 1,200. 1,400. So, people kept coming. And any given night, there would be 200 overnight visitors. So, what are you going to do with all those people? Well, you put them to work. If you have something to do, you put them to work. And we also started switching back into tractors. Because we just realized that with trying to feed 1,000 people, you really needed to be able to use tractors. And some of that kind of equipment. We also had the skills. Because we've been taking this bus caravan around. We knew how to fix international harvester school buses. And so, we could fix that kind of tractor. And that kind of combine. And we could scrap out. And we could wreck. This guy was a welding. The welder here was an artist at the Rhode Island School of Design before he joined the caravan. But this is his modern form of sculpture. And, you know, we could even do emergency repairs as needed. So, also providing food out of season. You know, you have to feed everybody year round. So, you need to start to think about storing food and processing food. And being able to make it into another product. Like cheese. Or frozen products. Or canned goods. Or dried things. Having large solar walk-in dryers. That kind of thing. And that was a very key pieces of the tool kit. We were lucky that we were vegan. All the whole thousand of us. And so, because of that, we had a diet that was based on soy. Which was a marvelous, noble bean from Asia that had been used for 2,000 years. And you could make tofu and tempeh and all these other products from soybeans. And it's a complete amino acid. All eight essentials in good proportion. A good protein source. Inexpensive. And we could do it organically. So, we could do soybeans. And we could, you know, make milk. And from milk you can make all kinds of other products. We made cheeses. And we made ice creams. And we made tempeh. And we made tofu. And we made frogurt and yogurt. And so on. So, you know, with soy, you could make all these different things. You know, soy burgers. And soy pizzas. And soy cheesecake. And soy sage. And you could even make the coffee cup. Henry Ford was making plastics out of soy in his Model T. So, some of it was figuring out also how to share the surplus. We set up a little farmer's market in the town nearby. And began to also truck. And we had a trucking company where we could hook up food cooperatives around the area. And we could begin to network. And we actually realized after a short amount of time doing large-scale farming, maybe it's not ecological to grow everything we eat on this 200 acres in the highland rim of middle Tennessee. That actually our soil and water regime and so forth is best attuned to certain kinds of crops. But soybeans, for instance, might be better grown in the Mississippi Delta a couple hundred miles to the west. Where the river floods the plain and refertilizes the soil. And you have the nitrogen-fixing qualities of the soybean. And you can do organic beans there that you specify that are best for tofu or milk or whatever. And so we started working on two-year advance contracts with organic growers in the Mississippi Delta to do the large-scale food crops there. And we also started thinking about what are the things that grow best where we are. And we became a synapse between all of the regional farm co-ops. So just about that time, mid-70s, you got the Tucson Food Co-op. You got the Northeast Alliance of Food Co-ops. You got Fork Out of Atlanta, Tree of Life. All of these other food co-ops started up. And so we started hooking up oranges from Florida with apples from Michigan with these other kinds of things. And we became the mechanism by which all of those things got exchanged. Which meant that we could also be a depot. And we could also start to receive in that and put our produce into it. The other thing is, this style of agriculture, I now know a whole lot more about what's wrong with this from a carbon standpoint. But at that time, what was wrong with it was, you get to the end of a row after a very long day in a very hot sun. And what have you really accomplished? I mean, you just look at that and it's just like this endless sort of thing. And this is going back to the 19th century instead of going forward. And so we switched out of this style and into a much more intensive permacultural design landscaping, edible landscaping mode. And we actually produce more in home gardens, neighborhood gardens, CSAs, and so forth today than we produce when we were doing broad scale over hundreds of acres with mechanized equipment. And that's just learning, getting smart about it. The other thing is, this is much more enjoyable. A whole family, you know, going in and enjoying the greenhouse. And it's much more something that you do without worrying about it in a work sense. You do it for yourself and for your community. You can do it commercially, but it's not something that you don't want to do. The other thing is turning waste into nutrients. And so we had a very large laundromat, naturally. A lot of 20-somethings starting to have families and lots of young babies with diapers. And so we needed a diaper rinse. And the diaper rinse had constructed wetlands that we then used to fertilize the fields. And that is actually some of the richest land on the farm today going forward 30 years, was those areas that we used for the diaper rinse. Today we have constructed wetlands around the Eco Village Training Center that handles all of our wastes. So, also, you know, I mentioned the babies. We were doing our own midwifery and childbirth there. We became a childbirth center. This is a neonatal intensive care center that we had with bilirubin and lights and incubators and so forth. We can handle most emergencies. We have a lot of midwifery courses at the farm. Ina Mae was just awarded the 2011 Right Livelihood Award. She'll be receiving that at the Swedish Parliament in December. And, actually, that's the second time the farm has received the Right Livelihood Award. The first time was in 1980. So, these are things that are valuable. You begin to learn these skills. And well babies, having well baby clinics as opposed to sick babies and figuring out what to do when that happens. Maintaining health by proactive work. Looking ahead, doing, you know, shit smears. And that's the same in German, by the way. And you do these kinds of looking at the health of the population. Treating for parasites. Treating for lice. Treating for other kinds of things that may come up right away. Stopping pandemics before they start. Having a basic ambulance service that can reach out into the surrounds. Also provide a service for the community. We had so many paramedics and well trained people in our medical system that we started working with surrounding communities. We started a program for Nashville. Because they didn't have a very good neonatal or intensive response, emergency response for childbirth. And so we went up there and started working at Vanderbilt Hospital to create what they called Angel One. Which was a helicopter service that scrambled doctors who were specialized in childbirth to reach patients and do something. And we actually staffed that for the first years of it until they got up and running really well. I mentioned my work already with the nuclear power issue. I don't need to get into that. And my work with the atomic veterans. Nuclear power plants around us that are being restarted. I'll skip all that. Communication is another important piece, right? So you need to have good communications. And in a community, any community, having things like newspapers, newsletters, social events, social networking of various kinds. In our case, we salvaged a 400 phone system out of a nearby phone service that was going digital. And it's the town of Leoma, Tennessee. And we brought that back to the farm and we set up our own phone system all over the farm. Every house had a telephone. But it was all a party line. And so you would have, on the line, you'd have Morse code for the particular place you were calling. If you were calling the horse barn, it would be da-da-da-da, which is B. And so you'd call around to different people and you'd use Morse code to do that. That trained everybody from little kids to old people in Morse code. That is actually important and I'll get to that in a minute. But the other thing we had was a dial tone that was like the Grateful Dead. Or maybe it was a public announcement, public service announcements, where you had so many people needed tonight at canning. Or the line at the laundromat is now two and a half hours. Or whatever it is that is a public service announcement, that would be the dial tone. And then we also had a hotline. So on every phone, in addition to the party line, which was everybody, you could also flip a switch and it would immediately be picked up by a 24-hour operator. The 24-hour operator would handle any emergency. So she was patched in by radio to our ambulance, to other emergency vehicles, to the local police. She could contact local police and immediately set up a roadblock through town, through the stoplights, if we had to scramble the ambulance into the hospital or anything like that. Fire department, whatever. So ham radio became one of our important things. I'm WB4LXJ. A lot of people on the farm, having now learned Morse code, could pass a simple test to get a ham radio license. And you would thereby avoid the cost of long-distance telephone, which actually turns out to be significant if your community of 1,000 people is living on an average income of $1 per person per day, which we did for the first 13 to 14 years. It wasn't that we were living at the standard of living of Haiti. We were actually much better than that. It was that we weren't exchanging pictures of dead presidents. We didn't have a cash economy. We were collective. And so, you know, there might be a ration at the store, only a pound of butter per person per week or something, but you could, you didn't have to exchange money. And so it was a non-monetary economy. And because of that, certain things you could not really afford. And telephone is one of those. Medical is another. So, I mean, we could provide our own primary health care. And to the extent that we had doctors, we could provide a little bit better than that. But we could not, for instance, do a long hospital stay because we didn't have insurance. And if we had to, we would do a long hospital stay. But we would try to avoid it and bring people back and have our own infirmary and dispensary and so forth. And we could call on a ham radio, WV4LXJ, CQCQ, looking for a ham in Detroit with a phone patch. And a ham in Detroit would come back and say, I can do a phone patch. We'd say, okay, we've got to call Aunt Tilly here at this number. And we'd call back over to Sally in the tent on Hickory Hill and say, Sally, your phone patch is ready. Sally would pick up and talk to Aunt Tilly in Detroit. And that conversation could also be carried on by CB radio from a vehicle if you have a midwife who's needing to talk to a patient that's some distance away or something like that. You can get fairly elaborate with that system, which we did. In fact, we had people who were extra class hams. And they could get into bandwidth. We put out the CB radio Big Dummies Guide. That was one of our early bestsellers. But some of these guys actually were able to put in these crystals into sets that I don't even know if they're legal. But these guys were electronic whizzes. And they would take the Scenic Cruiser when it was out on band tour. We had a rock and roll band that toured. And when the band was on tour, it could go in through to Washington, D.C. And they'd be listening to the Secret Service and the HRT at Quantico and the Air Force One. And, you know, it's like they had all of that all the time. And they'd be going across the Arizona desert. And they'd be listening to police, you know, half a state away. And they would have, like, airport landing lights mounted on the front of the bus so they could look two miles out ahead until a car came into the view, you know. So it was one of those kind of things. Then the other one was I mentioned this in the other slideshow, which is we were part of the World's Fair in 1982, where we reclaimed this old Victorian house that was in downtown Knoxville that was slated for demolition and made it into the appropriate community technology pavilion. And at that pavilion, we displayed a lot of the kinds of things that we had discovered or been working on at that point in time, like concentrating solar and super insulated walls and different kinds of things. So we actually had a company that went around the state building buildings and putting up solar and solar electric and solar water and so forth. And today that company has grown up into the largest solar company in Tennessee. It's no longer affiliated with the farm. Steve Johnson's Lightwave Solar is still doing amazing projects all over the place. And we had some businesses that failed. This is also something that you're going to have. You try and you fail. You learn from that, too. This one was way too far ahead of its time, the idea of a solar car corporation. And it eventually did a $2 million private placement offering, had a factory in Melbourne, Florida, churning out vehicles. It had contracts to do airport service vehicles that were all electric and solar charged. And had postal service contracts. And was actually looking at acquiring the electric boat factory in Groton, Connecticut, which was no longer making submarines. A lot of unemployed people. So we were actually looking into acquiring that to make solar cars. And then Jimmy Carter left office. And you know the rest. So the farm had this radio room, right? And everybody's knowing how to use ham and how to do Morse code. And also you learn some basics of circuit diagrams. We got asked by Greenpeace to provide ham radio for them. So we had our operators on board, the Rainbow Warrior. And they developed a slow scan TV. So you could actually send television signals across ham radio. And we could feed, like, the dumping radioactive waste off like Kaplan hog into the television news streams for the nightly news in the United States through a horse barn in Tennessee, where the ham radio shack was. And we also developed radiation detection equipment for them. I'll get to that in a second. That was actually, you know, if you mix marijuana, Macintoshes, and knowledge of electronics together, you tend to get pipe dreams. Like, what would happen if we put a Geiger counter and a Fuzzbuster together? And you plug it into your cigarette lighter, and if you get too close to a nuclear power plant, it beeps at you. So that was the Nukebuster. And this is taking a blown-up version of the Nukebuster to Three Mile Island. But the funny thing was, we were there at Three Mile Island, and our little Nukebusters that we had, which were sort of novelties, were far more accurate than anything they were using. And so we were getting accurate readings. And we started sharing that with the news outlets around Three Mile Island, Harrisburg. And, you know, they were getting their information from the state, which was getting it from the feds, which was getting it from, wait for it, general public utilities. And so we showed them what was actually happening, you know, and they suddenly started pulling news crews out of there. So today our electronics company is very busy. They, you know, we go, it's a cyclical business. Three Mile Island was very good for us, but then there's a delay, slack for a while. And then Chernobyl, and we went international, and really booming times for a while. And it kind of slowed down, business was not doing so good, and then Homeland Security. Got to love it. Homeland Security, and we started selling these detectors that could stand by a roadside and detect stuff coming by and all kinds of ports of entry and things. And today, we've added another line, another production line, because we're working three shifts. All the entire line is now going to Japan, has been since March. And everybody else has to wait. And what we discovered there was there's actually confiscation of meters, and they're putting out fake meters in Japan. And real meters are real valuable, especially to schools and hospitals and normal people, because the fake stuff and the bad readings are really bad. And so this was while we were here in Michigan. This was last Friday night on the PBS NewsHour. One of our folks was there being interviewed. And they're doing crowdsourced radiation mapping of Japan, all over Japan with these Geiger counters. And so they're actually getting serious, realistic isobar mapping of the radiation around the area. And it's being done despite government help, despite government opposition. So this is one of our major crops. And, you know, these kids are probably, you know, 30s now. But we had to build a school for them. And we went out and salvaged materials and built a solar-powered school and had an interesting working it out with the state about doing that. And eventually established our own school. And this is visiting Professor Wavy Gravy teaching a class in clownsmanship. We're also part of the National Coalition of Alternative Community Schools. And we get to cross-fertilize with a lot of alternative experiments and get to pick the best stuff and choose the pedagogy that most fits our needs. A lot of that is actually action learning, where the kids get out and apprentice and learn from people who are doing things. That's always been the most effective way of learning anything, like how to make a Geiger counter. Also, the farm has a lot of entertainment, a lot of things to do that keep ourselves happy and having fun. And if you look at the farm today, we're a cultivated ecology. We've spread out and organized ourselves on this piece of land, and it really does feel much more like a village. It has all the essential features of a village. One of the ways you have to be sustainable is economically. Our book publishing company is the single largest publisher of Native Americans. It's also well known for its how-to books and raw foods cooking and vegetarian and vegan cooking and so forth. And we no longer print very many books on our farm. We do have a small press, but mostly that's farmed out to other larger presses. And we do a lot of creative work on the farm, and we have a large website for not just the books, but a lot of the products that we make on the farm. We also have a media production studio. We've been doing that for a number of years. There's new media like the podcast that KMO does and some of the other kinds of things that we do on new media. Mushroom business, another one of our businesses. This is something that's very appropriate for a large oak forest, and we grow gourmet and medicinal mushrooms, and we sell the kits to farmers to teach them how to do shiitake and maitake and okitake, all those good Japanese forest mushrooms that are good for you, medicinal value. Also working on biofuels and biofuel conversion, trying to figure out the ways to make it. I have a large bamboo plantation and doing bamboo to biochar now as part of the way we heat our houses and trying to figure out how to get electricity off of that too. I'll use it for waste treatment. The car I drove up in here is my Volkswagen Jetta. It gets 50 miles per gallon, and it's going to get a turbo boost from a hydrogen add-on. It hasn't happened yet, but it's supposed to, and that's going to add about another 20 miles per gallon. That's now running on biofuels, and we can make our own. So this gives me a little bit of freedom, a little bit of independence to be able to go around and talk at places like this. So just to make a long story short, this is a rough schematic from a few years back of the businesses on the farm. There's for-profits, there's non-profits, there's land-owning entities and non-land-owning entities and mom-and-pop companies and independents and various things. But it's an ecology of systems, and it works together. We work together. Our community has been through ups and downs over the years. This is the population change. In the early 80s, we decollectivized, and that was a big shift. A lot of people left because the revolution was too slow, and some of them left because they thought we were leaving the revolution. And so we're now cooperative, and the population's come down quite a bit, but it's stable. And if you look at the money coming through the farm, that's been constantly increasing, even though the population has declined. So we're actually successful that way and able to undertake more efforts to share surplus.
