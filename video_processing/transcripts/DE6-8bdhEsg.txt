 Yo, what's up everybody? In this video, I'm going to show you how to get prismatic rewards super fast in the new Summer Harvest event in Grow a Garden on Roblox. And trust me, these rewards are crazy. You can get night eggs, moon cats, and even rare event seeds like the moon mango seed. So if you want to be one of the first to get them, watch this whole video. I got the best tips for you. Alright, so here's how it works. Every hour, the Summer Harvest event starts for 10 minutes. During that time, your whole server works together to earn points by submitting fruits at the event cart. But not just any fruits. You need to submit only the new fruits that dropped recently, like banana, kiwi, avocado, and more. Meaning only submit the Summer fruits. These are the special ones Sam added to the shop for the Summer update. And here's the trick. The bigger and rarer the fruit is, the more points you get. So a prismatic fruit is way better than a common one. You want to plant as many of these new fruits as you can. So before the event starts, fill your farm with nothing but summer fruits. Focus on the biggest and best versions. When the event begins, harvest like crazy and run to the cart in the center to submit. Your goal is for the whole server to reach 12,000 points. That unlocks the prismatic reward tier, and that's where the best stuff drops. Here's a secret to make it easier. Join a good public server with active players. Or better yet, join my Discord server. Link in the description, where you can find other players to grind with. The more people submitting good fruits, the faster you hit 12,000. Once your server hits that goal, boom, you get a prismatic reward. That's where you can pull crazy stuff like moon mango seed, moon cats, and more. You probably want all that stuff now, but you didn't play Grow a Garden before because you thought it was bad. Do you want to get pets like the Raccoon or Disco Bee for free? If yes, go to blockstime.com. Just sign up with your Roblox username, you don't need your password, and click the earn tab. You can do easy stuff like download apps, watch videos, or answer surveys to get points. Then go to withdraw, choose Grow a Garden, and boom, you'll see pets you can claim for free. It's safe, it's fast, and there's even a referral system where you get 5% of what your friends earn. And if you make a video about blocks time, they'll give you 100 points for every 1,000 views you get. That's wild. Now, if you want the rarest stuff without doing offers, check out blockshop.org. You can buy pets directly and skip the grind. It's super trusted. Over 400 good reviews on Trustpilot. And don't forget to use my code HYPERGARDEN at checkout for 10% off. Links for both sites are in the description. So yeah, plant only the new summer fruits. Use the better versions as much as you can, grind the harvest event, and unlock those prismatic rewards.
