 Hi, I'm Andrew Elgrisma and I'm the Grower Solutions Manager with BSF Canada and I'm here at the 2015 Precision Agriculture Conference to talk about a new mobile farm management solution called Compass Grower Advanced. Compass Grower Advanced helps growers by enabling them to make more informed decisions and getting valuable reporting off of a farm management platform that brings together crop, financial and grain marketing management data all onto one solution. So it really helps in the reporting and data capture and brings together a lot of valuable information including data from the cabs of tractors and combines and sprayers and allows growers to bring that data all onto one device. Compass Grower Advanced is brought to the market as a result of a partnership with BSF Canada and Affinity Management which is based in Oakville Ontario and we have the luxury of the developers and the support team to help growers get on the tool being all based here in Ontario. It's built on a Microsoft based platform which allows us to continue to evolve it and will ensure it's here for the long haul and if you're looking for more information on this tool or how to get it please contact our egg solutions line at 1-877-371-2273.
