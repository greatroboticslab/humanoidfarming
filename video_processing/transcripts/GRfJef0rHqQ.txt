 An agricultural crisis is tearing apart the United States, and your loaf of bread now comes from Canada. With U.S. farm bankruptcies skyrocketing by 55% and wheat production at a 50-year low, the harsh reality is America is losing control and Canada is stepping in to fill that gap, one loaf at a time. For generations, agriculture has been the backbone, the pride of America. The image of a resilient farmer on endless fields was once part of the American dream. In 2023, the U.S. ranked third globally in agricultural output with $459.85 billion, of which $443.15 was from food. But that's the story of the past. 55%. This isn't a growth rate, but the percentage increase in U.S. family farm bankruptcies in 2024. 216 farm bankruptcies were filed in 2024, a 55% jump from 2023, marking the end of four consecutive years of decline. But the more alarming number is 82 bankruptcies in the first three months of 2025, almost double the same period last year. This means that nearly every day in Q1 2025, a U.S. farm declared bankruptcy. The root cause comes from multiple factors. Many American farmers need to supplement potassium in their soil, so they use potash, most of which is sourced from Saskatchewan, Canada. Conversely, Canadian farmers often need to add phosphorus, so they buy phosphate, most of which comes from Florida. Fertilizer is the largest input cost for most farmers. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that 22% of total corn production costs came from fertilizers, including labor, machinery, and overhead. Earlier this year, potash prices rose from $303 per ton to $348 due to U.S.-Canada tariffs. At the same time, fuel shortages in states like Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas have caused operating costs to skyrocket. Emergency declarations were issued for Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas due to the fuel shortage, leading to inflated prices for tractors, plows, and food transport vehicles, putting tremendous pressure on farmers. Farmers are stuck in a trap with no way out. Product costs, fertilizer, fuel, seeds are controlled by big corporations and domestic policies and are continuously rising. Meanwhile, commodity prices are determined by the global market and are showing signs of decline. They're stuck buying high, selling low in their own industry. While American farmers are caught between escalating trade wars and drastic cuts to agricultural budgets, Trump continues to offer mild promises of adjustment time, with farmers expected to suffer a little longer. Now, the remaining trust and capital of farmers have run out as major export markets dwindle, and U.S. agricultural products are slapped with sky-high prices due to tariff wars. This has led many farmers to be crushed by losses, with no choice but to declare bankruptcy. Reports from DTN Progressive Farmer show that farmland prices remain high, which is the only way out for some farmers. Many have had to sell their land to pay off debts or invest in more promising industries. As a result, fields are left abandoned. Farms are deliberately burned to stem losses, and American farmers leave the land, taking with them the collapse of an entire rural ecosystem. Here's a harsh truth. Since 2000, the total land area of U.S. farms has decreased annually, except for a small increase in 2012. According to statistics, the total agricultural land area has dropped by more than 66 million acres, and by 2024, only 876.5 million acres of farmland remained. This crisis is becoming more evident, with the 2025 wheat decline showing it clearly. The USDA has forecast that in 2025, farmers will plant less wheat and switch to more profitable crops like corn, and that grim prediction is now a reality. According to Farm Progress, spring wheat acreage in 2025 has fallen to just 9.4 million acres, the lowest level in more than 50 years since 1970. States once considered the grain belt, like North Dakota, Kansas and Montana, are reporting double-digit declines in production. Farmers are no longer interested in wheat because planting it is now a losing gamble. The direct consequences are felt in every household. When you, a regular consumer, go shopping and see the prices of bread and cereal spike, things like Kroger and Safeway are reporting price hikes ranging from 20% to 40%, or have started shrinking packaging sizes to quietly deal with the supply shortage. For the same price, you're getting less. It feels like you're getting robbed legally. The biggest sting comes when you pick up a loaf of bread and check the label. More and more loaves are coming from Canada, because their prices are more reasonable than domestic products. The made in America, pride on the dinner table, once a given in a country that was the world's third largest agricultural producer, is now replaced by a harsh reality. We have to depend on Canadian wheat. That's a big question the people are asking their government. Can their country still take care of its own agriculture? While U.S. agriculture sinks into crisis, a completely different story is unfolding at the northern border. In the Great Plains region of the United States, where spring wheat once dominated the fields, farmers are turning their backs on the crop. But just across the border in Canada, the struggles and prospects of U.S.-China tariffs on canola oil have spurred farmers to ramp up wheat production. China's 100% tariffs on Canadian canola oil and the threat of tariffs on canola seeds, amid President Trump's broader trade war, have rattled Canadian farmers, who have nearly quadrupled their canola acreage since 1990 before cutting back in recent years due to increasing droughts, high production costs, and crop diseases. Now tariffs are expected to accelerate the potential for thousands of farmers to cut back further by hundreds of thousands or even millions of acres less canola, according to farmers and analysts. And they've turned to growing spring wheat. Instead of dumping their grain into the volatile commodity market, they're going straight to U.S. food giants, bakeries, pasta plants, fast food chains. With an offer they can't refuse. Your system is in chaos. Your supply is uncertain. Sign long-term contracts with us. We guarantee you a steady high-quality supply uninterrupted. For a U.S. business desperate for supply, it's a lifeline. And so, Canada has quietly taken over the U.S. supply chain from the inside. Unlike in the U.S. immediately after tariffs took effect, the Canadian government stepped in with direct subsidies and farmer protection policies, creating a sustainable and flexible system. While American farmers leave the land due to retaliatory tariffs and confusing policies from the government, Canada quickly fills that void. The price for filling that void is nothing less than America's sovereignty, a truth evidenced by undeniable numbers. The U.S. is losing control over its own food supply. Wheat imports are on the rise. The USDA forecasts that the U.S. will import about 150 million bushels of wheat in the 2024-25 marketing year, an 8% increase from the previous year. But this isn't just a number. Think about it. Next time you open a bag of flour, you might be holding wheat grown in Canada or Australia, not from a nearby farm. Most Americans don't realize that domestic production is running dry. In the geopolitical game, relying on essential food supplies from another country is like putting a sword in the hands of your opponent. And ironically, that sword is now in Canada's hands, the very country the U.S. has tried to pressure with tariffs. Think about this. If the U.S. keeps pressuring Canada with tariffs, what will they retaliate with? They already have strong cards in energy, steel, oil and more. But now, they have an even stronger trump card, wheat. A small political move from Ottawa, such as imposing export tariffs, restricting supply, or prioritizing contracts to other countries, is enough to cause a real crisis within the United States. America has lost control over its own dinner table. When wheat becomes a political pawn, they're no longer the ones calling the shots, but the ones waiting. And in the geopolitical game, the one waiting is the loser. In less than 72 hours, China rejected 150,000 tons of U.S. beef. Worth over $520 million, Russia moved in immediately to take its place. Is this just a trade hiccup or a turning point in the global balance of economic power? In early March 2025, China abruptly rejected 150,000 tons of U.S. beef. Worth over half a billion dollars. No statement. No warning. Just swift action at major ports like Shanghai and Guangdong, where shipments were turned away under a single explanation. Substandard safety compliance. The official reason was food safety. But just days earlier, the U.S. had imposed a 25% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles and components, impacting over $38 billion in trade. Analysts noted that the volume of rejected beef in March was over four times higher than in January, a spike that sent shockwaves through the export industry. This wasn't a port-side technicality. It was a strategic signal, calculated and deliberate. And while the blow may have landed at the docks, its impact struck straight at the heart of American agriculture. Texas, Kansas and Nebraska, three states that account for over 70% of U.S. beef exports to China, are feeling the hardest hit. By mid-March, more than $520 million worth of contracts had been canceled or frozen. Wholesale beef prices dropped sharply. 7.3% in just two weeks. Thousands of tons of product are sitting in storage. Cold chain logistics have been disrupted. And the feed supply industry is now facing downstream losses. A Nebraska producer said his $4 million export contract is hanging by a thread, forcing him to sell at a loss in the domestic market, which simply can't absorb that much volume. But here's the twist. These impacted states? They're rural America. The very backbone of U.S. political campaigns. Just as the U.S. was left behind, Russia stepped in. In the first quarter of 2025, Russian beef exports to China surged 32%, reaching 41,000 tons, an unprecedented increase. But the story isn't just about numbers. It's about how Russia planned ahead. As early as 2023, Moscow signed bilateral agreements with Beijing to create a custom veterinary inspection system, unlocking access for 40 processing facilities that were previously restricted. By November 2024, a new rail corridor from Volgograd to Xinjiang came online, cutting shipping time from 28 days by sea to just 11 days by rail. Russia wasn't reacting to a crisis. It was anticipating it. With a deliberate strategy across production and logistics. Russia isn't just selling beef. It's changing how beef is paid for. According to China's General Administration of Customs, 89% of Russian beef exports to China are now settled in yuan or rubles, not U.S. dollars. This allows both nations to sidestep the global financial systems dominated by Washington. But it doesn't stop there. The Russian government has announced a $1.1 billion support package to double beef export capacity by 2027. Three mega farms are under construction in Voronezh and Kursk, each designed to raise over 100,000 cattle. Russia isn't just replacing the U.S. in terms of volume. It's rewriting the rules of the game. Just three years ago, the United States held 12.6% of China's imported beef market, worth over $1.2 billion in annual revenue. But by the first quarter of 2025, that number has dropped below 6%. In the meantime, Russia, Kazakhstan, and other emerging exporters have moved fast, signing long-term contracts, building dedicated logistics networks, and conducting trade in their own currencies. According to expert Deborah Elms, one supply chains are restructured around new standards, new inspection protocols, and non-dollar payment systems. Coming back is nearly impossible. The U.S. hasn't just lost its biggest customer. It now faces the deeper risk of being cut out entirely from the global protein value chain. The supply chain is shifting. Will the United States reclaim its position, or be pushed further to the sidelines? Don't look away, because what's coming next might just change the game for good. The U.S. economy is collapsing. And over 60,000 people, from Denver to Tucson, have risen up to protest Trump's policies. While billionaires and politicians continue to live lavishly, the people are demanding justice. Are you among them? For the American people, this could lead to a severe economic recession, skyrocketing inflation, and a shrinking GDP. These issues won't only affect large corporations, but will directly impact living costs, jobs, and daily life for everyday Americans. Imagine struggling to make ends meet, while policies from above push the economy down an even more difficult path, leaving wages stagnant and the cost of goods soaring. This is the reality that many Americans are facing right now. While Donald Trump is continuing his vacation at Mar-a-Lago, the U.S. economy faces a future filled with uncertainty. Experts at J.P. Morgan warn that if the U.S. government continues with its tariff-heavy protectionist policies, the economy will slow down significantly. And the U.S. could fall behind strategic competitors like Japan, the EU, and China in the next 10 to 15 years. This means the U.S. could lose its leadership position in global technology, manufacturing, and trade. The increasing competition from other countries will make the U.S. economy too weak to maintain its dominance in trade and technology, increasing the gap between rich and poor nations. As the economy weakens, the American people have no choice but to stand up. Their uprising is not just a simple protest, but a call for massive change. But will the government listen before it's too late? As economic hardships become unbearable, Americans are pouring into the streets to protest Trump's policies. From Denver, Colorado, where over 35,000 people gathered, to Tucson, Arizona, where the turnout was eight times larger than expected. Everyone carries a powerful message. We will not accept a country run by billionaires. We want a fair government. One that doesn't sacrifice the many for the few. These protests aren't limited to major cities. They're spreading to rural areas, industrial zones, and schools where people can no longer bear the weight of their struggles. These movements represent a powerful wave of resistance, the voice of those affected by policies and worsening living conditions. These protesters are not disruptors. They are citizens directly impacted by failed economic policies. Those who have suffered while billionaires and the powerful continue to enjoy lavish lifestyles. The government must listen to them before it's too late. And this uprising becomes an unstoppable wave. With a weakening economy, the people are rising up. But will the government respond in time? If you watched the previous episode, you'll understand why things are spiraling out of control. Stay tuned as we dive deeper in this episode. 90% of Canadian tourists canceling US trips. Travel is no longer just about vacation. It's now a political statement. Canadian tourists boycotting US travel. Every year, millions of Canadian tourists cross the border into the US, from Florida to New York, spending billions of dollars on travel services. However, this year, things have changed dramatically. According to the Old Orchard Beach Tourism Council, Canada accounts for 40% of the tourists in the area. But this year, that number has sharply dropped. Hotel owners like Sterling Morse in Maine report that over 90% of their Canadian customers have cancelled their trips, causing severe losses for local businesses. These numbers reflect a major disruption in the tourism industry, especially since Canadian tourists have been a stable source of income for many regions. This is not only impacting the economy, but also weakening the economic relationship between the two neighboring countries. So, why is this happening? Trade tensions and hostile rhetoric between politicians have led to this shift. This is not just about a tourism boycott, but a clear expression of national pride. For many Canadians, traveling to the US is not just for fun. It's a recognition of a peaceful and respectful relationship. The tensions in international relations have eroded these values, leading to the decision not to travel to the US as a way of protesting the administration's policies. This is also a signal that countries will no longer tolerate decisions that can harm mutual respect. Wide-ranging economic impact. According to the Maine Tourism Council report, Canadian tourists contribute about $1.2 billion annually to the local economy. Each Canadian tourist spends not only at resorts, but also in shops, restaurants and attractions. This boycott could force many businesses to close or scale down operations during the tourist season. This issue isn't just affecting the tourism industry. Other industries like transportation, lodging services and retail stores are also being hit hard. Businesses may need to find replacement customers or accept declining profits while costs remain unchanged. In the midst of a struggling economy, the absence of Canadian tourists not only reduces revenue, but also puts small businesses at risk of closure, deepening the economic crisis in the region. This isn't just tourism. It's a political statement. So, is tourism still just tourism? It's time we realize that tourism can now be a powerful tool for political statements. When people choose to boycott a country not because they dislike the tourist attractions, but because of that country's policies and statements, it becomes a lesson in national pride. It's also a lesson in respect within international relations. When a country decides to stop cooperating on tourism and consumption, it's not just about dissatisfaction, but a form of resistance to actions that could harm their values and sovereignty. It also shows that tourism isn't just about moving from one country to another, but now it's a part of soft power strategy. The Canadians are teaching the US an important lesson in self-respect and respect. How will international relations change after this event? Will we see other countries adopt a similar strategy, using tourism as a tool to express dissatisfaction with the policies of other nations?
