 Hey everyone, today we're talking about one of my favorite tool, all-time favorite tool, for prepping the permanent beds here in the market garden and we're talking about the tilter. The tilter is just a perfect tool to prepare your seed beds because in a no-till system where we're not wanting to inverse the layers, we're not wanting to prepare our beds by using a tiller or deep down tilling, we want to have a tool that can surface cultivate to finally prepare your seed beds, level it down, mix the amendments in the top inch and this is the perfect tool to do that. It is powered by a drill, it is 15 inch wide so you can go back and forth and do 30 inch in two pass and it's lightweight, you can carry it all around. It was designed and developed to work on a permanent 30 inch bed system in a no-till approach. So I started to use the tilter around 2006-2007, so many many moons ago and I think, was it last year, Johnny's came up with a new model, lots of improvements, it's definitely a new tool in my opinion, just like it's better adapted to put your drill, they've changed a lot of the mechanisms here, it used to clog a lot when you would get rocks, now it doesn't anymore, it's just easier to maneuver, it just feels better. A little improvements, but they make a big difference and so really enjoying using this tool and for anyone that's out there that is working on a 30 inch bed system that is in a no-till approach, this tool is a great companion to the broad fork. The broad fork allows you to go deep and this one allows you to, you know, mix your amendments in the top inch, finely prepare your seed bed, it's going to be perfect companion if you're using a seeder or if you want to have fluffy soil to transplant into. Now let's use it and I'll explain why this is such a game changer. So what it does is that it prepares the top inch, top two inch of the soil and that's what you want in a no-till system, you know, you don't need to go deep, you just need to have the top inch kind of mixed in because you're going to be putting compost or amendments and that's really it and this tool does that. It finely, it mixes the amendments, it kind of loosens the top inch and it allows you to have a good tilt. Not sure if everyone understands this well but when you're using a seeder and you know you want your seeds to properly germinate, it's really important that the seeds have a good seed to soil contact and that's why having soil that's kind of most, you know, refined on the top, not in the bottom but on the top, this is really helpful for that. So, you know, the tilter will allow you to break all the big aggregates, the big clumps and it's just going to neatly prepare your soil and then whenever you'll be passing with a seeder, it's going to be much, much easier, much better. And so having a really nicely prepared seed bed makes a big difference in many ways. I always say that the seedlings or the seeding will be as successful as nicely you've prepared your seed bed. So that tool does that. The last thing is always to come up with a rake, you know, take the last rocks out, level everything out nice and then you'll go in with a seeder. But the tilter, man, it's hard to beat to prepare a seed bed. It's really a A1 tool. The other cool feature of the tilter is the price. Like for the price that you pay compared to let's say two wheel tractor, it's a fraction of it. So if you're a beginning farmer or if you're, you know, your market garden is still pretty small, that's such a great introductory tool. But even for someone like me, like I use the tilter a lot because it's practical. I can use it in the greenhouse in tight spaces. If I were to use another tool to try and work here, it'd be complicated and it wouldn't work. So in many instances, this is just like the perfect, perfect fit for tight spaces, small acreage, you know, market gardens or even home gardens. Like if you have a home garden at home, this tool is just like, it's sweet because it works in smaller, in compact environments. One of the neat feature that was in the original design and that's why this was so clever, but the tilter, you can also offset the handlebars. So the handlebars are offset, so you can really work the bed without stepping into them. You'll be walking in your pathways and you can just drive up the bed. You're doing a nice 15 inch pass one way, then you'll do a 15 inch pass. The other way that's going to be 30 inch and then it, so you can, you can really adjust it if you're a lefty or a righty. And so that's, you know, it sounds really simple, but that was the original reason why I thought this tool was so great. It allowed you to prepare the beds without stepping into them. One of the nice little features that Johnny's made in this improvement is that they've added discussion here when you want to carry it and this little handlebar to pick it up. So it's really easy to carry around. We'll go in the greenhouse right now. So easy to carry, so lightweight, and that's one of the main reasons why this tool is in my tool shed, because it's more practical in many instances to just grab this, do your bed, and then that's done. And depending on the size of the garden, you know, the BCS, let's say I'm preparing a whole field block, I'll use the two-wheel tractor. It's going to be more convenient. But in many instances, I'm just using the tilter and just like fast, fast efficient way to get to where I want to go and do my bed prep. So another feature that's really cool is that, you know, sometimes, especially in the spring, soils are moist or they're on the wet side and even coming with a two-wheel tractor might really compress them or even kind of like build compaction on them. The tilter, it'll never happen. It's always lightweight. So when the soils are on kind of the wet side, you can come in with a tilter and still use it. And, you know, that happens. Like sometimes with our calendars, we need to plant. We're on a tight schedule. And so that's in many instances is my tool of choice when soils are just on the wet side. So honestly, friends, there's really nothing like it. The tilter is such a great tool. And I have to say that these new features that Johnny's has developed, they're epic. The tool is much better now. It just feels that there's more torque. The little features of just being able to just like move it around easier and faster. The new gear system, all in all, is just perfect. And for the price, it's definitely worth it. So that's it for this week.
