Howto & Style
 This is the double cup method, which is the best way to grow healthy tomato and pepper seedlings. As the name implies, this method uses two red solo cups to plant your seedlings in. The first cup contains dirt for the seedling, and we cut slits in the bottom of the cup for its roots to grow through. The second cup we leave whole. We place a pebble in the bottom of the cup, in this case I just used a piece of gravel, and then we add a small amount of hydroponic nutrient solution. As this cup sits in the cup with the solution, the roots can grow through and access the nutrient solution. These seedlings really take off once the roots access this nutrient solution. Also, it has another advantage because the pebble provides an air gap between the bottom of the inner cup and the surface of the solution, so the soil in the cups is actually very dry, which helps deter pests and diseases. That way the double cup is a win-win.
