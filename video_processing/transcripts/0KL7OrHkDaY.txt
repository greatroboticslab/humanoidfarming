 Music It's a competitive environment we're in in potatoes and you have to cut costs and increase efficiency wherever you can. Music We were digging 12 rows and we were using 8 sets of diggers and our target was to dig 4 to 450 acres a day with those 8 systems. And when we switched to this system with 2 6 row windrowers and 1 4 row harvester and the increased speed and capacity, we just cut our diggers in half. So we went to half as many tractors, half as many operators. That was probably the most significant increase that I saw that I didn't think we could get by with only half as much equipment. But we're actually digging more now than we did when we had 8 diggers with the previous system. Music The truck drivers have a habit of getting lost sometimes and with 8 different harvesters in the field, there were more opportunities to get lost. Now they're more focused knowing where they're supposed to be and when they're supposed to be there and the rotation works a lot easier. So there aren't as many trucks waiting in the field some of the time and then waiting at the cellar the rest of the time. Music Well the design of the machine is a little higher capacity and a little higher speed. I was concerned that we might pick up some brews and we did that but actually it helped our brews. We've significantly reduced our brews because the machines stay fuller, less drops with only half as many machines so that naturally helps. But probably the thing that surprised me the most was we were able to cut about a half a dozen trucks out of our system. By not having so many locations where a harvester needed a truck, the trucks became more efficient. So I was able to cut 5 or 6 trucks and drivers out and those that are driving know to be in the right place at the right time. They get into a rotation that they just become more efficient. Music I've been amazed how efficient they are at not wasting potatoes. We don't have potatoes slobbering over the sides, they don't go over the back, over the vine chain. It might not seem like a lot but it sure makes you feel better not to see all those potatoes laying in the field. When you get done. Music Well I felt it saved me money in a lot of ways. Naturally having to have only half as many tractors in the field was probably the biggest and greatest savings. Big savings on labor. But the other thing that I didn't really count on is I was able to cut 3 or 4 days out of my harvest time. By cutting 3 or 4 days out of my harvest time I can let the crop grow that extra 3 or 4 days. Get a little better yield. It might not work that way every year but it gives me a lot more control knowing that I can complete harvest quicker. So between labor, fuel, equipment costs, it's a great way to get it to get it to get it to get it. Music I've been very pleased with the system and have recommended it several times. Sometimes you don't like to be one of the first ones to get the bugs worked out but Sputnik has worked very well. If they have any kind of an issue on improving it, they're ahead of the curve. Then they're fair to fix it and do the updates you need to so you always have the best equipment. Music My name's Carl Taylor from Taylor Farms in Idaho Falls, Idaho.
