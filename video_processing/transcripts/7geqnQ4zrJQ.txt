 Plant-based milk brands are churning up the global dairy business with a surge in sales, investment and new products coming to market. The plant-derived dairy trade is now worth an estimated $17 billion worldwide. Growing consumer demand has boosted investment. According to data firm Dealroom, venture capital funding across the plant-based dairy and eggs sector has skyrocketed from $64 million in 2015 to $1.6 billion in 2020. The world's biggest food company, Nestle, recently launched its first international plant-based dairy brand, a cow's milk substitute made from yellow peas. Wonder will come in a variety of flavours, competing with established brands like Oatly, oat-based milk. Founded in Sweden in the 1990s, that company is now valued at around $15 billion. Demand for alternatives to soya, which once dominated the dairy-free market, continues to escalate. In the West, sales for other plant-based milks, including oat, cashew, coconut, hemp and other seeds, overtook soya back in 2014. Since then, they've raced ahead to be worth almost three times as much as soya products, with a combined projected value of more than $5 billion in sales by 2022.

The average 100 milliliter glass of cow's milk contains three grams of protein, compared to 2.2 grams in pea milk and just one gram in oat-based substitutes. Dairy producers have also won a legal bid preventing vegan competitors in the EU from calling their products milk and yogurt. Despite their growing popularity, plant-based brands are a long way from displacing conventional milk products. Their current $17 billion turnover is still a drop in the pale compared with the traditional cattle-based dairy trade, which is worth an estimated $650 billion worldwide. is concerned that many thousand businessmen将 flight factors 100 g were approached between public crude oil and different markets.
