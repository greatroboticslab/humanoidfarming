The show is going to actually start tomorrow and then it'll conclude itself on Thursday so today we're going to kind of look around Cleveland we're going to go visit some garden centers so if you want to strap your shoes on let's go. All right guys we are here in Avon Ohio at Petiti's Garden Center I've seen this one in Garden Center Mag supposed to they have like a chain of them I'm not exactly sure if they're just in the state of Ohio or up here in the north but we're going to go check them out right now. This is a cool idea you guys you got your bale of hay your pumpkin your mom and a corn stalk 39 bucks. Beautiful entrance here. What is this? It's like Carolina Sweetheart I think redbud yeah I gotta be. All the mums up here they're a good bit cooler than we are back home so they're kind of beating us into the fall season a little bit. Whoa. Y'all check out this retail space man they've got retail space for days lots of natural light coming in through this gazebo style retail center all your fall stuff and Halloween stuff over here this is cool. Chad look at the size of the day. Chad look at the size of this umbrella dude. That's a big one. Jeez. Santa Claus is already here. Yeah Santa's already chilling in the hot tub. Nice. Chillaxing. Yeah this space is pretty incredible. Love this flooring too. I think I watched them do this floor in the driveway. Yeah. It's actually permeable. Oh yeah. Probably like just exposed aggregate but then it may have that sand like that polysand. Yeah they screed it in. And then water can go through it. Smoothed out. It looks good. Can't hear it. Got a nice little kid's section right here. Got a little bit of everything don't they? Candles are kind of a lost heart I think. Yeah. I mean in this form. Yeah in the Yeah like It's all the jar stuff but Need some grassroots honey. They do need some grassroots honey. We'll have to send them some. Hell we need some grassroots honey. I gotta get robbed of bees when we get home. Belt on the phone. Yeah. Cheers. Got all your different relishes and some canned goods and stuff. I like how they kind of got the Christmas stuff kind of segregated by like color and theme a little bit. It's not all in one area like that. Back there was all the bluish type stuff. And then over here you got more of the all white snowy festive kind of stuff. So we're very close to the lake aren't we? Yeah I could see the lake from my hotel room. Lake Viewer. I don't know if you could or not. Looking downtown. I paid extra and got Lake View. And they got a good bit of clothing type stuff up here too. Got you a little customer service area where we just talked to the fine folks here and make sure it was okay that we film a little bit. A couple little checkout lanes. Let's go see over here. Over like about birding area. Chad here's that Bobak stuff. The repellent. Are we carrying that now? Do you think we got it? I think we got it in too. Supposed to be really good at keeping animals away. There's all your Spoma Biotone stuff. Captain Jack's Deadbug Neem Oil products. Little seed display area. Bulbs. They probably can grow tulips a lot better. Up here in their colder environment than we can back home. That's for sure. Up here. Okay. We take some Fayette's Deadbug News. Wow, this place is massive y'all. I'm not going to lie, I'm really, really jealous right now. Look at the size of this place. Some nice fall planters already potted up. You just grab them and go. Beautiful seed I'm blooming. Selosia and of course mums everywhere. Wow, this place is incredible. Just goes and goes and goes man. They got overhead watering. You see they got some shade cloth strung up over the stuff that needs a little more shade like your ferns and hostas. And they beat us to the pumpkins. Me and Cam got to go soon to the farmer's market and get our pumpkins to bring back to grassroots. But man, they're in the mecca up here. Like most of the pumpkins that we buy at our local farmer's market back in Columbia, South Carolina are actually grown up here in Ohio. With their cooler weather they can just grow a lot better quality pumpkins up here than we can back home. And mums for days and days and days. All different colors. This place is cool. That's pretty cool. And since we are by the lake, they got them a nice little sailboat display up here. What is this plant? Y'all know I love anything variegated. Oh, Lakothui. Variegated Lakothui. I like that. I don't do all that great back home. Hydrangeas look good. Ours are pretty much dying out right about now. They're tired of the long, hot summer. Yeah, they've got red buds everywhere. Probably rising sun. Rising sun. They kind of lose their color this late in the season. In the spring and early summer, they're absolutely gorgeous. But they kind of fade back. Oh, that's hearts of gold? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I think that's a newer one. We see them smaller and they leave smaller. Yeah. This place is awesome, man. Let's go out here. Yeah, we'll go out here for a minute. How's it going, bud? This place just goes and goes and goes. Yeah, they're a big deal up here, man. Everything's laid out so nice, too. All the beds have got gravel in them for drainage. Nice big sidewalks. And you know you're on a garden center when you can't even shop at somebody else's without standing plants back upright. It's been so windy lately. All of ours are blown over, too, back home. What if they use this pond water for irrigation? I was going to walk over here and look. I bet so. Yeah, I would assume they're probably using that water for irrigation, bud. Weeping cedars. What are they? Chamaciparis. So this is a false cypress cultivar of some sort. They're going to have a lot of evergreens up here that we just can't grow back home. Too hot, man. A lot of drift roses. There's tons and tons of stuff out here. They got it set up right, though, man. There's a flamethrower. Yep. Yeah, they got a lot of redbuds up there. There's a Weepin' that's probably Golden Falls down there next. Yeah, redodendrons are probably... Hey, this is the one I just planted. Nova Zimbla. This is the one we found in the landfill. I just planted that one in the yard. I had to save it from the landfill. We'll have to see if it survives. Pretty impressive place, though. And they got a really cool tarp or covering system right here so they can open or close it as necessary. Some knockout roses. Tons of big proven winner. Panical hydrangeas. You got to see which hydrangeas this one. A little quick fire. Oh, man. There's hold their color. This pinkish color way better up here since it's cooler. They do turn pink, but they fade to brown a lot quicker in our heat and humidity. This place is just really incredible, you guys. I don't know how many acres this garden center sets on, but it is massive. This has got to be limelight or either little, yeah, little lime. Look at those blooms, man. You got limelight at your house, right? Your big old massive ones? Yeah, that's a little one, huh? Yeah, this is little lime. That's damn near full grown. Mm-hmm. They'll probably get a few more feet on it. I think they're probably five. Three to five. Yeah, five footers. Yeah, it is considered a dwarf compared to mine. Yeah, yours are freaking 12 foot tall. We're going to head to another garden center, bud? Yes, sir. Okay. Cool. These are bigger than 18 and more, I guess. It's a three and a half. So that's an interesting herb. That's nice. Nice size herb, yeah. Give us. Yeah, I'm pretty sure as big as this. They grow everything. This business is. They grow a lot of their own stuff, if not everything. Which one we're going to head to next, bud? Remember the name of it? The next one is called something kind of unique. Brimic. Brimic? Brimic Garden Center. Chesterland, Ohio. Chesterland, all right. All right, guys. Well, we're going to head on to the next garden center here. But now here at Petiti's, this is just, this is phenomenal. Super jealous of just the amount of space they got under roof. Concrete floors everywhere. Pretty dang impressive. So let's continue the tour. Let's go see what the next one is. Okay. But first, we've got to get us a little something to eat. This is 4th Street, right? Yeah. Back downtown Cleveland? Upland. Really nice, man. And they've got baskets every which of where. Restaurant after restaurant. So we've got to find which one we're going to eat at. Hey, how's it going? Good. Thank you, sir. So we found this place, Blue Agave. I've got the Tinga Tacos, which is the chicken tacos. Some Mexican rice. We've got the queso and salsa and guac sampler. Chad got the carne asada tacos. Coconut margarita. Got me a cold Victoria. Time to do work. So I'm probably going to get in trouble, but I've been feeding these little birds. Now we've got like a whole family that lives over here by our table. Y'all, I am so full. After that lunch, it was delicious. But we can't get tired now. We're at Brimmick Nursery in Chesterland, Ohio. And this place looks awesome. So as soon as you come in the main entrance right here, I mean, you're just blown away with the statuary. They've got a pond house up here. They've got a greenhouse with tropical house plants. Huge nursery. We're going to have fun here, guys. Look at the size of this eagle, man. They have got some really, really cool statuary. They're going to close in about an hour. So we're going to do us. Oh, I love that. We're going to do us a quick little walk through. I say let's head into the pond shop first. And then we'll head down to the greenhouse area. And then maybe if we talk nice enough to them, they'll give us a golf cart ride back down through the nursery. All sorts of stuff. So here is going to be all of your pumps and your aquascape products. All the stuff for your koi ponds. Our buddy Ethan with Amy and Corner Ponds would love a little shop like this. That's for sure. How's it going today, bud? Good. Here from the BFG show? Yep. Where are you from? Augusta, Georgia. Okay. What company? Grassroots. Okay. Nice. First time here? First time is. It's awesome. Sean sent you over here? Um, actually we just Googled it. Something hooking up stuff? Yeah. Cool. And found yourself. Nice. Well, thanks for stopping. Appreciate you having us, buddy. This is cool. This will look awesome around the pond. They got blue glass. Little smaller chips down here. Go out to the stonyard yet? The pottery? Not yet. Just got here. Yeah, I'll take you on the golf cart. Okay. We'll go in just a little bit. I'm going to go inside the greenhouse real quick. Okay. I like this place, man. Everybody's super friendly and nice. We met a couple of the workers here. And they welcomed us to film. And it's just, this place is fantastic. How you doing today, man? Good. How are you? Good, thanks. Thank you, man. And of course, they got all their moms out here on display. They look really healthy. Tons of different colors. But where I really want to go right now. Is inside this greenhouse. Because y'all know. I love me some house plants. Oh, wow. Check this place out, guys. All the succulents. We got some pansies over there in the center. Oh, we got some mangaves down here, too, I think. We've planted a few of these in the yard. Yeah, this one was Mission to Mars. Don't have that one yet. But the mangaves have been one of the only things that the deer haven't eaten. Got some bromeliads down in the bottom. Cactus. Some nice big cactus there. Got some huge dracaeus back here in the back. Ponytail palms. Some ZZs. What you done found, Miss Mildred? That's you right there all day long. It's a Thai constellation. Yeah. Y'all got any elbows? No, we don't. No elbows? We just have a... The Thai. So, this is Miss Mildred. I told you I was going to put you on the YouTube channel. Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. Miss Mildred was our Uber driver out here. And fellow avid garden lover. Yes. I told you I was going to put you on here. I'm so excited. It's fun, it's fun, it's fun. You see what I'm attracting to. I know it. You said you like the monsteras. You had to come find the most expensive one in here too, didn't you? What? What? What? I know. I can't afford it. They're beautiful though. It is beautiful. Y'all's greenhouse looks awesome. Thank you. Yeah. I love it. I love it so much. Yeah. It's in the corner. I've been over there for a while. This is my second time in. Okay. You're out. They got a little bit of everything out here in this greenhouse, you guys. Calatheas, alocasias, philodendrons, you name it. They got it. No way. That's cool. Look what they did with this big, huge fountain. Did a big sedum planter in there. We got some Australian tree ferns. Giant ficus. I love how this greenhouse is laid out. And it's also just like really bright, nice and clean. Very well displayed. Everything looks awesome. Hey, they even got a little mini straw bales. I've never seen that before. So, Miss Mildred, as I just said, she was our Uber driver out here. Such a sweet lady. Been gardening all her life. She's from Cleveland. She's never been to this garden center. So, I was like, hey, why don't you jump out and come check it out with us? So, she's in hog heaven right now. They said they had a tornado come through not too long ago. So, one of the greenhouses, I think it was over there, plastic was all torn off. I think they're doing a little bit of construction down here. Looks like probably their maintenance shed down here. Oh, check this out. No way. Look at all these bubbling boulders, I guess is what you would call them. That is so cool. Look at that one in the middle. Almost like a huge slab of marble. Wow. This place is nuts, you guys. Yeah, I mean, check out some of the rock sculptures they have. That is wicked right there. Some nice specimen trees planted all along the side. Oh, there's some of that blue glass we saw earlier at the bottom of that bubbling vase. Definitely have got some of the most unique water features I've ever seen. Never seen anything quite like this, y'all. The fountain studio. Let's go down in here and check this out. Good gracious at the fountains. Wow. I hope the microphone does the sound justice down here. Because there's like a hundred running fountains down here. Okay. Yep. We have definitely got some work to do when we get home. Because this is incredible. I mean, there's just fountains literally everywhere. Okay. All the pottery. Everything is just laid out so beautifully. Giant mushroom over here. I tell you what, if you can't find a fountain that you like in this place, then I don't think it's made. Oh, check this one out. That is so cool. I've only seen one of these like huge ones up at Ripley's, believe it or not, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You could actually push it out on the sidewalk. The much smaller version, but the light, I bet that looks incredible at nighttime. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Here's this, a big happy Buddha hand carved from grade one marble. Boy, I bet that took some time. This place is nuts. So yeah, we've got a lot of work to do when we get home because this just, I'm so envious of the setup right here. But that's why I love coming to these different garden centers is because you can get all these great ideas. You know, see how other people do it. And these guys are obviously professionals and get some really good ideas of layouts for back home at our garden center. We're going to be able to go to the garden center. Here's some of the garden center. People have to go to the garden center. I love it. Yeah, I love that place. I could stay down there all day. Somebody needs to take a tour ride around in the golf cart. Yeah, ready? We'll go out to the stone yard and counter it. All right, let's go. I'm on my way to the stone yard. Can you bring the snippers for that metal band? Yes, I can. Okay, I'm going to take her to get a car. I'm going to hire her to get out of here. I dropped you off of the car. All right. Here's the guy. Because you're here, right? Yep. I'm the manager of the pine shop, fountain studio, stone yard, statuary and pottery. Did you set that fountain studio up? Yep. That looks incredible, man. You did a fantastic job on that, dude. Yeah, we got a lot of construction going on because we had hurricanes up here. Yeah, tornadoes come through right there, say. Five? And we're sealing the driveway, so just a lot of stuff going on. Stuff. Now here's all our pottery. Man! That is crazy. Getting ready to order some more. Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Now is fall a decent time for you guys? Or spring obviously? Yeah, this is kind of that in between. People are buying fall stuff. Right. But we'll be hitting hard here in the next couple of weeks. The weather's been great too. It's beautiful today. Yeah. It's been like that here. Yeah. You're lucky. It's been hotter than Hades back then. I'm good. I'm good on that. Yeah, you're good on this golf park too. I would've hit those pots right there. I would've hit those pots right there. Get those pies close. And then... Wow, look at the size of this. And then... Wow, look at the size of some of these. Yeah, so these are all concrete. These are by Jackson Cast Stone. Okay. They're, you know, a hundred thousands of pounds. Whoa. But they're rated up to 7,000 PSI. Nice. Like a power plant. So you should be able to weed them out all year long. Okay. Don't have to worry about them freezing and cracking. Alright. Here we've got our whole stone yard here. Yep. We're actually going to a show up in EA here. Open house. Okay. To pick out more. So, kind of letting it live it down a little bit. There we go. Still got way more inventory than we got back home, man. I'll tell you what, this is... The whole place is just impressive. Yeah, and everything we have here is natural stone. We don't do the pavers and all that. Okay. So, everything we sell here. They have like a little salt area back here. Okay. And then we have somebody let, you know, they come out and dump manure here. I see. You want to make compost? We make our own everything, yeah. Top soil. We call it a bed mix. Beautiful. Yeah. So they just made that yesterday. Okay. And then we have everything. Blue stone. We have like pick me piles you can pick from. Your regular blue stone pallets. Now how do you do your pick me piles? Because they, it's been kind of a pain in the foot. Well, we just tell them it's 40 cents a pound. Yeah. And they go, what? I go, well, you start digging it and we go wait and you go, oh, that's too much. And that's why it's 40 cents a pound. That's why it's 40 cents a pound. That's right. And then we have this, this stuff's usually called the Pond Shop. It's called, we call it a $1.49 stone. Okay. So it's $1.49 a pound. Gotcha. Or decorative. And so do, what do folks put it in? Like fish tanks or around the bags? No, no. I mean, as far as when they're purchasing it. So we tell them either to bring their own buckets or we have tree buckets. We don't give them away because they never come back. Right. Yeah. We dump them in there. Okay. Similar to what we do. But this stuff sells like eye caves. Yeah. Y'all got some beautiful stuff. Like some really, really unique. And that's the thing too. People come here to buy stuff or they'll come back the next day and it's gone. Right. That's how it is here. You got to get it while it's getting good. That's it. We just sold that fountain and installed it yesterday. Wow. Yeah. So we do all the installs and deliveries and all that. Whole nine yards. We do it all. I love it. Okay. We'll talk to you. Okay. Bye. Check his pockets before he leaves. Yeah. So this is our garden. We kind of show people the stuff we could do. Oh man. Look at this outdoor living space right here. I need this at the house, Jeremy. Yeah. Me too. Yeah. I need y'all to deliver it down to Georgia, install, everything. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. The total package. The base we just put in. Oh yeah. This is by Atlantic Water Gardens. It's actually brass. Oh really? If you listen to it, it echoes. Hear the water like. Oh yeah. That's actually brass. Wow. That is cool. I love that blue glass man. I want to light it up. Yeah. That's beautiful. We got a little older water feature that we've had back here for a long time. But a little pondless water palm. Yeah. We got you a little Japanese maple up at the top. Dude, this is really nice. We used to have parties back here. We used to have cold water throwing and cooling and stuff. Oh right. We used to do our parties back there. I don't blame you one bit, dude. And yeah, come up here, you can see the property. Okay. Mostly. Sweet. We love behind the scenes stuff, man. And we make our own mulch. Do you? Okay. We make mulch back home too. We let the landscapers come here and dump their, you know, flippings and stuff and then we turn it into mulch. Beautiful. Hey, yeah. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're here. Cool. Hey, yeah. You got quite a bit of it, don't you? That's about half of what it is, Liz. Yeah. Oh, wow. Cool, man. So it pretty much goes to that white house over there in the corner and then we're still adding right now to the back. Man, this place is massive, dude. I figured you can't really see it for now. No, I'm glad you let us come up here and check it out. This place. Wow. This is, is that your irrigation pond back there, Jeremy? That's the main one. Yeah, see the new shed there? Yeah. That's where we got all our pumps and everything and then we just added a pump to that pond because we made that one bigger. Okay. There's three. There's one up top. Alright. Now, do y'all, you, how do you get your water into the pond? Because obviously you go through a bunch of water. Yeah, well, hopefully it rains, but that one connects to this one, gravity. Okay. We have a valve on it. And now we actually are making this one so we could actually pump it back. Gotcha. For when we need it. So we just made that one bigger and now we're making it bigger again. Because right now we're running out of water. Gotta have water, man. That's it. This is truly amazing, dude. I love it. And it just keeps going. And y'all got four of these. Yeah, well this is the main store. This is the home base. The other ones are about 15, 20, 20 so minutes from here. Okay. I'm on my way. Yeah, and the other ones are all their own little niches. You know what I mean? His wife's store is in Concord like 15 minutes from here. Yeah. She's got like a boutique. Okay. See if you take people. Is this your people? Yeah, that's one of my people. Show them the gardens. Yeah. But, um, yeah, she has like a boutique out there. So she sells purses and jewelry and people love it. Yeah. They go out there just for that. But all the other ones are a lot of fun. Hey, you losers can't come up here. This is part of the VIP tour. That's it. We got drinks, cocktails. Y'all stay down there. That's why I told her I said I wanted to smell it for miles. That's it. He knows. He's asking where the stake is. Yeah, and then we have meetings in here. Okay. And then that's the architect, the design team's in there. Wow. So every Monday all the managers come over from the stores and we go over all the numbers. Okay. See what to put on sale and what's going on. Y'all got it going on, buddy. It's cold. It's cold time. I bet springtime is absolutely nuts. You can't even, yeah, you can't even think. And then over here we have an artist that comes here. She's in our department. She like will touch up any fountains that come in chipped or damaged. Yeah. Or like you've had a fountain at your house for 10 years and needs upkeeping. Or any statuary you see here. Oh really? That has color. She'll redo them, huh? Alright Jeremy, we're going to go get her car and bring it out now. Sounds good. I'll meet you there. Yeah, so this is like, this statue is just concrete. And she made it like that. These all fell over from the storm. Oh, gotcha. Yeah, she makes any color you could imagine. Man, that's really, that's really cool. That was just raw concrete and she did that. Oh man, she's talented. She's very good. But like this, people bring us like fountains that fall over or something falls into it. And she'll repair it, huh? Yeah. This is on the border, but yeah. It's our headless section. Yeah. And then we got our offices and then this is our shop, you know, mechanics. We got a couple mechanics. Right. And then up here, this is up so you real quick to get a meter. Yeah, you're going to get in trouble. We got a Pondliner over there. That's how we sell. That's our production barn. Okay. Now do you all do aquascape stuff? Some. Mostly Atlanta because it's right down the street here. Gotcha. This is all the Amish built this last year. It's really cool. Man, I love this handrail. Yeah. They all hand-eat all this stuff. How long you been here, Jeremy? This is five years now. Okay. This is what the garden center used to be. Just a house. Just a house and a greenhouse. Yeah, back when you bought it. Yeah. Wow. And then this is some of the jobs and place. A lot of the Landscape Ohio wards that we win. I can imagine. Some of the houses. I love the office layout, man. Yeah. This is really sweet. And then, you know, ponds and stuff. We do more projects of the years and stuff. Incredible, buddy. Yeah. And then that's our meeting room. And then, you know, where the architects do their thing. Design work. They got the best view in the house. Yeah, they sure do. Well, plenty of inspiration. Yeah. Right out the window. Right out the window. That's it. Man, thanks for showing us this. Sure. That's really cool. And we got all our clothing in here for uniforms and stuff like that. Yeah. All the apparel. That's it. Yeah, this is great. And then pottery, where you're from, you probably don't have to wrap yours, do you? Nope. Yeah, we got a string wrap and like a boat, so that's coming up. I gotta go to all the stores and wrap it all up. Oh, man. That takes some time. Yeah. How long are y'all up here? What gardening zone? Six? Six or seven. Something like that. Yeah. So we're 8B. 8B? Yeah, back home. You get a little lucky. Yeah. Well, you better go for you to get in trouble, man. Yeah, I'm gonna go. You don't even know where you're at. I do. I'm gonna try to find my group. Oh, there they go. I'm gonna go chase them down. Did you guys make it into the tropical house? I think so. No, I haven't made it. I haven't been in that one yet. I'm gonna go check it out now. Appreciate your time, dude. See ya. Everybody is just so incredibly friendly here. And I lied. I got turned around. We have been in the tropical house. So now we're gonna head back over here. I want to check out the shrub section and see what else we can check out before they close. So we got car-napped again. So we were riding around with Jeremy. Jeremy. Now we're riding around with Miss Susan, who's gonna take us to the back 40 and show us what we're gonna look at. We're gonna look at our pond system. Okay. Japanese maples. Awesome. I guess you have a lot of Japanese maples. Yeah, I may or may not be addicted to Japanese maples. Oh, okay. We have a family that's definitely addicted to Japanese maples. I love them. Here's just a few. Whoa! Sweet! I'm in heaven. There you go. Oh, this is so cool. This is our pond. Our main pond. This is our pond. Yeah, that's what Jeremy, he was just telling us a little bit about it. He said that y'all have three of them that are kind of connected. Right. We have a canal system, buddy. Alright. That we use, we pool water from there. Yeah. And we put it in there and then we can use that to water all our pots. Nice. And so then I'm assuming too the runoff flows. It looks like it's natural. It flows right back to the pond. Yeah. And all these go back into our pots. Irrigation pots. Now we have three pots. Here's some more Jack Moose Gables. Good gracious. We kind of have them separated. These are blood goods. I think I saw Twombly right here. Oh yeah, Twombly's Red Sentinel. Yeah. It's got Red Sentinel here. A lot of blood goods. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Twombly's Red Sentinel here. A lot of blood goods. We have a lot of blood. I like this. Yeah, I like this one. Yeah. And I like this one. Yeah. I like this one. I like this one. Yeah. I kind of, I don't know, I got introduced into Japanese maples, I guess 20 something years ago. I just, I just absolutely love them. But you know, we're in zone 8B. So they don't, you know, you have to be selective about where you plant them because they like to burn. Yeah. Because it gets so, so hot July and August. Great. Wow. The mum house right now? This is one of them. I have several. This is a bum season for us. Oh yeah. As you can tell, we have a grower on staff that is amazing. She times everything just perfect. And these are nice and butted up. Aren't they? Looking pretty. Won't be long, they'll be done busted open. But you got a bunch back up at the retail center. Full, full color. We haven't seen anything yet. We have another. This is called Atlas II. Yeah. And this is filled with mums. Okay. Atlas Greenhouses. They are. I love Atlas. That is not. Okay. These two are. This is Atlas II. And this is Atlas I. Atlas I will have other things like cabbages that we sell. Okay. Other. Miscellaneous. Other cool season annuals. Yeah. And these are some of our perennials. Okay. I mean our bushes and shrubs. Gotcha. This place is so cool. This is like the dream of what I want to build. I say I work at the Disneyland of plants. You do work at the Disneyland of plants man. Beautiful. Every day I wake up I think wow I get to go back there again. Isn't that great? So my daddy always said, you know, if you do what you like for a living you'll never work a day. That's true. I love my life and that's how I feel when I come to a place like this. And even my own nursery. Although sometimes, you know, especially springtime. It's uh, you kind of second guess what in the world you got yourself into. That's true. Wow. Here's some, there's some sweet food here. Oh yeah, some more of your weepers. Yep. What is this? This is a dogwood tree. What? Yeah. It has the fruit that's actually edible. Yeah, I've never seen that. I've never seen that kind of fruit. I mean we have dogwoods back home but it's just your, you know, your Cornus Florida. Just your regular old. Well we have those too. But that one. That's a Cornus Cusa. Okay, that's a Cusa dogwood. I've never seen the fruit at all. Yeah. They have to be taken care of very well in order to fruit. And we take care of all of our plants. I can tell. That makes all the difference in the world is when your people that work here are plant nerds. I mean it shows in your quality of your plants. Oh my goodness. They're going too fast. I'm freaking out. No, you're good. I know you gotta go. Hey, what are these? Riosens? Yes. Love Riosens. And that's our whole pile over there. And there might be some more Japanese maples coming up. Yeah, I see them already. This is incredible. These are our grasses. Incredible. Some perennials that are in two gallons. Yep. And now? We're waiting for plants for us to either propagate them. Yep. Propagate them. Yep. We all use these cold frames as cold storage? Yeah, so all these will be covered with plastic. Okay. And until April, March. Here's some more base. Japanese maple is good. This is Japanese maple heaven. I know. This is beautiful. Here's some more. Gorgeous. I've been playing overload right now. Like I can't even talk. I just... I want to come up here and work for you during the summer. Now the winter time I'm going home. Yeah. Winter time I'm going home. That's fine. And we're adding three more huts over there just because we need them. Wow. Here's some of our things. Everything looks so good. Healthy. Yep. Here's another pond. I think we need some more water. Okay. This is one Jeremy was telling us. Y'all made bigger, but now you're making even bigger. Yeah. We just added... See that over there? Yep. And the water, I'm going to go over there. I'm going to go over there. I'm going to go over there. There's a little bit of water. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. I just added, see that over there? Yep. I just added that so that will be about, you know, $100 or $1,000. There it is. Nice. Is that Euonymous? Yes. And bright red. I love that plant. Yeah. Yeah. It's hard to find a prettier fall shrub than Euonymous. It's true. I mean, they look like they're on fire. Yep. I guess that's the burning bush, right? The burning bush. It's their common name. Yep. That's their common name. Yep. That's their common name. This is incredible, Ms. Susan. Do you have this stuff here? It really is. We have some bulk stuff here. Okay. And then, um, this is from a group. They do our design and mill. Okay. And install and... Y'all do install and maintenance? They do that. Okay. We're with the garden. I'm with the garden center. Gotcha. I just sell two, two, three, and trucks. You're a smart lady because... That's my lawn. Yeah. It's more jack maples. More jack maples. Goodness. And a pond. Just keep going and keep going. I know. Because that's not... What is that there? That's in case we have to lower something. Oh, that's your gate? Yeah. So they can drain the pond a little bit, FTP? Yeah. This is our inspiration garden. I'll take you there. Yeah, take me there. There's Japanese maples on the other side that you saw when we drove through. And this is professionally maintained. So that we have some place to show our customers if they want to see ground cover or a certain kind of plant. Oh, yeah. If we know it's in here, we can show our customers. Super smart. Uh-huh. And they can kind of get ideas of, okay, this is how much space we have in our backyard. Maybe we want to do a little something like this. Yep. So they can kind of see it in their mind. And we tell them, like, this right here used to be in full shade. And it's not now. It should be bright yellow. Yeah. Japanese forest grass. Right. It's not because the sun is bleaching it. Yep. So that's why you should always put a plant where it belongs. I agree. So that's one thing we did try to do with our nurseries. Put everything... Alright, if it's under the shade house, it needs shade. If it's out in full sun, it can take full sun. Right. Here's some more. Or maybe you can add some to a pick-up. A pick-up area for wholesale nurseries. Okay. Here's some more moms to be she can see it up. Beautiful. And tomorrow. Look at all the different... The different colors are incredible. Yeah. I've grown her as amazing. She grows 40,000 annual perennials a year. Yeah. And... Can I get a note? And 100,000 annuals. Annuals. 40,000 perennials and 100,000. 100,000 annuals. Wow. These are bad girls. But you can see our grounds are very maintained. Nice and maintained. Oh, they're gorgeous. But we can show a customer, you know, that's a certain kind of Japanese label. Right. This is what it'll look like in 10 years or so. Yeah. These are, you know, sweet William. Right. It makes a lot of difference when the customer can see it already in a little more mature state and kind of planted together. Yes. And then here we're back to... We call this the quad. Okay. And our customers come here first to see if we can, you know, if they need something in this area, which is normally anything that's blooming at the time. Yeah. Beautiful. Thank you, everyone.
