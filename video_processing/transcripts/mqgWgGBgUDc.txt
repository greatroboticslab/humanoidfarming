 Samson Wanamwa is a small scale farmer in Azigo sub-count in Kayunga district who has opted to undertake a lease of a tractor such to do better farming business. Realizing the subsistence nature, the peasantry nature of practices, I realized I could not go far. So I needed some equipment to help me, especially working with bigger acreage and so you may be able to get adequate stock for feed. A new leasing program fronted by Opportunity Bank and South African farm John Dairy will now offer small and medium scale farmers a chance to own a tractor. And we have at least one million dollars of tractor requests in the pipeline. So I can see the agreement being very successful so far and even more going forward. Qualifying farmers will enjoy a 10% interest rate over a 36 month repayment cycle. It's the first time that an alliance or a product has been developed specifically for that market segment to create access for financing. Because what we realized was to really improve food security and to upskill farmers you need to focus on that segment. A farmer in need of a tractor will also make a down payment of 20% of approximately 84 million which is the market price of their new equipment. You know it depends obviously on swell conditions but you know it can anything, it can vary between 10 hectares to about 50 hectares per day. Obviously like I said depending on ground conditions, the sort of equipment that the customer is using behind the tractor and a couple of things, external factors that weigh in on that as well. Turn around time in the farming calendar remains a critical challenge which adversely impacts on the value chain all bait without mechanization. Reina Orjan, NTV Business
