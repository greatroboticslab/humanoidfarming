 I want to introduce Natalie Lounsbury, our next speaker. Natalie is a PhD student at the University of New Hampshire and also a part-time vegetable farmer in Maine, so I'm not quite sure how that works, but she's a busy person. Natalie, before going back to New England, Natalie got her master's degree at University of Maryland, working with Ray Weil on no-till and vegetable crops, I believe, and she's going to talk about managing cover crops for ecosystem services and vegetable systems. Quick show of hands, farmers. All right, extension. All right, NRCS. Other. Okay, so I wasn't really sure. This is like cover crops 2.0 or 3.0. This is not, you know, intro to cover crops, and so I wasn't quite sure where to go with this talk, and I'm a baby PhD student. I don't have any data of my own to share or anything, so I sort of made it into a conceptual talk, so some of it's a little redundant or you could say reinforcing some of the things that other folks have already talked about today, so I may breeze over some of that. So, yeah, I did study, before I go on, I did study with Ray Weil, and Ray's a soil scientist, and now I'm at the University of New Hampshire working with Rich Smith, who's an agroecologist, and as I went back through this talk, I was like, oh my gosh, I wasn't really sure what an agroecologist was, but I feel like I'm becoming one. I can sort of sense that it's happening, so I'm being influenced. So, in a perfect world, just to set the stage, I know everybody knows this, but just to set the stage, agriculture would produce lots of healthy food forever. We would never have to worry about it. It wouldn't contaminate the air or water. It also wouldn't hurt wildlife with whom we'd coexist in harmony, right? It would be perfect, and it would be manageable for farmers. We wouldn't be breaking our backs. It wouldn't be a pain in the butt. We'd make money. It'd be great. So, that's in a perfect world. But then we wouldn't be here at the Doubletree in Linthicum, Maryland, and we wouldn't be here, where we still are seeing declining soil health, and we're sort of facing a problem with producing enough food sustainably for future generations. What I'm going to talk about today is agriculture and ecosystem services and disservices. This is a topic that was given to me. Jason asked me to talk about ecosystem services, and again, I was like, okay. But, and then the cover crop trade-offs and vegetable production, some innovative cover cropping that's happening. Ron really set the stage nicely for that, and he was kind of the pioneer in that area. And then visualizing ecosystem services and going forward. Mitch kind of touched on some of that already with the spider plots, and so that was a great introduction. I just thought that since you all are tasked with going back to your respective states and educating everybody else with cover crops on what they do, that would be kind of a way to wrap things up. So, ecosystem services and disservices. I'm forgetting everybody's names, but Rob. Yeah, presented that Swiss army knife and all the different tools, and I think it's fantastic, but the thing is not, cover crops don't just do good things, and I think we need to be honest about that. I think cover crops are a key part of sustainable agriculture, but they're also disservices. And so this ecosystem services model, I kind of like it. It is a, it's a thing, like it's defined. So ecosystem services are defined as four types of services. Provisioning services, which is just producing food, fuel, and fiber. In this case, I'm supposed to talk about vegetables, and that's kind of the big one. That's what everybody focuses on. Oh, I also wanted to say that ecosystem services wouldn't exist without people. This is all about us. This is about what the ecosystem, what the agro ecosystem, what the agro ecosystem can do for us. So, cultural, pretty landscapes, recreation, spiritual connections. You know, I might be tempted to say like, whatever, cultural. But these are actually pretty significant when you think about it. What makes people connect with agriculture? What makes people support agriculture? And then if you think about things like, okay, well, back in the day, people thought that bare soil was beautiful. We're changing that. We're changing that cultural service. And so if people start to think of, you know, different kinds of landscapes as being beautiful, then they may support different kinds of landscapes. So, supporting. This includes nutrient cycling, soil structure and fertility, biodiversity, pollination, habitat, and soil retention. So, these are cycling. The agro ecosystem both receives these services from the rest of the ecosystem and it provides some of these services in return. The flip side of service is disservice. And so, while an agro ecosystem may be preventing soil erosion, in some cases, if it's still allowing some soil erosion, then it's actually still causing a disservice. So, it's kind of this balance between services and disservices. Our management, our inputs, is what influences the balance of the service versus disservice. So, that includes rotations, tillage, cover crops, fertilizers, pesticides. There are some feedback loops between how these interact. And ultimately, I think we always need to keep this in mind. We do still live in a capitalist society. Your management inputs and your yields combine, or your management and your yields combine to make your profitability. And that's really important. So, the vegetable agro ecosystem is a little bit different than some of the other agro ecosystems that they're talking about in the other room. And I think in some ways, they're a little more complex. And so, not a lot of people, not as many people work in them. That could also be because, you know, we just don't produce as much calories. We don't cover the same amount of land. But they're different because we have really, generally, really diverse crops, which means we also have really diverse pests and diseases. Lots of tillage is common, which means that soils are often poorly aggregated and prone to erosion. But irrigation is also common, which means that, you know, Ron mentioned that he's irrigated cover crops before. So have I. So, irrigation is there. That's a tool that you can potentially use. Fertilizer and cover crop seed are not as big a percentage of the budget. So, these systems are often over-fertilized. That's kind of a food safety concerns with wildlife. This is something I don't like talking about because I think it's a pain. But it's a reality that we really need to address in vegetable systems that they don't have to deal with when they're talking about wheat and silage and the like. So, many crops need pollination. Many crops are small seeded. The use of plastic mulch is common. And folks are often land limited. Everybody thinks they're land limited, but vegetable growers definitely, sometimes they say, I want to grow five acres of vegetables. And so they buy a five acre farm. They really are land limited. Is the ecosystem services framework useful or is it just another buzzword? Like we go from one buzzword to the next. You started hearing ecosystem services a lot in probably the last decade since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Soil quality, soil health, that's changing. That could be another buzzword. I thought it was interesting that I've now seen, including mine, three definitions of soil health put up on the board. And they're all a little bit different. But what I did notice is that the NRCS soil health definition now includes humans. So it's kind of getting more at that ecosystem services part. And it mentions, you know, the vital living ecosystem. So I think NRCS soil health is moving a little bit towards this ecosystem services model. The basic concept of soil health and soil quality is that you can either sustain, get better, or degrade. If you put that, it's like super simple but super helpful to think about. So if you put that in the ecosystem services context, if you're degrading, those are services. If you're degrading, those are disservices. Ecosystem services as a framework does encompass farmers' goals. I snagged this from Chuck Moeller's crop rotation on organic farms. I know these aren't, you know, necessarily your average group of farmers. They're expert organic farmers. But so they came together and they came up with 21 goals of crop rotation. I took out a bunch because I thought 21 was too many. So I made this list of 10 or 11 and then kind of defined them in terms of what ecosystem service each one of these goals is or what category it falls into. So maintaining healthy soil, number one, definitely very important supporting service. But some other things that I want to point out, controlling diseases, controlling insects, very important regulating services. And then one, minimize off-farm inputs. That's a goal that doesn't really fall into an ecosystem service model, but it's interesting that it factors into farmer decision-making because ultimately we're talking about farmer decision-making, farm management practices. And then finally, I wanted to point out that refining the aesthetic quality of fields and farm is actually a goal that farmers came up with for their crop rotation, and that's a cultural ecosystem service. So these are important, all four categories of these ecosystem services. I think it's a good framework because it addresses realistic trade-offs, both the ecological and the economic trade-offs. Because really, farming is about minimizing risk. So intuitively, I think this is how farmers may already be thinking. It places individual services within the context of the whole system. A lot of the studies out there look at specific ecosystem services. And in fact, when Jason asked me, it was like, you know, pick from these ecosystem services. And so I was just like, erosion, you know, we'll talk about these ecosystem services. But then I thought, that's not the point. The point of the ecosystem services framework is to stack your ecosystem services to get multiple benefits out of the system. So, sorry, your program is wrong. I'm not talking about those things. But also, it already encompasses soil health. So it's a little bit broader than soil health. Like soil health, it's really hard to measure directly. This is a lot of moving parts. Hard to do research on this. How do cover crops affect ecosystem services and disservices? This is a kind of conceptual model that Ray and I have been using for a while. But because we were soil people, it was all underground. And then I just was like, oh, above ground stuff matters too. So I threw the pollinators, predators, and pests up there. But so unlike the Swiss Army knife of your toolbox, this is sort of just saying that cover crops affect everything. It could be positive, it could be negative, but they change. They change the system. So you have to decide how you want to change the system. And I think Mitch did a really good job presenting how you can make those decisions with respect to cover crop mixtures. Carbon sequestration in the air. Yeah, so that would fall under soil organic matter. Carbon dynamics. Carbon dynamics. Yeah. So yeah, carbon dynamics is really important. It's one ecosystem service that there has been a lot of attention on lately because of climate change. And I think that cover crops are doing a lot to change carbon cycling. Definitely there. And then, you know, to take that further, so you've got the total organic matter, then you've got this active organic matter fraction. That's going to affect your soil food web activity. Over time, your organic matter is going to affect your aggregate stability, which is going to affect erosion. It's going to affect water dynamics. So everything's connected. Everything interacts. And ultimately, we care about crop growth. We have to keep that in mind. Service versus disservice is kind of all about context. So sort of about the functional, temporal, and spatial niche that you're trying to fill with your specific system and cover crops. I'm not a nutrient management person, but I have heard people throw around this nutrient management, you know, rules, the four R's, the right product, the right time, the right place, and the right rate. And I think that that's completely applicable to cover cropping and cover crop decision making too. So as an example of the right product and the right time, on the left, we've got a fall seeded cover crop, fall seeded forage radish, which is really good at bio drilling, weed suppression, nutrient capture. So it does all these ecosystem services when it's fall seeded at the right time, at the right rate. But when it's spring seeded, it basically just flowers. And so you're still getting an ecosystem service. It's just a different ecosystem service. It may not be the one that you intended. So right product, right time, and then also right place. So again, forage radish, this is, you know, it's not perfect. Nothing is a silver bullet. And so when planted on slightly steeper soils, you still can get some fairly significant erosion in spring. And, you know, the saying goes, if you can see it, it's too much. I can definitely see this. It's too much. So I call that disservice. Although it is still, this is some data from Ray. Having radish is still better than having a tilled soil and no cover crop. Understanding multiple services. This is from a paper that Mitch referenced by the Penn State crew. So I'm not going to go through it. And I know those are really small. But it's one of the first papers to look at a suite of ecosystem services and the relationship of cover crops to those ecosystem services. And it highlights the need to increase our knowledge of the cover crop traits that drive the ecosystem services. And so good paper if you want to read it. Cover crops and ecosystem services and vegetable production. Like I said, vegetable production is a little bit different than growing grains. We have other things to consider. In particular, pollination, habitat, disease suppression, pest control, I think, are different. I do have a website. I have not updated. It's a blog. But you can check out notillveggies.org for more information on this case study. But I want to talk about the services versus disservices and then kind of the trump factors that you have to think about in vegetable production. So this is what I did for my master's. So we've got this forage radish. Captures all these deep nutrients. Brings them to the surface in its tissue. It dies. Then you've got this hole. And you've got all these nutrients hanging out in the soil surface. What happens to nutrients during winter and early spring? All right. I know I'm running through this really quick. But basically you get a slug of nutrients really early in spring, right when it warms up. In my case, we planted spring vegetables after it. They did great. We did it no-till. Ooh, that's not supposed to be like that. What this says is that on the service side on the left goes through all the services. So you get weed suppression. You get early mineralization of nutrients. But then you've got the disservices, which can be the same thing. Early mineralization of nutrients can be bad if you're not planting an early season crop. That can lead to environmental losses. The big circle thing over it is that in vegetable systems sometimes there's kind of a trump factor. And so when I would talk to farmers about implementing this system in their, or implementing this cover crop into their system, they're like, what about brassica pests and diseases? And they refused to use a brassica cover crop because they were scared about pests and diseases. And I don't have any data to say otherwise. I have anecdotes to say otherwise. But this is some harlequin bugs that came over from a mowed rape crop and attacked forage radish. This is kind of worst-case scenario. But the point I'm making here is that in vegetable systems, pests and diseases are, I would argue, more significant. And vegetable growers are more concerned about them because they have more diverse crops. So the soil health framework, although I think it's great, it doesn't address some vegetable-specific concerns that the ecosystem services framework does. Pollination. There's a great fact sheet that Sarah came out with. I think there's a copy in your bag. So the ecosystem services that are needed need habitat for pollinator nests. We need the population of pollinators. Provided, I don't know what I'm saying with this, but the ecosystem services are possible that these cover crops can be host to pests. And if you let them go to seed, they can become weeds. So in this case, Phacelia, which I really like as a cover crop, it's quite pretty. And bumblebees love it. I think it's maybe the most attractive cover crop to bumblebees. But on the flip side, it is a host to tarnish plant bug. So if you're a vegetable grower and you've got strawberries, then this is a problem. So I don't have the answers, but this is just an example. Habitat versus food safety. This photo of this little deer is from Carolyn Lowry in my lab. So the mama deers would leave their does in the cover crop because it was a nice, safe place for them, which is really cute, except that you also have this problem of lots of deer poop in the field. And, for example, if you're trying my system where you come in and no-till directly into that and you've got a pile of deer poop every 15 feet with food safety management, like, I don't know what to do. So you could till it under and pretend that there was never manure in there. But the reality is that wildlife loves cover crops. And this poses a particular or a unique question for vegetable production. I'm going to cruise through some strategies for reducing these tradeoffs. So these are kind of innovative, more innovative systems for using cover crops. This is from Ken Lang in Ontario. I met him at the Ecological Farmers of Ontario conference. And he got this idea from Eric and Ann Nordell, who got this idea from attending a field day at Steve Gross. So these things spread. So in this case, I guess you could say they're kind of planting their garlic greens. So just tilling a little strip, planting the garlic into it. These are winter-killed cover crops. So I think they planted them in August. Oats and peas. By late fall after the garlic planting, you can't tell that there are strips of garlic planted in there. And then I wanted to make sure that everybody knows that they got a really nice garlic crop. It was not a failure. This is a system they've been doing for years, and it works really well for them. And it makes it so they don't have to buy external inputs of straw, which is what a lot of garlic producers do. No-till early vegetables into winter-killed radish. This is what I worked on. Again, if you get that high biomass weed suppression, it works really well. Another example, maybe some of you met Jan Hendrik when he was on his great American no-till vegetable tour. He came over from Germany where he's trying different systems. And he has a webinar on e-organic that I would recommend if folks are interested. But they're looking at combining high biomass cover crops with, there's an example of it, with cut-and-carry mulch because they were finding that just the high, this is in organic systems, just the high biomass cover crop was not enough to get the weed suppression that they needed for the duration of the season. They also developed a little transplanter. This is a picture of some research in Quebec where they were using tarps to help terminate the cover crop because that can be another problem, and also for added weed suppression in vegetable systems. So the reason those are randomly placed is because it was research in a farm where you'd want to have more even coverage. So I think this is something that kind of on a small scale can work to augment the ecosystem services provided by the cover crops. Precision cover cropping, this is something that it seems like every single person is talking about during this conference, so I won't get into it too much, but this is my very own example of the kind of strip tilling with the forage radish and then the higher biomass cover crop in the pathways. So then you can grow corn or whatever. We didn't grow corn, but you could. Co-growing, I just threw that out there as a term, but inter- and overseeding. Co-growing, this is black plastic, and then in the past there's radish and oats which will winter kill. This is, I think this is a great idea. I don't know why more people don't do it because it really does help prevent erosion. Then living mulch, this is an aerial photo from some research that my colleague at New Hampshire did, and unfortunately, I like the broccoli data that Ron talked about. Unfortunately, Nick found that the living mulch really did reduce broccoli yields, and you can kind of see from the aerial photo that some of the plants look a little chlorotic. So there are trade-offs, and I think that it's not going to work perfectly in every system. So I was going to talk about communicating and understanding ecosystem services using a spider plot, going back to those goals, and then this theoretical farm, and as long as you divide the spider plot in sort of a logical way, you can really highlight the strengths and weaknesses, but I think that Mitch did a better job talking about that than I could. But this is a paper from the group at Penn State, again, looking at simulated data over, I think it was 30 years, the cover crop and the no cover crop system. This isn't a vegetable system, but immediately you can see the differences between these two systems. Mycorrhizal colonization being the most obvious difference. Cover crop system had much higher mycorrhizal colonization. But what I think is really important about this figure is that not only do they have the different ecosystem services, they also have the profitability and the management ease. And so those are key. It's not just how much food you produce, it's how much money you make, and it's not just how well you're providing these ecosystem services, it's how much of a pain in the butt is it. And so someone mentioned, you know, I don't want to deal with six-ton hairy vetch. So that's a significant thing that I think we can combine the profitability and the management with these ecosystem services, and I think it could be a good model. So in conclusion, the ecosystem services and disservices may be a helpful framework, may not be just another buzzword. We need to know more about the interactions and traits that drive different cover crops and ecosystem services. Farmers and researchers are innovating. I think it's really important that when we're communicating, we communicate mechanisms because no one system is going to work in every place. But if people understand how things are interacting and how they're working, then they can tweak it for their own systems. And finally, spider plots may be a helpful way to visualize things. I'm wondering, how do we communicate disservices? Because I think, as you said, vegetable growers are really constrained by pests and diseases, and sometimes the cover crops contribute to those problems. And so, you know, how to sort of balance that with the other kinds of services. And there also, you know, another thing, actually, well, I have the microphone. Another thing is that it's not just about yield, it's also about quality in vegetables, which is something that I think we don't talk about enough. As far as communicating disservices, I think we just need to communicate what we know. Like, Facilia is a host for Tarnished Plant Bug. Here is the life cycle of Tarnished Plant Bug. Make your own decisions. Because we can't possibly know all the disservices, just like we can't possibly know all the services. But I think that we ourselves are doing a disservice to farmers when we don't communicate what we know can go wrong. So, you know, for instance, with respect to nutrient cycling, it's not always a benefit to have a cover crop prior to your cash crop. Sometimes you're going to have to add more fertilizer because your cover crop is immobilizing nutrients. So, and I guess that's just where ourselves understanding the mechanisms and then really explaining the mechanisms to people, that's the only answer I have for that. And then your second question was? Oh, yeah, cosmetic. I think that's an area where cover crops can really do a lot and no-till can really do a lot. So these high residue scenarios where you don't have splashback and there's also kind of emerging evidence to show that when you have habitat for insects, you get fewer, for predatory insects, you get fewer blemished fruits and whatnot. I think every situation is different. I did no-till carrots after forage radish, and I found that the marketability was higher than the ones where I had tilled. But there's no, you know, single answer for every cover crop in every crop. Hey, Natalie. Interesting talk. Enjoyed it. On the disservices side, which is good to call attention to, don't the spider shards show that? Yeah. So if you're comparing with a cover crop and without a cover crop or a conventional system, if, you know, pest control is more towards the center, that's a disservice compared to the one. Yeah, definitely. You just have to know. You have to have that as one of your indicators that you measured. So you have to figure out what you need to look at. I just wanted to make one announcement here before we, you can see you have some more questions. But some of those innovative practices you were showing there, Natalie, they can be funded through a SARE grant. Northeast SARE has a farmer grant program for up to $15,000. So if you work with farmers or if you are a farmer, a little plug for the farmer grant program at Northeast SARE. In the overhead shot that you showed of the broccoli and grasses, do we know if the broccoli was hurt because nutrients were being leached by the cover crop in the paths? And do we know in general if there are specific crops or cover crops in alleyways that are going to do that to your cash crop when using the alleys? I don't think they have a mechanism. They couldn't identify a mechanism for why this didn't work. And this has worked in some settings. So it could be that this was a rye grass and white clover mix. So it could be that the mix wasn't right. It could be that it was, you can't, that it's not good to establish it at the same time as the broccoli. Maybe you need to wait a little bit to give the broccoli a competitive edge. It could be something about light interactions. It could be any number of things. I think there was definitely a nutrient phenomenon going on here. So I think they probably needed to fertilize at higher rates where there was the path, living path. What about moisture? Yes, good point. This was irrigated, drip irrigated. So they tried to maintain adequate moisture availability. So moisture should not have been limiting for the broccoli. But in... It would be so hard to do that unless you had individual drip lines separated from non-covered cover. Good point, good point. You could do it fairly. Oh, Steve picked out the error in the design. Thank you. Thank you.
