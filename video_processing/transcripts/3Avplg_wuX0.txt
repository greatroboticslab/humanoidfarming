 Dealing with the abundance season is fully underway here and we've been pulling in piles of stuff from the gardens and the woods. This week our dry beans were coming on strong, which is really exciting because they're one of our favorite staple crops to eat over the winter. If you've been following us for a while, you know that we like to crack open beans and nuts while we're watching a TV show, which we call Netflix and Shell. But this week the goldfinches were putting on a show for us on the sunflowers in our front yard, so we just sat there and watched them. One thing we love about growing dry beans in the garden is that they store indefinitely at room temperature, so you don't have to do anything to preserve them. There is a little critter called the bean weevil that will chew through them while they're in storage though, so we like to heat treat them at 145 degrees for 15 minutes, which kills off the bean weevils. You can also get rid of the bean weevils by putting them in a freezer for about two days, but it has to be a really cold freezer. I think it's recommended that you use one that goes down to zero degrees Fahrenheit. These little goodies will make so many delicious meals for us this winter, and we're so excited about all the refried beans, chilies, soups, tacos, stews, and more.
