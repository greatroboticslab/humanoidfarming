Howto & Style
 If your cucumbers grow slowly and look depressed, and you fertilize and water them well at the same time, and you can't figure out what the reason is, then most likely it's the soil, namely the acidity of the soil. If the soil is acidic, then cucumbers will grow poorly in it. Because they like the neutral pH of the soil, and ordinary chalk will help you to make the soil neutral, which is sold in garden shops. Dilute it with water and water your cucumbers one time every two weeks until the soil is restored. A more detailed video with the recipe and proportions has already been released on my channel.
