 Hello, everyone. Welcome to Health Professional Radio. I'm your host for today, Tabitha Moreto. Our guest today is Gabriela Holmes, the Project Manager at Triple Care Farm for Mission Australia, which is located in New South Wales. She's here to talk about the wonderful work she does at her organization. Without further ado, welcome to the show, Gabriela. It's so nice to have you here. Tabitha, thank you so much for having me. I look forward to speaking with you this afternoon about the programs Mission Australia offers here. My pleasure. So, can you please tell the audience more about yourself and the nature of your work? So, I'm the Program Manager for a Mission Australia project called Triple Care Farm. Triple Care Farm works with young people 16 to 24 from throughout Australia who are stepping out of the cycle of drug and alcohol addiction. They come and stay with us at our property to participate in a number of different programs. We have a withdrawal unit based here at Triple Care Farm and that offers a supported medicated detox program for up to 28 days. Young people are then able to, if they choose to, move on to the residential rehabilitation program, also based on the same property, up to 12 weeks. And then young people are then supported back in their community for up to six months through our aftercare program. That sounds wonderful. So, can you tell us, how is Triple Care Farm different from other rehab programs or centers in Australia? Triple Care Farm is set apart from other services because it is a unique integrated program where young people are able to access a spectrum of services all in the one site that's individualized and integrated to meet those young people's needs. So, instead of needing to pop from different services to different services at different stages, you can actually participate in a large spectrum of the service. So, you can start detox here, have that medical support at the beginning of that withdrawal process and then move into a very, very comprehensive treatment program at Triple Care Farm and the residential rehab. So, available on site over that 12 weeks, we have a number of different programs available. We have a residential living skills program. So, we have accommodation for up to 18 young people to participate in the program at any one time. In that residential program, we help young people to build up their independent living skills. So, cooking, cleaning, learning how to take care of personal hygiene, building up their interpersonal skills, learning how to relate to other people. Really, it's the backbone of the program, what young people often refer to as home. Then, during the day, we have a vocational education training program where young people are able to participate in a course that provides a year 10 equivalent qualification. We do that in partnership with an organization called Kiama Community College. As a part of that training, we also have modules to complete a barista course and to complete a horticulture course and young people really enjoy that aspect of the program. We also have a metal work and a woodwork program. We provide trades training, including a forklift license, completing your work health and safety white card and then we have an education program where we're helping young people to build up their literacy skills. We also have a farming and landscaping program where we're situated on 110 acres and so young people are able to learn how to take care of a property. And we also have a music program and a creative arts program. The music program offers both young people to be able to have the opportunity to write and record their own songs as well as learning instruments. And the art program focuses on fine arts both as a creative expression and as a therapy. So we do painting, sculpture work, a really big spectrum of fine arts within that program. We also during the week have a counseling team. We do both individual and group counseling and then we have medical staff that support the program. And then on the weekend, it's about really building health and fitness, getting out there and having some fun. So participating in a big range of sport and recreation activities from bushwalking, bike riding to doing indoor rock climbing. And then when a young person's finished those programs, we support them for six months in the community. So we're innovative and set apart because we have all of those programs offered to young people through the ONE program. That's wonderful. It sounds like you have a very special organization because you not only help young people overcome their addiction, you also teach them and educate them in a variety of ways in order for them to use those skills in order to live a productive life once they get out of rehab. Yeah, absolutely. And that's one of the keys to the impact that Triple Care Farm is able to have for young people. We ask them when they start the program, what is it that you would like to achieve? And for most of them, it's, I want to stop using drugs. I want to have my own home and I want to have something to be able to do. I want to be able to be connected. And I mean, they're pretty reasonable goals that all of us have. But for these young people, many of them felt that's unattainable. And so being able to both address the reasons why they may have entered and started using and equipping them with the skills and the passion to be able to find something that they connect with when they leave. Triple Care Farm is really important because if young people feel that they have a purpose and the confidence to use the skills that they've got, then what we see is a significant engagement in education, training and stable accommodation, which is really where we want to see them excel and shine. That's fantastic to know. Now, Gabriella, if you don't mind, can I ask you a personal question? Yes, certainly, Tabitha. Wonderful. Actually, I ask this to all of my guests who come on the show. So can you tell us, why are you so passionate about helping people, especially young people, recover from addiction? Certainly. So I started working at Triple Care Farm in the year 2000. So this is my 18th year being a part of the program. And the thing that keeps bringing me back to this work and being so excited about it is watching young people flourish. The young people that we support have been faced with every barrier that our community can throw at them. Many of them have experienced significant trauma and really don't feel worthwhile. And what I see time and time again is young people actually develop a sense of worthfulness. So rather than feeling worthless, start to feel that they are worth something and then start to smile and start to connect again and have the strength to actually step out of the trauma that they've experienced. And just a really, it's a great joy to be a part of that. So that's what keeps me coming back to the last 17 years. Wow, that's amazing. 17 years. So that means you really care about young people, especially when it comes to overcoming their addiction. Yeah, absolutely. I would love to chat with you more, Gabriella, but we're running out of time. But before we go, can you please tell us for those who want to contact Triple Care Farm, how can they do that?
