Howto & Style
 If you want to get a large crop of potatoes, at the same time spend little effort on growing them. Then use this method. Dig not deep holes, in them spread out one potato at a distance of 15 centimeters. Sprinkle with soil to cover the seedlings slightly. Lay the straw on top with a thick layer, at least 10 centimeters. And pour plenty of water. So the straw will hold tightly, it will always be wet under it, and the potatoes will grow large and clean.
