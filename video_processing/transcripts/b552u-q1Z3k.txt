Howto & Style
 Growing your own food and flowers from seed is so satisfying. I'm going to share with you a budget-friendly DIY seed starting system that I made. Start with the used or new metal shelving unit. I like the four foot wide units so that I can put four 10 by 20 trays on each row. I took advantage of the wasted space on the top shelf and I added lights up there as well. It didn't cost me a lot of money. I just used some PVC pipes that I had around my house. Adding caster wheels is optional. I like it because then if I need to move the unit around it's much easier to do so. The lights come on at 5 a.m. They go off at 9 p.m. so that's 16 hours and they're set on a timer. I use a power strip to plug everything in and I love zip ties just to keep everything manageable. The four foot LED shop lights have a pull chain and they fit my system perfectly. It is also very easy to raise and lower your lights if needed. In order to avoid having to plug in so many lights I highly recommend buying LED shop lights that are linkable.
