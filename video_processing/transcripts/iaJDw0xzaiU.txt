 Greetings fellow hunters, welcome back to my channel. Today I'm here to unravel the fascinating world of herd management. Join me as I explain what herd management is and guide you through my 10-step process to enhance your hunting experience. Let's go! What is herd management? Herd management is the process of managing a specific species herd by harvesting mid and max level animals and leaving low level animals on the map to increase the chances of spawning larger respawns with the goal of respawning a max level animal that has a best chance at getting a diamond score. By spawning larger level animals you will also increase the chance of spawning what the community calls a super rare which is a diamond animal that has a rare fur variation like piebald, albino or melanistic as an example. The community is also split on the idea that herd management affects how quickly you spawn in a great one for one of the five species that have great ones. The developers and EW have not confirmed or denied if this is the case. Step 1. Picking the right map and species. When using herd management as a play style it is not just for the purpose of grinding for great ones and can be used for any specific species in the game. Since herd management increases the chance of respawning a diamond, I've done herd management grinds for a diamond blacktail deer, gem's bock, european and plains bison and as well as grido ibex. But I've also used herd management in my great one red deer, white tail, moose and fallow deer grinds. Some animals tend to be easier to manage, specifically animals that travel in herds like red deer and white tail deer. So start by figuring out what animal you want to herd manage and what map you want to manage them on. I have chosen Tia Oroa for both my red deer and fallow deer grinds because they are concentrated to one side of the map and they have the least amount of zones to manage with up to 40 zones each compared to 55 plus zones on other maps for red deer and fallow deer. Step 2. Do your research. Before you embark on your herd management journey, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with the map and species guide for each animal. Get to know their drink zones, their lakes, rivers, drink times, potential animal levels, what the diamond score is and rare fur types specific to your target. Experts like Pro XCK, Wild Hunter and Lady Legend XO have crafted exceptional guides. Check out their channels. I strongly recommend watching their guides before you start any of your grinds. Step 3. Find all of your zones. Now that you've selected your species and map, the next vital step is locating all of their drink zones. The game respawns to animals that have been taken down, but if you haven't discovered most of their drink zones, respawns might just end up in uncharted herds or solitary zones that you've not discovered yet. To ensure consistency, scout for all the drink zones. Begin by scouting around bodies of water an hour after their drink time starts. You can even pick up need zone indicators up to two hours after their drink time ends. Toward the end of drink time, hop on an ATV and encircle the lake, gather need zone indicators. Smaller lakes typically have one or two zones whereas larger lakes may have four or more. Coastal areas and rivers typically feature zones based around 250 meters apart. So stay vigilant and be ready. Step 4. What zones to grind. You want to start your grind on herd zones with multiple males if possible that are of mid to high level for the range for that species. As you are finding zones and spot herds you want to grind, you can leave a tripod or a tent nearby to mark that you want to come back to that zone when you start your grind. I usually don't start with shooting any solo herd zones, zones with one animal, until I've stacked enough high level animals in my herd zones to efficiently drive down their respawns. Step 5. Where to place tents. Tent placement plays a crucial role. Animals won't spawn in if you fast travel to a tent that's within 200 to 250 meters of their drink zone. My preferred method is placing tents precisely 250 meters from their drink zone and marking the zone with a map marker to ensure that I am at the right distance before setting up. This ensures animals will consistently spawn in when you fast travel. Step 6. Where to place tripods. I use tripods or hunting blinds during my grind to not delete my zones. If a zone gets more than 3 kills without a tripod that will increase the hunting pressure to the point that it will delete a zone and you will have to rediscover the zone somewhere else in the map. This can be a tedious additional step if you delete a zone. Using a tripod or a hunting blind gives you 16 kills before the pressure would delete a zone. I have never deleted a zone while using a tripod or a hunting blind. I usually set those up as close as I can to a tent to save time or if I want to get closer to the animal's zone for a more clearer shot I will set them up between 175 to 200 meters which allows me to safely run to the tripod without spooking the animals. Step 7. What animal do I shoot? Different animals have varying max level types. For instance, animals like white-tailed deer go to a max level of 3 while fallow deer reach a max level 5 and red deer peak at a max level 9. Adapt your strategy accordingly. For max level 3 animals focus on shooting level 2s and stacking diamond potential 2s and 3s. For max level 5 species target 3s and 4s and stack diamond potential 4s and 5s. Avoid shooting the 1s and the 2s. Finally, for max level 9 animals shoot level 5, 6, 7 and 8 and stack diamond potential 8s and max level 9s. If you prefer not to stack you can shoot max level and diamond potential animals which might slow down your progress initially but won't negatively impact your grind. Step 8. Stacking. Stacking is a crucial strategy at the beginning of your grind. Leaving max level and diamond potential animals in zones to occupy herd spots and decrease the level of respawns in other zones. Keep in mind that there's still some randomness involved and that's called RNG. So having multiple max level animals in the game can lead to an overcompensation and spawn lower level animals in the zones you want to shoot down. For example, in my fallow deer grind if I have let's say 5 to 7 max level diamonds on the map they drive down the respawns in other zones on average to levels 2s and 1s. Especially when I'm focusing on solo zones this is a big help. Step 9. Shooting down your zones. A zone is considered shot down when it only contains females and low level males. Keep track of the number of males in a herd. For example, if a fallow deer herd has 2 males and 5 females and both males are level 2 or lower that zone is considered shot down. You can then pick up your gear, move to another zone, repeat this process. Once you've left with about 10 to 12 zones you can harvest your stacked diamonds and diamond potential animals as they've fulfilled their role in the stacking part. And your herd is well on its way to being effectively managed. Step 10. Pick up tents. When your grind is streamlined down to about 16 or fewer herd zones you can then transition your tents into pick up tents allowing for faster runs. Currently in my fallow deer grind I'm managing 10 zones with 8 pick up tents. This enables me to complete a run in 45 in-game minutes which roughly translates to about 12 to 15 minutes in real life. In one hour I can cycle through all my zones four times. The ultimate goal of herd management is to maintain around 10 to 12 zones that consistently spawn larger animals for effective harvesting. You shoot an animal, you fast travel to a tent, pick it up. Now that you have my 10 step process I do have some additional tips that will help you on your grind. Tip number one. Pick up all your harvests. Jaxi Beard who was once a content creator for Call of the Wild is now a community manager for EW and hosts the weekly expansive world stream. He has stated many times that by not picking up your kills affects your chance of a great one spawning. So if you're herd managing to spawn a great one I suggest picking up all your harvests. Tip number two. Dealing with your solo zones. I treat my solo zones as if they're a separate grind than a herd zone. If you shoot a solo male they will also respawn anywhere on the map. This will cause you to have to rediscover those zones. Once I have stacked some diamond potential animals in my herd zones I then focus on the solo zones and grind them down to smaller levels because you have to keep refining them. Once you've got them ground down to where you find them acceptable then you can go back to the herd zones. Tip number three. The one minute trick. If you arrive at a zone and you find that the animals are not there drinking. If you get back into your tent and rest for one minute ahead there is about a 75% chance that the animals will arrive at their zone immediately. If they are not currently there try it. Tip four. Doubled zone two tents. If you have two zones that are 250 meters apart you can place a tent directly on top of each zone. When you fast travel to one tent the animals on that zone won't spawn in and you can shoot the adjacent zone's animals. You can then fast travel to pick up that animal and the zone that you just left will have the animals spawn in to render distance and you can shoot one of those animals as well. In my fallow grind in my final 10 zones I have three such placements and these are the best zones I have which essentially saves me one tent each. That's all for today fellow hunters.
