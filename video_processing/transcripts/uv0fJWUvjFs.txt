 When you put basalt, you put this, you put other antennas, you will all increase those electromagnetic, electrical, magnetic, natural energies that will increase life and you will see life exploding in the garden. A lot more diversity, singing birds, also more different insects. You have good insects and the bad, but when you do electroculture, you will see a lot more biodiversity of the good guys, of the good living organisms. Imagine being able to build the health of your soil without using the traditional means as cover crops and crop rotations and inputs, but using something called electroculture. Let me introduce you to Yannick Van Doorn, who is an agronomist and independent researcher who has been putting together applications for farmers and gardeners for over 20 years and developing tools for electroculture that are being used more and more worldwide, not just by gardeners with a little garden in their backyard or flowers beds in the front yard. But farmers who are farming thousands of acres are using electroculture. In this conversation, we take a look at charging seeds, implementing electroculture on a smaller scale and on a larger scale, and how it impacts soil biodiversity and the health of the plants and the health of the soil and the health of the crops that we're growing. I'm really delighted and honored to bring this conversation with you from Yannick. Enjoy and thank you so much for joining us for the soil summit. And you make yourself an amazing day. Big love. There's so many questions I have about electroculture. So my training is in polarity therapy and energy medicine. And I've always been kind of dazzled and odd by energy. And so the idea of electroculture and what that means for gardening and farming and growing food and is really, really, it's really, really exciting to me, Yannick. So thanks for joining me for this. So I'm at 2024. Thank you too. It's good to have you here. So Yannick, tell me, how did you discover electroculture? To make a long story short? Yeah, or just tell me the moment. Like, tell me what that moment felt like and what that was. I would say it was around 1998. Then I read the book, The Secrets of the Soil, from Peter Tompkins and Christopher Burt. It's really an amazing book where you discover a lot of alternatives for agriculture, that it's possible to do agriculture without pesticides and without polluting the earth. And I was studying engineering astronomy and didn't learn about all those topics in my courses. So I was very, I was very, very interesting in this book. And this book, in this book, they have a whole chapter about the influence of round towers of paramagnetic basalt. So they speak about the magnetic forces of the earth and also about energizing water, water, about microbiology and so on. And there was also a whole chapter about the influence of music on plants. And so I decided to do a research on that topic. And I did my end year thesis about the influence of music on plants. And so bit by bit, step by step, I was more and more conscious about the influence of electricity, magnetism and other subtle invisible energies on plant growth. And bit by bit, it came, it brought me to electroculture like we see it today. It was, it took like around five to 10 years that I did the step to really promote almost only electroculture techniques. I did first some experiments by myself in my garden, because I wrote some articles and books and, and old articles, because in the, in the, in the, in the 20th century, there is almost nothing. Uh, uh, it was, it was like old articles from 50, 60, 60, 100 years before. And so I decided to begin to do experiments in my garden. And I saw very rapidly, huge increase in plant growth, very good results. And so I did more and more experiments. And in 2008, I, I met a farmer in Alsace in France and, and, and, and, and he was, um, uh, quite open-minded and he, he, he, he, he, and he let me do an experiment in his fields. Wow. And so I did, I made a big magnet in that time. It was, I can show you. Yeah, do show us. It's a big magnet. That, that was my first antenna that I made and that I use, um, on, on, on a huge field. It's like, uh, like, uh, five to 10 acres, uh, uh, huge. So it's, it's a big magnet like this and there is a flat coil. And there is a, this is, this is pink plate on, on, on the, on the, on the and on the south magnetic hold, a copper plate. But like, like when you see this, you would think, how did he get this how how didn't he invent this well that's a lot of research and understanding of how those energies works and then i had a like an intuition uh also and and i i i made that to make a long story short also and so i i made this and uh i put like um around 40 to 50 in the field like uh on each 12 meters or uh then it's like uh yeah on each uh 12 meters or 12 steps you could say and and then um it was on a cabbage field and the cabbages began to grow really a lot faster than in the in the control fields it was like uh at the end they were like three to four weeks um uh they grew like three to four weeks more rapidly it was really huge effect and so uh then then at that time a journalist uh heard about my story about my huge results in the field and then he came he made an article in a magazine and then it brought me to other farmers and and so step by step i i begin to make my profession about this uh to to to to develop electroculture but now i have a lot of different techniques i make like round towers like this for the gardens i make magnetic antennas also those little ones that that that's for example uh a little one that i invented uh uh for the gardens or for everyone to to to to be able to to do experiments very quickly and and with and with a lot of results and so with that little one that you're holding um what what does a person do with that and how much area does that serve um yes in electroculture you have really a lot of huge uh a lot of the different techniques uh uh well the this one is uh put in the earth and is connected with uh galvanized uh iron wire or galvanized uh iron wire um that is uh ferromagnetic because this techniques work work with the magnetic field of the earth and uh and then it has to be put really uh very precisely uh from south to north uh the direction in the same direction as the magnetic field of the earth because the the aim of this one is to act as an antenna with the magnetic field of the earth otherwise it doesn't work if you put this in another direction it doesn't work it's a it's it's like you take a bucket a bucket to to collect the the rain the rain water if you put the bucket on the on the one direction you you will not collect water even if the bucket is okay so so here with the magnet is the same so it's good to understand that it's the magnetic field of the earth that we want to collect and not the magnetic field of the magnet itself really because otherwise you would think that if you use a more powerful magnet it will work better or things like that but that is not true in in nature the the the power is mostly in various subtle energies it's it's not about uh more power more stronger more bigger no it's it's uh mostly in in very subtle energies that we need to understand to learn and and then need to to learn how to act with them how to how to use them how to uh how how how to collect them um because otherwise those energies are there always it's like radio waves like from the radio we are always in the radio waves but if we don't have the radio we cannot hear the the radio so we we need like to create the antennas that will collect those uh natural energies and then use it in a good way to to have the effects because for example the magnet if you don't use it in the right way you you don't have the effects too it's it's the same with a lot of other techniques too yeah so uh so with that magnet that you're holding there the one that goes north to south how much area would that serve or work with how big can my garden be answer your question about uh um and in um well when you put a wire it will act all around the wire in a radius around uh one meter or three feet around like a one to two feet on each side of the wire so if you if you need to um to um to cover a wall field then you need to put a wire every meter or every uh three feet uh around every two that three feet uh so so so so it's a lot of wires that that you need to install but uh wires are not so expensive it's quite cheap uh it's just iron uh galvanized uh iron wire it's quite cheap um and it's uh it's normal wire that is usually used in in in in agriculture um what bury that yes and you you you you bury that in agriculture they use a machine to bury that if it's in your garden then then you just take your tools and and you bury it in the soil you you don't need to bury it very deep if you put it around uh on feet it's very good but you can also put it just on the soil on the top it will work too but it's uh it's uh it will it will work even better if you put it in the soil then you put it around 10 20 30 to 50 centimeters so it i would say maximum one feet and a half or uh 50 centimeters because if you put it deeper the energy it's not strong enough anymore and then it will not work i i did already it's not strong enough but i'm not strong enough but i think that's not a big part of the the experiment uh um and um yeah and then you put the wire every meter you can also spread it a little more like every meter and a half but the energy field will be less stronger uh so the ideal situation is to put every meter every meter and um now in agriculture it's not always uh possible to use that technique because if you have rocks in your soil or um or if if uh if it's uh like a farm of thousands uh acres it's it's it's it's too big uh to use that or it's it's more difficult uh so then i developed other techniques that can be used in in uh huge farms but but that technique is very it's always very effective but it's very uh useful or um interesting like for for vegetable uh growers uh also orchards also um uh it's also very interesting uh if you put it before planting the trees uh you would see that the trees will grow like maybe two times faster and i i have already apples on on apple trees that i planted uh uh two or three years before i have the first apples after two or three years and normally it takes like five years uh yeah yeah i was just thinking for orchards that this could be a really really powerful um yeah like what does a larger scale farmer use what do you suggest for that um at large scale it's the most difficult because um the they they don't have much room for investment they they they cannot invest a lot uh per square per acre for example than on small scale farmers or in your garden and uh but there are possibilities are there are solutions for example the the round towers uh we make round towers like this but huge uh a lot bigger and then it can it can it can radiate um beneficial energies like on on 100 or two or 300 meters around so it can it can be uh uh an example the the round towers you find in ireland uh is historically that were built built 600 after jesus christ they they had a um an effect on on on on kilometers or miles you see so but but but those towers are like 30 meters high so it's it's a lot that but you cannot build that in your garden or in the field but you can make towers of two meters three meters high and and and those can have uh like an effect of 20 to 40 times its its height so an example if you make one of two meters and it has uh 40 times uh uh uh the the effect of a radius of 40 times the height so it's 40 multiplied by two it's uh 80 yes 80 meters uh so it's like two or three uh hectares or maybe five to ten uh acres uh of one tower approximate yes yes approximately yeah so for a smaller scale vegetable you make yes for a smaller scale then you can also use those little one that you then you mix uh basalt with cement uh to make uh little ones like this and it's quite easy to make and it can have huge results too i explained that also in my book uh how to do that um because my my my philosophy is really open source i learned also from the past from from what uh the the the inventors of the past uh uh shared so uh and then i did my own experiments own developments too but my idea it's really to share the knowledge that everybody can do even with uh with uh with uh with the cheap uh materials but i built also things and so if people don't want to do themselves or they prefer to to buy uh or they prefer to buy an original one from from the inventor they can buy to my shop and and support my work like this but uh but the idea is really to share because it's like this that this knowledge will will stay in time otherwise if we don't share if we just hold the knowledge for ourselves then when we die it's lost and and that is not the the the goal that that's not the objective so the idea is really to share and to develop electroculture and i'm very happy to observe now that since i began in the beginning i was like alone i could uh not speak to anyone about this or to or i could not exchange my results because i was like the the only to do it and and so with time i met more and more people and more and more people begin to experiment and now they are all over the world now it's it's really nice to to exchange and to see the results from others and to learn from each other because we do all different experiments and and we some have good results some have bad results and then we try to understand why and how we can improve things and now it's really it's it's it's it's like an airplane in the beginning it drives slowly and then faster and faster and then up it takes off well now we are in the years i i see that electroculture is taking off but we are still in the beginning now we have to to go yeah it's so exciting so what is the largest size of farm that you've worked with who the the largest size is a farmer in canada that contacted me that has like 2500 acres wow tell us about that but uh it's still the beginning so i was thinking oh whoa whoa whoa whoa what can we do uh because there are only two people running 2500 acres with huge machines and so i was thinking how can i help him and and then my first idea it's to do um is to energize the seeds because that is really what can help even a small gardener can it can it can have huge effects just by energizing the seeds and when we do it on small scale then we can put the seeds in a little pyramid for example i can show you one so then i make a little pyramids like this in copper but that you cannot use for a large-scale farmer but for in the garden you put your seeds in the garden you put your seeds in the pyramid it will work very well but for large-scale farmer we developed i developed a system with kind of cones that are connected with the wire that we can connect to the seed uh to the seed stock um to the seed stock um bin i developed also a system that works with electronics that makes a magnetic pulse uh that also energize the seeds with with what i experiment with um we can also um uh put uh round towers in the fields uh but uh the bigger ones and also um uh adding uh basalt rock in the in the in the in the manure or in the in the uh in the uh in the fertilizers in the fertilizers so we can we can energize also the fertilizers energize the the pesticides or the water used to spray them uh and and and if if they do already all those um applications they can really increase a lot their results they can maybe increase by 20 30 50 percent uh it's it's it's always difficult to to know in advance how much uh would be the results because every farmer every situation is different every soil is different every crop is different every season the year the climate everything is they're always always always uh they're always in private in in uh um there are always unexpected situations that changes the the story so it's always difficult but but just energizing seeds can sometimes even double the yields in the garden even if you don't do electroculture in your garden but that you just energize the seeds it can have huge results that's amazing so when you're talking about the 50 increase you're talking about 50 increase in yields yes yes yes so or in germination also and in germination and in what sorry yes in the in the growth of the plants uh and and and and the final yields and mostly what is also very interesting it's not only about the the yield or the or the growth it's also the the it's it's it's it's also the nutrient concentration that is increased the nutrient concentration every time they did measurements it was always like uh 20 30 percent more uh like uh oil content or protein content or essential oils or active molecules in most cases it was always around those uh those numbers yeah right and so you're going back to the grain farmer because that's i'm you the green farm was able to keep the seeds in his bins and then you created systems to energize the seeds in his bins yes we we energize directly the whole bin so we we will connect the the systems to the bin the the bins are mostly in metal in metal and that's good because it's uh it's it's it's a good conductor and so you can conduct also those energies in the metal in the whole bin uh to the whole bin right now we are doing experiments uh to see how much systems or how we have to apply them to have the good results and so the the experiments are running now we are we are trying that but at at little scale we know it works very well but now it's uh how to do it a big scale and we need to experiment right so um it sounds like one of the best places to start with electroculture is with energizing seeds would you say that it's true yes yes if if i would be a responsible of the department of agriculture uh the first step i would say uh to the farmers is to energize their seeds yeah that's uh because it changes it changes the whole story of the growth of the plant if the if the plant begins to grow more quickly and more stronger then the plant is more resistant to disease to uh insects attacks and everything so automatically they will use less uh fertilizers less uh less pesticides everything will be uh uh uh uh will will develop in a good direction uh so uh and also uh in when they talk about uh uh climate uh change or problems uh well the plants are also more resistant if if it's too wet they will be more resistant to too wet if it's uh too dry they will also be more resistant now they are limits but they they will be more resistant so powerful it's it's like it will it will awaken the the the the the old memories of the plants so it's like the plants will will uh activate again their their genes or their or their capacity to resist when we take a modern uh hybrid uh or gmo plants they are like they are like they are like cultivated or they they are like breeded to be like robots you see they are they they cannot adapt anymore or a lot less they are like all robots and with electroculture with with electrical fields or with different or with the pyramid we see that it awakens again the old uh character of the plant an example of corn plant when you take a corn a corn seed and you just see that normally you will have like a robot you will have one stalk and maybe two or three ears or only one uh when you energize uh with electroculture techniques in most cases you will have like two or three or four or five stalks or even more i i have i had one with eight stalks uh in my garden and then you have on each stalk you will have like one two three four ears uh on it so you will multiply the yield and it's like it's because a corn it's like a grass and then it become it become again like a grass it's it's like with with different thoughts like this you see but we are so you we are now so used to see the corn like a robot like one stalk that we think it's like that but it's not like that that's not his normal uh way of of growing uh that that's the way of growing with modern industrial techniques but uh we can we can do a lot better there is also an amazing story about in the years of in the year 40s around world war ii uh scientists develop um um wheat and so a grain uh that was a hybrid uh uh between the normal wheat and um and and and and um at the normal wheat uh grain and and the wheat um that this um uh the the wheat grain is annual uh you you have to see that every year again but the wheat wheat it's uh it's it grows every year so and then they they combine the two genes or they make like a hybrid of it and then they had the wheat w h e a t um that grow again every year that you don't need to see it anymore so that you you see if if you have a wheat that is pluriannual that is uh that grows every year back then you don't need again to plow every year you don't need to use so much fertilizers and pesticides because it grows again like a grass and and the scientists uh made that it's possible but the the the industry they don't like that because they want to sell a lot of stuff to the farmers so they don't want to develop they don't want to promote or fund uh science projects where the farmers become more independent they only fund science uh solutions or projects or research that makes the farmers uh always more and more dependent uh like slaves they become like slaves of a system or of the industry and with electroculture it's in the way i develop it it's like we we make we help the farmers to become again independent uh it's it's all research that we do in the community it's it's without the institutions uh it's it's mostly from people that really uh uh uh look for for for real solutions and real results with uh with cheap material or with less investment so it's really real research that that uh responds to the demand of the real people and and what we and and what the farmers really need now the the only problem today it's just that it's like unknown it's like the people don't know about it because it was so long time answered uh since uh around uh the year the the end of the 30s 40s uh it was completely erased from the dictionaries from the encyclopedia from everywhere all the books and you can you can see that back uh when you go in uh in the in the in the libraries uh the official libraries of of the state uh and and you and you put in in the search engine of the library you put electroculture you will see uh the keyword electroculture you will see that before 1939 around there are hundreds of articles hundreds of newspaper articles about electroculture there are books there are there are a lot of uh information and after uh 1939 they are like uh only five or ten uh until now but in the in the period between 1939 and 2024 so it's really amazing and it's a proof that everybody can check it's not just me that is telling that you everybody can check uh with the keyword in the libraries uh and and it's really a proof that it was uh by intent it was censored it's like a date and it's really just before world war ii or around world war ii and in it was all over the world censored like this it's like there there was already a world government at that time but we don't know about it right and so why does electroculture work why oh that's a big mystery yeah yeah why why so um yeah it's it's uh we we are we are trying we are searching to to understand how nature works how why a baby uh breed when when it's born uh why um how we live how our cells live the the how what what what what define uh what is life it's it's difficult to know there's no scientist that can really explain that in detail uh even there are thousands and thousands of science articles and books they are still searching what is the difference between life and that and uh and and well in the beginning of of um of um of the search to electroculture probably uh the the first antennas that were made were antennas to collect atmospheric electricity that was like a pole uh with wires in the sky at uh like uh two three four five six meters high or even more and the idea was to collect atmospheric electricity because they observed like we all observe that when it rains the for example the plants grow a lot better than when we take water from the river or from irrigation uh it's it's it's such chemically it's the same uh water molecule but there is something different when the water uh drops from the sky and and even more different when it's thunder when you have electricity in the sky like uh thunderstorms then the plants after a thunder rain the plants grow a lot faster and so they they begin to to to to think yes maybe there is like a life energy life force energy and and one century ago they were speaking uh the scientists also about a life force energy but with time they they put that uh that uh vocabulary away they don't know anymore about life force they want to see life only as a mechanics as as a robot you see because then they can sell chimics they can sell a body parts they they it's everything it's like a robot and and and but in the beginning of the research they they were looking about what is a life force and they were looking about the source of life force and they discovered like this that electricity is a main component because in in living organisms you have always electricity always but the opposite is not true it's not because you have electricity that you have the life force that's right sometimes well sometimes yes but sometimes not an example a robot is full of electricity but it's not living really uh it's it's will always be different than a real human or or a real plant and so they that's why it's more important to use um natural electricity because natural electricity because natural electricity i see it like this you have that subtle invisible mysterious energy that we would call life force or that willem reich would call organ energy that you you will not find in artificial uh electricity or a lot less and so that's also why when you use antennas uh passive antennas that collect the natural electricity even with a very little bit of electricity you have huge results that when you use artificial electricity in most cases you need a lot of electricity for little results so it's um it that that's because that invisible um invisible uh uh factor of uh factor of life force is different too uh and so that that is really a huge uh uh mystery but uh uh there is a lot of research but the the the industry doesn't want to speak about life force or doesn't want you to know that because uh all industrial process uh reduce life force uh because if you have like an an apple and they hold it like uh three years in the storage and it looks like a fresh apple but it's not fresh it has only already three years well uh um the life force uh will be completely out but it will still look like an apple but it's not an apple anymore it it doesn't have the the nutrients or it doesn't have the energy anymore so and and and the the insects and the the the sicknesses the molds the the fungi they they can see or they can feel that life force so when you have a product or a vegetable that has less life force it will attack it it will just eat it and transform in compost it it's just a normal process and compost it it's just a normal process and when you have more life force it it they don't attack it it stays good so electroculture can be really effective for pest control and disease control as well yes yes yes yes yes the the idea about a pest and disease control it's not really to attack the pest or the disease it's really to increase the life force energy of the vegetable or the plant and then the disease it disappear by itself it's like when we are weak we are like tired then we become diseased we have maybe a flu or whatever or cough and then when we sleep good and we eat good uh we have we have again more more energy and then the flu go away yes so true so true yannick i just love it so we we are not uh going to attack or make war uh against disease against this or no we are just cultivating what is good and and cultivating the word the etymology of the word cultivating it's to uh honor what is good to honor it's like it's like a farmer in a reality it's like a kind of a priest because he cultivates the land and the and and cultivating the land is to honor the land it's to do everything to increase the benefits of the land and and and and and for this we don't have to destroy it we don't have to make war we just have to work and to work and to work in a good way and to understand to learn and to to to make the the best out of it and electroculture can help a lot uh with that so powerful yeah oh i i'm i'm just sitting in awe at this moment one one of the conversations we had for the soil summit was with dr james white i don't know if you've heard of him yet he he he really um lit up the conversation about the rise of phagy cycle so the understanding that um plants don't necessarily absorb um the nutrients they actually eat bacteria so plants actually eat bacteria and then the the the the bacteria go into the the the plant and the the plant strips the bacteria and then it gets shot out through the roots well it doesn't actually get shot out it actually moves out and that's what makes the little root hairs and then that strip bacteria goes and then it becomes whole again and and um goes through the cycle over and over and over again the plant eats it again when it's complete so one interesting i i didn't know that story yeah it's really fascinating so one something that came up because i asked him what's new what have what what else have you noticed he said and i'm pretty sure i've got this right i could have it opposite though he said they've also noticed that the the the root the end of the root has a negative charge and the bacteria has i think a positive charge and so they're wondering if that is actually a part of the process so i think that would be an interesting conversation too yes the the the soil it's like a battery like a battery and when we do electroculture it's like we charge the battery it's like we charge the energy in the battery and if you look at the scientific point of view you can you can maybe see that when you put electricity it will create like an electrolysis process so it will it will make that some nutrients will appear or some ions of different of calcium magnesium different salts that are important for the plants you can see it like this but in reality the plant doesn't absorb so much of of nutrients they they they they are mostly hotter water like us we are a plant is like more than 90 percent of hotter and just a little bit of salt and nothing more and and proteins and and so it doesn't need really much and there is a theory also that the plant makes its own um materials makes its own nutrients in a certain way it's like and in electroculture there were experiments like uh by uh justin christophe lo what that was a pioneer in electroculture in 1918 to 1938 uh and 1925 he he made a book and he showed in his book an experiment he grow plants wheat plants on stones and he he collect he connected the stones with uh at the the where the plants were were seeded uh he he collect he connected with his antenna with his atmospheric electroculture antenna and then he connected also the stones with a wire to the soil so that the energy could could go through the stones and then he he puts enough moisture that that the stones uh stay humid and he grow wheat plants so without any nutrients only stones and he had even more results than in real soil without uh the antenna he had more more growth and more yield in his stones than in the real soil without the antenna so it shows that that growing or life energy it's it's really energy what what makes the plants growing if you you can put as much as nutrients you want if you put the plants like in the microwave oven it will not grow but if you put it in the right energy if you put it in the good energies it will grow yeah i have two questions about the um energizing seeds so for the gardener to energize the seeds uh of copper like a pyramid does it matter what the pyramid is made out of uh yes it matters um they they did experiments there is even a thesis um from texas in 2017 where they um where they compared different pyramids of different materials uh copper pyramid uh copper pyramid uh wooden uh cardboard pyramids and they measured that the the the best effects were with copper now it doesn't mean that the other materials will not work it will also work but the effects will be less it's less strong so uh but with copper it's the most stronger that that we that we can have so uh you you need to uh uh to correspond with certain um uh angles uh certain proportions to make it work and also you need to put it in the direction uh south to north or the four direction uh north south east west it's not the angles that's right the faces at the base yeah so cool just the base and then and pardon me yes you can make a big pyramids or you can make smaller pyramids it will work um as good a big one or a little one on on the seats uh if if you want to make electricity for example then a bigger one uh there are also experiments with electronics and pyramids and then a bigger one will make more but the effects on on seeds i didn't saw difference between the big one or a little one it works also good with the little one yeah and then charging seeds um for a big farmer how would they do that is that would they call you yes or they or they or they read my book yes and and it's also explained how to do so if they if they want to use a pyramid for example then uh they can make a pyramid like uh like uh uh three to four to five meters uh side so uh in in in feet it's like 10 to 15 feet uh uh size and then they put their big bags their their uh their seats in the pyramid a few days i would advise minimum two days they can put it even longer but for example if it's uh uh thunderstorm outside then even if you put the seats only one hour in the pyramid it can already have huge effects because the pyramid is like an antenna of of those electrical atmospheric and uh and cosmic energies of of the earth and so uh then the farmers they put for example only in france they are more than than than than than 30 uh uh farmers and even uh a lot more uh but just in the region of southwest of france they are on they are already more than 30 farmers using that technique of the pyramid to energize their seeds wow so um but they do mostly they do it uh they they don't talk much about it but they do it in their farm yeah and i have already hundreds of farmers as customers that bought me pyramids that use pyramids that use pyramids in their farm so and and and the and the first thing to do is to energize the seeds with it but they can also energize uh the fertilizers they can energize the the pesticides even uh they can energize uh rocks uh like uh uh uh basalt uh rocks uh or rocks from uh volcanoes that uh sand and powders that can help a lot uh to increase the the fertility of the soil it's always to bring like a life force energy to the field it's like you you charge the energy at the barn in the pyramid and then you spread it in your in your land yeah yeah i'm not a super fan of uh and a lot of our audience isn't a super fan of uh of pesticides but there are there are some there are some um people in in in our community who are still using like organic yes organic inputs like about pesticides i i'm also not a fan but we there are still a lot of farmers using them so we can help them to to to reduce the use and that they don't need it anymore and what is interesting with the pyramid and with electroculture is that when you increase the the force of the plant the the energy that it's less attacked automatically the farmer will use less pesticides and and when you put the pesticides or or chemicals or um or toxic products in the pyramid it will tend to reduce the harmful effects of it or the harmful side effects and it will also tend to increase the the the intention uh your your intention when you do something the uh and the pyramid is very important for that how it works it's it works also with your consciousness with your intention when when you have a good intention it will increase the good when you use a product that it's organic or not you you have a certain intention you you have a certain goal well you will increase the effect of that and and so uh a pyramid even if they use pesticides it can help them so i i don't want to to um to i i work with all farmers you see uh with uh organic farmers biodynamic farmers with uh uh with uh farmers that that blow with farmers that don't blow uh uh with uh farmers that use pesticides with others that don't use so the the because electroculture is like an um it's like until now in agriculture we looked on the on the physical part of life like on the and the chemical part also in organic farming we we look about nutrients in the soil and and the life in the soil but we didn't look about the whole invisible uh electromagnetic influences on life well electroculture with electroculture we would we will look at that aspect of life and we will do everything to optimize to improve that aspect and it's good and it's useful for all kind of uh uh farming methods uh you can add that you can yeah thanks for presencing that yeah like my mom um she passed over in 2015 and she was a pioneer in in the farming and industry and mbc here the organic industry and um and biodynamics too a bit and uh one of her superpowers and gifts was to just to hold space for all farmers because she really believed that we're all doing the best we can with what we know with where we're at and we all want to grow good food and um provide for our families and um do what we really believe and feel is best so i deeply honor your work and the way that you're showing up for farmers so thank you for that um the other question i had do you have a few more minutes yes yes okay awesome is um you've been using electroculture with bees as well so tell us about that yes bees well like you see on my antennas i put beeswax around and and why is this it's not to protect the magnet some people think that but it's not to protect the magnet the idea is that the magnetic field will go through the beeswax field will go through the beeswax and will um will be impregnated by uh the the frequencies that you will find of all the molecules uh of the beeswax and beeswax is really an incredible substance because in beeswax you will find all the molecules corresponding with all essential oils of all the flowers of all the plants that the bees visit so when you know that one um one essential oil of a flower uh corresponds already with thousands of different molecules that are all natural all beneficial frequencies well uh in beeswax you will find not only from one kind of flower but from uh hundreds of them of different flowers lavender uh all kind of flowers and so it's really very rich and very powerful uh energy and when you smell good beeswax you're always happy it's like it's kind of like a drug but the natural it's like you you you cannot be sad when you smell uh good beeswax it's like a smell that it's it's like you are in a in a field in the mountains full of flowers but it's just in that beeswax yeah you can smell nothing long yeah i've bees i'm looking at my beeswax candles i can't reach them but i agree they're just there's something so there is something special and and so uh i needed beeswax for making my antennas and then i i was uh thinking oh they speak always that bees are disappearing and and dying and and then i i was concerned because i i i would like to to help them to survive because we need the beeswax to to to make a lot of things and so i began to read articles and to learn about the bees and bees and insects in general are very uh sensitive to electromagnetic fields and the magnet and magnetism and there there was a a patent or an inventor in the 80s in in the usa that uh discovered already that when you put magnets on a on a beehive that it creates it it stimulates them it's like the magnetic field of the magnet stimulate them and they they they had a higher yield and also they had a lot less uh sicknesses and problems and and they have a a lot higher survival rate every winter like around more than 50 percent more survival rate than before and so i began to to put magnets on my bees uh beehives and to and to uh and to speak about that idea and to promote that idea and more and more beekeepers began to to uh to do that with very good results a lot have really good results and then i discovered other techniques like to put a copper strip at the at the entrance of the the beehive because copper is a natural antibacterial effect uh they they used it in hospitals before or in the kitchen because it has a natural antibacterial effect and so when the bees will walk above the copper they they they will walk in walk out walk in walk out well every time they will take some copper ions inside the beehive and it will help them to protect against uh uh fungi against bacterial disease and also against the varroa might so that a little insect that uh that is a parasite of the bees and so the the the bees are a lot more stronger they have less problems with the varroa might and a lot less problems with all other kind of disease and then there is another technique uh that i use too now it's uh the lakowski coil so i put um an oscillation circuit at the on the on the south face of of the beehive and this works also quite well and then when you put an oscillation circuit so it's like like i have a bracelet here it's just a copper uh band that is open it's not a closed it's open and that creates like a mini oscillation circuit like a like a radio circuit that collects the natural radio frequencies of the earth uh so the good ones mostly and it will amplify them uh mostly on the north side of it so that's why i put on the south side of the of the beehive and it will increase the life force energy of the bees and since i do that uh my personal results in my own garden uh i have like uh for example last year i had four beehives without without anything without uh electroculture and then i have six beehives with the electroculture techniques well after the winter five of the six survived and from the the control group only one survived of the four so uh it's a whole difference difference and in my place in my region uh the beekeepers mostly lose like 30 50 percent sometimes 80 sometimes 90 percent of all their beehives every winter so it's it's really a huge problem uh the the idea also is it's a hypothesis uh why magnets uh affects so much uh or is so beneficial for the beehive the i the idea maybe is that the bees are really disturbed by the electromagnetic pollution and it's like the planet earth the planet earth has a magnetic field and that magnetic field protects against too much of the of of the solar magnetic field of the solar activity if we would not have that magnetic field on earth then the probably the all life on earth would would be not uh as today we will all be burned down because or or or or like uh or we will be in shortcut because of too much electricity from the sun and and then on the bees maybe it it works also like this like it makes like a protective shield against the the electromagnetic pollution uh and maybe a lot of uh uh uh and maybe a lot of uh electroculture antennas works like this because today in our gardens or the plants are really disturbed by the electromagnetic pollution there was even a science article uh in the rocky mountains or of the usa they did an experiment they compared the growth of uh little uh of trees and they put trees some trees in a faraday cage a faraday cage is to protect from electro pollution and uh and other trees were controlled they put in a plastic cage that that doesn't protect against pollution but but just to have the same light intensity because the cage takes a little bit of the light of the sun and so they they compare the growth well at the end of the season the growth of the the new growth of the trees in the faraday cage was double than the one without a faraday cage it shows that today all plants are for me that's my hypothesis all plants and even humans animals we are all disturbed and all depressed by that electro pollution because in nature it didn't exist and now we are like stressed by that pollution and our bodies our cells need to to spend energy to become again normal uh because of that that in the past they didn't need to spend energy to to be to to to to against the electro pollution and so we lose energy on things we we didn't need to and so uh we are all weaker and so it's important to increase the good energies because otherwise we lose energy otherwise we are too much um aggressed by those uh electromagnetic pollutions yeah so true it it it's good to shield also but shielding it's not always good because you when we shield against electro pollution we shield also against the good frequencies of the earth and we need them so what do you suggest to do to energize how to to implement all electroculture techniques that you can find so in your home you're talking like in your home in your garden in your farm yes yes and you can uh for example i i showed already uh two three techniques like uh you can put uh basalt rocks in the garden or basalt sand or powder uh why because basalt comes from the volcanoes and it's mostly very magnetic uh but has a natural magnetic uh property that we call paramagnetism and in the usa there is a famous inventor researcher that is called uh philip uh callahan he wrote a lot of books about this and now he i think he died now he he he but he was really very interesting guy and his books are still available and um well those those magnetic particles will interact with the earth magnetic field and amplify them locally and it's shown in science articles now that when you when they amplify even like by 10 20 30 percent the local magnetic field all plants uh grow better or or live better or a lot more resistant also and when the magnetic field is weaker then all living organisms weaker because because we grow on earth with with the magnetic field of the earth since billions of years and the the energy of all living organisms is directly related with the energy of the earth the energy uh so when the earth energy uh reduces uh naturally or not naturally uh well then it will affect us too and while we and now we are in uh in a cycle every um i don't know but every thousands of years uh the magnetic field of the earth flips over and the north pole becomes south pole and the south pole becomes north pole yeah well uh in the in the meantime it doesn't flip like this in in one second it it flips over time so it's like the magnetic field grows increases and then it decreases and then it's very very weak and then it flips over and then it increases again and now we are in a period where the magnetic field of the earth is very low because it will flip one time maybe maybe tomorrow or maybe in thousands of years but uh it's it's uh it's uh that solar activity uh makes also some problems uh because uh it's it's very intense energy and um uh with electroculture it's like we will increase the magnetic field uh first with the magnetic antennas we will like locally increase the magnetic field and so we feel better we have more energy we we sleep better i put all that that's the one i took in my sleeping room because i sleep on it okay and that's just that's a magnet covered with beeswax yes uh and and then i put also wire and i put it under my um mattress mattress oh your mattress okay cool yes i put it under but you put it in the garden too and so when you put basalt you put this you put other antennas you will all increase those electromagnetic electrical magnetic natural energies that will increase life and you will see life exploding in the garden a lot of a lot more diversity uh singing birds uh also more different insects uh uh uh uh uh you you have uh good insects and the bat but when you do electroculture you will see a lot more biodiversity of the good guys of the good uh living organisms brilliant absolutely brilliant yannick um what does biodiversity mean to you biodiversity for me it's like a result when there is harmony and good energy um it's like uh the whales in the in the ocean you have first water energy then you have little microorganism and then bigger ones and bigger ones and bigger ones and then you have the whales and um it's like also the rain the the the warm the earth warm in the soil it's like the wheels in the ocean you you have first you have just soil and and and and or volcanic rock and and energy and water and then you have little bacteria and then you have little more than plants and then and then you have the whales of the soil the earth warm and then you have a lot and then you have the birds that eat the earth warm and then you have more and more living complex uh living organisms you see it's a it's a result of good energies and uh and diverse and it creates diversity if if we if we are in bad energy then the diversity reduces and and and uh and the complex living organisms disappear uh and uh i see it like this uh and on i see it like this on an energetic uh point uh of view i love that i love that lens and uh and and what does cultivating life mean to you well life if you go uh mike my uh uh conclusion uh uh conclusion uh at the end uh of of the search where i am too it's uh it's really uh spiritual life energy uh um um um yes it's it's really um uh when you search for life energy and you you you become uh spiritual it's not possible otherwise because it's a big mystery so you it's like you are searching truth you are searching uh from where it is and then you become very humble because it's like science science in in in a good way it brings you closer to god if you look at the nature as as a reflection or as as um as the creation of god then the more you understand nature the more you understand god the the more it's like you want to understand god so the more you you you you look how nature works and life energy well the more you you come closer to god but we but it will always be a mystery because we are not god but we can do a lot of things like god because the the and the bible they say that god created man as the image of him so we we can do a lot of things but we are not god and there we can and so the more we we understand we can see it as as uh as as really uh uh how to say that um uh we can see nature as marvelous and a wonder a wonder that we try to understand we we are just a little children that try to understand uh children that try to understand uh the garden that discover a snail or discover uh an earthworm in the garden and we are looking wow well how how does he act what what does he do well a scientist uh at a certain point is like a child just just uh uh that is so wondering how nature works and every time we we learn things we we are we are like praising god that wow that's wonderful uh how how you how how it's like you you tell to your friend how did you get that idea to do that like this well it's it's uh well god that had a lot of ideas like this it's uh and then uh life becomes uh more and more magic in a certain way or more and more marvelous and and and and then and then you can only respect life you can only respect the creation uh even if you don't believe in god i think you cannot not believe in god when you really go deep in trying to understand nature it's it's not possible i think uh but today um they they want to make us uh uh the most stupid as possible because then we don't ask questions and we don't and we don't want to know the truth we just uh live uh uh like robots but we are not robots we are all we we we are all looking for truth and for uh life we we want to feel that we live that we live and and and that our life has a sense that that that that that we really contribute and that uh and uh to to to make a better world in a certain way uh i hope so and uh me too and so we we can only then want more and more life and so we we don't want anything that kills life because that that's not what god wants too it's even in the bible that you will not kill your your uh your other humans or but in a certain way in nature also you don't kill to kill you just if if you if you eat a plant or an animal or or or whatever it's it's it's it's always with respect it's not it's with respect to life and and and to the wonder of life it's it's not uh just uh as a consumption good that you have to use or produce uh yeah so that's how i i see it um that's beautiful yannick that's beautiful thank you for your time today i really appreciate you sharing your life experiences and your journey of discovering and working with electric culture and i'm really really curious and excited to see where electric culture grows and how it grows in the upcoming years i think it will really grow big and and we are like we are like cultivating the seeds of tomorrow it's like we we we are really uh today um there are not many farmers knowing about but it's it's not so a problem uh uh the what we need to do it just continue to experiment because everything we will we will have discovered yeah and uh and and improved will be ready for the next one that will continue uh to do it you see i want to say thank you so much i appreciate you and your wisdom and all that you do so thank you for serving and sharing thank you too for organizing the soil summit and uh it's always very interesting and and and uh and soil is is um yes it's very i i want to i had the choice to help industrial farmers in greenhouses with artificial substrates and so to do electroculture but that that is not what i like i want to grow food in real soil with life in the soil and increase the life in the soil and to come back to with time to little farmers that that really cultivate uh real soil real plants and and biodiversity and that makes that life is really we all want to live in a nice garden we don't want to live in a concrete box of with artificial lights and agriculture like this no we we want i think well that's my goal too uh uh with really uh grow food help to growing food in in really nice conditions and then you you will find that energy in the food and so the environment the energy of the environment uh you will find it in the food so in in the so it's important to to work on on on that it's it's not just um and the soil is a very important aspect yeah very important and energetically too every every mineral in the soil corresponds with a certain crystal and with certain frequencies and so every soil will will have another influence on the on the qualities of of a vegetable like you see it very good with the wine and grapes because when you have uh uh an acid soil you will have uh other kind of wine than when you have uh a very uh calcium soil or alkaline soil and things so well in reality it's with all kind of vegetables like this and and and so we we need to to promote that diversity and and and and and and that living aspect and to become more and more sensitive to it because when we when we begin to taste that then we become more and more sensitive to it and and and then we see that it's not only food for our body but it's food for our thoughts for our spiritual life too it's it's really food at all levels uh it's uh yeah so thank you very much yeah it's my honor it is a pleasure thank you very much thank you all right big love bright blessings thank you if you want to learn more about electric culture be sure to go and check out yannick's website and you'll be able to find his book at his website all about electric culture yannick's website
