Training Out of Control Pole Beans!

Howto & Style
 A really common question that I get is how to handle when this happens. So these are some pole beans right here that I have planted out and they've actually already climbed up the top of the trellis and are now starting to reach out and find somewhere else to continue growing. So what I usually do is I will train them to either go to the side like this or try and just get them to climb right back down so that way they can get dense and come and take over this entire trellis that I have right here.
