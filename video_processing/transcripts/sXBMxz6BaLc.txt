Travel & Events
 Planning a trip to Costa Rica? Add agritourism to your itinerary. Agritourism is all about visiting local farms, vineyards, orchards, and rural producers while on vacation. It's a great way to explore beautiful landscapes, taste fresh products, and support the island. Agritourism focuses on sustainable farming practices, responsible water usage, and preserving biodiversity. By supporting these efforts, we contribute to saving the planet and helping local communities by creating jobs, supporting small-scale farmers, and preserving cultural traditions. In Costa Rica, I saw the production of chocolate, pineapples, and coffee. So if you want to taste something good and do something good, support agritourism on your next trip.
