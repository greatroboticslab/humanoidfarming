 I'm Alvina Maynard, owner-operator of River Hill Ranch, an alpaca farm and agritourism destination in Richmond, Kentucky. I transitioned from the military into agriculture and gosh I knew nothing about ag before I got into it so I started from zero. So it was really because of organizations like the Farmer Veteran Coalition. We're so blessed to live in Kentucky, the Kentucky Department of Agriculture with the Kentucky PROUD program that also started the Homegrown by Heroes brand which is a logo that we can put on military veteran that have transitioned into farming on our products to be able to show consumers that this product was produced by a farmer veteran. There's also the Kentucky Center for Ag and Rural Development which has been totally instrumental in making sure that our business plan and financials were solid and thanks to the extension offices, our extension agents were incredible in making sure that I learned how to grow grass because I didn't know anything about growing grass and it was a news flash to me oddly enough that if I had animals that ate grass that I should probably learn how to grow it. So all of those things from the business management standpoint to the agriculture standpoint reaching out would be my biggest advice. Doing the internet searches, social media, finding those organizations that are that exist in order to support new beginning farmers. There are tons of them out there to support you both in training and workshops, demonstrations and the business management aspect of it as well.
