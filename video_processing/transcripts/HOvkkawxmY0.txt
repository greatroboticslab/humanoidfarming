 Did you forget about those potatoes growing in the back of your cabinets? Don't just throw those potatoes away. Instead, let's plant them. All you'll need is a 10-gallon grow bag, three of your sprouted potatoes, and some high-quality organic potting mix. Start with filling your grow bag up four inches or about a third of the bag. Next, place your potatoes on top of the soil with the sprout side facing up, and be sure to space your potatoes evenly for maximum yield. Now it's time to add another four inches of soil to cover up the potatoes. Now place the potatoes in a sunny spot and give them a heavy watering, but don't relax yet. There's still some work to do. When your plants are six to eight inches, fill the whole bag with soil like this. This is called hilling, and it will massively increase your harvest. Are you going to grow potatoes this year?
