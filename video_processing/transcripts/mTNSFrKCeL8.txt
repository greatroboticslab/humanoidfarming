 This is the easiest way to do the stack glitch. Make sure you purchase and equip a trowel, then select whatever plant you want. Pick it up, then move it to a location and set it down. Then pick up the same plant once again, move it, but instead of placing it back down, just unequip the trowel. Do the same thing for the other plants until you're satisfied, then leave and rejoin the game. And once you rejoin the game, they should all be stacked.
