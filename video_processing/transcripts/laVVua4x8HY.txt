 FarmAfrica has been working in Ethiopia for the last 35 years focusing on rural agriculture, natural resource management as well as market systems and market engagement, supporting smallholder farmers and pastoralists to improve their livelihoods. We have presence all over Ethiopia except unfortunately in the north we no longer have our offices closed due to the conflict but otherwise we are in all the regions except Dredawah and Harar.

Saddam Mohamed is one of the farmers who lacked access to agricultural inputs. Saddam neither could afford to buy nor acquired the skills on how to apply the inputs on his farm. We have to buy the farm, and we have to buy the farm. Like Saddam, the vast majority of farmers living in the district could not afford to buy farm inputs.

This fact meant many farmers like Sada Mohammed did not use agricultural inputs at all, which significantly compromised their production and productivity, thereby adversely affecting their incomes and livelihoods. To address this gap, Farm Africa and its project consortium partners Mercy, Cops and ORDA worked to create a fertile ground for agro-dealers to open shops in places accessible to smallholder farmers. Farm Africa provided technical assistance and training to these agro-dealers, cooperatives and private input suppliers. The agro-dealers are now offering high-quality farm inputs at affordable prices using a cost-sharing modality. It is good to look every one of our own products.
