 It is not in Burkina Faso that they will come to give crumbs because they are hungry. It is not in Burkina Faso. It should no longer be seen as beggars. It is us who should give to others what we have not finished consuming. It is us who should do the right thing. That is why I say I invite people to change their mindset. Believe in yourselves. It is possible. There are many challenges. There are many challenges. There are many things to accomplish. Just now I discussed with the customary...

In the heart of the Sahel, a quiet revolution is taking root. One led not by force, but by shovels, seeds, and technology. At the forefront is Captain Ibrahim Traori, Burkina Faso's transitional president, who saw promise in the nation's vast, underused land. His vision, a future where Burkinaabe youth are trained in modern agriculture, transforming them into the architects of their own prosperity. Launched in March 2025, this initiative is more than policy. It's a declaration that the country's greatest resource is its people. Traora aims to rewrite the story of African agriculture, turning Burkina Faso into a breadbasket for the region. The plan tackles youth unemployment, food insecurity, and economic stagnation by empowering young people to cultivate their land sustainably. By investing in skills and self-reliance, the government is planting seeds of dignity and independence. This marks a pivotal shift. Agriculture is no longer a last resort, but a sophisticated, profitable profession. The soil beneath their feet becomes a canvas for innovation and a pathway to a prosperous future. This is about nation-building, creating a legacy of self-reliance and a brighter tomorrow. President Traori's agricultural initiative is built on three clear goals. First, dramatically boost food production so Burkina Faso can feed itself year-round, ending reliance on imports. Second, achieve food self-sufficiency, keeping precious currency in the country and insulating it from global shocks. Third, empower rural youth by making farming a viable, attractive career, offering training, resources, and land. This revitalizes rural economies, curbs urban migration, and turns young people into job creators. The three goals, production, self-sufficiency, and youth empowerment, form a virtuous cycle of growth. As production rises, so does self-sufficiency, which strengthens the economy and creates more opportunities. Empowered young farmers drive further innovation and prosperity. This holistic approach aims to reshape Burkina Faso's economic and social landscape for the better. Training is hands-on and rigorous, turning novices into skilled professionals at institutions like the Murku National School of Agriculture. Trainees learn market gardening, fruit and cereal production, fish farming, and organic composting, building a foundation for sustainable agriculture. The curriculum goes beyond growing crops. It teaches business skills, from planning and finance, to marketing and value chains. This focus transforms participants into entrepreneurs, not just producers. Early testimonials show the impact young people mastering new techniques and shifting their aspirations toward agricultural entrepreneurship. These stories reveal a change in mindset. Youth now see agriculture as a path to success. The program is igniting passion and ambition in a new generation. It's not just about skills, it's about inspiring a movement. Even in its early days, the initiative is delivering real results. The first cohort produced over 30 tons of organic manure and established nurseries for thousands of hectares. These achievements are more than statistics. They symbolize a new era of knowledge and optimism. Farming is now seen as modern and lucrative, inspiring thousands more to join. Trainees are spreading their knowledge, becoming ambassadors for change in their communities. The goal of training 8,000 young entrepreneurs is within reach, sparking a nationwide movement. The government's vision is becoming reality, with trainees applying their skills and producing tangible goods. The first harvest is measured not just in crops, but in renewed hope across the nation. The government's support goes beyond training. Thousands of tractors and modern equipment are being deployed. Mechanization allows young farmers to cultivate more land efficiently, marking a leap forward for Bukinabe agriculture. Graduates receive 12.5 hectare plots in their communities, turning training into immediate action. 4,000 hectares are being prepared for these new entrepreneurs, giving them a real stake in the future. The vision includes agro-industrial zones to process local produce, creating jobs and reducing post-harvest losses. The plan is to build a complete value chain from farm to factory to family table and eventually to export markets. Large-scale irrigation and expanded training centers will ensure year-round production and nationwide participation. This is a sustained national effort to build a thriving, self-sufficient agricultural sector. A new generation of empowered farmers is leading the way. The initiative is transforming agriculture into a driver of economic growth and environmental sustainability. By making farming attractive, it tackles youth unemployment and curbs rural urban migration. Local economies benefit as new agri-entrepreneurs spend and invest in their communities. Climate-smart practices, organic composting, efficient irrigation, crop rotation and agroforestry are at the program's core. This ensures today's gains don't come at tomorrow's expense, restoring soil and conserving water. Agro-industrial zones add value, create skilled jobs and boost national income. Reducing food imports strengthens economic sovereignty and resilience to global shocks. The initiative empowers a generation to innovate, proving that sustainable development and growth go hand in hand. President Roré's message is one of national pride and continental ambition. This initiative is more than policy. It's a movement for dignity, sovereignty and self-sufficiency. We are equipping our people to feed generations to come, he declares. Agriculture is reframed as liberation, a path to economic power and independence. Burkina Faso is setting a model for Africa, showing that solutions lie within. In a land, youth and leadership. The program is a blueprint for genuine independence, urging other nations to invest in their own people. It challenges pessimistic narratives, proving youth can drive economic growth with the right support. If successful, this model could inspire a continent-wide shift toward modern, self-reliant agriculture. Roré envisions a green, prosperous, youth-led Burkina Faso. Mechanized, productive and a net food exporter. This is not just about crops. It's about cultivating a future of limitless possibility. As reactions continue to pour in from across the continent, one thing is clear. Africa is demanding respect, sovereignty and accountability.
