Forage Crops as Cover Crops

 Because dairy farms typically need to spread about half of their manure in fall, we have been looking at which kinds of crops can utilize those nutrients to grow a crop that can be harvested and used on the dairy farm. And this is an example of winter rye or cereal rye, which is a great forage that we harvest for rye silage in the spring. So we applied manure and then planted this winter rye and we'll harvest it about May 20th for a very useful forage crop, especially for dry cows and heifers. And that way we have a root system that is protecting the soil from erosion, utilizing that manure to grow feed and we don't need to import as much feed. And it's also, as you can see, good for suppressing weeds and the root system is promoting soil health microbial activity in the rhysosphere. Behind us we have some other species that can be used as cover crops, crimson clover, and also a rye silage that was planted there after sorghum sudangrass. And then around us we have of course our perennials, alfalfa and orchard grass, which are other wonderful crops for year-round soil conservation, building organic matter and soil nitrogen.
