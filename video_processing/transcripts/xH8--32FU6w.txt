 On this modern family farm, the future is always front of mind. Found any boys you want? And even during the worst drought they've ever seen, Katrina and Mark Swift have plenty to be proud of. We're growing more grain now than what we did in previous droughts that we thought were pretty bad. Their farm business has spent years embracing new research, technology and seed varieties and helping improve soil quality. This is what we call ground cover. This crop isn't good quality, but rather than cut it to make hay and quick cash, they're keeping it on the ground. So it stops wind erosion, water erosion and it holds that soil, the soil particles together. During this drought the wind has barely stopped. It's driving people nuts. And because of the way some soil is being cultivated, it's so dry and livestock are kicking it up. And that means the dust is just blowing everywhere. Something farmers like John Gladigo have seen before. There was not a blade of grass on our entire farm. There was just nothing. It was just erosion. That was it. Since the 1982 drought, John Gladigo and his business partner have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in no-till farming. They grow crops without disturbing the soil. Now there's ground cover almost everywhere and no dust. This year we've had the same amount of rainfall as we had in 1982 and basically the soil is still held together. But smart solutions can only go so far, especially if there's no significant rain next year. I don't know what we do because there'll be no ground cover anywhere. We can grow some barley. It's why they'd like to see farmers rewarded for taking care of the environment. The federal government's developing a trial to give farmers money to improve biodiversity. Because if you're going to get paid to do something that society wants and it looks after your environment as well, where's the downside in this? Thinking about the future of farming.
