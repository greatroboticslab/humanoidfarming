 One of the key successes with no-till is determinate upon how diverse the rotation is. There's lots of different things going on in a native prairie system. That's Mother Nature's rotation. Mother Nature has the ability to put those things in place to bring diversity to the soil, to feed the soil, and just through those different time frames, it creates an environment for soil biology to continue to thrive. We grow multiple different crops, mostly for forage. Alfalfas, peas and oats, different cane sorghums, milos, corns, all of those go towards forage or grain production for feed. It gives me lots of different opportunities to grow a lot of different crops, which lends itself very nicely for the rotation that we develop. One of the new things that has come to play is cover crops. Cover crops is a great tool to add to those monocultural systems to help bring more diversity back to that soil. Cover crops are bringing another dimension of diversity to the soil system that wasn't there before. It's actually going to increase yields and it's certainly going to improve the soil characteristics as a whole. of how you are doing more than just to make sure the ground wound up holdingerness in a jardin That we really love figuring out how to best do and build them in ouracements. The fall, this week will begin a couple steps from transfers andedars on a larger basis to take risks to the soil using rankings out elles in the registry.
