 old alishan with tobacco on good tires even got a little friend under there all right welcome back to cnc equipment's youtube channel we are off site today in monrovia indiana at the ted everett farm equipment auction you guys have seen me up here a few times in the past it's mainly a farm sale but i do have some construction equipment and stuff like that so bought that little ford tractor a little while back here that we got going and fixed up so we're going to take a peek and see what they got so i'll have two rings running one will be selling golf carts lawn mowers and stuff like that other ring will be selling the big tractors and the yellow construction equipment plenty of lawn mowers this is a uh april sale i have this every two months what mine picking up a cheap lawn mower for the new uh building we got in helmsburg we'll have another third truck that starts selling around noon or so here we're getting ready to start on smaller tractors here shortly i got some construction equipment over here i'm gonna check out this little john deere some of this stuff has some higher hours on it and showing that was changed in january at 3400 hours painted the latch over here john deere under courage supper sprockets those are under aftermarket blade face looks original it's pretty good shape they put a quickie paint job on it and painted over grease and everything any? some mop balls in here where you blinded ours? oh this custom is running eyesaninating quick insanely IM Pretty nice little dozer we're going to keep our eyes on. I think the hours are right on that. Checking a backhoe out here. You can tell it's come from the same place as that dozer. We've got the same mothballs in it, the same smell. 6,100 hours, a little more than I usually like to see but we'll keep our eye on it. Whoever had these two pieces, it took pretty good care of their stuff. Old TD15C. You guys see me mess with some of these dressers and stuff on the channel. I've got this thing laid way forward. I see that cut to arm. You guys see that blade pitched? I had problems with it going in some hard ground. Somebody's cut and added that piece to this rod here. The blade pushed way back. The only reason to do that, the ground is super, super hard. If the ground is soft, that blade is going to suck in really, really bad. Let's weld some patches on the blade. The rails aren't terrible. There's no farm dozer. Let's see if she starts up. Whatever the weather is perfect. Not evil. Sloan is very curious. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Alright, I'm probably going to pass on that dude unless it's like dirt cheap. Raider has got a leak in. I smell antifreeze. You know what? It's just an old farm tractor. See you in a few hours. I guess I'm coming to a couple buckets. The hour is rolling up. 3600. She's dead. We got a John Deere 85. 85G. Coming with some filters. It's like it's dead too. It's like it's dead too. Wait till they get that. It shows it's got 2400 hours on it. One thing about this auction. They do stand behind this stuff to run and drive and do what it's supposed to unless they say otherwise. So, take it home and something's the matter with it. They'll let you bring it back. So, it does. This auction tends to bring more money because of that. Another thing is Ted Everett actually owns almost all this equipment. He buys it with his own money and sells it. So, no premiums, no reserves. Like I say, it does bring higher prices than most normal auctions because of that. But, little Alice Chalmers. Neek little backo. Love is here... It feels like buying it. The contestbar has only been Luc пользовat. If you're from here you play a girl. Pretty cool old all over it looks like propane maybe. Now we'll get all this stuff running and drive it through that building. Old bike. Old case. Old Alistair McBacco on good tires. Even got a little friend under there. You're going to lose your eggs later. 410G over there it's a little rusty. Rougher than I like to buy. Case. Loader. That's a little. That's a little. So yeah. 410G over there. It's a little rusty. Rougher than I like to buy. Case. Loader. Loader The church was 996 hours pretty clean Stay tuned horsepower The vide probably should be walking and do somethingtor 8 hours on this 6,600 hours that's way too many for to likes of her John Deere's got 6,300 hours on it. One thing I like to check on these backhoes is how loose the back end is on them. You get play right down here in this joint. Not terrible. A little more hours I'd like to see but it is fairly tight so we'll keep an eye. On this one. Been serviced pretty regularly. Pick up a lot of new dealer trade in stuff. That's what a lot of this is. Sometimes you see some higher hours on it. This one has been loading some salt. 2700 hours. 1800 hours. There's a lot of new dealer. There's a lot of new dealer. There's a lot of new dealer. There's a lot of new dealer. Combines as far as you can see. So they'll sell the smaller tractors and kind of work into the construction equipment. Then they'll start selling the combines and these big tractors. A lot of times they're here until midnight. When they have some big sales. Green heads. Green heads. This thing looks weird to me. I'm not a tractor guy but. I'm assuming this is set up for a 4 wheel drive and somebody ordered it at 2 wheel drive. Why that's all cut out like that. Like that 60-68 in it. Pretty clean tractor you don't see every day. 2-1-55 4 wheel drive. There's a lot of new dealer. There's a lot of new dealer. A big Ford Versatile. What I see is a lot of new dealers. I see this random line of trailers. Truck and stuff. Looks like one owner is selling out. He's got these lined up. Because he probably does not own these. He's selling them for the company or bank or somebody like that. that so these will sell as is probably around noon or so today i usually try to do that around noon sometimes he has these or sometimes he has on-site sales this sale they have every two months the first friday of the month so this over here is where the ring three is going to sell it's a lot of miscellaneous stuff the dead row stuff that don't run all that good stuff pretty clean old c50 old green truck don't look rusty so is now is okay now so now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now now 50 all done. 9,500. 7,500.
