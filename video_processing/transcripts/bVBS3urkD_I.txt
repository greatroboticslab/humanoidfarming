100 Players Simulate Island Civilization in Project Zomboid

Gaming
 In one of the biggest social experiments ever done in Project Zomboid, I trapped 100 players on a zombie infested island. And with only 1 life and limited resources, how will they survive on here? Will they spend their supplies sparingly and try to work together, or just throw over their chance at the functioning of society and go to all out war? Only time would tell as the event began. Go, go, go! Go, go! God feed all of us! You guys stink! Fuckers, you want to do this together man? Who's talking? That's Orphan talking there. Guys follow me! We're gonna get guns! Orphan's our strong leader, follow him. Oh my god. Where the hell are we going? We're just going where the wind takes us! This is not a plan! Oh, we're dead. We're so dead. Keep running! Santa Claus, no! They got Santa! I don't know this map! Now, having 100 players stuck on a pretty small island that was infested with zombies, you'd think it'd be absolute chaos. But the players who knew this map had a goal in mind, to get to the limited gun spawns. And with these spots having the most dangerous weapons on the map, you'd think the players would fight over the guns, but instead they were acting pretty friendly to each other. Hi friends! Hey, I know you! Crest Boyd! Oh hi, Slipi! Oh my goodness! So good to see you! What's your game plan? I'm looking for a weapon. So am I. Guys, follow me! We're gonna get guns! Open the door! Alright, alright, alright, alright. Close the door behind you! I'm gonna get behind you. We gotta break this door guys, we gotta break this door. Oh, I'm good! Alright, oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! Uh, yep, alright. That's their problem, that's their problem. Yay! We in! Take everything, girls! Take everything, girls! Am I with you guys? Am I coming with you guys? Are we friends? Yeah, yeah, yeah! Now, this player named Sleepy Witch had just joined a group at this police station, and after looting the police station, they then found another friendly group nearby, who they decided to meet up with, and formed something that you probably wouldn't expect. I feel like 20% of the servers are on right at this location. For real! Yeah! I feel like we should all have one group. Yeah, we could just form one group. I don't know if everybody should serve them. Yeah, big group. Monkey, Monkey Strong together. Do we rename Monkey Strong? Monkey Strong! Monkey Strong! Monkey Strong! Monkey Strong! Okay, okay, okay. This was the largest group that's been formed in any of my events, and they called themselves Monkey Strong, or MS for short. Now, having this many members would be a blessing and a curse, because while it helped with gathering resources and fighting, the sheer task of trying to coordinate this many people was pretty daunting to say the least, especially when one of the first things they decided to do was coordinated dancing. But while they were trying to organize themselves, they did mention something that was pretty important. I have one ice cream left if someone wants it. Please! Do we know if the cult is playing this fun? Don't they have like combined 10k hours in PvPing or something? Probably! Yeah! It's not gonna be like it at all. Jesus! It's ridiculous! It's crazy bro! MS was talking about the cult clan, one of the most dangerous clans in Project Zomboi, known for having members with thousands of hours in the game, and being generally feared by most players. And while they weren't here this time because of the no preform group role, one of their members were, and that member was a man named Strudel. Ow! What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? Yo, can I get a ride? Hell no. You can get a gusset. Nope. And right off the bat, Strudel took any opportunity he could to run over other players. Even though he was here without his whole clan, as it was proven in the Rebuild Civilization video on my Harvest Z channel, he alone could still be very dangerous, especially for large and uncoordinated groups like MS. The only thing that would change the fate of these players were the gun spawns. But a lot of them were already looted, so players opted to head to the most valuable spot that they knew of. And that was the armory. A spot with literally more guns than players on the island. And the players knew this existed because this event was hosted on the popular Kingsmouth island map, which I did have 3D modeled just for this video. Anyways, that armory was located here. And as you can see, there was only one way to get to it because of this huge fence. And paired with a massive amount of zombies, looting this armory would be much harder than the players thought. Okay, let's keep going to the military base. Okay, you and me bro, we got this. Alright. Come on, let's keep going. God bless. I'm gonna take you to the end. Okay, let's go man. Alright, here I go. Oh dear Jesus. Jack? Jack, you there? I'm over here, I'm back by the gatehouse. How'd it do? That guy has an MP5 on him. Hey, do you guys mind helping me? No. Step in man. Back up, back up. I'm coming, I'm coming. Go, go, go. You gotta run man. Ah Jesus. Wait no, Jack! No, no! No! No! No! No! No! No, man, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! You're gonna die within 60 seconds. Oh, he's alive! He did it! Holy shit! God damn it! I don't know who can help you check. Um, you just trapped me. I'm trapped! No! Help! You guys just killed him. You guys just killed him. After leaving his teammate to die, they didn't even care to check if he had died or not, and he happened to still somehow be alive underneath a giant horde of zombies, and it was up to some strangers to try their best to help him out. They can't get to me! They can't get to me! Oh, dear Jesus! Please, somebody! Hi, how are you doing? Uh, can you maybe not drive directly over me? All right! No! No! Not like this! Not like this, god damn it! Hi, hi! You mind helping me out here? How are you doing? Yeah, I'm uh... Oh, shit! Yeah, I'm kind of stuck under this car. Look, I have um... I'm trapped under that uh... I'm trapped under this uh wreck here. Oh, if you move that vehicle, I'm afraid they'll uh... I'll uh get unstuck and then they'll uh... they'll be able to bite me! Oh, I'm out! I'm out! No! Ah! Ah! Ah! Dude, what the fuck? I think he died. Well then! God damn it! After literally abandoning his teammate to the horde, Orphan then went on the former clan named the Kings of Kingsmouth, but I'm not too sure if people who leave their teammates to die are worthy of the title of king. But regardless, Orphan and his dead duo weren't the only ones with their eyes set on the armory. Fucking strudel. Strudel from the cult clan is here in his little car. Already had the giant guns fawn. Oh no, but Glenn's here. Glenn's inside already! Oh my god! He has the key! Bruh! Oh, baby! Now this, I can get used to. Now this player, Glenn, was the first person in the armory. And as you saw before, Strudel was lurking around it as well. And after finding a duo, he opted to try and loot the armory for himself. This could be dangerous for Glenn, but he'd play this a bit smarter than you might expect. Wanna try to get this armory? Does he have a key? He does not have a key. Oh, I have a crowbar. I can actually pry this open. That's hilarious. Ooh! Uh, come through, come through. Evening, gentlemen. Armory's all yours. I got my itch. Now, I don't know if you realize the severity of what just happened. Strudel, the same cult clan member I referenced earlier, now had control of the majority of the guns and ammo on the island. If Strudel had bad intentions or no one was going to try and contest this, this could literally be the end for all players in this event. But there were a lot of groups trying to make their way to the armory, including the clan named Monkey Strong, who are currently suffering from their massive size and trying their best to somehow drag their entire group to the armory. But they'd soon find out that it wouldn't be too easy to do so. Dude, that's a sick mask you got on, Donald. Yeah, you're sling, honestly. Looks sick as shit. Yeah, what the hell? Gamers, hold up. One of you guys want to wear this bear mask? Oh my god, me, me, me, me, me. Put it on the ground for you. Yay. Are you sure that's a bear mask? It looks like a pig mask. I'm not going to lie. It says hog or something. Someone said mead here. Where is everybody? We have half the fucking server on this team. I know, bro. You guys know the plan? No, we've been looting all these buildings. There's a big neighborhood or something to the northeast. We're like almost there. Yeah, I think northeast would be best bet. Oh, there's a giant gate. Oh, you ding dong. Wow. The MS clan had hit the main fence that separated the island, meaning now they had to travel all the way around to get to the armory, wasting time that they really did not have as everything else was being looted by other players. Unfortunately, we have to go all the way around the map. Do you see that big lake? We have to go all the way around the map. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. We have to go back here. Dude, that's so fucked. This is a bad idea. While this was a seemingly easy path, either one of these points that they would have to pass through could be choke points that other players could try and station at. Anyways, leaving them to try and figure out how to get to the armory, Strudel and his group had formed a faction named Skib which still had complete control of the armory as I mentioned earlier and Skib was intending to keep it under their control. Oh my god. Oh my god. Woah! Woah! What's up, bruh? I should have joined the boogie board again. Oh shit, bruh! Oh no! I don't know if we should hold this. We could easily hold the entrance. There's only one way in. Yeah, you guys want to go? Yeah, for real. We should get some food. I got a car out here. I can patrol the area. There's multiple towers. I'll go out and get stuff. Like... Like, bro! Bro! That was like so not cool, bro! Fuck, I have a launch bullet. I got a gun. Strudel, bro! We gotta drive to a hospital, man! The Skib Clan were relentless and wouldn't let this armory go without a fight. And during the chaos, Cuddles had been shot in the leg and since the Skib Clan only had guns and limited medical equipment, him and Strudel planned to make his way out of the armory and to the hospital. But before they make it there, let me introduce you to a clan named The Boys. A group of laid back players just trying to survive and have fun on the island like the MS Clan. And while they were small at the moment, they were actively trying to recruit more members. But while doing so, they would find out the meaning of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Hey! That's a lot of people. Hi. Yo! Oh wow! It's an actual fashion! Hey there! Hey, what's up boys? Literally! How much you guys like The Boys? Uh, not much, man. We have a car, we're just trying to survive, you know? Where's the medical center at? Oh, it's like down the road, straight. It's like outside the base. Alright. What, are you guys taking new members? Yeah, sure. You trying to group up? Sure. Yeah, if you want to invite me and Snake, we'll definitely join. And you'll see a pop-up. Hey! I'm a boy now! Alright, so we're on our way to the police station, which is to our left, this way. Alright, I'll follow you guys. Hey, we got another scene if you need a payload. Do you want to let me drive? Yeah, sure. I'll get out, we can switch seats. Alright. Oh my god! Oh my god! I'm gonna try to get this bullet out of my head. Oh no, I got shot. I'm fleeing. This fucker just hit me, bro. We just lost a man. Get out, Snake, get out! Keep moving, keep moving. Get away from me. Get away. Just get out. Just get out. Come on, coward! Let's do it or something. Oh god, oh god, what did we do? Fuck! I took a bullet. I took one too. Go, just go. Wait, wait a minute, no. We lost, we lost Decorus! He was with us. No, we lost Decorus! We should probably move somewhere safe because of the guys. I'm gonna try to get this bullet out of my head. Ahhhhhhh! Oh god! They actually dropped. Gotta be quiet man, gotta be quiet. In my ears. The Skib Clan had just shot up these innocent players for seemingly no reason. I mean, it's not like they were defending anything. They could've just drove past them and went towards a hospital. But it seems that just like in the Rebuild Civilization video, Strudel wanted blood. And with Skib still in control of the Armory, it didn't look like anyone would be able to stop them, even though they only had 5 members. But there were still massive plans around the map. Including MS, who were still on a sort of great migration to find the Armory. But after hitting the fence, they were just trying to find places to loot. So they opted to go down this route, straight through this bridge. Which was the only connection between these two halves of the island. And with this being such a choke point, of course the Skib Clan decided to station themselves right here. Leading MS to unknowingly walk into a dangerous trap. Do we have a code word for killing people? Hey! Monkey Strap, Monkey, Monkey Week? Go Bananas? Go Bananas! Go Bananas! Go Bananas! Okay, where are we going though? Because like now we're all back together, so... I think we're going into the military base, right? I don't think the military base is a good point. That car works? Yep. Alright, I'll hop in the back. Alright, we're gonna head this way then? Yeah, yeah. Yep, this building right here. This one right here. You see all those crates? There's tools in them. Alright. Yep, check those crates and stuff. That's where they spawn. Where are we gonna go then? I'm not sure where to go, but I know we need to go somewhere. Yeah, 100%. On the ground here. Wow! Whoa! That's gross. What the hell is going on here? This does not seem very safe. Marco! Oh, there y'all are. Yo! Oh, there's my... We're gonna get wiped. Let's go Bananas? What are y'all going Bananas for? Alright, hold up guys, hold up guys. Are they shooting at us? Let's group up. They're not shooting at us. So what's the plan? What's the plan? We need to find a base that can hold all of us, gather resources, and start building something. We need to find like a big compound. There's a big building just across this road. Yeah, let's go check out this big building across the road here. Let's go scout it out. Holy shit, who are all these people? Ah! They're in the house, they're in the house, they're in the house, they're in the house. Shot, believe me. They're in the house, they're in the house, that's a story. Go Bananas, get your gun out. We fight. Wrong house, motherfucker, wrong house, bro. That's like another confirmed kill, bro. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Yeah! I'm dead, god. I'm dead, goodbye. Oh, good lord. Oh, man. Who was it? Who is it? They were geared, they were geared. They'd been to military. Pull back, you're on the bridge. Pull back from the bridge. We've lost so many. This is fucked. We need to stay in the tree line. I feel like we're abandoning our brothers in battle. There's nothing we can do for our brothers right now down there other than die. So that hurts. Oh, man. All my friends are dead. Bloody vegans dead. I'm sad. I'm really sad. All right. We can toss pipe bombs at them. The Skib Planet just committed a massacre, killing so many innocent MS members. But for what? They were just trying to find a place to live in this apocalypse. And now their group was falling apart. As I said, the armory would determine the fate of all players on this island. And it was still holding true because the Skib plan was unstoppable. But this wasn't the end of the massacre. Now that they were split up into two groups, Strudel took this opportunity to divide and conquer. Hunting each and every member of MS down. No matter the cost. it's happening. benim progressive将來的 generating攻撃,把 biraz出来比... Yo, we can chill, you know? Oh, we've lost so many! Yeah, yeah. There's only- oh, another one just died! Wait, no, Sharif and I- Monkey not strong, I guess. This did not last long. This is fucked. Yeah, I think it's her. That was a massacre. Yeah, I guess it is just us and- Yeah. Oh, what the fuck? Run. Run. Those are the same guns that killed everyone else. Just run. What the fuck? That wasn't my thing. I just walked away from there. We just need to fucking get away. Yeah. Alright, we just need to- We need to- Just get away from the gunshots. Ow! Fuck! I'm hit! Oh shit, me too. Aw, I'm dead. Monkey Strong was now fully eliminated from the event. Crushing all the dreams, goals, aspirations, all these players had going into this for seemingly no reason. What would this island look like if they were here to stay? Would they have helped build a functioning society here? Filled with shops, farms, societal structure, a way for those who senselessly kill others to be punished for their actions? Well now we'll never know because the Skib Clan decided to massacre others for their own enjoyment. And as for all the other groups on the island, they were in oblivious to the massive amount of deaths being broadcasted to all players. Crocs just died? No way dude! Just people dropping left and right man. Careful. I ain't scared! Well, I am. Dude, there's so much death. Oh damn it's fallen. Holy shit. I feel like people really want to kill. People are dying, I don't even know where. They're fighting dude, oh my god. With all these deaths, the players would definitely be more cautious in their future interactions. And speaking about interactions, right after the massacre cooled down, there was a shipwreck that was announced to all players on the island. While it wasn't specified exactly where, they were told it had a lot of guns, ammo, armor, basically any supplies the players needed. And with the Skib Clan having the best weapons on the island, the players would definitely need these to have some sort of chance against them. And so, it was a race to be the first to find it. Hey fellas, let's roll out. Guys, I heard from god that there's a ship crash. Guys, let's go. We're going to check the shores. Now with everyone in a race to check the shoreline around the entire island, of course this would lead to more players bumping into each other. Including these players, who were part of two small factions named Gub and Live, who had actually taken control of the armory. Which was dangerous, because Skib was underweight to the armory as well. But before Skib possibly clashes with these groups, if only they were in control of something that was a bit more linear and easier to hold down. Like a train from this video's sponsor. Enginefall. Enginefall is a multiplayer sandbox survival game, which combines survival, crafting, PvP, building, and extraction, in which survivors are trapped on a gigantic train, with the goal of fighting for the spot as conductor. Which is honestly very similar to my last civilization, where I trapped 100 players on a ship, and on there, they were all fighting for the powerful captain's head. But in Enginefall, you're fighting for the spot of conductor and complete control of the train. But it's not that easy. Survivors first board the rear of these massive trains, where they must craft, sneak, trade, or even fight their way to the front to overthrow the conductor. It's basically like Rust and Escape from Tarkov, combined with the movie Snowpiercer. But once they become the conductor, they are able to hold the engine room and gather the super rare loot in there. And just like how the captain can control different events in my ship's civilization, there are future plans for conductors to control the rules, carriage classes, taxes, and many other aspects of the train. But after they're satisfied, the conductor can extract to other trains and begin to fight again with their overpowered loot. Or just choose to extract to their personal train. I actually played the game myself back in late 2023, winning the first conductor's game against a ton of other players. And while the game back then was in very early development, the core gameplay loop was still genuinely fun. Which is why I love having this game as a sponsor, because it's not only similar to these civilizations where players fight back and forth for power, I played the game myself and actually enjoyed the concept. And if you play Enginefall, you'll support the making of these massive videos that take way too long to make. So if you like to play Enginefall yourself, they are in pre-alpha and are running free open playtests every other weekend, with the next being on the 3rd and 4th of May. To play, sign up for the playtest on Steam and join their Discord for updates and exact timings in your region. Links for both are in the description and the pinned comment. And thank you Enginefall for sponsoring this video. Getting back to the island, as I said, the massive amount of deaths before caused players to be more careful in their interactions, leading Skib to not have the edge that they normally do. Hey, uh, don't shoot. Hey, help me. Oh, there he is. Oh, there he is. Oh, hey man. Hey, what's your phone up with the truck, Rando? Okay. Alright, uh, I'll just follow you guys out. Alright. Do you think it'd be near the military base? Yeah, I was going to say, yeah. Oh, shit. Banana, make it up. I don't think we can get out of the this way. Can we ditch the car? Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Keep driving. What the fuck was that? No, firing right at him. You want me to get the car and bring it around? Are the gurus still here? We'd like to form an alliance. It's, uh, it's live. We just tried to go out the exit. We got hit up by Strudel and like three other guys. Looks like we got a team up against the- They were right in the entrance. We were trying to leave and they just blasted us. Immediately, yeah. How many were there? At least three. Yeah, three, four. Just three? We've got like seven on our team. Let's leave live and join you guys. Is that cool? If you'll have us, that is. Yeah. The goobers expand. The goobers expand. Watch out. This thing's breaking down fast. Where's Strudel? Find where we went. Uh, opposite direction. Towards the army. Rando, Mucho Mango. Uh, who's the other guy that was in your team? I thought there was another one. Stranger, J. Uh, this way? Left, left, left. Go ahead, go ahead. Is that us on the car? Oh, that's them. That's them. That's them. That's them. Kill him. Go, go, go. Are you fine? Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. I'm going to die. I just want to go out fighting. No, banana, don't die. You can, you can survive. I have bandages and a needle. Come here. I have one bar of health. I'm dead. No, bro. Eat like, I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. Bro, eat like. Oh, fuck. They were yelling run go go. Yeah, they saw, they saw a gang and they were like, oh hell nah. They'll definitely be back. I'm gonna get out of here. Fuck. I can't get this far. Drudel. Up in. Mank, get to the back. Drudel. I'm still losing health. I have everything. Who killed him? There was a group at the military base and it like, they just lit him up. I think I'm gonna die. Do we need to go back and kill? There's a whole group. It's like 15 people. Nah, guys, I'm dead. Mank, bro, I just, oh. Oh no. Skib was now down two members, falling far from the finesse that they had while taking down the entirety of Monkey Strong. While this might be because Gub decided to actually fight back, Skib would definitely want revenge. Leaving them for now, getting back to the shipwreck, there was a clan who was getting close to finding it. Okay, so, Lighthouse? Yes or no? I think we're going through the trees looking for the shipwreck. What do you see, Halo? Nothing. Not dick at all. Damn it. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. The south side. So wait, maybe it is down here. This is where me and, uh, me and our other team was going to build at down here. Yeah, I'm feeling it's on that island, dude. I have a feeling. Yeah, let's do it, boys. Uh, sure, let's do some searching. Let's see. Oh shit, there's a lot over there. Fuck. Oh there, hey there's a lot over there. Fuck. Oh, there's a- wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, look down at the bomb. Oh my God, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuckin' hurt, dude. Yeah, just run. Yes, sir! It's over here! This is it! Yes! And the trench coats. Sledgehammer. Yes! No way! We actually found it? Huge! We got zombies incoming, boys. The boys, the same clan who was shot up by Skib before, had found the shipwreck and all of its valuable cargo. Maybe with these newfound weapons and armour they might be able to get revenge on Skib themselves. But talking about Skib, they wanted revenge on a clan that they shot at first. And as I said, Strudel was a dangerous player. And even down 2 players, he was confident that he'd be able to take them down. Dude, I think we need to go kill those guys. I think we play a little stealth. I got a M14 8X go, keep our distance. We just gotta hit him and run back. Yo, can we mount up and get out of here guys? I don't like being like sitting around here while they know where we're at. Yeah, they know where we're at. I'm loading my magazines right now. Uh, we need a couple, let's go to the front entrance of the military base. Did you guys want to keep looking around for Strudel and like dicking around here? So why would we go to the entrance? Are we like holding it down or something? Yeah, this is gonna be our base. If you get me an axe, I could close it off. There's someone over here. Axe like a carpenter. Oh, there's one? Yvonne. Don't fucking shoot. Somebody's shooting at me. Kill them. Kill them. Kill them. Kill them. I don't even know where they're at, man. I think they're at the far end of the road. I don't fucking know. Yeah. Everyone's dying. I'm scared. I know. Use the map if we get separated. Do you want to like make a rendezvous point? We're trying to get out. We have to go all the way down the main road. It's the only way out. We're in Blizzard. Dead. Yeah, I mean, it was a pepperoni blizzard and Stranger Day and Linda. Fuck. All right, yeah, we're out of here. Just be careful because they might be here holding us down. Yeah, they're behind us. Get a shoot. All right. All right. It's so hard to get out of. Fuck. They got that little car. There you go. There you go. The engine's gonna go out. I can't hit. See if you can break line of sight on them maybe. That's our best bet. Tell my mama lover. I haven't seen the new Spider-Man movie. I'm in so much pain. Luckily enough for Skib, they had successfully gotten revenge against the clan that they shot at first. While it's impressive they didn't lose anyone this time, they were still being very aggressive and this wouldn't be the end to that because the island had about 30 new players that washed up on the docks which looked like new players to recruit to some factions. But to Skib, they just looked like fresh meat. What's going on? What up? All right. Let's make a faction together. Fuck it. Right? All right. That works. Did you just join? Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I just joined as well. Sweet. Sweet. We're gonna be traveling together. We should probably start our own faction so we don't hit each other. Let me make one. Alright, so what do we do when we come into contact with someone? We just try to chill it out. Yeah. I don't think everyone is aggressive. Oh hey, Pity. You want to be friends, Pity? Do you have any idea what's going on on the island? I don't. All I know is I want to join a faction. And while these new players were just trying to survive, one player named Slizzop didn't have the best luck doing so. Because literally less than five real life minutes after being brought into the civilization, he ran into a clan that he'd probably later regret. I don't know. Now while this was just one murder out of the 20 to 30 that Strudel himself had committed, for some reason, this one finally woke him up and let him realize what he had done. All of the wasted potential that was lost due to the actions of a few who wanted to just murder innocents. The blood on his hands weighed him down, but instead of going to the survivors of his rampages and asking for forgiveness, Strudel had decided to do something that no one really expected. Next person you guys see, I'm going to give them my kit. My kit, I have it. Oh, you already got an M14 bro. That's a big job. Oh, there's a guy right there. Right there. Big, the big guy. Oh yeah, invite big guy. Big guy. You want to join us? Yeah, why not? Actually, I'm down. Oh, okay. Bro, hey, listen. Come here. I got some stuff for you. Come here. Come here. Good shit, good shit. That's all you, brother. Uh, do me pretty. What are the car keys for? I will say. Wait, big guy. Can I ask you one more thing? Yeah. Can you send me off to Valhalla? You got bit bro? Here. I got you. Alright. No! He's got a good one. GG! Goodbye, Strudel. Goodbye, Strudel. As you just saw, Strudel had decided to eliminate himself from the event, trading a life for a life and giving away all his gear to one of the new players on the island. This was one step that he made that was actually positive, realizing that what he had done up to this point wasn't right. And while he can't undo the massacres that he caused throughout this event by being the first one to shoot pretty much every time, this was a sort of way for him to stop himself because he was probably the best at PvP on the island. And now, with the threat of Strudel gone, the players could shift their focus from surviving Skib clan to surviving on this island, starting with the boys who after finding the shipwreck were looking for places for their group to permanently settle down on this island. Boys, we need to have a discussion. We need to lay out a game plan. So, first off, we need to find a place to call home. We need to bunker down somewhere. Does anybody have any good suggestions? I think the top right. Top right's nuts. The top right? What's the top right? You're talking about that lighthouse? There's a lighthouse, there's a lighthouse up there. There's a little house. We go to the gay community. Can it be easily defended? Uh, I would say so if we can build a wall on the road. Okay, who's all in favor of the lighthouse would be home? Sure. I mean, we have axes now, so we can definitely cut down some trees. So now that we established where we're going to be heading, making our home, we need to discuss about protecting ourselves or being friendly towards more people. We're not a small faction anymore, guys. We're now a powerhouse. We need to defend ourselves if necessary. There was a point when we first started, we were friendly, you know, getting new members left and right. But now at this point, everybody's either in a group already or they're solo trying to kill people. Just, you know, just murder. But we need to come up with a game plan. Murder! We need to protect ourselves. No, no, no, not murder. Not murder. The thing is, if we show hostility to other people, then people we haven't shown hostility to are going to come for us because we're a threat. And a difference between defending ourselves. We don't know who we can trust. If people attack first, we attack back. But we should be nice. That's how we got so many people because we were nice to them and brought them in. I understand what you're saying, Cowan. You can't be nice to everyone at PZ, though, brother. I think you can be. I'm alive. So this is gonna be our game plan. Let's loot up the food store, get food and water, and then let's make a beeline straight to the lighthouse and start fortifying. Let's call ourselves a home. Okay. Alright. We should definitely pick up this shit. With the boys choosing a spot for their base, they then made a move out to get to the lighthouse that they were mentioning. And after that whole murder or not murder talk, we'd see what their real intentions were with other groups soon enough. Just stay together. I'm over that without dropping this bag. Hello? Hello? Please, sir? Who are you? How are you? Identify your somebody. Yeah, I hear it. I hear somebody. I'm gonna get in the back. Are you guys friendly? Yeah, we're friendly until you decide to be unfriendly. Oh my goodness. We've never even attacked anyone. Don't say we're not friendly. We are until we're un- We're friendly. We're just- We're just- We're the boys. We're the boys. We're the boys. Hey, just be aware, uh, you're moving towards the military base. Strudel's up there. Strudel. Strudel, everybody's talking about. He's a member of the Commonwealth. Wait, we have like 10 people up in the military base holding out. They wiped us out, man. There's only three of us left. Were you the guys I ran up on at the fucking fence? Yeah, wait. Yeah, hold on. You're, uh, oh god, I can't remember your name. I'm gonna hop in the fence. Don't freak out. Dirty. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, hop on over here. Hey, hey, hey. Yeah, I don't know. It was brutal. I didn't even see them and half the people were dead like in 15 seconds maybe. It was scary. Yeah, bro. They're stealthy and they're good with guns. I mean, well, we're pretty decimated. So, I mean, if you'll have us, we wouldn't mind joining you. How about this? Yeah, of course. You guys want to join us? Yeah, you can join us, of course. After letting this Gub Clan that had some members killed by Strudel before join them, it was clear that the boys were one of the better factions on this island. Letting them continue onto their base spot, with the fall of Skib Clan and the introduction to 30 new players on this island, there wasn't really anything stopping groups from taking advantage of the less fortunate, and one group was planning to do just that. I have someone. What's the code word? Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, what's up, bro? Yo, sliced greens. You want to join the king of kings? Uh, I mean, I wouldn't mind. I have some shit that could possibly benefit y'all. Word. This is the king right here. King of greens. Welcome to the fucking clan, my friend. Sliced greens, I'm just going to give you a heads up, bro. We're going to be kind of, you know, not the best people, if you know what I'm saying. We're going to be good people. Sometimes there can't be good people in the apocalypse, dog. Can't always be peace out here in these streets. We need a code word if we want to, you know, rob people. So what's the code word? Cheese it. Cheese it? Okay. If anyone says that, pull your guns out and point at the guy. Good luck, folks. All right, let's fuck this. You still go, bro. King of kings, boys. King of kings. Okay, where are we, dude? I've never seen this map before. Is that a bag? Hold on. Oh, is there someone in here? Hey. Hello. Yeah. Sorry, I've been shot by someone. There's a lone gunman with a pistol. Oh. He was trying to take us out. Oh, shot. Do you need sterilized rags or suture needles? Um, I have a piece of bandages and a tweezer, but I'm still losing health. You have a deep wound? Um. Huh. Let me, let me get in there, medical check-in. Hey, uh, plastic, drop me all your medical supplies. Did you, how long have you been here, man? Have you just been sitting here, like, bleeding out? Um, actually, I just got in here like a minute ago. Oh, yeah, us too. There's some painkillers in here if you want it, but I stitched up your wound. You should be fine. Um. Thank you very much. You plan to stay solo? Not sure. Considering what just happened, I might be safer with the group. I don't know what you guys are all about. Uh, well, we just joined. You know, we saw each other at the beginning, so we kind of just linked up. I don't know if you want to join. It's up to you. All right. All right, sweet. We'll try to stay clear for now. Let's get some decent loot first before we try to stick with the group. I am very dehydrated. Okay, yeah, let's go back to the house and get you food and water. No, that's... Oh, look at these people. Oh. Hey. What's up, brother? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Just let's see what happened. So far. Well, y'know, now we gave you something. You can give something back like that fucking axe. I think you guys have some Cheez-its on you, right, guys? Oh, whoa! E- We can make a trade, right? No, the axe is in the bag, buddy. Yeah, the axe. Also, all your food and water. Why are you doing this, Ray? Hey, Whiskey, you got any food and water? No. That's why that guy's out there dying. Okay, you gentlemen have a great day. Okay, and remember we're the kings of the island Okay, oh the king Alright, so we don't want to stay here guys. Let's get out. Let's go let's go What the fuck did we just get dude? How are they gonna rob us when we have nothing? What's nice? Have a good day I guess Good luck. Bye bye. Fuck those people the hell better than dying. I honestly thought we were gonna die there Some people can be ruthless. Damn, they seem nice too. I feel bad Don't worry. Don't worry. Good thing is that we have an ex now. That's the whole thing about being bad guys Okay, even if we feel bad we got to push through it KOKA just robbed a small group comprised of players who just washed up on the island I guess they were living up to being the self-appointed kings of Kingsmount taking from players who can't defend themselves for their own gain But luckily enough for the players who needed guns with all the spawns already looted There was someone who was on their way to the island who would help with that This is a traitor offering weapons armor items food anything that the players would want as long as it's for the right price Now this traitor was killable But if they were attacked the two armed guards were authorized to take down any threats to the traitor's life and with the traitor's location being broadcasted to the whole island It wasn't long until the traitor had their very first customer M16 bullets motherfucker Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. Yeah, what do you got to trade there? Duck tape. Duck tape, huh? Hmm. How about duct tape in that crowbar? Uh, I'll trade you the crowbar for a samurai sword. No, no, no Uh, this should do. Alright, throw in the crowbar and you got a deal Oh There they are Hello We have a lion Get left You guys gotta get one Yeah, what do you think is a good trade for that? I will trade you a shotgun Oh, what the fuck? Oh, shit Oh, shit Get the fuck out, man Get the fuck out, man Get the fuck out, man Get the fuck out, man The lion cleared up The lion cleared up I'm looking for a very specific item Looking for a firebomb with a crafted timer attached to it Man, you're a kind of a sick bastard, aren't you? Get the hell out of here Leaving the traitor with that mess The boys had sent their own player to the traitor to get them essentials for themselves And after doing so, the boys would run into a problem of their own Sinister and self, those are our two people going to the traitor? Oh, silent? Okay, so we got three people, okay Three should be good for a small team Three should be absolutely good There's a rifle on this zombie if y'all need it Hey, bull or vest here? Oh, mind if I take it? Oh, hey Oh, hey Yo Oh, shit, it's the boys Oh, hello Do you guys live here? What is that? Do you? Okay, well, have a nice day Hold on, guys, we got like a car back here Holy shit We both live Well, now we know where the boys live They're fucking off, they're fucking off, they're fucking off They're fucking off Alright, one, they're fucking off Two, they know that we're here now They saw how big we are They seem pretty adamant to get the fuck out of here KOK having the location of the boys was not good Because as you've seen from their previous actions on the island, they thought that they ruled this place And even against a friendly clan like the boys, KOK wouldn't lower their ego And conspired with the last few remaining members from a familiar clan Oh, hey, big guy Keep Oh, shit Oh, whoa, whoa Hello people What do you need help? Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're shooting zombies, right? I thought you guys got attacked or something Oh, hey, big guy Guys, since we're close by, should we actually head over to the military base get some more ammo? Sure, I really do need ammo I need an actual gun Guys, what, what, hear me, hear me Everyone, come here, come here, I have a special program You know this faction that's very big? Come on, king. Um, what's the color? Boys. Yeah, yeah, I know them. They live up over by the lighthouse to the top of the eye. Yeah, they live upper. Wanna do it, guys? Make it nice and attack them? We can do it. I'll offer it if you guys are all up for it. I'm down for it. Yeah, we're all down for it, Mr. Pokko. Okay. We can go through it right now. Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Dude, this is gonna be so fun. Do you wanna try and rob them or just wanna come up straight shooting? No, no, kill everyone. Yes. Now this sort of out of nowhere desire to kill a group sounds like normal Skib Clan behaviour, but this time they did have their own legitimate reason to raid the boys. Because between them finding the shipwreck and now, someone had leaked that the boys had found it. Now, it could be someone inside their group. Or it could be the solo named Brother who was lurking around the shipwreck and their group. Whatever it was, after Skib merged with KOK, they didn't only want what the boys got from the shipwreck. They wanted control. Not only of this one group, but of the entire island. And in their eyes, there was only one way to do so. Ugh, gosh. I have a saw. Yeah, we're gonna need to get saw so we can cut down the logs in the blanks. Yeah, it's like, you'll see, you'll see. It's complete. Yeah, this is it. Okay, we're gonna get out like a little. I think like here. Moving some of those logs from over there to where we're gonna be building the fence. Do you think you can do that? I can try. I mean, don't strain yourself. If it's too much, then don't worry about it. I mean, I'll bottle. Hold on, let me look at you. Let me do a medical check on you real quick. Saw. Uh, there was a saw over there. Oh, uh, Arthur has it. Oh shit! Damn! They don't deserve it! They don't deserve it. They don't deserve it! I have a gun. They don't deserve this. They don't deserve it. Okay, hey, there's two over here. Nice, nice. Is that everyone? Everyone's dead. Okay, let's grab everything, guys. Grab everything and go. That's not all of them. Okay, who's left alive? Who's left alive? Is it literally just us? KOK had just taken things further than anyone expected. They raided the boys' base and left almost no one alive. This wasn't a raid. It was a massacre. The KOKO at least left players alive before it was gone. Now they were clearing out entire factions. Factions that didn't deserve this at all. And throughout this entire event, the boys have done nothing to harm anyone and just wanted to establish themselves on this island. But now, because of the greed of a few players who call themselves kings, the dream of building a civilization here was dead. But not all of the boys were gone. A few had actually been out looting, completely unaware of what happened back at home. Wait, Taco and Dorky died. Aren't they at base? Should we head back? Guys, I... No, I was fucking cutting wood and then there were a million fucking gunshots. Who was it? I... I... We were... We were making the wall and I went into the forest to cut more wood and I heard a million fucking gunshots and everyone fucking died. Like, look at the chat. Everyone's dead. Okay, we need to sneak back in quietly from the south. Stay in the coastline. Bro, I don't know if going back there is a good idea if they fucking wiped us out. After hearing that their group had been wiped out, it was reasonable for these boys members to want to see it with their own eyes and they would find players that were alive but maybe not the players that they were hoping to see. I think we just, we approach it like very quietly and then just like, don't take any risks that we can. It's a not speaking game. Just stick to the coastline and go up. Okay, who's left alive? Is it literally just us? We're fucking fast. Okay guys, let's get everything in the cars and leave. Three. Store everything in here. Who's that? It's me, it's me. Friendly, don't worry. From the trees, from the trees, from the trees. Back, back, back. I think it was just a bit too far. I'm stunned. They looked up north and they thought we came above them. I hope they did not spot us. Yeah, we can just kind of hunk down here and try to just hold or we can just keep moving south. Where's our team that went to the trader at right now? Uh, aren't they west? Yeah, they're at the trader right now. Okay, they're really far. Should we try to go meet them so they don't try to go back to the light. Yeah, let's just, I think we just need to abandon our base. So we just need to move south now. After learning the truth about what happened, this was war. Not for no reason or for greed like some of these violent factions on the island, but for vengeance. And they would take any opportunity they could to take KOK down, no matter the cost. But first, they would have to come to terms with what they have truly lost. Man, what the heck. All of our boys. Our boys. We had so many boys. What's our like headcount? How many of us are alive? How many of us are alive? There's four here, and then there's three who are at the trader. So half of us are gone? Yeah. Jesus, man. Yeah, we just gotta keep moving, cause they're probably gonna realize that we just left. I wonder if they're even looking for us, or they just wanted that spot. I didn't see what clan they were. They were a red tag though, so. I saw one was a orphan. Ah, I was with orphan at the start. You wanna do this together, man? Who's talking? That's orphan talking there. Guys, follow me! We're gonna get going! Orphan's our strong leader, follow him. We're all gonna go to the military base together, and then we went to the police station and all got lost, so. Damn. Well, we're enemies now. That's how the game goes I guess. It is what it is. Let's try to at least go to that bridge, that bridge that kinda connects these halves of the map, and meet up with them there. Hopefully there's nobody who's holding that down, because we know if they're trying to come back to us, that's where they have to go. And so, these survivors headed off towards the infamous bridge, in an attempt to reach the remaining boys members who were at the trader when the raid happened. But on the way there, the boys would come across something that would yet again test their intentions of peace on this island. Somebody's inside, somebody's inside. Announce yourself, announce yourself. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hello there. Hey, we're friendly. Hello. Good show. Didn't mean to intrude. I have a guy with no mic in here. Okay. We're not trying to fight or anything, we're just escaping from the death of our faction, or most half of our faction anyways. The noob faction has like 20 people in it, so I just kinda left. Where are they based up? Uh, across the bridge, near the dock. Cause the, the team that raided us, they're very aggressive. Are you guys like, fleeing from that area? Yeah, there's, there's no reason to go back. They're like, super kitted out. Our other teammates are, they're, they're coming to the bridge right now. Hey boys, boys. Hey, there's one of them. Oh, this is, this is dope man. Hey, small W's man. I think we should, we should try to, to meet up with, with their big group. Yeah, we, we met a bunch, we met a bunch of them at the trailer earlier. Do they seem cool? I mean, it's a fucking huge group. I think they just kinda like accepted everybody right up at the beginning. I, I like the idea of safety in numbers. The boys had now become friendly with this noob faction, who you might have seen briefly at the trailer. This was a faction led by a man named Kaz, which was comprised of the majority of the new players on this island. And while this clan was absolutely massive, as we've seen, without organization, huge clans like this can fall within a matter of minutes. But as the word spread, they knew the threat that KOK posed to the island. And it was only a matter of time until either of these clans would run into this murderous faction. Wait, the most BVP experience I think we are. I think we are. With the traitors. I thought that was one of the purple dudes. New. The guy who just ran past him, he was, he was new. Red, red, red, red, red. Yep, these guys, fuck him up. Whoa! Those are boys. They're pissed at us. They're shooting at us. That was them. Yeah, hold on. Don't chase, don't chase. They were pretty suited. After getting attacked like that, Orphan and his goons drove home as quick as they could, more than happy to brag about the innocent faction they just slaughtered. Hey! Here we are. Oh, it's a terror. Oh my god, you missed out. You guys, I saw Todd died. Okay, so you know the big guys, the biggest group? We raided them. Yeah, holy shit. Eager Beavers. We just like wiped out half a faction. That's sick, I wish I could have seen it. I guess I will later. But yeah, we are probably one of the most powerful ones now on the server. Fuck yeah man, good work. KOK was celebrating being quote unquote the most powerful faction on this server. Giving themselves this title because they successfully ambushed a friendly group. I mean, would KOK really fare any better if they got ambushed themselves? But there was one thing that KOK did have that would give them an advantage. Because earlier on in the event, they met someone that would prove to be super valuable to them. Oh, hey there. Oh, brother! Hey brother! What's good? Hey brother! What is that? It's orphan! Calm down, calm down! Hey what's up? Brother's got some flashbacks. You look like you've been through the war. I see all this is a ramble. Don't get behind me! Jesus, you remember me? It's okay, it's okay brother, it's okay. Not here to hurt you. If we were, we would have done it already. Yeah. What are you doing here brother? Have you guys seen the she-zits around? Oh no. What? What? What are you doing here? Have you seen Strudel? Oh no. What are you looking for him? I'm looking for Strudel. What he did this time? He ran me over at the beginning. Wait, was it a red car? Yeah. You looking to join a faction or are you going solo? I don't do factions. I'm a bit of a lone wolf. Well, we can help you to calm down Strudel. We can help you dog. I think he's a risk guy. We're human bro. Tune into the radio station 83. I'll be on that station if you need me. Okay. I'll do that. And so, even after Orphan said the code word Cheez-Its to rob him, KOK secured Brother as an ally. Now while you might think Brother is just a solo and wouldn't be that valuable to KOK, Brother was the leader of a massive faction called The Kingdom in my first civilization. In which he dealt with tons of information and politics before and during that event. And in this event, he was already seen trailing the boys. It was most likely the one who told Skip before that they got the shipwreck. And soon enough, he would get some useful information for KOK as well. What's going on here? Over? Oh, hey. Hey, brother. What you doing up there, man? This is my outpost. Hey, have you seen Kok? You wanna come join? Who's Kok? The red guys. They mugged me. Very not bueno. Oh, yeah. You got a bone to pick with them. Oh, well you guys don't need me either. You got so many people. Jesus. Good luck, guys. Slice tomatoes. Come in. Come in tomatoes. You're in the Kok clan, right? The boys are on their way to kill you. They're marching down the road. They just passed the bridge. Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. Alright. Yeah. What? Guys, they're coming. They're coming. They're coming. Okay. They're coming? How do you know? Everyone get your guns. Get your guns. Get your guns. Brother told me. Brother told me. He gave me information. Okay, guys. Line up the cars. Line up the cars. Guys, line up the cars with me so we can get defense. What? Guys, guys, guys. Let's get in the woods and we'll get behind them. Get in the woods. There's no woods. After Brother told them that the boys were on the way, KOK started to panic and put together defenses in preparation for the raid. But this was a bit of an overreaction because the boys were just on their way to meet up with this noob clan that they met before. And with KOK not knowing that, being in this panic state was dangerous for them because before the boys could even become a threat, something dangerous was on its way to the island. Uh oh. Oh my god. That was spooky. Holy shit. Thunder. That was foreboding. Is there gonna be a horde in a storm? Oh no, yeah the fog's in there. Oh don't say that. Oh man, it is messy out there. Now this wasn't a normal storm. The players would soon find out that this was a sprinter storm, turning every single zombie on the island into a sprinter, making them about 10 times more dangerous, especially with the fog blocking the player's vision. And many fachions noticed the danger quickly and began to fortify buildings to withstand the horde, but some were not so prepared for what was to come. I guess brother gave us false intel. Or maybe they gave up. I think they changed their minds or maybe someone told them we're ready. Hey Vaughn, I had an idea actually. So we could probably get some more cars, maybe like one or two more and make this barricade, car barricade a little better. I know of a car that just needs gas. It's pretty close. I trust you guys to go get it, but that's up to you. After noticing a storm coming in and possibly that brother's intel was false, KOK was still focused on going out and prepping their defenses. And while fachions like the boys were outside in a massive group, after noticing the storm, they opted to find shelter and wait and assess the situation. So whether it be from their ego, lack of self-preservation, or just straight up karma, KOK's leader orphan was putting himself in a dangerous spot, going out into the storm right before the zombies turned to sprinters, with no clue what was about to come. K, stay frosty. Sound me. Damn, there's a horn. Run back, run back, run back, run back, run back. Go back, go back, go back. I saw you. Holy shak, shut the door, shut the fucking door. There's like a million dollars outside. Oh yeah, there's a bunch coming. They're sprinting around. Other room, other room, other room. Oh shit, they're coming in. Alright, get ready boys. Fourathan Siomi, here's how good they're turning around. We have all resistance. Oh wait,�ier look! No사랄? In the spotlight, no hat or whatever! T-Wiste hit, no cap or any damage, or if you want to get a damage. Oh man do you want to know if you miss another solution? but not a stratum to kill me with this crap, keep going, keep going! Oh man do you want me to make it emergency! No cut away from command? Oh lord! Go too! Keep going! What's at risk? Wellłąva is. Keep going! Nice! Oh boy, whyconfine. Oh man is here. Red around the window. Oh no what?! This guy this guy is using your threat, Good boy that is an assure. Everyone else get inside what you're doing out there man. That's crazy. Tactical smoke break! How's everyone doing? Does anyone get like fucked up by that? We're all good. No no no no. Wait guys! Did we miss seeing Orphan and Vaughn fucking die? Ohhh fuck dude how did I not see that? I was paying attention the whole time! Okay that changes things. Dude they killed him dude. There's no way they didn't kill him. What the hell? Orphan, the leader of the kings of Kingsmouth, was dead. He ran out at the worst possible time, right at the moment that zombies turned to sprinters. Which was most likely karma for all the innocents him and his group have brutally murdered. And while it would be great to see one of the players that he's wrong to kill him for revenge, I think it's kind of poetic. The self-proclaimed king of this island, who left his teammate to die to zombies at the beginning, eventually dying to zombies himself. But with the leader of KOK gone, the group began to struggle. Because no one else was willing to step up as a leader. But KOK weren't the only ones who struggled during the sprinter storm. As you saw before, there was this clan on the island called the Noob Clan. And you would soon find out that their name was more literal than you might expect. Do you think we could put these dressers outside of the windows? What? Ah, you fucking asshole. Ah, fuck. Oh, god. Yeah, there's a car that beeps. Who the hell is this? Who's this? Token. No, Token! Go inside, Token. Go inside, go inside. Make a line. Make a line. Make a line. Noob was not the biggest fan of their new neighbors. This random duo for no apparent reason decided to attack the faction at their base and took shelter right next door. And so with Noob having about 20 members, a duo would be an easy threat to get rid of. Right? They have a car. We can take that car probably, right? Anyone in there? Speak now, please. Who is it? What's your name? Tell us your name. Oh, someone up front. Someone up front. It was nice knowing y'all. They're still alive but they're trying to survive. No! They're inside the house. They're inside the second house right here behind us. They have guns in the next house right here. They killed Cheese. This back room right here. There's Cheese's body. Poor Cheese. No. Fuck you. No. Oh shit, I'm hit. I didn't even realize. I'm low. I'm low. I'm low. I'm low. I'm bandaging up right now. Dude, I'm dying. I'm dying. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Whoops. I did not mean to do that. No! No, Buka. Last saw he was in there in the left corner. I got him. I got him. I got him. I killed him. Nice. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Buka. Despite having ten times their members, the noob clan had lost four and let one of them get away. This clan was looking like a mirror image to MS before, struggling with their size and communication, but luckily enough for them, they would have some help that was on the way. Yeah yeah yeah, boys! You guys talked to me before. Hi. Yes. It was Lord Pell. Lord Pell. I need help. I have bullets lodged in me. Also, boys, thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. I'm kind of willing to just like reform a new team. Okay. We want to just be in the same faction. Yeah okay, that makes sense. That sounded good to me. I could play MC with. Instead of boys, you could be guys. Yeah. Guys. We're all guys now. Alright, Sinister. Who's next? Minnie Myers. Understanding that there was strength in numbers, these two fachions came together and called themselves the Guys. This would make them the largest remaining faction on the island by far, as all the other fachions were mostly small duos or trios, except for KOK, who were still smaller than the Guys, but had a bunch of weapons and a decent amount of members. But they still didn't have a leader, and were continuing to struggle because of it. Yo thank you guys for nothing by the way. Like it's no big deal to me, but maybe to him it is. I had to fight 6-7 sprinters all by myself. Are you fine? Sorry man, I was feeding. I was feeding. No no no. Everyone just started unloading shots and attracted a ton of sprinters. It was bad. I had to shoot and as soon as the first shots started coming off, I just ran off. I mean. It was going to be a fucking horde. With KOK starting to take out their frustrations on each other, I decided to go to them directly and ask them a few questions myself. Hello? Can I talk to you guys? Can you come down here for a second? So, my question is for the kings of King's Mouth. Why are you in the corner? Why are you not talking to the other groups? Rolling as the kings that you are. So, we're building up this base, just kind of gathering people, and then the fog came, and the sprinters came, and immediately killed Orphan. And since then, we've just been picking up the pieces. So, my question in the first place, why attack the boys? What did they do to you? We are the kings. So, you just want to impose your rule on them? That was the plan? I don't even think that. I think we just wanted to take their shit. Yeah, we just needed their shit. Honestly, we just needed water and food, and we got water and food. So, KOK thought that they were in the right to kill the majority of the boys for their resources instead of trading with them. Or even robbing them. I mean, this is coming from self-proclaimed kings! So, maybe in their eyes, they had a right to do whatever they wanted on this island. And they would continue to do what they wanted. As after I interviewed them, Solo came by in search of cigarettes. So, let's see how the self-proclaimed kings of Kingsmouth Island would treat their innocent subjects. Oh, where's this guy? What's going on? Where's this guy? I'm getting a cigarette. I'm getting a cigarette. Hey, Graft, can you take out your shoes? Alright, alright, calm down, calm down. Your shoes, take out your shoes. Take everything off. No, no, your shoes. My shoes are right. Walk, walk, walk, walk to those things on the floor. Walk here, walk here. Walk here. Walk here. No, no, walk, walk there. Alright. No, no, walk. Start walking. You want me to walk there? Guys, this is a little barbaric, don't you think? Okay, so now... No, no, no, no, don't kill him. Don't kill him. Don't kill him. Don't kill him. Look, if we're killing... He's kinda... Put on his misery. Guys, fresh meat. Fresh meat? Fair enough. I... Oof. He's got food. He's got so much food. He got a lot of food. Wait, who is this dude? This was just someone who showed up and Koked decided to start like torturing him by making him step on broken glass. He's got funny. He's got funny. KOK had just murdered an innocent solo for no reason whatsoever. He was just looking for cigarettes to help his smoker treat, but instead he got shot to death. And now KOK was looking like the mirror image of Skip before, killing innocent factions and solos. But unlike Skib and Strudel, they still thought that they were in the right and would continue to impose the rule on the players of this island. But right after they murdered that solo, one of the only players that didn't have a hatred towards KOK would show up to their base with some valuable info. Oh, who? I have to wait too fucking early. Oh, who? Hello. Who the fuck is this? Don't shoot, don't shoot. Who the hell is that? It's God! It's God himself! Hello, God. You look like a business man, OK? I just found it on the road. Tell me, tell me what's your business here. You guys have rivals, you know? And I, Loki, have beef with them too. Can you join us? And yeah, basically. Yeah, let's let this guy again then. OK, I'm gonna invite you. No? Wait, guys, what if this guy's a fucking informer? We're just gonna let him in? Yeah, man. Exactly. I fucking hate those guys. They tried to kill me. I threw a Molotov at their base, so. Well, do you know where they are? We can just go fuck them up right now. Yeah, I know exactly where they are. OK, let's do it, bro. Let's do it. Let's die hunting instead of being hunted, guys. No, playing defense is way better, bro. Fuck defense. Fuck defense. OK, I'm gonna be real with you, dawg. If we could sit here all day, they might not even come. Defense is the most tactical position. Fuck tactical. It's like a slim chance they might come. I have a broken leg. Fuck you. But you fought off seven sprinters, dawg. You got the potential. I believe in you. Sprinters are easy. All you gotta do, just sit on your ass and snipe. All right, guys, tell you what. In situations like this, where seven of us wanna do seven different things, even though we're all equal, defer to Koka, let this man speak. Yeah, man. I think I'm a different person. I'm a good representation of this group. I'm the most crazy here. Are we hunting or getting hunted, bro? Yeah, yeah, we're gonna hunt. I don't know. Also, why is there just a torso on the floor? For sure, that kinda scares me. Y'all yell a little out. Can I eat it? Eat it? What? Yeah, eat it. Hit it, man. All right, well, who's ready to fucking hush, bro? I'm ready to fucking hunt. Guys, we're fighting for Orphan and for everyone else that we've lost along the way. Yeah, man. Yes. Fuck yeah. We're the ones in the right. We're not doing anything wrong, dawg. You know, I really wanna see what the boys are doing. They're gonna die soon, so... We are the kings of this island. Let's go on foot. We'll be more mobile. We'll be more mobile. We'll be more mobile. We need to flee! Well, if we need to flee, then I guess we'll flee. Also, we should... You drive and we'll walk. We have some boys to kill. Let's get going. We have some boys to kill. Let's go. KOK were planning to attack the Noob Clan using information that Godly gave to them, who was the same person who attacked the Noob Clan before and was looking to get revenge for his dead duo, who was killed because of Godly's actions against the Noob Clan. Regardless of the justifications, now with Noobs, technically guys, location, KOK were on the move to their base, but unfortunately for them, they weren't the only ones with the idea to attack. There are quite a few zombie bodies here. Yeah. Oh. That's them. Oh, damn. We found them. Who'd you find them? They're at the lighthouse. The KOK. Yeah, we should do like a follow-up assault on them. We got people bid, so we always think that was going to make their base and think about it. We got to make a move on that. Alright. Yeah, we got to go in. Yeah, I'd love to. Everybody got to go in. Alright, so we're going in? I think we're going in. Alright. If I'm going in, someone take the drip. I didn't know you were going in, but you were a great teammate, bro. Hey, kick some ass for me, alright? Let's go get them, boys. Gentlemen, let's get moving. Come on now. Let's go guys. Yeah. We should probably leave Captain Geese behind, it's only going to slow us down. He's in a fucking car, dawg. Like, it's the first time. We've got to go in. I think we're going in. Alright. If I'm going in, someone take the drip. I didn't know you were going in. But you were a great teammate, bro. Hey. Kick some ass for me, alright? Let's go get them, boys. They will die today. Gentlemen, let's get moving. Come on now. Haul ass, boys. Let's go guys. Yeah. We should probably leave Captain Geese behind. It's only going to slow us down. He's in a fucking car, dawg. Like, it's chill. Wait 10 seconds and we're good. Oh, I thought he was walking, because I saw a big guy in the car. Yeah, I don't know. We're so disorganized, man. We're clean. Oh my god. Consistency hitting everything there is. Yeah. What's that? What's that? Car coming, car coming. Yeah, here. Oh no. Oh yeah. Holy shit. I hit one good. Hit one good. Hit one good. That's all for me. Geronimo! Triple drown, baby! Triple drown! Come here! One bad. One bad. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. See? We're deep. Coco, we lost two. Go back. Go back. Go back. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Go back. Go back. Go back. Be careful. They're here waiting for us. They're running. They're running. They're running. I think they're running back to their base. I imagine they went back to the lighthouse. Yes, sir. They're waiting for this moment, this entire playthrough. Right. Three. There's three. They're here. They're here. Oh! A sniper! Fall back, fall back, fall back, for fuck's sake. Be careful. They can come from behind. Let me know when they're approaching. Dock, they're coming from the back. Dock, they're coming from the back. Dock, they're coming from the back. Day 2, go. Day 2, go. Day 2, go, good lie. Day 2, go. Day 2, go, 10. Day 2, go, 10. Day 2, go. Instead of camp. Day 2, go. Day 2, go, go. Day 2, go. There's still a bullet. Hello? Knock knock. We're not here. You are not here? Oh, nice. Look out. Yeah, I'm not here. They're trapped. We just waked you out and you're dead, alright pal? Get to see you, Chuka. C-Coco, you're good. Coco, you're good. Come on guys, go up. We are making a party here. You're getting blown to hell if you come up those fucking stairs. Oh shit, no, no. Oh yeah, bye guys. GG, GG. No, Mr. Chuka, no. Bye. Fuck you! Fuck! No, fuck! The kings of this island were surrounded and down to only two members. And while the sensible thing in this situation would probably be to surrender, it wasn't looking like KOK was planning to do that. We're not surrendering for shit, you cocksuckers. Uh, you know, you surrender, we accept the surrender, and we build you a new set of stairs, and you can live together happily ever after. I don't believe you. I mean, that's the only options you have. I think I'd like option two. Can you guys fuck off and leave us without stairs? Oh god, fuck off. Alright. He killed my boyfriend. Yeah, fuck off cunts. Fuck you guys. Okay, no, actually destroy every single stairs. Alright, roll out, roll out. Destroy this set of stairs too. Alright, roll out. Nice. So are they all dead? All but dead. Yeah, there's two of them left and they'll just starve there because they have no stairs. Now you would think that the guys having more than six times the members of KOK stationed right outside ready to charge in that they would just go up and be done with this, right? Well, KOK had prepped for this and destroyed the stairs leading up the lighthouse. And while they could be replaced, the guys would have a disadvantage and lose a lot more members by pushing it. So instead, the guys decided to try something a little more tactical. They decided to leave, not risking any more lives to kill the clan that's provided them with so much suffering. At least that's what they would like KOK to think. Because they were actually trying something similar to what's called a feigned retreat, where most of the guys left to go back to their base. And some stayed behind. Because they knew that KOK would want revenge for their fallen members. It wouldn't be too long until they would try to leave the tower. Good, good, good. Wait. Shit. Do they not know? Come on, Glenn. Yeah, okay. Come on, Glenn, you got this. Come on, throw it, throw it, throw it. Throw it. Yes! Yes! Not how it hurt, eh? What's happening? This is for my shovel, bitch. Oh, he's dying. What the fuck? They're still here? Oh my god. One down, one to go. Just surrender. Please, please, please. I didn't mean anything. Please. All right, all right, all right. Jump down the stairs with your hands up. I can't just bear to live without my friends, guys. Without my lover, Coca. Now that Coca's gone, I just can't bear myself anymore. Goodbye, everyone. What a guy. That's respect. With the last member deciding to eliminate themselves, KOK was now fully eliminated from the event. And so, with the island finally free of the so-called Kings of Kingsmouth, the war was finally over. Now the around 30 remaining players were able to live in peace, able to form functioning societies with actual structure, with no threats other than their own survival. And while it's sad that so many innocent players were needlessly killed by factions like KOK or Skib, there was some hope for humanity emerging on this island after all this bloodshed. As players who had no relation to the conflicts were coming across the multiple massacres and burying the fallen. Giving them a proper resting place like many of these innocent players deserve. I've started digging graves for the fallen. I mean, I don't know what these people were, what they went through, but I feel like everybody at least deserves something proper when they're gone. It's not much, but it's what I can do. Be able to recognize them. Anyways. Gorilla, you mind if I talk to you for a second? Yeah, of course. Because I see you're making something. So what is this, what happened here? I don't know. That's the funniest thing. Oh, you don't? So you just came across this? You weren't even part of this group? No, I found just a massacre here and I thought, you know, be disrespectful to the dead to leave them just out in the cold. I mean, that is the most like humane thing I've seen in this event so far, Gorilla. Yeah, I've been hearing some pretty unsavory stuff has been going on over by the military base. Basically everywhere. I mean, I won't leak any locations, but a lot of stuff has been going on, especially here. These poor people. I mean, you don't, so you have no clue who lived here? I mean, I've got names. That's about it. They would definitely appreciate knowing that you did this, but I mean, that's for you to tell them. There are still some surviving members. I'll tell you that you can try and find them and let them know. This is really cool of you to do, Gorilla. Yeah, I have been thinking about getting out of here. It's a bit depressing. Good luck, Gorilla. I mean, yeah, I wish, honestly, you the absolute best of luck, because you're…that's insane. That's so cool of you. Thanks. This man named Gorilla had laid all the bodies from the boys' massacre to rest, but he also unknowingly buried a KOK slash Skib member named Label Banana nets them as well, which is a testament to all the senseless violence that occurred throughout this event. It doesn't matter if we're fighting for good, evil, or something in between, at the end of the day, these meaningless conflicts aren't carried to the grave. But as Gorilla said, it is depressing seeing so many innocent players who were killed and lost their chance to build a society here. Well, luckily enough for these lost players, they would soon get another chance to form a society, not on an island surrounded by water, but in a place a little more dangerous. A place not only infested with zombies, but a place that would put every player's survival skills to the ultimate test. could beнибудь from there for every career. Other players have more fun.
