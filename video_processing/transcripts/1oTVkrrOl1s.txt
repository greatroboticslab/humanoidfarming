 I give two hay bales at a time. I have two different hay bale feeders. So, well, one's for the cows and horses and sheep, basically. They all share it. But I have two different feeders. So they generally, the cows and horses will eat on one and the sheep will eat on the other. And they'll go back and forth because, you know, the grass is always greener on the other side. This allows the animals not have to fight over it to give them two bales at once. So it's about once a week. What's your favorite part of doing hay? I want to do that. Oh, you want to use the skid steer, huh? Yeah. One day I'll teach you how to use it, buddy.
