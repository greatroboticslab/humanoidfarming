 The Amish don't just store potatoes. They preserve them the old-fashioned way, turning plain spuds into shelf-stable pantry gold. And the method? Pressure canning. No freezer, no fridge, just jars and time. Start with 10 pounds of potatoes, any kind. The Amish peel, everyone. You should too. That skin? It blocks heat. And for safe canning, heat needs to get all the way in. Cube them small, half-inch chunks. Toss them in cold water so they don't go brown. Now bring a pot to boil and parboil the cubes for two minutes. Not fully cooked, just enough to soften. Load into clean quart jars. Optional, one-half teaspoon salt per jar. The Amish often add it, not for preservation, but flavor. Pour in boiling water. Leave one inch of headspace. De-bubble. Wipe the rims. Lids on. Rings finger tight. Into the pressure canner they go. Let it steam for 10 full minutes. That's critical. Then, 10 pounds of pressure. 40 minutes for quarts. Use 15 pounds if you're above 1,000 feet. Let it cool naturally. Then lift your jars and listen close. Pop, pop, pop. That's the sound of sealed, shelf-ready food. No freezer burn. No power bill.
