 Hey guys, Jill here. Welcome back. It has been a wild weekend on our farm if I'm being completely honest. My in-laws were in town this weekend and they stayed with us. And then we had our friend Sean, who is also our farm consultant, here all day yesterday. And that is exactly what this video is about, why we hired a farm consultant, what we got out of it. And just kind of walking you guys through the process of that. I know I mentioned it in a few videos a while back. You guys were asking, and I just want to be completely upfront and honest. I think I am pretty vulnerable and transparent of sharing you guys. I do not know it all. I know how to grow food and I know how to grow food decently well. But there are a lot of aspects in profitable farming that I don't do well. And I'm still learning and trying to figure those things out. And that was a huge reason why we outsourced a farm consultant. So we're going to dive into the nitty gritty of that today. I'm going to show you guys, walk you through the farm, some of the things that we talked about. And I'm just super, super excited. So before I get really invested in this video and just telling you guys everything, I want to just put out all the information for our farm consultant. He does consulting even if you're not local to us. I'll, of course, put all his information in the links below. But if you want to look him up on Instagram, it is just mindfulfarmerarkensol. They also do like value added stuff as far as ferments. They make elderberry syrup and a lot of stuff like that. So if you're interested in any of those other aspects as well, click below. I'll have all their information listed. All right, let's dive in. I'm officially, officially starting this video now. So one of the huge reasons, because this was a question I did get asked when I mentioned it, why did you hire a farm consultant? Ultimately, like this is my job. This is what I do is the farm. We are really wanting to upscale that. We were really having a dollar amount that I needed to be hitting. And so we need to figure out how to upscale that and what the right steps were. So Nathan and I were in this place where we felt like we were working maybe on a step two and three when we haven't even done the step one process yet. And just knowing like, yes, I sell produce every single week, but we were not running it really in a business structure with all the core values that we needed to be. And bringing someone in who does this for a living, who has much more experience in that, you know, he farms for a living, he consults for a living. It just gave us a much clearer picture. He asked those hard questions and helped us walk through all of those things. One of the really, really cool things he said that for me was kind of like that, wow, I'm glad you asked that. Like he was asking our values. And I think when you run a business, in my opinion anyways, a business that you run from your home, which is what we do, like our farm is on our property, we're here all the time, you can kind of get captivated in working all the time. And there's definitely been seasons in my life where I have put work the top priority and maybe sacrifice my family time or my time with my children. And writing out those core values, not willing to sacrifice my family for this business. That was something that needed to be physically written out. I love farming. I will always pursue farming. I will never pursue anything that sacrifices my family to get to that goal. Now I know, you know, I'm going to have to make time sacrifices. I know that there are going to be seasons in our life where it's a hustle and a bustle and we're grinding things out to reach that goal. And that I am 100% aware of and I know. But I feel like overall, at the end of the day, we should work our hineys off to get to a certain place. And then our family gets to enjoy that together and work towards those goals together. I shouldn't have to put work over my family, if that makes sense. And so just physically writing out those values that our business is going to stand by, for me, was a lot. These are principles that we live our life by. You know, first we love God. Then we love people. Then we love other things. And so having that out, writing that out for me meant so much. Like I will probably be one of those people that have like our core values as a business, as a family written out, posted in my house as like a good reminder. I also think if you are in that stage of wanting to upscale your business, wanting to upscale your farm and become profitable, maybe you're just dabbling in selling produce at a farmer's market and all these things. I do, I feel like it's super important. Figure out what your values are. Figure out what you want. For us, community was a huge value. We want to bring our local community back to regenerative agriculture, back to sustainable living, teaching them how to grow food. And ultimately, like we want people on our farm for seasons where they learn how to then go and create their own farm and just keep that process rolling. And for me, that's something we've never done before. We never took the time to write out our core values. We've talked about what we believe in and what we want to achieve as a farm. But I feel like there's something about taking pen to paper and writing out those things. There's a level of accountability that comes with that. And having someone else that you're talking through that with as well, not just your spouse. Not only now, Nathan and I have to hold each other accountable. We have our friend who's also a farm consultant who can also hold us accountable of those values and what we want out of our business. And for me, that was worth money. And some of you guys may be in the same season. You may can relate to something like that. Yes, ultimately, I want to run a profitable business. I have passion in that. So that was a huge part of what we spent most of our day on. Just honing in on our values, our vision, what enterprises we have, what dollar amount we needed to make. And I don't know, if you were in that season, I think it's worth reaching out to someone to walk through those things. Also, you know, he farms for a living. So realistically, he knew with our property how much we were able to gross off of our property, which also gave us a really good idea, you know, for our long-term goal. We're not able to reach our long-term goals on this property. And so that was really good to know. Okay, what are we going to invest in here? Knowing that this isn't our forever home, this is not where God has called us to be. But we are in this season, and what can we do in this season? Before we move outside and we talk about some more things, I just thought I'd give you a little plant update. Micro greens. Trying a new mix this week. Got some pea shoots going. And then these are all getting planted out this week. All my lettuces, my parsley. These came from Saun. We've got some bunction onions, some salvo nova lettuce, some arugula. Look, this could actually be like micro greens. Look at that. These are the size I harvest my micro greens. Don't they look so good? This is actually with the paper plot transplanter. I don't have one of those, but these will just decompose in the ground. But essentially what that paper plot is, you fill all these, and then you just run that, and it plants this spectacular straight line. I think these things are so neat. I really feel like a big reason why I wanted to do this video and walk with you guys through my experience with our farm consultant. One, I think it was just, we were at a place, Nathan and I were at a place, where we desperately needed that. We needed that outside opinion. You know, we were at a place where we kept racking our heads back and forth. And I think there comes a point when you're trying to grow your business and your farm where you need some outside consulting. You need someone else's perspective to kind of be that mediator. Ask those hard questions that maybe we're not willing to ask ourselves. And I don't know, I'm talking to the person who is maybe on their farm and they have been thinking, how do I upscale? How do I make my hobby, my side hustle profitable? And I feel like you can, 100%. Walking through those things, figuring out your vision, what your goal is, how you're making your income. For me, at the beginning of the year, we do plant sales. We make a good amount that helps me get through the early spring off of that amount. So if you're doing that, maybe hone in on it. Maybe if you're wanting to experience with microgreens and they're big in your area, super low investment, really easy to crank out. Look into that. Plant starts, if you're wanting to sell plant starts, if you're wanting to sell vegetables. Maybe try to grow vegetables if someone else in your area isn't. I keep mentioning too, because I feel like it's worth mentioning, flowers have kind of been a game changer. Flowers are something I'm going to be dabbling into more and offering, and I think it's going to be fun. Flowers spark a lot of joy for me, so growing something beautiful and knowing that it's also bringing in revenue for my family is something that I'm really just taking into consideration. I think another big reason why I wanted to do this video is to tell you guys, like, I'm rooting for you. So sometimes I need someone to tell me, like, hey Jill, I'm rooting for you, and I'm telling you, hey, I'm rooting for you. If you are trying to figure this out, I've been growing food for a long time. I've had my business operating for a while, and I'm still figuring it out. And I think that's okay, because I feel like when we stay in a place of constantly learning, then we will continue to constantly grow. And I feel like that is the place I'm in. I am recognizing that, yes, I can grow food, but there's a lot of things I don't do well. The business side, the organization side of a business, I don't do well. And so I'm learning and adapting, and I'm growing, which is growing my business, it's growing my mindset, it's growing all these other aspects and all these other areas of our farm that really need that. So if you are sitting there watching this right now, and you're thinking, man, I really want to ramp up production on my farm. I don't know where to start. I would recommend a farm consultant. Maybe talk to someone else who has experience, another farmer. Get other people's ideas and feedback, and be encouraged by that. Do what you can do in the season that you're in financially, mentally. Secondly, I also want to take a minute and encourage you that you can have a successful business and not have to sacrifice your values or your family for that. I know sometimes that can get a little sloppy. Like I said, when you run your own business, you pour everything you have into it. It's your baby. You want to see it grow. You want to see it thrive. And I'm 100% yes. When you have invested in doing a business, you need to do that with excellence. You need to value that and value what you're giving someone else 100%. But I do believe that there's kind of this sweet spot where you can still have a really successful business and you can still be really invested with your family. That is one of those things. I'm not willing to sacrifice my family for anything. I don't feel like that's what God's called me to do, and I don't feel like I have to. So I want to encourage you, if you're a mother and you are taking care of your little babies and you are running a business, you can do it. You can be a really successful business person. You can be a really amazing mother. And I just want to take a moment and tell you that. I feel like you can do it. I have faith in you to do it. I don't feel like you have to compromise one to have the other. And so let that just be my little two cents for the day. But I believe in you. I feel like you can keep your values and still run a very successful business. Something else we talked about were things we were keeping on the farm just for our pleasure. We had no intentions of trying to sell them or make them profitable. They're just things that we enjoy and we're keeping them. And that would be our chickens. You know, the chickens provide us eggs. We enjoy having them. By no means do we want to sell those. That's nothing that we want to, you know, upscale or anything like that. So knowing that that's just our little family's leisure and that's fine. And the rabbits are also one of those things that we just have for our family. No intentions of upscaling that. No intentions of selling rabbits. Selling the meat. Nothing like that. And I think for me, knowing those things too kind of takes the pressure off of me. Like I can have the things that I know need to bring in money and bring in income to be successful. But then we also have those things that can just be our family's leisure. And I don't have to worry about, oh, you know, are the chickens producing enough eggs to where I can sell, you know, my minimum requirement for the week or whatever that may look like. So it kind of took a little pressure off of me. And it was nice just having those lanes where we were like, okay, this is the lane that we sell in. This is the lane that's just our family's, you know, for our family's use. Even the kitchen garden, you know, we were honing in, okay, these beds are the ones that we're going to do for the kitchen garden. These are the ones we're going to do for flowers. These are going to be the ones we sell out of. Just having that clear picture just makes it so much simpler. Hi, girlies. Since y'all love the rabbits as much as I do, I am really glad we have these little girls. What you doing? Aren't they so sweet? Hey. They kept trying to eat the microphone on my camera. We have really, really enjoyed having these rabbits. And I think that that's, you know, when you live at a place where you're working from, having these things that are just leisure in there, your family's pleasure, it is important. For me, it is really important. My, you know, our breeder rabbits, my kids can get attached to. Our chickens, my kids can get attached to. Green, and they're not going to get attached to the produce that I sell or anything like that. But I think when you're trying to figure out the core values of your farm, what you want to bring income, how do you want to be profitable, and then knowing what you can keep and what you can have just for leisure, for fun. It is a nice balance. And someone had commented the other day and had told me that I just seem like I have so much joy. And I really believe when you're doing something that you feel like you are truly called to do. Like, I am literally like, I'm just as happy showing you guys my life. Like, I know for seasons and seasons I have prayed for this moment where I could do this. Where I could farm. I could share that with someone else. I could teach someone else. I could let them experience this lifestyle with me. And being at a place where, like, God has answered all those things for me seems so unreal. Just the possibility of being able to share this with you guys seems super surreal. So, I'm glad you guys see that. I'm glad you see my joy and my heart in it. And knowing that I want to use this as a platform to better you guys and help you guys and show you guys ultimately what does and doesn't work. You guys know, like, I don't have to figure it out. I mean, I can grow food. And that's about it. But we did make the decision to tear down the muscadines too. So, that whole patch over there is muscadines. And the plan was to level this out and make this high tunnel production area. Which kind of seems like daunting work. And it is. But at least knowing that those are things we need to work on. We finally made a decision about a greenhouse. We are getting our greenhouse from our friend Sean. He builds these hoop-like houses. I'll link them below if you want to check them out. He does them custom. And so, he's going to do that. We're actually going to have it be movable. So, we can keep it close to the garden. But then have the liberty to move it wherever it makes sense for us later down the road. So, having a clear picture and a vision on that. Like I said, the plant sales are a huge income for us at the beginning of the season. So, knowing that that greenhouse needs to be done by January. That way I can start my plants in there and starting seeds. Just gives us a clear idea and a clear vision. Okay, these are what our money needs to go to in the beginning. These are the things we need to emphasize on and focus on. For us, just really answered a lot of questions to the next steps that we had on our farm. We had even talked about, since we finally made a decision on the seed starting greenhouse. The greenhouse that I currently have that we're about to walk into. We made a decision on what to do with this. I love this space. Actually, quite a lot. It's just not a functional space as far as the infrastructure of it. It's way too shaded for like seed starting greenhouse that I would need. But, instead of tearing it down all the time we've put into making this work. We found out a really cool thing that we can do with this in the meantime. And I'm pretty excited. It is going to allow me to offer something that people in my area aren't offering. Utilize the space that we have. So, that's really cool. And something that I would have never thought of. I love being creative. I'm not always creative. But I love attempting to be creative. And then, like, tossing around my ideas with other people's ideas. And hearing, you know, the things that they come up with. It blows my mind. Like, just how many creative people are on this earth. And just how all of our minds work differently. I'm just thinking, oh my gosh. Like, this is fantastic. So, our friend Sean had come up with a really cool idea. Where we could utilize this greenhouse in our off seasons. And it made a lot of sense for us. It was super cool. Really creative. Super unique. So, stay tuned as we try to, you know, work through that and figure that out. Right now, it is just the storage house. And that's actually what we're utilizing it for now. And I actually think that's fine. Because otherwise, this stuff would be crammed in my herb room. Which is not a lot of space in there anyways. So, right now, during the fall and the winter, we just use it to store all of our stuff in. So, I really hope this video kind of just gives you a clear picture of why we felt the need to seek out a farm consultant. Maybe if you're in the same situation and you're asking those questions. I don't know the next steps. I don't know if I need to reach this income every month. What I need to do on my property to reach that. It may not even be vegetables. It may be selling goat's milk. It may be selling eggs. It may be value-added products. Like, you know, ferments or jams and pickles and things like that. And that's okay. Figure out what it is. I just know that for Nathan and I, as we're sitting here, having owned a business for, you know, at least a year. Thinking, okay, are these common things that a lot of people are asking and we just don't know what resources we have available to us. Or maybe we're just stuck bouncing these ideas back and forth on our spouse. And maybe they are like-minded like us. So, when we think of solutions, they're the same solutions. And when you actually just need to source that out and realize, okay, maybe if I invest this money in this area, the payout on that for us was substantial. You know, for us, it was worth the investment on the front end for the knowledge and just having someone else's perspective. You know, he was telling me how many beds I needed to be planting and figuring out how I'm going to source that. Is it going to be wholesale? Is it going to be direct to consumer? Those are things you need to take into consideration. So, I am making this video for that person who is maybe wanting to step into becoming a small business, making their farm profitable. What next steps you need to take? Maybe these are things you've never thought about. And I would encourage you, figure out your customer. For me, I've always done wholesale. And I can tell you, having done that, that now I want to move away from that because there's not as much profit in it for my family. And if I'm able to have that direct to consumer sale, it just makes more sense versus wholesaling it. And then I'm only getting half of what they're trying to sell it for, which is just the name of the game, right? I mean, there's no fault in that. That's just how we've always done it. But then knowing, okay, I'm wanting to move away from those things. So, these are the steps I need to take to make that actually happen. I know yesterday we kind of had just, for hours, it was an all-day ordeal. I had just kind of walked through all of these things and throwing our ideas and our visions around and just listening. And it was a lot. Like mentally at the end of the day, Nathan and I were like, oh, it all hurts. Like everything hurts. But it was one of those things that it was necessary for us to figure out what our next steps were. And I think if you guys know anything, I want to encourage you guys. I feel like God has called me to a place in my life to pour encouragement into you all and into others in whatever way that may look like. So, if you are in a season where you're sitting there and you're wanting to make your farm more profitable and you're needing to know what steps to do. And you're not wanting to have to, you know, sacrifice your time as a mother or a wife or whatever. If you're a father and you're, you know, still wanting to farm and not have to sacrifice the time with your kids. I think you can do it. And I'm here to encourage you. I'm here to say yes. Like I want to rally behind you on that. I do. I feel a lot of passion behind it. I think that we as a generation, it is our, almost our responsibility to teach the next generation how to farm regeneratively. How to be more sustainable. How to lean on the land more than, you know, a grocery store. I think that there's a lot of value in that. There's a lot of value in passing that down to the next generation to keep that legacy going. And I'm here to root you on for it. So I know this might have been a bit of information overload. As I was overloaded with information, I then pushed that information on you guys. So I apologize if it seems like a lot. While it was fresh on my mind and while we were hitting some of those points, I wanted to relay that to you guys. And if you are in a similar season that Nathan and I are in and with your business or maybe you're needing to make decisions or move forward with things, I just wanted to relay this information because for us, it was a game changer. It was valuable. It was worth our investment. It was worth our time. If you are in the same particular season, I want you to know that I feel like it may be worth that investment. It may be worth your time investment, your money investment. Especially if it's going to provide longevity. It's going to provide income for your family. I think it's worth looking into. Obviously, I'm going to recommend my friend because I think he was fantastic. But I'll put their information below if you want to reach out to them. Of course, figure out where you are. You may have that friend. As you're listening to this video, someone may pop in your mind like, Oh, I know this farmer who does farm consulting. Reach out to them. I think it's just important really to bring in outside voices. I know a lot of times I'll ask my sister and my sister-in-law things. They're not in my realm when it comes to farming and owning a business. But they do have an outside perspective that is really valuable. Their input means a lot to me. Even if maybe you don't have a farm consultant or you don't have the means to invest maybe that initial cost into a farm consultant, Reach out to someone because you would probably be surprised at what their inputs and their advice on something might actually help you quite a bit. So my hope for you would be from this video that you kind of had some clarity on what it looks like to hire a farm consultant. What you might expect to get from that. Granted, it was a 9 to 5 all day ordeal. So there was a lot more packed in there. A lot more hard questions. But if you're in that, maybe in those in-between places and you're trying to figure out how to transition and how to upscale, I just wanted to paint this picture for you guys. Let you guys know what we got out of it. We would 100 times do it over again. We felt like it was so worth it. We felt like it answered so many questions that we needed answers to. It gave us a clear vision on what we needed to do and in the steps and what priorities they were in. Which is something we were also kind of struggling with. We know all of these things need to get done, but at what priority do they take? So for us, we cannot speak enough about it. If you guys have questions or you're just needing some extra encouragement, please reach out to me. Like I said, I do feel like God has called me to do this. And with that, I want to invest in you guys. Because y'all have poured into our family and invested in me and my family so much. So we could never thank you guys enough. And I want to repay that in any way I can. So if you have more detailed questions about what that looks like. Or you have questions in particular that you want an answer that maybe I didn't cover in this. Please comment below. You guys can send me an email. Whatever that looks like. I would be happy to talk with you guys more about this one-on-one. But that wraps up this video. I am actually making dinner tonight. So I'm going to go in and get started on that. But thank you guys so much for hanging out with me today. I'll talk to you soon.
