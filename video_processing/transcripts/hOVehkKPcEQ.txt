 Hi, hey kitty. Hi. How are you? Good kitty. Hey guys, what's up? Welcome back to another one. Um, I just got home from work and I got an auction video ready for you guys. It's almost ready. It's the second part of last month's auction and there's something that I bought that I haven't showed you guys yet and I'm gonna show you guys, which I'm pretty excited about it. But real quick, before we get into that, tonight I'm catching all those guys. These guys have been getting out, so I might take some of them. And there's also a few this and that that I want to catch also and take to the auction, which is tomorrow. So fresh auction stuff coming up. But I mean, the baby goats are just too much fun, but they're growing good, growing fast, kind of crazy. Anyway, into the auction. Some big boy roos. You guys older, younger? Young. They had to sell pretty well. My guess is nine bucks. How many ladies in there? Four? Good looking birds. You guys all ruins, I'm guessing. I like apple yards. Pretty birds. Harlequins. That's what I meant to say. They're not silver hop birds. These are wash harlequins. Pretty. I like them. Some bunnies. Big ones. A bunch of eggs. What kind of you tell me about these eggs? Three dozen per bucket. There you go. Probably sell them by the bucket. A nice cage. Figure that out. Pretty rude. I don't know what to make out of him, but you know. He's pretty. Looks like, oh my goodness, you guys are old. Check out the spur on little boy back there. Hey, bud. Come on. I don't know if I can zoom in on that or not. Anyway. Cool looking little birds.

Not too many of them. I should have brought some, but nope. What do we got here? Langshan. Don't see those in white very often. A lot of times you'll see them in black. Oh, look at the Muscovies. There's. There's blues. This is a bird that I do not need, but I need a good blue drake. And there's good looking blue drakes in there. I mean, look at that guy. A little bit light for what I really want. I might have to go something like that, but I've got too many Muscovies, but I really want some blues. I have no idea what an Aloha is. You chickens sound made up. All these designer breeds are kind of hard to keep up with. Calico coaching? They don't even have feathered teeth. Is that what's supposed to be on here?

There might be some barn builders in there, but... What are you telling me? No. A bunch of Caternix quail. Crazy. These guys are what? Two weeks old? Maybe? They grow so fast. Indian fan tails.
