 You can see this one's a very healthy robust looking plant, obviously growing very well. It's got a lot of stems. This lab in Wovorn may seem like a long way away from the grain fields of the Midwest and Canada, but what's being done here could change the way crops are grown around the world. Dr. Ali Peebles has a PhD in molecular biology and a CEO of Yield 10 Bioscience. Their team is identifying genes and crops like rice, corn and beans to boost their production without adding chemicals. So it's really about efficiency. It's improving the basic efficiency of crops. For centuries, farmers would select the best crop after harvest and plant those seeds the next year. Today, to find the perfect seed, they use technology, something called CRISPR. It's a gene editor that allows them to find a desirable trait and replicate it quickly by slicing the DNA of a plant. Do you go into it with the idea of we want to change this or in the process to learn that that's what needs to be changed? In our case, it's very targeted. We want to go in and specifically change a specific sequence. By changing a specific sequence of DNA, they can produce a crop that is naturally resistant to pests, weeds and drought. At the same time, boosting the yield, allowing farmers to grow more plants on less land with less harmful chemicals and fertilizer. We have edited seeds here. Kira Ryan shows me that once the DNA sequence is cut, it leaves a marker to help sort the seeds. To see which rice seeds are best to work with requires some special glasses. And by placing it under this green light, they can now look at the individual seeds and the ones that glow, they get rejected. That's a marker for the genes that we want to sort out of these, this group of plants. What we're really doing is we're just using the genetic engineering tools to untap the genetic potential that's actually present in nature and to do it in a way that directs it towards societal good. This is really interesting because the agriculture business is really big in the US. It's huge. In the US alone, it's a hundred and sixty billion dollar industry. Now imagine these guys can increase yield by 10 or 20 percent. You get the idea. That part of the market is huge. They could really develop in that.
