 So Paul, a common question from golfers may be, have the greens been irrigated? So how much, where and when should we be irrigating? And why Caitlin? Why should we be irrigating? We're doing this to maintain the health of the surfaces, the consistency of the surfaces. But we don't irrigate everywhere. Greens will be the primary location so we can understand how much we need to irrigate by good green keeping, good green keeping site knowledge, but also tools to measure the moisture content, to get the even distribution on the surface and in the soil. That might be irrigating from the automatic irrigation system or irrigating, hand watering the high and dry low spots because again to conserve water is really important. So primarily it's the health of the turf, conditions which are too dry, we lose playability, but also encourage disease activity and disorders. But similarly if the surfaces are too wet, the surfaces are too soft and can encourage thatch and disease issues as well. So all around the right balance of water management will benefit the golfer. So let's go to the right balance of water management. So let's go. So let's go. So let's go. So let's go.
