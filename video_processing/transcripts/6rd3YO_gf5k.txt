 I have to make a profit. And my wife and I are both public school teachers in Alabama, so that's a surefire way of not having money. And we started doing rotational grazing, 94, 95. This is it. We just move cows, make sure they got water and minerals. Do you notice the lack of flies on these cows? We do nothing for flies, zero. We let our sanitation department, generally our dung beetles, take care of that. We will never cut hay here as long as I'm alive. Anytime I feed hay, I'm not happy. I talked to the guy the other day, and he said, you know how much hay I fed this year? I said, no. He said, I bailed myself 1,200 round bales. And I bought another 200 feet. I'm just calculating my mind, how are you making money? You got three iconic grassland bird species here that are known to be in decline on a national scale. Oh, really? Bob White. Do you hear Bob White either? Yeah, you hear that. I bet you do. You're managing your landscape in a way that not only is economically feasible for you, but it's harmonious with nature. You know, you're providing grassland habitat. And it's really good for the soil. Yeah, it is. That's right.
