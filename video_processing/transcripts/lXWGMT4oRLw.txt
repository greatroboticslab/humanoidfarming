 assalamualaikum and hi everyone this time i would like to share with you on the topic of agricultural productivity and management to maintain soil health as we know that soil erosion has been the largest contributor to reduce soil productivity soil erosions are mostly caused by water and wind and this will reduce the soil productivity how soil erosion cause low soil productivity the first one it will decreasing the topsoil thicknesses and rooting depth next it also will decreasing the organic matter and microbial activity the disturbance of the microbial activity in the soil will decrease the nutrient supply for the plant update and the last ones the soil erosion will cause exposure of the topsoil sorry the exposure of the subsoils the exposure of the subsoil will decrease the infiltrations and plant available water therefore today i will share with you the management practice for soil health these are the three common practice to maintain the soil health the first one is a conservation tillage second one is the crop rotations and the third one cover crops and green manure but this time i will discuss with you for the conservation tillage first conservation tillage are the crop residue management system have been developed to leave more crop residue on the surface to reduce soil water loss compared with conventional tillage system there are specific advantage of the conservation tillage the first one it helps to reduce soil erosion how they can reduce the soil erosion this is due to the presence of the plant residue this plant residue will retain the soil from runoff it also will increase soil organic matter where this is also organic matter will increase the soil aggregation and also the infiltrations and the conservation tillage have to reduce the soil evaporation it means it maintains the soil moisture the soil moisture is a very important to have the microbial activity in the soils the soil soil conservation tillage refers to the tillage system that leaves more than 30 percent of the soil surface covered with residue after planting these are the most common example of the soil conservation tillage that currently practice in oil pump fields where there is a usage of the chipping of oil pump trunks in the fields where all the plant residue were written back into the soil where these plant residue will become the soil organic matter there are three methods conservation tillage that requires specialized equipment the first one is no tillage no tillage means all the crop procedure left on soil surface and soil disturbance occur only with plantals and applications of nutrients however no till is not well suited for poorly drained soils second one strip tillage a strip tillage is a process of incorporating the residue only in the narrow trail sorry sorry only in the narrow strip which allowing for increased soil temperature and decrease soil water at the planting compared to the non-tills the third one is a rich tillage so the rich tillage means the planters actually pushes all the residue in the area between the rows these practices is very useful on the polydrain especially for clay soil that's all for today thank you for watching this video you
