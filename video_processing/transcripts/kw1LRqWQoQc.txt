 There's no question it's getting colder out. Summer crops are becoming a memory and even the perennial favorites are shutting it down for the year. I'm lucky where I live in that the fall is usually quite mild and the creeping into winter is slow and gradual. And this allows me plenty of time to still grow a wide array of fall powerhouses such as this kale here. For many of you though, winter is coming or it's already here. But instead of fall doldrums and winter sadness, join me inside while we keep this garden party going with my top 9 crops to grow indoors this winter. Let's get it some time. Let's get a quick look. Great. Indoor plants don't magically need a different set of requirements than their outdoor counterparts. But obviously how we grow and achieve these things is going to be a little bit different. Indoors, temperatures are usually quite steady. And obviously at this time of year, probably a little bit higher. Indoors, especially for germination, where the sprouting requirements for most seeds is actually warmer than that of the plants themselves. Once they've sprouted, however, every crop in the world looks for light. And even on a day like this, advantage outdoors. Nothing beats the sun, neither in cost nor intensity. But when the outdoor temperatures can no longer support a crop... No amount of sunshine, or lack thereof, is going to matter. Sunny windows, solariums and greenhouses can suffice if you're one of the lucky few. But often, we're going to need to resort to artificial light. Now that I got you thinking about temperature and light, let's move on to containers and soil. Outdoors, we often take drainage for granted. As no matter how much rain we get, when set up properly, our beds can deal with the excess water. Indoors, however, many have foolishly tried to grow in self-contained pots or containers for fear of the water coming out the bottom and spilling everywhere. Don't do this. Non-draining containers are a death sentence for plants. So make sure your containers drain, and that means you also have to provide a means to catch the runoff. For soil, it can be tempting to use compost or the soil out of your garden, but I'd strongly advise against it. Indoors, you really want to go with a store-bought sterile mix. Bringing in soil from outside can introduce a whole host of pests, which we'll get into later. But let me leave you with this. Without the balance of nature to keep pests in check, they'll go rampant and explode like you've never seen before. Trust me, you don't want an outbreak. Leave the outside soil outside. So, these are the four parameters that are going to govern your indoor growing success. Temperature, light, water, and soil. Before we get into the big list of plants I grow indoors, let's go through all the steps that are needed to successfully grow an indoor crop. Time's short, so let's do two at the same time. When I plant an indoor crop, it always starts with a series of choices. What plant to grow is first, and it governs almost everything else. In this example, we're going to grow a wall of sugar snap peas and a bed of spinach. Pretty cool, and it's easier than you think. Once you know the crop you're going to grow, you can start off with the containers, which of course, we have to poke holes in. Even though these were bought from a garden center, and they're designed for plants, and they should know better, astonishingly, they still didn't have holes. It just shows you, you can't trust anything these days. Once we've finished our drainage holes, we're ready to fill these guys up. I use a sterile indoor potting mix. This stuff is designed for indoor houseplants, but it works just as well for garden crops. Fill them up right to the top. Easy stuff. For the peas, I like to soak them first, usually overnight, before planting. I plant them in twos, in case one doesn't germinate. I can always thin them again later. Space each group of pea seeds three to four inches apart, burying them at a depth of about half an inch. For the spinach, I create a little trough in the center, about half an inch deep. I generously sow the seeds in this little ditch, and cover them back up. Finally, I top off both containers with a skim coating of mulch, which will make top watering a thousand times easier, and it'll hold in the moisture, so I can water a lot less. Above, I have a simple LED grow light, but this is at the high end of what you need, as both peas and spinach will grow just fine with the light from a window. If you are using a grow light, space it about 24 inches away from the top of the plants. Within five days, the spinach has sprouts. Two days after that, the peas also poke through. For spinach, because we can get away with a minimal life cycle, it's an ideal indoor crop. A plant grown purely for foliage, resulting in a quicker, less resource-expensive harvest. Peas, on the other hand, are not only going to need the flower and fruit, but they're also going to require vertical support. Peas are a climber, and they're going to need at least two feet of trellising to grow upwards. It's not a huge deal, but when you're growing indoors, these kind of needs and requirements tend to be cumulative. Truth is, it's a noticeable discrepancy between a quick leafy harvest and a flowering plant requiring a bit more resources. And this is precisely why I picked these two crops. It's something we need to think about when we're choosing the best plants to grow indoors. If given enough space, heat, time, and light, anything can be grown. But there's a limit to where it becomes no longer practical. Or profitable. I want you to choose the best plants suited for your indoor endeavours. Because there's no point in growing a $10 crop that costs $20 to reach harvest. And on that note, here's my top nine crops that I'd pick if I were starting an indoor edible garden today. First up has to be lettuce. All varieties are fair game, but the loose leaf and romaine types like this guy here are tops on the list. Upright cultivars like romaine and certain loose leaves can be spaced closer together, taking up less room in the cozier confines of indoors. Lettuce sprouts fast. And once you get four to five layers of leaves, it can be harvested continually all winter. Keep it cool, well watered, and at least some full spectrum light. Four hours or more, if possible. Next up, and we already covered this guy, is spinach. Spinach is an even faster crop than lettuce, maturing in less than 50 days. The only issue, however, is that it's usually a single harvest and then the crop is done. No problem there though. Simply stagger your plantings every couple of weeks to have fresh spinach all winter. Keep the plants cool under 65 degrees Fahrenheit and give a moderate amount of light. Spinach is quite shallow rooted, much less so than lettuce. So its planting possibilities are endless. Another leafy miracle is arugula. This spice monster, native to the Mediterranean, is super easy to grow, very forgiving, and matures in as fast as four to six weeks. Known as rocket across the pond, arugula grows almost identical to spinach, although it'll tolerate higher temperatures and more intense light setups. Sow your arugula seeds very shallow and use a wet paper towel to prevent the seeds from drying out. You can harvest arugula at any time with the younger leaves being much milder in flavor. I know we said the flowering and fruiting crops were way too resource intensive, but honestly, growing a giant wall of peas indoors is just too cool not to include. Peas like this sugar snap variety are quite shallow rooted with all their space requirements being above ground. They're going to need a minimum of two feet of climbing space, but beyond that, their heat and light requirements are fairly reasonable. Of course peas are going to do better with more light, but nothing nearly as intensive as say tomatoes or peppers. Be aware though, bigger the light, bigger the pods. Light is an energy input, and the pods are an energy output. And that makes sense. Give them as much light as possible, but don't think you can't grill them without an expensive LED. Now, you may be wondering about the flowers and fertilization. Have no fear, peas have perfect complete flowers, meaning that both male and female parts are on the same structure. As such, they're self-pollinating. No need for insects or intervention on your part. Next up, we have a category of crops rather than a single plant, and that's microgreens. The reason for this and why I've lumped them all together is that microgreens are almost always grown indoors, and they're all grown the same way. So in that sense, every microgreen makes the list. What are microgreens, you ask? Simply put, microgreens are the very, very young shoots of ordinary crops germinated and harvested shortly after their true leaves appear. In the timeline of crop categories, they sit right after sprouts, just before baby greens. Soak your microgreen seeds of choice for 24 hours prior to planting. And I say planting, but with microgreens, you really just place them on the surface of the soil. Most microgreen varieties are harvested in 12 to 14 days. And a few of the multi-node crops, such as these speckled peas here, can actually be harvested more than once. Microgreens are some of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet, but they're not cheap to buy in the store, nor do they last very long after harvest. Fortunately, they're beyond easy to grow, even if you've never gardened before. I've got several videos giving an in-depth tutorial on specific varieties. Check out this video right here, as well as others in the description. The next set of plants are also grouped together, collectively known as herbs. Hmm. Now, not all herbs are suitable for indoor life, so I'm just going to cover my top four. First up is everyone's flavor favorite, and that's basil. This spicy member of the mint family is as easy to grow as it is delicious. And while it is often offered at grocery stores as a full-grown plant ready to go, the seeds are super cheap, and it's really simple to start. Basil does like it a bit warmer to get going. Try for around 80 degrees Fahrenheit, but they sprout fast, and they grow quickly. These guys here sprouted less than a month ago. Harvest basil by cutting down the shoots to just above the first leaf node. The plant will then go ahead and reward you with double the production as two more shoots take its place. Keep one plant going all winter for unlimited pesto and basil goodness. Another flavor superstar and a herb that grows even faster than basil is cilantro. It's grown in much the same way with higher germination temperatures and then cooling off as the plants grow. Instead of the branching nature of basil, though, cilantro is more of a single-stemmed annual herb. So we multi-seed the containers to achieve nice bushy harvests. And that time from seed to harvest is less than two months. So plant a couple of pots staggered for fresh cilantro all winter. And you can't have a flavor train without dill. Traditionally an outdoor herb, more and more people are growing dill indoors these days. And I, for one, welcome it. The five or so months that I can grow dill outside is simply not enough. I want fresh dill all the time. Having said that, dill is the one herb that I've found that dried leaves actually retains some of their signature flavor. Still though, fresh is best. And dill is super easy to grow inside. I try to pick the shorter varieties to plant indoors because normally dill is a tall, vigorous grower. Pruning to harvest regularly will keep the plants in check, however. And just one dill plant is enough to last you the entire winter. If you haven't tried growing dill indoors yet, do check it out. Fresh dill is like a little ray of sunshine even in the coldest of winters. And last on our list is actually two plants, chives and green onions. Although they look very similar and are closely related, chives and green onions, or scallions, are not the same plant. But they can be grown the exact same way. Sow your chive seeds quite shallow in groups of 10 to 15 seeds. Green onions can be planted the same way, but limit the number of seeds to 3 to 4. Green onions are more of a single stalk type plant and they grow much, much larger than chives do. Chives and green onions sprout at almost any temperature, but their ideal range is between 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. I try to wait until the shoots are at least 4 inches tall for chives and 6 inches tall for green onions before I harvest. You can selectively cut out the stems as you need them, or if you need a lot, you can cut the entire plant down. It'll still grow back. And using the whole cut method, you'll get 3 to 4 harvests each winter. Keep these guys at room temperature, but give them as much light as possible. One unique feature about the green onions though, is that you can start them from grocery store plants. They're sold with their white root bulbs still intact, and when placed in water, they can grow quite quickly into brand new plants. It's quite amazing, and if you've never grown anything before, green onion cuttings are a great way to start your gardening career. Indoor growing can be expensive, complicated, and unprofitable. But it doesn't have to be. Your success at producing food indoors has less to do with your ability and experience, and more to do with your crop choice. These 9 plants will almost guarantee you a harvest that you otherwise wouldn't have as we wait out the long winter. Give indoor growing a try, because whether you're a veteran grower or a first-time beginner, being able to scratch that garden itch in the middle of winter is worth the effort.
