 It's incredibly hard to mess up farming, but I still see so many people do it. So here's your ultimate farming guide. First of all, you can just use a 9x9 square and put one water in the middle, but mainly you should always alternate crops. Alternated crops grow much faster than clumping them together, and most people want carrots and potatoes anyway. And if anyone's ever told you that sugarcane grows faster on sand, they're lying! It grows the same speed on everything, that's just how it's coded. Also, this is the most efficient water pattern for sugarcane, and you should always put slabs on the water so none falls in.
