Education
 I appreciate all of you coming today. This is the first of three seminars as part of the UNL Big Ideas Seminar Series. And our particular topic is technology for use in identifying or recognizing plants. Now, we've got some variation in that because there's obviously different things that are related to that. But over the next three weeks or so, we're going to hear from three different individuals who are going to talk about kind of the latest in what they're doing as far as identifying plants, the use of robotics in managing plants. And today, I would like to introduce Dr. Simon Blackmore. He is with Harper Adams University. And Simon has traveled all the way from UK to be with us here today. And I really appreciate him doing that. Dr. Blackmore is the head of the engineering department at Harper Adams University. Before that, he's spent some time in his own endeavors looking at robotics and how that applies to agricultural systems. He travels the world, has been to China, different countries, talking about this subject. Probably some of you in this room or maybe even online have heard of him or have seen some of the things that he's done. But I think you're really going to be interested in what he has to talk about today. And I would encourage you to stick around at the end. We will have time for a Q&A. And those of you who are online, I don't think that you can ask questions live. But you're welcome to send emails later to follow up. So without any further ado, I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Blackmore to tell us a little bit more about this topic. Okay, well, thank you very much, Steve, for the invitation. And thank you very much indeed for the invitation to actually come here and join with you in this very interesting set of seminars. Well, good afternoon, everybody. It's a great pleasure to be here. Thank you very much, Steve. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 6% of our students get jobs within six months. Third in the UK for teaching excellence, just behind the OU Cambridge, and then ourselves. This is always of interest to my wife because she works for the Open University, so she says she's beating us on that one. And fifth in the UK for student satisfaction. So the engineering department, we offer two degrees, unique degrees, that are unique in the UK. My department is the only department of agriculture engineering in the whole of the UK. All of the others have been shut down over many years ago. But we're reversing the trend. We're getting record numbers of students. We're getting record numbers of interest and funding and so on. But we offer two degrees, agricultural engineering and off-road vehicle design. And that's quite an interesting combination because a lot of the things that we teach in agricultural engineering are pertinent to off-road vehicles. And so we don't teach agriculture in that degree, but we do then look at the vehicles themselves in more depth. And we offer a whole range from foundation degrees right the way through to PhD. I've got about 30 staff and 300 students with a full workshop, an indoor soil hall where we can do experiments without worrying about the vagaries of the weather, lots of tractors. And we're going to be starting a new master's in 2013 in precision farming and another one in applied engineering. Developing links with China and Brazil and funding from different companies. So this has resulted in setting up the National Centre for Precision Farming last year. And we got an announcement from our Prime Minister that they'd actually then awarded us £1.5 million from the Government Catalyst Fund. And we raised £1.5 million for a new building. So we're going to have a nice new agriculture engineering building. That's going to have all sorts of hopefully innovative technologies inside it, including a full-sized tractor simulation laboratory. So the centre is an inclusive, non-competitive networking hub used for passing on information and bringing people together. It's quite interesting listening to your colleagues this morning at the all-hands discussion about the work that you're doing with your own innovation campus. And in fact, I was joking with Steve that the topics that we heard this morning could have been replayed at my university and it would have been exactly the same. So we have a lot of shared experiences there. But nevertheless, the outcome of doing this is to help farmers meet today's political, economic and environmental needs by using smarter systems. And I think this is the key part to all of the work that we're doing to develop systems, techniques, processes and machines that are smarter than the previous versions. And then we're going to deal with a number of different services. So today's topic is talking about robots. So here's a nice lot of robots all brought together. Before I started at Harper Adams two years ago, I was project manager of the European Future Farm project. And we brought robots together from all over Europe at the field robot event where we could then evaluate them, try them out, see how good they were and quite often see how unreliable they were. So this is actually an issue that we do really need to get serious about and find ways of making these machines more reliable and robust than perhaps where they have been in the past. So if we're going to look forward, one of the things I think always to do is to take a little look backwards and look at sort of current trends. And we've seen machines getting bigger all the time. If you talk to any of the tractor manufacturers and ask them about what their next model is going to be, it's going to be something that's bigger than was there previously. Can that continue? In 10 years' time, in 20 years' time, is this linear development of machine size going to continue? Are we going to get 2,000 horsepower tractor? Are we going to get things that are six times larger than they are at the moment? I think, intuitively, I would say no. There's got to be a limit to what we can do. And what we're actually finding is that these big machines are viable in certain conditions. And even in this funny little cartoon down here showing how tractors are developing and getting bigger over the years, if you're prairie farming, then yes, you can stand a 900 horsepower tractor, 1,000 horsepower tractor, because you're effectively doing industrial farming. You're just getting out there trying to cover the acres as quickly as you possibly can. But I think there is some alternatives. And although we've got advantages with the current system, very effective, reduced labour cost per hectare, high work rates, good for large farms and fields, which is effectively taking advantage of the economies of scale. It's a classic case that's being carried out in industry. Economies of scale. You can make it bigger. If you're going to pay somebody an hour to sit on the tractor, if they can do 20 acres rather than 10 acres, that makes sense. But there are disadvantages of well. Operators are expensive. The capital cost of these machines is a lot of money. Reduced flexibility, non-scalable. What about the possibility of subsoil compaction? And I'll come back to compaction a few more times. If we start compacting the subsoil so that the plants cannot grow, we do not have enough energy in any machine to be able to rip out subsoil compaction. It is so deep and so much energy is needed. And we can also start thinking about trafficability. Now, again, if we now look a little bit in terms of managing these situations, we can consider the units of what are the management units. So quite often, farm managers will perhaps do the same operation across the whole farm or may do the same operation across one field, which is the traditional way of doing things. We've seen with precision farming that it makes sense to divide the field up into sub-areas and be able then to treat different areas with different treatments. And we get variable dose rate, patch application, and so on. But if we continue that, what is the smallest area of treatment? What's the smallest unit of treatment that we can deal with? And I would suggest the smallest unit of treatment we can deal with is actually the individual plant. Now, we don't normally think of things at that level because if we had a manned tractor or if you and I were doing this, it would be highly repetitive and would be too difficult to deal with. But I'm going to show you a number of robots that can actually deal with this plant-level husbandry, this individual plant care system. Now, to be able to do this, I think we need to take on or to develop a new generation of machinery based on plant needs. The more that I've been looking at how we are currently dealing with mechanization, I see that the limitation is actually to do with the machines themselves. It is actually the machine that is causing the problem in the first place. But if we can, all right, I can almost bring it around the other way. Let me ask you a question. Can we then come up with a system that doesn't have the limitations that we've got at the moment but can still carry out all of the agronomic requirements needed by a mechanization system? And my answer to that is yes, that we can. But if we come up with this new generation of machinery based on the plant needs, we can do operations that we cannot do now or find too expensive or time-consuming. We need lower energy. I will come back to intelligently targeted inputs in a moment. Small area or plant scale operations, low compaction, modular and scalable, cost-effective, fleet management. There's a lot of high technology, new ways of managing these machines when we develop it as a system. Now if we do develop it as a system, I like to think that I am a systems thinker. And one of the aspects of systems thinking is to understand the multiple perspectives of a system. And so here I'm going to show you some of the perspectives that we've taken into account when trying to design the system. So we need to think about safety, energy, economics, environment, management, mechanization, technology and society. Now it's a big ask to come up with a design that can deal with all of that. But of course it gets complex very quickly then because then we end up with a whole range of other issues coming into this. But again, if we are going to try and design a system to go inside this box in the middle here, then if we want that to be successful, it has to meet most of those requirements. So we have to understand the system well enough to be able to come up with one that is going to solve more problems than it's going to cause. So if we do come up with a system, what are the implications? Well, we then, it should be good for the environment to be able to come up with minimal energy inputs. I've had discussions the last couple of days with Steve where what we're really trying to do with these things is to actually, what is the minimum amount that you need to change the environment? If we've got the natural environment out there and we are converting it to do something useful for us, grow our crops and grow our food, what's the minimum energy that is needed to be able to adjust the natural environment? And that's why I keep coming back to energy because we could have done it through economics, but that is quite, can at times be quite vague and difficult to understand. But we can actually, as engineers, understand this whole process through looking at the energy flows. It's good for the environment, allows controlled biodiversity. At the moment we consider any other plant growing inside the crop as a weed, and we see that as competitive and it shouldn't be there, so we need to dig it out. Now, that's not necessarily the case. We can have plants growing in the field that can at times be complementary to the crop, and if it is not competitive, then why don't we leave it there? It's good for wildlife, it's good for the birds and the bees and all the rest of it. So, the understanding of what is a weed and what isn't a weed is very useful. Economics, we can talk about labour costs. One of the most expensive things on a tractor is the person sitting there. Does that person need to be there? I'm not saying we're going to replace all tractors. I don't think we will, and we're not replacing farmers. We will, farmers will always be farmers. But what we are developing here is a new set of tools for farmers to use. Economics, incremental investment. Small investment, these smaller machines. We can then have scalability if you want to up the work rate. You don't have to sell that tractor and buy one double the size. You can have two, three, four, six of these small machines, depending on exactly what it is that you're trying to do. The concept of redundancy. If you've got one big tractor at the moment and that breaks down, the whole thing stops. If you've got half a dozen robots running around, maybe you've got a spare one in the garage. You bring it out, start it up, and off you go again. It's giving a lot more control to what is actually going on. Social. Public perception of agriculture improved. We see a lot of movies about robots. And the public acceptance is that if we've got a cute little thing that's running around here doing something useful for us, that's acceptable. The public like that. And to be able to have these machines helping us in agriculture, I think, is already accepted in the public. I know I'm talking to an American audience here, and I apologize. You like big things. You like your tractors to be like that. Well, at the moment, I like my tractor to be like that. But that is only whilst we work out what safe and reliable is. After we've spent time understanding what safe and reliability issues are, we can scale them up. But in the first generation of robots, I think they're going to be smaller. And so that overcomes the issues of liability. If it's a small vehicle and it's only running at a couple of miles an hour and it bangs into your leg and you get a bruise, that's not a problem. If it bangs into your car and you've got a dented fender, you get your insurance on it. It's not life-threatening. If we talk about the big conventional tractors, then that's a different issue altogether. So it's different stages of development. And we've got a lot of opportunities to be able to use existing research sensors. A lot of PhDs around the world are developing interesting new systems and sensors that don't get outside of the laboratory. If it takes a few minutes, we're interested in understanding weeds, recognition of weeds. Again, I'll come back to that. If it takes five minutes to analyze a picture, well, hopefully in a few years' time the computing power will up so it won't take long. But we could implement some of these systems now if they were not on man tractors. If a man has to sit there waiting for it to take a picture and then move a yard and sit there and wait to take another picture, that doesn't make any sense. But if it's a robot, why not? They can sit there for 24 hours a day taking these pictures. So I don't see any reason why we take advantage of these opportunities now. Okay, so I'd like to talk a little bit about energy. If we take it, the farm, where does all of the energy come from? It all comes from the sun originally. And it comes then through light, air and rain onto the farm. But that energy has been stored up over the years in terms of fossil fuels. And we then take these fossil fuels and turn them into herbicides, pesticides, fertilizer and so on that all then come onto the farm. We also then take this energy and turn it into machinery and also turn it into fuel to run that machinery. And the outcome then is the food. Here comes the but. But we also have produced a lot of biomass that we don't use. We have lots of waste. We have a lot of off-farm pollution. And it is amazing if you actually start to think about how we apply energy onto our farms in the past and how we still do it now. It is almost random. We take energy in terms of chemicals and we throw it. We throw fertilizer out onto the field. We have sprayers that go up and down and cover the whole area. And it's because we don't know what's going on enough with these dumb machines. We have to smarten them up. But where we are then talking about these energy flows coming through here, we can then consider, as most countries are, the energy crops and the bioenergy and the biofuels. And in fact what we have here is a very nice opportunity for a closed loop system. And we thought, hey, this is a real good idea. If we then can grow the crops on the farm to fuel the tractors, this is a really new radical idea. And then somebody said, isn't that what they used to do with horses? Oh yes. It's exactly the same thing. The horse was the motive unit of power. You'd set land aside, feed the horse, get the power out of the horse. And we're just coming back to these old systems but with a modern twist. And again that happens a few times through my presentation. But if this is then the current system, what we then want to do is to minimize the energy, these blue arrows here, to be able to minimize these ones down here. So what we need to do here then is to consider this concept of intelligent placement of energy. If we've then got the sensors to be able to understand what's there and only put on the minimum of what's actually needed, we can then perhaps reduce these ones down here and increase this whole concept of efficiency within the system. So robotic agriculture then leads on to the concept of multiple small intelligent machines, in some cases replacing large man tractors. Multiple machines to increase work rates, longer working hours, safe and reliable, easy to manage. New concept here, robot shepherd. What do I mean by that? Shepherd, person who looks after a flock of sheep. What about the person who then will look after a flock of robots? So it's not necessary that the person is sitting on the tractor now, but maybe there, if we can sort of play our minds through a concept, the guy turns up at the field with his white van and a trailer on the back and he lets down the ramps and offloads half a dozen robots and presses the green button and they scoot off doing things and then he's sitting there drinking his coffee while they're all working out in the field and then one of them is saying, I've got a flat tire, another one a bit later on saying I need to be refueled. Then you've got the concept of a robot shepherd and it may be that that person doesn't need to be within the field. Maybe it is the farm manager themselves that then will be checking on the phone to make sure that robot number three is okay and robot number six is fine and suddenly gets a message from robot number 10 saying I need help. These things are always in communication and so there's some new concepts coming up in how we then would interact with these smarter machines. So what are the system requirements then? They need to be lightweight, able to work in soft soil, small and autonomous, computational autonomy and energetic autonomy. It's an interesting concept. At Bristol Robotics Laboratory where I have one of my visiting chairs in the UK, a student actually developed a slug eating robot. This machine could identify, using machine vision, could identify slugs in a crop, could pick the slug up and would you believe put it into a biodigester where the biodigester had a biological fuel cell in it which then powered the robot. And they were aiming then for energetic autonomy. It didn't work, we couldn't get energetic autonomy. But he proved that, well it was only sort of about 1% efficient so it ran out of battery pretty quick. But nevertheless there's some other interesting ideas. Can these things, could these things take a bite out of a sugar beet to be able to get enough sugar to be able to keep it going after a period of time? Solar panels and wind wouldn't work. There's not enough energy in those. But again looking at renewables to be able to keep them going. The concept of independence and dependence I'll come up with later on. As engineers we don't like redundancy. When we design things we try to make sure there is no redundancy. But if we want safety in these machines and the ability to have self-awareness then we actually have to build redundancy in. So if one section goes down there is another section there that knows that that first section has gone down. And then maybe can take remedial action. That's what we then call graceful degradation. We've all been frustrated where you turn the PC on and you've just got a blank screen or a machine and it doesn't put the key in the lock and nothing happens. We don't want that to happen. We want, if this is a smart machine, it should then tell you why it is not working. It should be able to communicate with you somehow. And to be able to work at night. So there's a whole range of different system requirements here. The machine behaviours themselves is then, or the intellectual challenge that I've had trying to develop these machines is how do we embed enough intelligence within them to get them to do what we want them to do. And the breakthrough for me came through the concept of behaviours. And a behaviour is a concerted set of simple actions to achieve one particular outcome. And we can think about some of these behaviours in terms of navigation, go from A to B, route following, stay on the line as you're going down a prop row, refuelling, refilling, explore, obstacle mapping, so on. These are all separate behaviours and it's a process of what we call subsumption, where you can have more primitive behaviours underneath. But we are developing these finite state diagrams to be able then to come up with what we can consider would be the specific behaviours and the triggers or the routes that can go between behaviours so that you cannot go from this behaviour to this behaviour without going through this behaviour. And what do we mean by intelligence? Well, I try not to use intelligence to the word intelligence too much because it is a human trait. I think intelligence should be reserved for people. Emotional intelligence, we know the difference between good and bad. We make these judgements. A machine doesn't have these abilities. But nevertheless, we can still make a machine that appears to be intelligent. If we had a robot in the room here that was sweeping the floor and it does it in a sensible way that we say, yes, that's reasonable, then that's good enough. We're not asking this robot to go and play the piano or paint a picture, which is what we would then say with intelligence to be able to deal with unknown situations. But if it can do what we are asking it to do, then that's good enough. And there is a simple test, the Turing test, if it's indistinguishable from human behaviour. So if the robots do what a person would do, then, as I say, that's probably good enough. So the autonomous behaviour is divided into two different parts. That which is purely deterministic. And what I mean by that is that we can determine it beforehand where we use knowledge and can be optimised. So if we've got a field here that's basically a triangular-shaped field, and we know the turning circle of the vehicle and we know the working width of the vehicle, we can then come up with an optimal plan. So there's no skip, no overlap, and to be able then to just do exactly what we want very simply and very efficiently. But the other type of behaviour is a reactive task, which is then how do you deal with unknown objects or obstacles. So if we've got the machine out in the field and it comes across something it doesn't know about, what do we want to do? Well, ultimately, as you or I would do, if I want to go from here to here, I would recognise that there is an obstacle in front of me, but I would recognise that as a chair. Now we find that process very easy. We recognise things all the time. But in the computational side of things, that's actually a very difficult thing to do, to be able to recognise objects. But we don't need to recognise every object that we might come across. What we need to do is to recognise the particular class of the problem. And in this case, if I stand here and wait for a few seconds and see that the chair is not going to move, then I know that is a static object and I can then go around it. If I'm standing here watching it and it does move, then I'll wait long enough and perhaps it'll move out the way and then I can continue. So this is the concept of the reactive tasks. And what we then need, of course, is a hybrid system that can deal with or utilise both of these two techniques. So many tractors at the moment are using auto steer. We've seen the advantage of straight line assist and operator assist technologies. So this is the next step forward is then going to be in full route planning. And the next stage beyond that is going to go into controlled traffic farming. So to me, the next big no-brainer in agriculture is going to be controlled traffic farming. And I'll give you some reasons for that in a moment. But let's come back to route planning. So if we've got an odd-shaped field here, at the moment perhaps an operator would normally look for the longest straight line edge and then work up and down and work the whole way across. But that may not necessarily be the most efficient way of doing it. There are different options we've got. We can have skip rows. We can then have simple turns. And we can use, as we do at the moment, craft knowledge. And this all then is part of the robot management information system that's being developed at different universities around the world. Which then is a way in which we can come up with the tools that are then needed to be able to manage these machines in hopefully an efficient way. And of course to be able to take the workload off from the farmer. What we've seen with precision farming is that as scientists and engineers and researchers, we made agriculture too complex for many farmers. As scientists, when we could do yield mapping and soil mapping and all these other nice things, we were fascinated by it. How did that help the farmers? It didn't. It made it more complicated. If they've got all of these, it's a data overload situation. How does a farmer make money out of a soil map? Well, the clever ones will be able to say how that can be done. But we have to, as we are designing these systems, we have to introduce a level of maturity in them that makes it simpler to use. Here is an example of some route planning software. So one of the deliverables from the Future Farm project can be seen at web-farming.com. And it uses Google Earth as a plug-in. And you can then set up a system. And you can click around the edge of your field. You can tell what tractor you've got, what the working width is, what the turning radius is. And it will then come up with, hopefully, what will be an optimal route for you to then follow. Quite often, these are intuitive. We can see, yes, that makes sense. But in fact, sometimes it can pick up more optimal routes that are not so intuitive. So we're doing some experiments at the moment, taking these route plans and putting them into the auto-steer systems within the tractor to see if we can get the full route plan implemented here. So that's a good site. What can you learn or what do you understand from that situation? Now, I know you've just gone through a year of drought. I'm terribly sorry, I apologise, but Britain's had all of your rain. We've just gone through the wettest year on record. So all your rain's moved over to us. So we're going to try and send it back. In fact, I was accused this morning of bringing the weather with me because it was all misty and foggy and rainy and horrible. So I'll try and come back a bit more often and keep my suitcases full and bring some fog back for you. But this is the situation that we are dealing with. And it is interesting because it made me realise that current tractors cannot enter the fields when the soil is wet. And horsepower doesn't help when weight is the problem. Weight is the problem. These big tractors... OK, you might have the biggest, best tractor in the world, but if the soil's like this and you can't go out there... OK, I like big tractors, don't get me wrong, but they have got problems. And if the tractor can't go out at that time, what's happening is that there is a reduced window when this big tractor can be used. And because that window is reduced, you need a big tractor to have the high work rates. So there's a cycle coming in here. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. And as the tractor gets bigger, the window gets smaller and therefore you need the higher work rates. And so we're going into this funneling down situation where you can't go any further. And we've got to find an alternative way of doing it. And I think as agriculture engineers, we should be smart enough to make a machine that can go out and put seed into the ground. How we're going to do it, I don't know. Tracks, wheels, balloon tyres maybe. UAVs, maybe. If I've got a robot that is the size of a shoebox that could go out there and do that, that's not going to compact the soil. That could run around on top there, not cause a problem, not sink. If a tractor is that big, it is going to sink. But how big these machines ought to be, I don't know. We still need to work that out. So can we design a tractor that can run on soil? So I think the answer should be yes. Another factor to consider, here we can see sugar beet growing in the field and here we can see a hard pan underneath the cultivation layer here. I was talking about the compaction of subsoil. Large tractors cause significant soil compaction that results up to 90% of the energy being used in cultivation is there to repair the damage caused by the machinery in the first place. Why do we cultivate? We cultivate to break up the soil. Fine, we've always done that. Why is the soil more compact? The tractors have squashed it down. Why? Can we come up with systems that don't cause the problem in the first place? And so, as we know, every kilonewton that you need in that direction, you need another kilonewton in that direction to be able to give you the traction. So that's why we've got big heavy tractors, to be able to drag heavy bits of metal through the soil. If we stop dragging heavy bits of metal through the soil, we don't need the vertical load. We don't cause the compaction. Low ground pressure tires, controlled traffic farming, route planning. Can we develop a system that does what we want without composing compaction problems? Ultralight machines. We're dealing with concepts of micro-tillage, zero draft force. There's a whole range of new opportunities. If we just take the opportunity to take a sideways step, don't just say, well, this is where we've come from and this is where we're going to go. We've got to do some lateral thinking. We've got to think about things in different ways. So, it's pretty picture time. There we are. Ta-da! No, this is... I did some work with Massey Ferguson a couple of years ago where they helped me to visualize some of the designs. So, all the sort of crazy designs can go into some of these drawings. And I'm not saying they're even going to look like this. These are a discussion document where we can then... I can help you visualize some of the things that I've got in my mind. And as we know, a picture painter is better than a thousand words. So, the ability to be able to come up with some graphics that will then talk about minimum tillage or micro-tillage, getting the right weight in the tractor, getting... so that it doesn't compact the soil, being able to do all of these different operations may result in machines that would be radically different. which then really brings us on to this concept of phytotechnology. And we can consider things like the three stages. Establishment of the crop, crop care and harvesting. And in terms of... when we're talking about these things, we do come up with some new terminology. So, I'll run through some quickly with you. The concept of a seed map is where we then know the position of every seed that goes into the ground. We've then got the concept of a crop map when we then get emergence. So, in some places it won't... we don't get emergence, but in other places we do. And we can then know where each one of these plants are. We can come up... or we come up with the... when we're discussing these things in terms of a weed map, which either can be in terms of areas or the location of individual plants. We talk of the inter-row area, that space between the rows of the crop, the intra-row area, the space inside the row between each individual plant, and the close-to-crop area, which then needs special attention, especially when we're trying to get some type of machine to interact with the growing plant. So, if we think about seeding and the issues of putting seed into the ground, most seed only guarantees 80% germination. And so what do we do at the moment? We over-apply seeds to be able to get what we want. And in fact, for many crops, or some crops, particularly like sugar beet, we put a lot more seed into the ground and actually have designed machines to go and kill all these viable plants because they then... there's too many of them. Now, that to me is a waste. Can we come up with systems, a seeding system, that puts seed into the ground directly where we need it and try and make sure that we get a much higher success rate? The seeders produce void areas because the seeders themselves get it wrong, don't do it always right. We have a problem of intra-row competition between plants. You put the plants too close together, this one competes with this one. And so they don't grow as well as they should. They all need equal access to land, water, air, and other resources. Can we control seed depth for moisture? Again, you've got a group here dealing with drought and how to deal with droughts. Well, could we have a machine that could judge the depth of where the moisture... It might be a bit deep to have to go down if you are in the middle of a bad drought, but the ability to be able to put it in deeper according to the moisture content and not so deep if the moisture content is right. Can we orient seeds to reduce inter-row competition? And I think that we can. So here we have a machine that we developed a number of years back in Denmark. Here's a high-precision seeder with a RTK GPS on the top here and some electronics down here. And down the bottom here then we've got a light beam and when the seed drops through, breaks the light beam, we can record the position of where that seed was dropped. And to test it then, we took a quadrat out, geo-rectified the... or worked out the position of the camera, took a picture of it, geo-rectified the image and overlaid the data. And what we can see here is it's not a very good picture, but we can see the position of where the machine thought that it dropped the seed and we can see where the emergent seeds came out. The blue line is... Blue crosses is the data from the RTK GPS. And we found that we would know where the plants were to within two centimetres. So it is actually a case of the same sort of level of accuracy as we get from the GPS itself. What's the... Why do we get the error? Well, of course, it could be anything. One of the things could be in terms of we get different aggregate sizes in there and then the seedling can come around and come out at a different point. Which leads us on to the concept of ultra-high accuracy seeding. So, the placement of seed in a predefined pattern, we can have perhaps synchronised planting. I mean, it is a question. Okay, it's a genuine question to me. Let's see if you can come up with an answer. Why do we grow crops in rows? See, nobody's ever thought about that one. Why do we grow crops in rows? Equipment set up that way. You win the prize. It comes back down to the machine. You think about day one of agriculture where this chap in his bare skins, he found a bent stick and he dragged it through the soil and he put some seeds into the ground. That's the simplest type of mechanisation. Is that the optimal way of treating those seeds? No, it's not. That's making agriculture simpler for the machine. Can we come up with a system that can put seeds in their own equal space? Yes, we can. We can consider equal space per plant. But those of you that are in the audience, you can see that immediately we are getting lines but in a different direction now. So then we came up with the concept of grid seeding. Why don't we just put them all on a grid? And we thought, hey, this is great. This is another new idea. And I had a tour around your museum this morning and I actually saw a machine that somebody had talked to me years ago. They said, that's not a new idea. The horses used to do that. And they used to have a layer of rope in the ground and put knots in the rope and it would then drop the seed every time it came to a knot and come around the other way and do the same coming back. And we actually saw a machine in your museum that did exactly that. But of course, now we need $15,000 worth of GPS equipment and computer controllers and all of these other things to do exactly the same thing in terms of the grid seeding. But I could see there are some very good opportunities with this grid seeding. So we've got the concept of synchronised planting because then we can do it in put the whole field down into a grid which then would allow us to be able to do orthogonal inter-row weeding. And so if we've then got the plants on a regular grid we've then got the weeds growing randomly and what we can then perhaps do is very simply so there's no robot on this tractor it's just a very simple intra-row weeding system but because it's on the grid we can then take out a significant number of those weeds. Crop scouting is a big issue and again listening to the talk this morning about phenotyping having your own automated phenotyping system undercover we've been involved in the same discussions in the UK a lot of money over the last 10-15 years has gone into being able to manipulate all the genes in these plants understanding the expression of those genes is a different thing but the discussion we're having at the moment is that it's not worth doing the phenotyping in glass houses because the plants express the genes in different ways outside compared to inside so what we're talking about now is phenotyping robots machines that can go into the field to do that same level of measurement but in the field rather than doing it inside the glass house and in fact at the moment for many crop trials the limitation is the cost of the people if you want to do a trial you've got to get lots of samples to make it statistically sound why don't you take thousands of plots because it's too expensive to do the sampling the land's available the seeds are there so on and so forth but it's the people that are the limiting factor in this case and so it's laborious difficult to find qualified staff data must be transcribed low levels of repeatability if it rains everybody goes home it's expensive so these trials are limited by expensive data capture it's the people in the loop that's causing the problem can we come up with a system to phenotype plants automatically and that's one of our current projects so I know that Lee Tang is going to be with you so I hope I'm not going to steal his thunder these are his videos here but he worked with me in Denmark we worked together in Denmark so this is why I'm laying claim to some of his work we had a little crop scouting robot out here with a different number of sensing systems on here and what Lee did was to stitch some video together to create one long bitmap that allowed him to develop machine recognition to know where these plants are and if we don't know the position of them to begin with through the seed mapping system we can do it at the seedling stage so we can identify each individual plant and that's not a lot of technology that's needed there's a webcam and a PC to be able to do that it's not necessarily expensive now the interesting thing is and it'll come up in a minute that we can not only identify the plants but we can also identify the growing points and we'll use that information in a minute so here's the first generation of the crop scout again this one was developed in Denmark it's no more than a desk with a wheel on each corner but what it does is very useful because it is an instrument carrier so we can mount on it expensive equipment it can move around it can take lots of different samples in its base form which is this it just follows a particular route and if anything gets in the way it just stops and calls for help so safety is not a problem two master students designed and built and made the whole thing so it's not such a difficult problem Aarhus University developed it we put different sensors on it but it was this part that stuck in my mind it's that this this simple robot could go out and survey 250 plots a day so I don't know if any of you are into crop trials but that's more than a person could be able to do and this table with a wheel on each corner can go out there and do that highly repeatable for us the second generation that was developed at the Fakershall in Osnabrook with Amazon was done by Arno Ruckelhausen and we can see the machine here this has got many more features on it it's all hydraulic and lots and lots of computers it's a good technology platform I don't think it needs to be quite as complex as that we've got there but that again is another proof of concept and that actually is a phenotyping robot and you can see the light curtain underneath the bottom here that then can take all the bring the information in so that's Bonnie Rob from Germany and then this is the again one of my concept vehicles that I hope that we can build within the next few years we've got some money now to do it and that then has got a number of different features on it very narrow wheels and tyres to be able to go in between the crop there's guards around the tyres so that the crop doesn't damage the machine the machine doesn't damage the crop high ground clearance all of these different things so weed and crop mapping with machine vision crop stress through ethylene detection insect infestation through volatile organic compound detection crop growth rates through crop height crop nutrient status through multispectral response crop quality and quantity estimation before harvest autonomous phenotyping and 3D canopy models so this is the sensing platform this is where you put your clever instruments on it and that robot does no more than carry those clever instruments around here's the Bonnie Rob simulation using LiDAR so we've got the sick laser on here and by moving along here then we can then get 3D information about that particular plant and because we know the location of each plant that can be recorded and we can then actually see the development again a useful concept or useful bit of information from the phenotyping point of view I've been going to China for the last 12 years I have different chairs at different universities there and one of the projects that I was presented with last year from Nesita really made me change the way that I think about instrumentation what we've got here is the ability to understand the context of the measurement that we take what do I mean by that well imagine look over here we've got a cloud of points and that cloud of points can be then turned into surfaces that can then come through into a complete crop model but imagine if we've got that one point there and rather than using LIDAR to take that measurement we've got a hyperspectral response so we've got one pixel with a hyperspectral response from it what can we understand from that well we know we're going to get variability but the trouble is we don't know which part that data came from we don't know the context was it from the leaf was it from the stem we need another aspect of this work we need to be able to recognise where it came from and with this concept of canopy models giving us the whole context of what's actually going on will significantly I think move the understanding of crop development and the measurement of the crops move it significantly ahead and so in terms of having this model we've then got a leaf there and we know all of the different measurement parameters that we've taken about that leaf what leaf it is what part of the stem where it occurred and all the rest of it is being embodied within a crop model so crop to me crop modelling is taking on a different aspect rather than just doing it plant by plant we can do it actually over the whole shape of the plant I talked before in terms of weather dependence and weather independence if we consider what goes on at the moment if a farmer wants to go and spray the field then when spraying a driver you're not allowed obviously to spray when the wind is high so if a man goes out with the machine the wind gets up he says ok I'm going to call a halt on it today I'm going to go home what happens if the wind drops down in half an hour he's already gone home I'm not going to go out again and maybe I'll go out tomorrow if we've got the concept of a machine that can go out there with its own weather station and spray and then when the wind gets too high it stops it waits when the wind drops down again it moves on for half an hour we've got the ability to work with the weather and opening up more of these and I think the answer is yes if we can make it an autonomous machine so again there's some of the concepts that we've been playing with here we've got the canisters on the side in fact some of the chemical manufacturers are very keen to work with us on this you would have thought if we were going to cut all this down they would be against it but there are actually not there may well be opportunities for new formulation and certainly taking chemicals out of containers is seen as a bad thing now you ought to be able to go down the shop and buy a sealed container it will have an RFID tag in it or a QR code on the side of it you come and you plug it into the machine the machine knows exactly what the chemical is it knows all the health and safety it knows all the regulations it will use it at the correct dose rates and at the end of the field when it's half full you can take it out and put problems that we've got with our conventional machines at the moment so it brings us on to then weed recognition again this work was done at Dias a number of years ago in Denmark looking at ways in which you can then recognize different weeds and the most powerful technique was to actually use active shape recognition now this was a technique that was used for facial recognition as a human I can recognize all the individual faces in front of me but what the machine does it takes a standard template of a cartoon face and for every face that it then gets presented with it moves the eyes to the right distance apart the characteristic about the nose and the mouth and everything else and it is all of these different characteristics that can be used then to be able to recognize the different species of weeds so here you can see the standard template being used it is then morphed around the weed itself and we can then use those different parameters to recognize up to 26 different species of weeds weeds if we then can understand what is happening with the weeds then perhaps we've got the opportunity to be able then to spray them you see there's no other weeds around here because we've done the mechanical weeding but here then perhaps we've got the camera going across and a little spray boom like an inkjet printer that can then only put the chemical onto the leaf of the weed and so here is the robot doing the work with the first micro sprayer down here in fact this was Dave Slaughter's micro spray boom he lent it to us in Denmark and we then used it here to be able then to spray on those weeds and so we could then be able to get save a huge amount of chemical by only spraying where we needed to but there's no sound on this particular video at the moment but here is one of the students at Southern Denmark University who's got a pot plant here with a specimen then of a weed here you can see a light hood over here with lighting around omnidirectional lighting inside there and it's got a camera on the top that's looking down and then underneath there then we've got the latest generation of the spray boom so you've got seven nozzles of the microsprayer across there and the idea of course is then just to recognise the weed and put the chemical now only onto the leaf of the weed not over the top of the weed but only onto the leaf of the weed itself so this again is a simulation so the robot arm is simulating the camera going along a crop row we can do all this in real time and that's just a normal laptop there and if you look closely on each leaf you'll see a blue dot see the blue dot there blue dot there how about coming up with a system that can save 99.99% of the herbicide I mean we're not talking of save 5% save 10% save 15% how about saving 99% of the herbicide by coming up with a smart machine and there's got to be opportunities to be able to commercialize something like that I think mechanical weeding yuck I wouldn't fancy doing that but people are asked to do that and people are paid money to do that in the UK forget the forgive me for the units but it's a thousand pounds an acre to do that a thousand pounds an acre for mechanical weeding for organic so that's costing a lot of money at the moment can we come up with better systems well you can come up with the cycloid weed hoe again this concept was developed at Osnabrück and they lent us this head and it does the inter row and the intra row leaving the close to crop area alone and this is the autonomous tractor that I developed in Denmark with a side shift tool bar here and here then we've got the cycloid weed hoe and what it's doing is that it's withdrawing the leg every time there is a plant there so it's then stirring the soil it's weeding the soil in the inter row area and the intra row area and then leaving the plant alone it gets a bit close to some of the plants towards the end here and it moves them which is not a good thing but again we've got the proof of concept there now what is the sensing system on that well it's no more than GPS it's always the two centimetre it's the better than one inch accuracy with the RTK GPS and we know those position of each one of those plants because we put it there with the seeder and we can then go into it with the mechanical weeder and then go through the field to be able to take out all of the areas that are not grown by the crop and so again if we were to then rather than put it onto a tractor put it into a smaller machine using less energy so much the better which brings us on then to another exciting topic as far as I'm concerned and that's laser weeding so we came up with the idea about ten years ago and there has been some quite interesting developments and the idea again is that we can recognise the weed and from the machine vision we could recognise the growing point of the weed and then apply a laser and all that laser is doing is heating it up because what we want to do we're not playing Star Wars we don't want to take out the Death Star yet but what we do want to do this tiny little plant with a tiny little very delicate area there the growing point what we want to do is to raise the cells the growing point between 56 and 94 degrees C which is just enough to get the cell membranes to rupture and that can then be done with a very very small amount of energy 5 watts tiny amount of energy now here we have laser weeding ok I like the smoke coming up gotcha damn you weed die but even with that 5 watt that's not necessary to be as strong as that because you think this is a tiny little plant here and there's a tiny part of a tiny plant and it's this quest that we're after what is the smallest amount of energy delivered in exact intelligently targeted inputs there it is there the smallest amount of energy to require what we need you see the plants are all still there but that's not going to go anywhere that's not going to grow that's stopped it dead that's finished there now that's that's we've we've killed the growing point of that plant I'm not sure how it's going to work with Japanese knotweed or any of these other things but anyway the concept of and of course then we're saving 100% herbicide with a very small energy source so again another really interesting opportunity here we've got another mechanical weeding system this is the autonomous Christmas tree weeder that we developed in Denmark Christmas trees are an agricultural crop not a forestry crop these are little Christmas trees being overtaken by weeds we don't like to use chemicals in here herbicides will kill the trees as much as they'll kill the weeds and what we've got here is a side cutter on a lawnmower where we've taken the seat and handled the steering wheel off and put a cutter on the side and again we can get two centimetre level accuracy with this little machine and it can then these are simulated Christmas trees and here's the real Christmas trees put some guards on the front of it and it can go down and we know the position of every Christmas tree and we can send the cutter out and withdraw the cutter back in to go around the tree and then back out again and it works and that's the only way to get rid of the woody weeds we get these strong weeds growing up through the canopy the tree canopy leaves a hole in it which is then considered a bad quality and so mechanical weeding robotic weeding of Christmas trees is a distinct possibility here's some work from Professor Noboru Noguchi from Hokkaido he's got a team who's developing a whole range of autonomous tractors and machines I was very lucky to be able to invite him over to England last month so he came over oh yeah they walk really fast in Japan so he came over for a few weeks and we collaborated together as we're now building our new generation of robots and he's got a very big nationally funded project in Japan at the moment to develop a whole range of autonomous machines autonomous agricultural tractors and machines and he left me this video which was quite interesting so this is his third generation of tractors but what he's now starting to do is look at these reliability issues and so he lets it run at night can you get these things to are they now reliable enough to work at night so the answer is yes so somebody did stay there with it they didn't all go home and go to bed and hope that it worked alright because it could have actually had the cultivation coming across the road and halfway to Tokyo before it was picked up but nevertheless we are now starting to get more reliable systems that will allow us to do significantly longer work periods than we've done before and again that brings us on to the last part of the talk which then is selective harvesting selective harvesting is what we do normally in fact when you go to the supermarket and you see three oranges there and you pick that one because that looks the best you are selective harvesting but the trouble is that what we do at the moment is that we often will particularly with mechanisation we will harvest the whole crop and we'll throw away a very significant part of that crop because it doesn't meet the right quality criteria your supermarkets when they say I want a lettuce they say it needs to be that big not that big and not that big it needs to be that big because consumers are asking for this and so we've got issues with expensive cheap labour many developed countries do use cheap labour we get a lot of people coming from eastern Europe and you get a lot of people coming up from Mexico and elsewhere to do this work but it's difficult to support these large labour forces you've got to give them houses you've got to have the buses you've got to feed them you've got to look after them you've got to keep them happy can machines help with this I think that they can the concept of this whole crop harvesting up to 60% of this is being thrown away because it's not of the right quality can we design a selective harvester that only harvests 100% of saleable quality so here again is a nice pretty picture of my conceptual harvester selective harvester and what it's doing it's leaving it's leaving behind the ones that are not of saleable quality so maybe this one was too small but if it's too small why don't you come back in a week's time two weeks time when it's grown big enough and be able then to pick it and you know because you've just measured it you know exactly where it is and then when you know that you've got 24 or a thousand or whatever it is in that row it's then worth harvesting it again it's not it's what you or I would do if you've got gardens at home and you then go out and say right I need an onion for tonight's supper you pick the best one that you can and you know oh that's a smaller one I'll come back tomorrow I'll come back next week for that one that's what we would do and often when I'm trying to think about solving these problems I think about how would an individual person do it can we then get a machine to do it in the same way and the back part here is then a just a trailer so the idea is that that would be a pallet full of boxes and then when it's filled up then it would disconnect go back and another one would then come in and join with it okay so that brings me to the conclusions I think it is inevitable that agricultural equipment is going to get smarter we're seeing it all the time we've got improved automatic control for well defined tasks if we look again in successful areas of automation outside of the agricultural sector anytime where we've got semi-skilled jobs being done repetitively this is where automation will first come in we can have automated data gathering better processing into real information again we've had some interesting discussions before the start of today's lecture about agriculture has got a problem of big data we've got the ability to collect huge amounts of data particularly with all these new systems but we have to come up with the techniques to crunch them into real information almost in real time real time information is the best possibility of fully autonomous vehicles with sensible behaviour in given context and I think it's the chance to design and build a complete new small smart mechanisation system that will serve humanity for many generations to come somebody asked this morning are we going to have robotic tractors and I can put my hand on my heart and say yes it's obvious to me it's absolutely obvious the next question is when that's a different question and I think that it is then going to be a case of when the climate is right and the technology has matured and the innovative and entrepreneurial companies pick up these concepts and I don't think it's going to be the Massey Ferguson's and the John Deere's that are going to come up with this because this is too disruptive the big machinery manufacturers have got a very linear view on what they want to do if you ask them and say well what's going to happen in the next few years what is your aspiration well I want to move my market share from 35 to 38% that's about the limit of some of the discussions that I've had with them this breaks that model completely and I think that there is an opportunity for entrepreneurial people to be able to start building their own robots that won't necessarily directly compete with the big tractors there's always going to be a role for big tractors but certainly in these niche areas high value niche areas there is now an opportunity for these machines and so that's my vision for the future thank you very much for your attention thank you Simon that was very interesting I know we are a little bit over our time but that's okay I'd welcome you if you do need to go go ahead and do that but we're going to take a few minutes here to ask Simon some questions if you have those just slip your hand up I've got to get it on the mic so the people on the online can hear anyone have a question thank you thank you Simon that was a wonderful presentation very inspiring in terms of forward thinking from an academic perspective I look at this and I think about workforce so you're talking about tremendous changes in the workforce in agriculture but it's also an opportunity for training people in new skills and new technologies and the academic community needs to get ahead of that in terms of training people who can be the technicians in the workforce in this arena so how do you see that developing in the coming years? Well I think that what has tended to happen again if I start my answer by looking in history and then project it forward is that many of the operations particularly when we've moved to sort of the industrial type of agriculture tended to de-skill a lot of things where you sit on a big tractor and just drive up and down but with this concept we need smart people to be able to deal with smart machines and I think that this is actually a real opportunity to be able to increase the opportunities in the rural areas particularly for high level employment because although I don't think you need to be a robotic engineer to service these types of machines I think that certainly as we develop them and in some cases where we need to look after them we do need to have these new skills. In fact it's a particular of interest in Japan as you know Japan are very interested in robotics robotics and if I remember rightly the average age of farmers in Japan is now 67 and the government realized that this is an aging population in the rural areas and they wanted to find ways of attracting young people to stay in the rural area so they actually invested a lot of money in developing some of these concept tractors these robotic vehicles because it is a challenge it is a can be good work it can be very interesting to be able to develop high technology machines in rural areas and so I think not only do we have to come up with people that can deal with these smarter systems but I think it will produce much more lucrative rural employment in the future. Thank you. Thank you for the wonderful talk excuse me. My question is how do you sort of now there are self-driving cars Audi and they have demonstrated self-driving cars how do you see automated rope automated tractors to be different in terms of navigation from the self-driving cars I mean I recognize there are issues. Well they to be honest when when we're talking about these automatic machines the problem is always the person the problem of people what is safety can these machines be safe to themselves yes can they be safe to the crop yes but we have to have to be safe with people and it's the people that is the difficult part in most of agriculture we don't get many people wandering around in the fields but if you had something like a golf course where you're trying to cut grass and there's people around then you've got a lot of potential there but the concept of the automated cars what is the purpose of the car it's to move the person and so you're always going to have the person inside the car which makes it somehow a little bit easier but the tractors are there not to move people around the tractors there to carry out a particular task and so it is those tasks that we are then optimizing with all of these all of these different machines but the the the concepts and the approaches between a driver an automatic steered car and an automatic steered tractor I think obviously are going to be quite similar but there is a big difference between automatic steering and autonomous automatic steering I can get I can I teach my students how to do automatic steering and within a couple of days they would be able to make an automatic steered car or tractor easy control loops PID GPS we can do that standard can we get it to be fully autonomous no fully autonomous recognizing what's happening in front what happens if the engine overheats what happens if a tree's fallen over what happens if you get stuck a wet patch in the field thousand and one different things that has to be dealt with if it is truly autonomous we have to have a lot of intelligence in the machine if we're going to make it autonomous automatic steering is easy autonomous is a major challenge so in some cases there are similarities and others not because with a car there will always be a person in the car so the person can oversee all the functions of what goes on but in fact it is of interest what we're seeing at the moment we're seeing lots and lots of subsystems being developed on tractors that are driver assist so different systems for headland turning different systems for auto steer and so on so these are all ways in which to help the operator but again you've got to be careful because if you automate all of that they're going to go to sleep very very quickly and it's going to become dangerous so you must the if you're going to and they're going to have the same problem with cars you've got to have an interaction from the person with the machine so that the person feels that they are still in control and must respond and do things so you can't just suddenly take all control away and expect this person just to sit there and just watch what goes on they have to interact with it and that's where we need a lot more sort of psychology and understand what is needed I thought it was interesting you showed the video from Japan of the tractor doing the work overnight and you come back the next day and the field is tilled and ready to go that reminded me of our center pivot irrigation systems they're set to go around in a field and to irrigate and you come back the next day or the next morning and and it's done what it's supposed to do that's the kind of thing that I was kind of intrigued about how that relates to a machine that's able to do something kind of on its own yet still were monitoring it I had the privilege to monitor one of those systems and I couldn't sleep at night knowing that that machine could possibly malfunction and flood the entire field so it never happened but that was something I always thought about so but I think showing that video really related to kind of our current systems that we're already using it's again it's this level of confidence and the confidence requires time and communication if your center pivot had a level of self-awareness and had a an ability to call your smartphone to say this motor is overheating or I'm running out of chemical you would be able to sleep at night and it would then tell you you would have confidence enough not not to keep you awake at night but it requires this same level of interaction like we were talking before to give you that level of confidence so I think that's part of what we have to build into these machines this level of self awareness and the communication with the responsible person because you've got to think of these things there's been for many years we've been discussing the thing of liability and of safety and often people have got the erroneous idea that because there's no driver on it that it is in charge of what it does it is not it is a tool like any other tool and there is a person there must be a person in charge of that robot in charge of that robot in charge of that robot the same as any other tool persons in charge of a car and if the if the sat nav tells you to go up the wrong way up a one-way street you can't blame the sat nav you it's it's a tool you have to interpret that tool you might not like it and so again it is this combination of man and machine working together okay I'm explaining that in a in a way because when I first started on robotics the idea was to get people out of the system and then ding the light bulb went wrong meh I've lost that's the wrong idea people are in the system but they are doing different things they're not hanging on to a steering wheel so it is the level if you want to sleep easy at night you've got to have the confidence that the machine is doing what you want it to do and that it will tell you when it's doing something outside of the parameters of what you or where you don't want it to do another question question what about fuzzy logic okay right well I we're talking about robots here and I haven't talked anything about artificial intelligence there is a huge opportunity for self-learning with these machines the the work that I've been developing over the last ten years has been something called SAFAR software architecture for agricultural robots and we don't use any artificial intelligence in that yet I think what we've got in terms of the deterministic and the reactive behaviors will allow us to deal with I don't know 90% of the situations that we deal with but it is a very powerful thing if the machine can learn from its own mistakes or if we have the ability to be able to say bad robot don't do that again and that's where the fuzzy logic and the self-learning and the genetic algorithms might then cut in to allow us then to do things in different ways but at the moment yes certainly for an intel a real intelligent machine we've got to have self-learning capacity but if I take you back to what I said at the outset is that we don't want this thing to play a piano and paint a Picasso picture we want it to dig weeds out the ground and we understand that context well enough and so within a given context we should be able to identify the appropriate behaviors so that we don't need so much self-learning at the moment I'm going to ask one more or just finish with one more thought if you will you talked about minimum energy and in Nebraska and in many parts of this country we use minimum or no tillage in our systems are we ever going to get to a point where we are going to be at no energy in our crop production systems way out in the future is that even something to think about at all well you talked earlier about looking over the horizon looking into the into the deep future I can't think of any situation where we would actually interact or modify the natural environment that would then require no energy but if we were to be able to get to the point of understanding the minimum change that we need and then being able to get that energy from renewable sources in terms of where we were talking earlier about the slug example or the energetic autonomy some type of closed loop system then yes but that still is going to have energy and that energy may well come from its local environment but I think it would have to be a pretty clever system to have no energy in it whatsoever but I think that as I say the more I look at these systems the more I'm amazed that we do things in pretty dumb ways at the moment we throw fertilizer all over the place and chemicals or certainly think about that laser weeding how much tiny tiny amount of energy that was needed for each of those weeds and think how much energy we have to use at the moment or we do use at the moment so I can see a minimum amount of energy or we're starting to understand the minimum amount of energy that's needed with the current thinking but you might be thinking of it on a different plane than I am at the moment. I just thought I'd throw that out there. Again, let's thank Dr. Blackmore for giving this great presentation. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you. Thank you
