Howto & Style
 With February coming to an end, it's about to be growing season, so I want to show you guys how I built my garden bed. Super simple, super easy, no tools required. First things first, go to your local hardware store and get eight of these brown concrete plantar walls. You see the wood too, don't worry, we're going to talk about the measurements in the caption, but you see it's less than $60. Next, you're going to get your raised bed soil. If you have compost, you use that. Next, you're going to go outside and you're going to find you some sticks. Don't go to the store and try to buy no sticks, you're going to waste money. Go outside and find your sticks. Then you're going to add your dirt or your soil or your compost, whatever you have. I had a mixture of both, so I mixed in the raised bed soil with that. After that, you're going to make sure you flatten it out, smooth it out, make sure everything's even. Then after that, it's it. You are ready to start planting. So if you want to see what I'm planting this season, stay tuned for more.
