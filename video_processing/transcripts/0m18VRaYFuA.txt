 I'm Katie Lloyd, I'm an egg product manager and I work at Ziggler Egg Equipment. Brant is super easy to work with. They have high quality equipment and we have Brant full line so grain carts, high-speed discs, augers, field belts. I like working with Brant because they're easy to work with, they have great customer service, they have high quality equipment. It just kind of helps us complete the full line dealership. They work in the next day, and then they've sent us your house cash back, so they just should be fined out the booking app. I'll go to the next page for you so easily for snorkel, like my annual store. All right. We finished the month at these end of 1996. I'm Katie Tyson.
