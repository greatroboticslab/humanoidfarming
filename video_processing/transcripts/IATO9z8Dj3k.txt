 Welcome to the NDSU Carrington Research Extension Center's organic tour. We are standing on the organic ground. This is one of two fields we have. And this field has been certified organic since 2016. Anyway, we're standing in front of the wheat flax intercrop trial and that's what I want to talk to you about today. Now intercropping is something that has become very popular in most recent years and particularly the last few. It's not a new concept although intercropping has been done for years. It's been it's being done all around the world particularly in many nations where they where farmers are not using a lot of inputs. And so in particular to also wheat flax intercropping there's there's information that goes back to the 20s that show farmers in the Dakotas were doing this. So it's not new. We're not reinventing the wheel but we're learning how to use new technology and new tricks to make it better. Intercropping wheat flax ironically is reported in our annual report in 1991 was looked at on this research center under conventional plot ground from 1989 to 1991 by Dr. Pat Carr. This this data showed in the early years in the first couple years we looked at at varying the rates of and excuse me varying the the row arrangements and how it was seeded broadcast and stuff. Basically the data showed that it through economic analysis and other factors that it didn't pay and there was no yield advantage. Then a couple years later from 90 to 91 it was re-modified and it was looked at it from the standpoint of of varying the seeding rates. Still not concise of research although it did show that in the in that we in 1990 the flax yielded two bushels to the acre and and in 1991 we were getting seven bushels to the acre. Now that's significant with showing a very little drop in yield on the wheat. Let's go to 2020. We're very we're revisiting it again but we're going into the using it under organic production. Now organic flax is one of the crops that we have found in our research out here that competes very poorly when we compare it to conventional plot yields. Many of the other crops such as wheat and oats and barley the yields are fairly comparable particularly under years that are not the racehorse years when conditions are not as good. That is one thing that's been proven when conditions are not as good when we don't have perfect growing conditions organic will be much more comparable to conventional plot yields. Our data shows us that here from this research center. So why we why are we looking at that? We're revisiting on the organic loan because organic flax fetches a very high premium for the organic farmer sometimes up to thirty dollars per bushel. But again as I mentioned we don't get good yields under our flax and so with that I thought let's look at it with wheat and have another crop there maybe the weeds will be will be better. So this is where we're at now. We've very simple design this year we have two varieties in here. FBC Dillon a variety that was developed by the Farm Breeder Club from Northern Plains Sustainable Ag Society developed and released that was developed under organic management conditions. And Glen Wheat an NDSU variety that has been our high quality wheat wheat for a number of years. Now it's been replaced by NPE Vit Pro as terms of the quality check. But still many farmer organic farmers are planting this variety. Then we went to Omega Flax which is our yellow flax which again organic farmers and conventional of course too are growing and getting a premium from. But particularly in the organic market that is a variety that organic farmers like to grow. And then our newest release N.D. Hammond named after Dr. Jim Hammond our previous flax breeder. Thank you Jim for all your hard work. So we have soil of each one of these. The wheat is seeded at as the seeding rate I use on these plots at 1.6 million pure live seed per acre which it comes to about 110 to 120 pounds or two bushels. Our flax here is seeded at 60 pounds to the acre and which is the rate we use in organic production. Organic production tends to use higher seeding rates than conventional. Doesn't mean that conventional farming doesn't but we tend to use higher seeding rates because we need more plants for the competition since we're not using synthetic herbicides to control our weeds. We're using crop rotation management and in factors like that to control our weeds. Now the other treatments we have here we took now again this is FBC dill and wheat on these two and we used we used FBC dill and wheat at two-thirds of the rate and at flax at two-thirds of the rate. So that means we're at a million plants per acre on the dillon and the flax is at 43 pounds per acre. Ironically that's about the same rates when I look in the annual report they used the first year they used 65 pounds to the acre and 32 pounds per acre. Very very close and now again we have the same treatment with Glen again with the lower rates two-thirds rates of each one of the crops. Specifically after this year we'll fine tune it and then start varying rates and stuff like that but this is just our first proof of concept year. Now ironically this year as we look in this plot here with the dill and wheat and the flax you can hardly see the wheat. The flax is going to far out favor so the results are not going to be the same. This can be this is due partially to the drought the very dry conditions we're in but it can also be to confound the issue it can be our previous cover crop here. Now we couldn't terminate the cover crop because it was a rye mixture with rye turnips, crimson clover and radishes. That was the cover crop because we were so wet last fall with the the big rainfall and and we could not terminate the crop so it had to be terminated this spring. That can be confounding the issue with the wheat the cereal crop and that could be why the flax looks so great. If you take a shot and look at this flax this is a plot that has not been harrowed we can't harrow flax anyway and it has not been hand weeded or anything. I think any organic farmer would love to have a field like this this goes against everything I told you where I can't weeds out compete me but it's it's going to be a very exciting year to see what happens here and you know again not a new concept that's been done forever we're just revisiting it and trying to find new tools and new varieties how to do this and ironically I want to read just a quick verb from the report that Dr. Pat Carr in 1991 annual report his closing statement he says since it remains unclear how wheat flax intercrops respond to plant population changes additional research is planned to determine how intercrop performance is influenced by lower seeding rates. Well Dr. Pat Carr you're a visionary just like Dr. John Gardner was and so we're going to revisit this and see what happens we're going to find out ways that we can make it better for your farm so that you can get good returns on your flax and have cleaner flax and get better profit that's what we're about here at the Research Center thank you very much.
