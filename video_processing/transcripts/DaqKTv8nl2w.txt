 Learn with Fluffy! Hello, friends. I am Michaela the Delicate Flower. Welcome to our special video where we'll learn about the amazing life cycle of plants. First, let's start with a tiny seed. It's like a little sleeping plant waiting to wake up. When we plant it in the soil and give it water and sunshine, something magical happens. The seed begins to sprout. A small stem pushes up through the soil towards the warm sunshine. It's like a baby plant stretching and reaching for the sky. As the plant grows, it gets leaves. Leaves are like the plant's food factories. They soak up sunlight and use it to make yummy food for the plant to grow big and strong. When the plant is all grown up, it's time for something very special to happen. It starts to make flowers. Flowers are like the plant's way of saying hello to the world. They are colorful and beautiful. Now, here comes the fun part. Bees and other insects visit the flowers to collect sweet nectar. While they do that, they also help the flowers make seeds by carrying pollen from one flower to another. It's like a little insect party. And guess what happens next? The flowers turn into seeds. These seeds fall to the ground and the whole cycle starts again. Isn't that amazing? And guess what happens next? The flowers turn into seeds.
