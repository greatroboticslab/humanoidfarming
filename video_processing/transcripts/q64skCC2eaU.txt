 What is the importance of the biodiversity? Well, it will be very important in the International Year of Biodiversity not to be dealing only with pandas and tigers, but also to be dealing with agricultural biodiversity, which is the basis of our survival on this planet. And this is not only important for today, but it is especially important also in the long term. Well, it's important to realise that in many countries the crops that are being grown now will not be able to be grown in the future, and therefore countries must be thinking now about what diversity they have to import from other countries to be able to meet their needs in 10, 15, 20 years from now. We also have to think about the two billion people that are suffering from the so-called hidden hunger, which is linked to poor diets, diets that are not diverse enough, and that maybe contain enough calories, but not the nutrients that are necessary for a healthy life. And so what we have to do when we talk about food security is not just dealing with production of calories, but production of quality food, of the food that contains the nutrients that allow people to develop fully and to have a healthy life. What are the challenges of the food that is needed? Well, these are short-term solutions, and they are by definition, because you have to repeat them year after year, not sustainable. By having a diverse production system that delivers a diverse diet, you will solve these problems in the long term. What is the problem? I think if we have an intensification without simplification of the production system, we can have an environment that is actually very favorable, including for things like wildlife in agricultural settings. So a diverse agriculture is compatible with conservation of nature in general. What is the problem? Well, even for those people that care about tigers and pandas and rainforests, it is important to deal first and foremost with agricultural biodiversity, because without that, we won't be able to care about the other diversity in the future. So it's important for everybody. Thank you.
