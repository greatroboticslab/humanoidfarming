Education
 Great. So we're here today to try and talk through kind of the box dev lit that just launched this morning on agricultural technology in Africa. As Chris said, it's sort of one of a series. Chris and this Chris and I co-edited it or edited it. And I just wanted to give a shout out to all of our co-editors. You can see them listed there. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow-Borquist, Tom Jane, Jeremy Magruder, Hope Mickelson, Meredith Startz, and Amelia Gentry. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- So thank you all for helping us put this together. You know, we think of the list as living documents. So that list will also hopefully evolve as we grow. And we have, we're continually adding people to this. So we're looking forward to future versions too. Okay. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- I'm going to try and make sure this all works. Okay, so the agenda for today is really simple. We're just going to go through bits and pieces of the lit. We'll start off talking about the trends in agricultural technology use and productivity in Africa. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- Kind of motivate why this kind of is an important sort of questions in the world. We'll talk about why there's been stagnation in this, in agriculture in Africa. And then the, you know, the sort of where does it come from and when and how. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- And then we'll try and end with kind of what I feel is like a fun piece of the lit, which is, you know, what do we think are open questions for students and other faculty interested in working in this area. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- So I'll start off with the trends a little bit just to set the context. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- So these two pictures show the ag share of GDP across the world. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- And on the other side, the ag share of GDP across different countries in Africa. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- And so you can see the ag share of GDP, you know, is quite high in Africa relative to the rest of the world and kind of varies quite a lot. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- So it's a very large part of these economies. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- And so trying to understand how to raise productivity and incomes in a sector that contributes to so much of GDP is important. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- If we look at employment, you're going to see similar things. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- And so, you know, the big part of the sector is a big part of the economy, and so trying to study what drives productivity in this context is important. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- And so the sort of bigger bigger sort of trend that is motivated a lot of Chris's work and my work, having been a student of Chris for many years, still am. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- Is the value of cereal yields so here we're just showing you cereal yields across different parts of the world. Jenny Aker, Lauren Falcow- And you can see that over the last 60 years, Africa has logged in the growth of yields. So not only is this a big sector for the economy, but the productivity is lagging everywhere else. And so you can't help when you see a graph like this to say, well, why is this the case? What is going on and what might account for it? And so that's part of what the lid is going to do is try and understand why. Not that we have a perfect answer, because if we did, there would be no work to do. But try and motivate what we've learned and what may be left to learn here. You know, related to the yield gap, there's also other gaps. And so we highlight two. One is the use of fertilizer. And again, you can see it by regions across the world. Here also, Africa lags tremendously. There's been very little growth in the use of fertilizer over the last 60 years, whereas it's grown everywhere else tremendously over this period. And so you see this widening, not just a gap, but this ever widening gap. And the same is true for the share of land equipped for irrigation. Again, Africa is going to lag pretty far behind the rest of the world on the share of land equipped for irrigation. And then keep in mind at the back of this, remember I said in the rest of the world, the share of agriculture is small in employment and small in GDP anyways. So we expect that share for the rest of the world to be quite small. But we would hope that this would be larger in Africa. Yeah. Yeah. So the extraordinary thing about these graphs, I think, is just the magnitude of it. There's essentially zero fertilizer and zero irrigation in most of Africa. Great. You're going to see this. We're going to have a bit of fun with this, by the way. We're going to interrupt each other. And hopefully that means this will be fun. Okay. I'm going to hand over to Chris now. Okay. So what's the reason for these huge gaps in productivity growth and input intensity use? Pretty clearly, there's no single binding constraint. And so the different combinations of constraints seem to bind for different farmers. And we're going to talk about that in a few minutes. So a natural conclusion as a consequence of that observation is that it might be that packages of interventions might be the most useful approach to try to close these gaps. There's a small but growing literature on this. So there's a lot of work to be done. And that'll be a theme throughout our talk is that we know very little. Even when we think we know something, we probably don't know it because we know it for one small place or one example. And so our lack of knowledge is, I think, the most important conclusion of our literature review. But there is a small literature that's growing on multifaceted approaches to trying to overcome the multiple constraints that bind for different farmers that are preventing them from adopting new technologies and intensifying agriculture. There's some examples that we list there. One acre fund is a particularly interesting example because it seems to be successful in at least one of its implementations. I've got some work with co-authors looking at a multifaceted economic conclusion program in Niger that seems to be doing remarkable things for agriculture. And there's a few other examples. But it's clear that these are not a silver bullet. Drumnet collapsed after a year when farmers were unable to meet EU requirements for exporting. And underlying all of my skepticism about our results on this so far are the massive failures like the integrated rural development programs that were implemented in the 70s and 80s, which are very reminiscent of these multifaceted programs. They were large-scale integrated programs that were trying to deal with multiple constraints at the same time. And they, by and large, failed miserably. There's some other examples of community-driven rural development programs that have not worked very well. And even when we see additional crop output being generated from these programs, costs are often too high. Great. Great. Yeah. I won't be as philosophical as Chris saying what we know we don't actually know. It's kind of a philosophical statement, Chris. But you will see a bit of that theme throughout. So one thing that we, at least I believe, I think Tamim agrees, is that we've got lots of evidence from lots of different contexts that farmers show an ability to overcome constraints when the technology is sufficiently productive. When it increases yields enough, when it increases profits enough. So if it's actually profitable, farmers will want to take important changes. There's many examples over many historical time periods. We can go back to the introduction of maize. We can look at the introduction of cocoa in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire. More recently, flowers in Kenya, Ethiopia. Improved varieties of cassava in Nigeria. Rainwater harvesting techniques in Niger. All of these are examples of farmers making very important changes, long-term investments, reorganizing social structures in order to take advantage of sufficiently productive and profitable technologies. But very often, these sufficiently profitable technologies are very limited in their scope, their geographic scope, their social scope. And those limits are being set by another theme of our literature review, which is the immense heterogeneity that we see across African agriculture. Great. Thanks. So I'm going to go through some of these constraints kind of individually. Just to reiterate something Chris started off saying, you know, we don't think that a single constraint binds. There's no silver bullet anywhere to be found. And I think we both now I'm going to speak for Chris like he did for me a second ago. And just I think he probably agrees that, you know, there isn't one out there. But the question is how to think about what both what we know and therefore what we need to learn yet. So there's been a large literature in agriculture trying to take one constraint and alleviate one constraint and see what it does. And in general, the message of this literature is going to be alleviating any one constraint has small effects. And it's because there's different binding constraints. And for different people, different constraints are the most binding. So I'm going to talk quickly about kind of two of the big constraints. The first is sort of credit liquidity and savings constraints. You know, again, there's a long literature here, for example, Laurie and I'll find that cash grants increase input use a lot. But a lot of papers find very small effects of grants or access to savings on inputs. There's a dozen, a half a dozen to a dozen papers showing that basically, even though I alleviate that savings constraint, the impacts are just pretty small. On insurance constraint, we, you know, the hypothesis is that uninsured risk may deter investment in new technologies. This is not a sort of crazy hypothesis to have. You could imagine that people care about downside risk a lot when they're poor. And so they don't want to invest in new technologies because they're really scared of a downside risk. And if you can't ensure that downside risk, it's going to deter this investment. And Chris and Dean have, and with Robert, have worked on this before, showing that there are benefits to having insurance products. But if I give it away, it has effects. The last point Chris just made, if I add a cost of it, it suddenly starts to look not so good. Right. And so the crop insurance stuff is sort of subject to high transaction costs. We've seen some work on this, like Lorenzo and Jack Willis have a paper on behavioral biases. Michael Carter has a lot of work on why there's still a lot of basis risk in these products. And so they're not as useful as if we could alleviate some of that basis risk for farmers. So even though they use these, it's not going to alleviate a lot of the risk that they face. And then, you know, innovation itself is a risky thing. It's a risky undertaking in of itself. And so much as we can try and provide some products that help alleviate these risks, it's still not kind of solving any of the stagnation pieces we see in a dramatic way. There's a large literature on knowledge constraints. Clearly, when you're talking about adopting a new technology, one of the things that has to happen is farmers have to learn about it. They have to learn that it's profitable for them. They have to learn how to use it. So there's a there's a I would say this is probably the part of the literature that's most developed. Maybe. Maybe. Yeah, I think that's right. Yeah. So there's a large literature on on on learning from experts, how to design extension systems, methods of teaching farmer field schools. There's literature on learning from experience, how farmers learn by doing how that can be coupled with, say, smart subsidies that are time limited to give sort of basically an infant industry argument for for giving farmers a time period to learn how to use a new technology. And of course, learning from neighbors, social learning, how networks work, optimally choosing who within a network to to to receive extension advice to best spread the knowledge through through networks. So there's large literature on that we still certainly don't understand all of it, but we know that farmers can learn and we know a good deal about about ways of reaching farmers. We I guess one thing I would add is that we wouldn't say that knowledge is the only constraint. It's not that ways of learning improve things. But again, the effects on adoption are largely small, I think. That's correct. That's correct. OK, good. A systematic problem that we'll see again, we'll reemphasize this later on. But poor infrastructure and high transportation costs can obviously limit adoption of new technologies and the use of intensified agriculture through applying more inputs because the inputs are expensive. A lot of that is just due to bad roads, bad infrastructure. But part of it may also be due to market power. And here there's there's less of a clear consensus in the literature. I suspect that there are examples of markets for inputs and outputs that are monopolized and have large degree of market power. And there's examples where they do not, where there's an almost competitive market for both inputs and outputs. And we're just starting the process of trying to map that out across the continent, I think. Yeah, it's really striking. Most of those papers are very new. It's a very new literature trying to understand that. So there I think also work to do. Yeah. Good. OK, my turn. The other piece that's sort of now also a pretty new literature is trying to understand the market for quality. Are there incentives for farmers to produce quality? And the way we think about it is you might want differential prices on quality. If there's no differential price for quality, then the incentives to invest in inputs that would raise quality are sort of muted. And so it's not clear that a lot of supply chains and product chains reward quality. But there are papers showing that if I do give farmers quality incentives, they do respond, which is great. Of course, that leaves this big open question of, well, why aren't product chains doing it? And how do we get the supply chains to actually provide those incentives? We don't know anything about that yet, I think. Right? I think that's right. I think that's right. And then there's also sort of a literature on concerns about quality on the input side. This is actually a pretty not a settled question. I thought we thought it was settled. Yes, definitely not settled. Recent work by also including one of our co-editors on the lit seems to show that this is absolutely not a settled question. There might be quality issues in some markets or some inputs, but that's by no means any general statement about quality of inputs. And so, again, you know, everything we're going to say is going to come back to the theme of this lit, which is context, environment, everything matters, and things are just not the same across even within a country across space. The last sort of the I think this is almost the last constraint is land and labor market imperfections. We kind of bundled those together because this is where there's probably the least amount of work on constraints. There's very limited work on understanding the role of rural labor market imperfections and how that affects technology adoption. One exception is the Jones et al paper in Rwanda. And then land rights and investment have been studied quite a lot. So I think property rights, laws that give property rights, those sorts of things have been studied quite extensively. Again, finding mixed results, mostly positive, but kind of somewhat mixed. So there's maybe probably a bit of work to do there. And then there's a lot of new work on equipment rentals, on trying to get investments in mechanization and machinery. So there's a paper by Chris Barr and Sheehan, and then an India paper that's just out by Julieta Cornedo and Namrana Kahl is showing that even though you can subsidize these investments in machinery, there's another binding constraint that hits, which tends to be a labor market constraint. Right. And so this is going to fit the same idea. There's no single binding constraint because I try to alleviate this big investment constraint on mechanization. And yet it doesn't suddenly create massive productivity growth. Instead, there's another binding constraint that prevents you from achieving that. So I think on the equipment side or the mechanization side, still a lot of work to do. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we think that underlying a lot of what we're finding in this literature is the reality that agricultural technologies are extremely sensitive to local circumstances. Nutrients, moisture, soil quality, weather, topography, solar energy. And then on top of these natural variations, there's heterogeneity in infrastructure and market access. In fact, the lack of infrastructure itself makes markets fragment, and hence there's a large variety in prices of inputs and outputs, which means that the profitability of technologies varies a lot over space. So technologies just may not be profitable everywhere. They might be profitable in one place, not another. It might also put barriers to adoption in the form of barriers to learning. The fact that a new technology works in one place for a neighbor, it may not work as well for you if your land is different or you face different prices. And so this also adds to an additional problem that we're going to emphasize in a minute, which is that the heterogeneity limits the incentives for R&D into new technologies, if those new technologies are going to have small markets, because they're only relevant for a small segment of the population. And so what we see is that given technologies, it might be difficult to spread because they're not profitable everywhere. And the shelf of new technologies is going to be limited by the limited incentives that this heterogeneity generates. Okay, so let's talk about the evidence we have on some of this heterogeneity. I'm not sure I should be talking about my own work, Chris. Well, go ahead. You know it best. So there's an old paper, a very old paper now, which I wrote in grad school, actually. So actually, you know it really well, too, because you advised it. And so it shows really big heterogeneity in growth and net returns to hyperseed and fertilize it even within a given country. So within Kenya, you know, maybe I should make you talk about your work, too, then. But, you know, it was sort of showing that maybe adoption doesn't look so low when we think of it as low, because if it's not profitable or, you know, doesn't have returns, then of course adoption should be low. It's rationally low. And so that was the aim of the paper to show that some of these low adoption rates might be perfectly rational when you try to estimate localized heterogeneity in returns, very localized. In fact, trying to get an individual specific and not even, you know, village level. The other thing that seems to be true from recent work, and Chris has a paper here, as does others, is that the heterogeneity appears to be far larger in sub-Saharan Africa than in other places. Okay. And, you know, we know some of maybe why. Partly it's the constraints we described. The infrastructure's worse. Everything's worse. It could be also kind of the diversity in land quality, just as an endowment, started off that way. Again, we don't know why, but at least we have some hypotheses that people have started to think about. You know, the implications of this sort of extensive heterogeneity can be far-reaching. Not just in, like, trying to explain the lack of adoption like I was doing, but in also sort of highlighting how hard it is to get a good technology. Because a good technology for me is not a good technology for Chris, and vice versa. And so developing these new technologies without some sort of understanding that there's going to be a diversity in the returns and profitability sort of prevents that sort of process of developing it. Because it's just not that easy to sort of make profits off the technology itself. And it also complicates policy. I can't just tell everybody, oh, go use this technology. Because it turns out doing that means a lot of people wouldn't benefit from it. Okay. So where does the heterogeneity come from? We think that soil inequality endowments themselves may be different for geological and historical reasons. Part of the... I can't remember if we have a slide on this coming up, so I'll say it now. Yeah, go for it. Say it now. Part of this has to do with the low intensity of agriculture itself. Higher intensity agriculture using fertilizer and irrigation helps smooth out heterogeneity that otherwise exists. And the low population densities in at least West Africa, which themselves can be traced back at least in part to the history of the slave trades, itself also generates more heterogeneity because low population density means that you're using long fallow systems. You're working more embedded in the ecology rather than transforming the land under permanent cultivation with added nutrients from outside the local area. That tends to smooth out differences across space. So there might be an endowment from long history, from geological history, and as well the historical process of agricultural development, at least in West Africa, which has generated more heterogeneity than we see in other parts of the world. Then heterogeneity in weather, given that there's no irrigation, farmers are relying on rain-fed agriculture. So when it rains, an innovation might be profitable. When it doesn't, an innovation may not be profitable. And the variation in the rates of return to investment is huge across time, even in a given space. So there's heterogeneity not just over space, but over time, over seasons. So one hopeful development is investments in developing new crop varieties that are resistant to poor weather realizations to try to smooth out some of that temporal heterogeneity. And then, of course, the scarce and low-quality road infrastructure, imperfect competition in transportation, means there's large variation across space in both the input and output prices, which, again, changes the relative returns to new technologies. Great. The final piece of this, I think, is the investments in technology for Africa are just really low, partly because there's low levels of public and private R&D. There's low spending per farmer on R&D. In Africa, it's two orders of magnitude lower than any developed country. And, you know, there's already a low level. When there's volatility in those investments, it makes it even worse. You know, in the developed world, private R&D in agriculture has been coming in over the last decade, and there's this huge growth in private R&D in agriculture. And you can think of all the big companies that are doing this, you know, Monsanto, Syngenta, et cetera. But, you know, it's still only a quarter of all R&D, and in Africa, it's basically none. So there's very little role for private R&D. And there's a bit of evidence, sort of an older set of evidence showing that agricultural R&D builds on itself. So, you know, there's a paper by Bob Evanson and Doug Gallen showing for the Green Revolution, building the first set of new technologies kind of created this momentum to build more and more over it. Just to give you some examples, in India, there's sort of between 20 and 40 new varieties of rice released every year, 10 to 20 new varieties of maize and wheat. The example I know best for obvious reasons, in Kenya, there's five or a few newer varieties introduced every year. And it's not just about the varieties. It's about does the new variety give you a big yield gain over the last technology that you did? And, you know, we often think that in the developed world or in India that's doing quite well, this new variety gives you a pretty big gain. In Kenya, some of these new varieties give you close to zero yield improvement on a research station. And so it's not going to do much for farmers. And so it's not just about new technologies, but what are the properties of these new technologies in the sort of profit equation we have in mind on the yield side, on the cost side? And just to give you a sense of this, here's a picture of our table showing public and private R&D spending. I know 2011 sounds like a long time ago, but it's not so easy to find all these numbers across the world. And so you can see kind of high income countries having really large amounts of public R&D and then this growing amount of private R&D, as we talked about. But there's very little in poor countries. Okay, if you look at Latin America, it's already quite low. If you look at the African and Middle East areas, even lower. Okay, so there's very little kind of public private R&D spend in these countries, which means the development and the production of technologies is going to be lagging what we would need to close some of that gap. If we even believed technologies were the solution. Great. Okay, so what do we do? So we've got very low productivity. We've got low input intensity. We've got relatively low adoption of new technologies. And there's these barriers put up by the huge heterogeneity that we see across rural Africa. Doug and I in our paper, actually, so you talk about within village variation and profitability of new technologies across farmers. And Doug and I find it variability in the profitability of new technologies across plots of a given farmer, even within the plot of a single farmer. And so one way that things might proceed is a combination of irrigation, permanent cultivation, gradually intensified use of inputs, and terrain engineering can smooth out this underlying heterogeneity. That's a very long-term process. In the short-term process, and in the short-term, we hope to see new technologies that are customizable, that could be adopted for the different uses. That different farmers will put them to, or profitable across a wider range of circumstances that just work more generally. If you look at the developed world, there's enormous customization in developed countries. If you go to the Midwest of the United States, you go 100 miles north or south, there's different varieties of seeds that are optimal for these farmers. When we were doing experiments in Ghana, the most profitable maize seed we could find was from South Africa, which is insane. It's got to be the case that there's seeds that would be better adopted to northern Ghana than something that was optimized for South Africa. There's very limited customization in Africa. And fertilizer recommendations to African farmers are often uniform over large areas. They don't pay attention to local variations in soil quality or needs. And so we need to find customization that work in Africa. So the problem is we don't know. It's not that agronomists wouldn't provide better recommendations if they knew, but we just don't have enough trials around Africa to understand the heterogeneity. So we need to find a way of greatly increasing farmer participatory trials so that we can try new technologies on farmers' fields in diverse environments. And the rapid expansion of information network availability across Africa is going to give us tools, I think, that we can use to generate large-scale testing of technologies across diverse circumstances of farmers so we can map out where new technologies work and where they don't. Okay. Okay. One of the obstacles to this sort of idea of having more trials, more data, more understanding of what works where is the low number of agricultural research stations with the low staff and high turnover. So let me give you an example. In the U.S., there's 607 research stations. You know, this gives you about 134 research stations per 100,000 farmers. Remember, there's less farmers in the U.S. And if you look at comparable numbers across Africa, we pulled out all the ones we could find. You know, the numbers are going to range from, you know, 7 in Mali to 154 in Malawi. But if you norm by the number of farmers, you know it's 0.2, 0.3, as high as 1 for 100,000 farmers, which is just, you know, 100 times smaller than it is in the U.S. And so this is going to be one key constraint is that there's not a public production process or a venue for that production process of knowledge. So, you know, that's one piece. The other piece we don't know. We're going to come back to this theme that Chris started off from. We can say what we know, but it turns out even the stuff we know, we don't really know. We also don't know what seed varieties are actually being used by farmers, right? This is one of the key things, like Chris said, the most profitable one they could find in Ghana was built in South Africa or made in South Africa. And some ways people have started to think about this as to do DNA fingerprinting of the seeds in existence to try and get a better understanding of what's the core pieces of the sort of the genetics of these seeds. And how do we think about what that means for what we need? I'm hoping that's the next step is to go work with some engineers down the street from us. And, you know, ultimately, even if we try to do that and we try to do better research stations, it's still not solving the problem, which is that there is still a lot of customization needed even outside those research stations. A trial on a research station, traditionally, at least we saw this in Sierra Leone, will give you yield returns. If we're in the field, the yield returns are an order of magnitude less because the context is different and it's not as controlled. And on a research station, I can pour water on it when I need. And you can control all the bits that create this volatility in yields. And yet the farmers aren't going to adopt based on that. They're going to adopt based on their own returns. And so I think something that Chris and I talk, you know, think at the end of the day is we need large scale participatory trials and, you know, bringing in an era of truly citizen science on the continent. Yep. And I think it can't be voluntary. I think it has to be. If you're asking farmers to contribute to the research process, they're generating externalities. There have to be rewards for them. Oh, absolutely. I thought you were going to say I had to force them to do it. And I was like, well, where are you going first that it's not voluntary? Great. This is you. Yes. Okay. So an obvious thing, if you're seeing very low use of inputs, very low use of fertilizer, we haven't talked about it, but there's much more rapid adoption of weedicide and labor-saving pesticides. But if we see very low use of fertilizer, very low use of irrigation, very low use of modern varieties of seeds, one thing, sort of an obvious thing to say is, well, maybe make it cheaper. The fertilizer prices are extremely high in most of Africa. Over 60% of the fertilizer in Africa was imported in 2016. And that share varies a lot. In many countries of Africa, it's all. So how can we make it so that fertilizer in particular is affordable to farmers? One thing to do is to invest in infrastructure. One of the reasons for the high prices is the enormous transportation costs. Another is to perhaps encourage more local production of fertilizer or more geographically local trade in fertilizer. There's only 135 fertilizer plants across all of sub-Saharan Africa, excluding South Africa, and only 17 of them are manufacturing plants. 101 are processing plants or mixing plants. And in most countries, a very small number of importers dominate the market. Maybe there's imperfect competition. We know there's imperfect competition in fertilizer markets. Maybe there's ways to improve the competitiveness of fertilizer markets. One could subsidize fertilizer. This has been often a disaster. It's expensive. It can lead to overuse. And it can often be captured by local elites. But if done right, it perhaps can play a role. And it's clear that there's other inputs like weather insurance that need government support because they provide externalities. Great. Ah, fertilizer prices. That's just to show you. If you look at the far right, there's the United States. Fertilizer prices in Africa are one and a half to two to even three times as high as they are in the United States. You would have thought it would be the reverse. All right. You want to conclude, Chris? I'll leave this in your capable hands. Okay. Here's a few of the open questions. I think one of the things that's exciting about research in this area is that there's so many open questions. How should we... The biggest question for me and Tabneet, I think, is how do we provide incentives for either the public sector or the private sector to develop the new technologies that are locally customized? We think that the main problem that African farmers face is not any of the specific constraints that we laid out. We think they all operate in different places at different times. But the lack of a deep shelf of really profitable technologies that farmers will adopt despite these constraints is the real problem. How should we provide incentives for experimentation with these new technologies? Another question, a deep question, is how much should we be focused on this at all? Are improvements in agricultural technology and productivity the most useful way to reduce poverty? Or should the focus be on helping people get out of agriculture and into non-agricultural sector activities? There's not going to be a... There's not an answer to that, I don't think. No. I think it's... I think... Anyway. I would like one. Yeah. So if someone could come up with one, please do. And so can the integration of rural and urban markets in Africa provide better incentives to reduce some of these price dispersions and these enormously high prices that we see? Is there a way to scale down large-scale infrastructure investments to get more irrigation? Can we do things at the small scale? Can farmers invest in irrigation rather than having large-scale projects? And just to add on that, one of the reasons is population density is low. And so big investment projects don't actually pay off for the investor either. And so trying to scale these down in a way that makes sense might make them smaller investments to be used by enough farmers to fill up the investment in some way. Good. And yeah. And so what is the role of the state in agriculture? Should they be making investments like that? How important is crony capitalism in agriculture? There are commercial farmers. The sector is actually growing fairly rapidly in many countries. The political economy around policy priorities and large infrastructure investments is fascinating. There's a long history of... Here in Cambridge, Robert Bates. States and markets and how they interact in agriculture is an important thing for us to understand more about. And there's a lot of work to be done on that. And we need to learn more about many of the specific constraints that we talked about. Even though we don't think any one of them is a silver bullet, we need to know a lot more about them because they do affect farmers' ability to adopt new technologies. Yeah. And how they interact with each other too. Exactly. Yes.
