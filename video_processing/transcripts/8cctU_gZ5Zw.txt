 Good day. I am Professor Betty Mubangizi and I hold the NRF Research Chair in Sustainable Rural Livelihoods. This is our final episode in our Digital Stories series, and in here I summarize the key takeaway lessons from the previous episodes. I offer a framework for informing policymakers and practitioners, and I highlight the need for more significant research on sustainable rural livelihoods within South Africa's institutional structure. To begin with, rural regions are not homogeneous, so there is no universally accepted definition of rural or rurality. Governments, divisions within governments, research institutions, and development organizations all have a unique perspective on what constitutes rural areas. Additionally, meanings fluctuate through time and space. Several years ago, for example, what was rural in South Africa is probably not rural anymore due to urban encroachment. Further, what is rural in the global north cannot possibly be rural in the global south. The focus of our research chair is on B4 municipalities. Now, B4 municipalities are in rural areas of South Africa and are characterized by communal land ownership, traditional leadership, scattered groups of houses, and most are located in former homelands. A further characteristic is that most B4 municipalities are reliant on subsistence farming, remittances, and social welfare subsidies. Now, as we've noted in this series, rural households rely on a network of actors and a variety of resources. So, designing effective pro-rural policies must be based on a thorough understanding of these resources, their availabilities, accessibilities, and control, and the role of various actors in the networks. And I'm going to take you through some of these resources, starting with physical resources. Now, rural regions share a sectoral trait in that the majority of rural schools are in the bottom quintiles under resource constraint. Now, schools are physical resources, just like clinics, just like roads, and connectivity. Now, rural roads are difficult to maneuver, especially during wet seasons, and many rural people lack access to or cannot afford transportation. As such, access to schools, access to clinics, and such services is challenging for the rural populace. Another important resource is financial resources. Now, for rural people, crop and animal farming are often subsistence occupations in rural regions and do not provide sustainable wealth or livelihoods. Some rural areas rely on public works programs in conjunction with civil society organizations. Public programs offer training and help for temporary jobs and micro-enterprises. However, they are not sustainable and do not provide sustainable advantages. So, the majority of individuals in rural areas rely on the government's social assistance programs. There is, of course, potential for rural labor markets and income-generating prospects that rural municipalities strive for, and they do so through the economic development programs and planning units and through legislated integrated development plans. Rural financial resources are thus dependent on the degree to which organizations within and outside of the communities and rural areas interact, implement, and monitor the principles outlined in municipal integrated plans. Fundamentally, of course, a functional and efficient municipality, one in which municipal councillors can be trusted to prepare for and administer the municipality's mandate is required.

Social capital in rural areas is also manifested through collective saving clubs and burial programs. Land and water resources are two key natural livelihood assets that lay the groundwork for all other assets. In South Africa, as we know, land is a highly contentious issue with a terrible history of dispossession and injustice. But not only is land necessary for rural livelihoods, it is also symbolic and significant in terms of identity and belonging, particularly for dispossessed people. Thus, access to land may mean reclaiming dignity, cultural recovery, justice and a higher standard of living for those in rural areas. Another significant issue for rural livelihoods with regard to natural resources is the reality of land degradation. Land degradation has a detrimental effect on biodiversity and livelihoods because it results in the loss of deterioration of soils, capacity to produce. And this can be as a result of soil erosion, felt degradation, overgrazing and other adverse agricultural and non-agricultural human practices. One significant issue in South Africa is the spread of exotic alien plants. The major invasive plant species like black water has been shown to significantly lower watershed and the spread of the land. The major invasive plant species like black water supply, degrade wetlands and diminish diversity. These difficulties exacerbate the plight of South Africa's rural poor, the majority of whom live under communal land tenure. This frequently involves agreements on community properties such as forests and grazing fields, as well as the allotment of arable land plots for household agricultural activity. Traditional leaders are critical to tenure management and accomplishment, but civil society groups also play an important role in resolving some of these land-related issues and assisting communities in making the greatest use of their property. The major environmental factors are critical to ensure that the water and climate are critical resource factors in South Africa. Legislative and policy frameworks have been constructed to guarantee that municipalities can provide an acceptable level of service and that all South Africans have equal access to water. Additionally, water management frameworks have been established to encourage community engagement in water governance. The reality is that due to the dispersed nature of rural housing, limited municipal resources and massive infrastructure backlogs, many rural residents rely on and will continue to rely on streams and ground water for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, rural springs are susceptible to pollution due to silting, inadequate sanitation, household waste, invasive alien species. As a result, spring protection measures are critical to ensuring the springs' quality and quantity, so we need to integrate approaches to water challenges across social, ecological and infrastructural systems while decentralising decision-making through formal engagement of stakeholders in water management. And our partners have proved that this is feasible. The UMZIMFUBU Catchment Partnership is an example. They have shown that it is feasible to build community resilience via governance procedures and to promote sustainable catchment management practice. We know it is achievable. The UMZIMFUBU Partnership has demonstrated that collaboration with local government, with traditional leaders, may result in minor but important gains toward adaptation to climate change and increased water supply. However, we have noted that local government remains a critical actor to such endeavours. And municipal integrated plans are a good place to start. And núㅋㅋㅋㅋs andcheering this To offset enrichment 겁‌u Sport-to-operable bobcatt lock-able By include the to pandemics, building resilience and strengthening the various categories of natural resources all hinge on transforming structures and processes. Policies and institutions are powerful forces that can negatively or positively transform rural livelihoods. Transformation, transforming structures and processes can be found at all levels from the simplest rural home to global institutions that set important rules and norms. Transforming structures include public and private sector organizations that make policy and legislation and that implement them or monitor them. Those that deliver services and carry out a range of activities affecting livelihoods. Policies on agriculture and environment and other cultural issues for example could determine whether Tabo's land adds any value to his household's ability to earn a living. Now speaking about livelihood shocks, even the most well-run municipalities and the best resourced municipalities are prone to environmental factors beyond their control. Rural livelihoods are generally fragile and vulnerable to such social economic and environmental shocks. Historical and contemporary problems of inadequate resources, a low skills base, weak governance systems, they all continue to rear their ugly heads manifesting in inequalities, bad roads, poor transport system, poorly resourced local governance systems among others. And these have been worsened by climate change, droughts and prolonged dry seasons that destroy pasture and crops. Heavy rains that wash away bridges and tornadoes that blow off rooftops damaging infrastructure of homes, of schools, of bridges and clinics. So COVID-19 joins a string of unfortunate conditions eating away livelihoods and well-beings in rural communities. Resilient livelihoods are ones that can withstand and swiftly recover from such shocks. Resilient institutions are those that can assist communities in coping with calamities and quickly recovering from their impacts. It is obvious that neither rural livelihoods nor rural institutions are particularly resilient as we have seen.
