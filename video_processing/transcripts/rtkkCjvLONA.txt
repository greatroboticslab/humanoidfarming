 Joining me is Dale Everman. We're at Holman Incorporated lot as they set up for Farm Science Review. And this is lot 612. If you hear some things you'd like to come check them out, Dale Everman to give us an update. First of all, what kind of equipment will we see here? Everybody seems to be running, I'm going to say, a slender view this year. Well, I think what we're running into is a lot of farmers out there want their equipment. And with some of the money that was handed out the last couple of years, I think they've got some money to spend. So on the lot today, we've got a Artex Dry Minoer Spreader. It's available with vertical beaters and a cyclone kit for litter and lime. We've also got some Bazooka Farm Star for liquid drag line equipment. We've got a booster pump, a hose reel, and the new Wolverine boat should be here Monday. So that will be at the show next week. Across the drive, we've got some Triolite mixers that we sell for the guys that have any TMR mixer or dairy or cattle use. We've got that available as well as a gear manure tank that's sitting in the lot next to us. Also, you do some work in the grain systems, and those guys have been busy for months now. Yeah, the grain season's coming on early this year. At least I feel like it's early. It doesn't seem like it's always during this week of the show to get ready. But the corn and beans are drying up fast. The dryers are starting to fire up, and the guys want to get at it. Service calls for guys with grain. Are you taking service calls, or how are things booked out? Usually it's on a day-to-day basis, depending on how urgent you need us. But yeah, we've got quite a few guys out servicing dryers, working on blower samplers, blowers, heaters, everything available out there. We've got guys out working on it.

Also, check with your accountant to find out if you've got plans for next year, and you've got money this year.
