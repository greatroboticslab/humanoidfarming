 Agents of change, challengers of the status quo, futurists. We're talking about farmers, ranchers, and the businesses that serve them. Because no industry embraces progress more fully than agriculture. From man to mule, from steam to diesel, from soil smart to satellite savvy, this business is about adapting. It demands a protector just as forward-minded. It demands Nationwide. As the nation's number one insurer of farms and farm families, Nationwide has long been a reliable resource for rural America. For nearly 100 years, we've been anticipating and mitigating the fact-of-life liabilities of agriculture. And while the current surge of data, technology, and globalization promises incredible growth potential, each new opportunity is shadowed by rising threats like security breaches, GMO contamination, and its supply chain failures. That's why even as we confront today's liabilities, Nationwide is looking ahead to the risks not yet imagined. How do we ready the Ag industry? The Nationwide Ag Insight Center. Created to provide a steady stream of intel to our farm-certified agents and farmers alike, the Ag Insight Center never sleeps. Just like agriculture itself. Clearly, no insurer knows the risks of today's agriculture like Nationwide, or is better prepared to protect it, against what's next. What's next?
