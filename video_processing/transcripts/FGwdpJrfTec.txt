 Economic development is all around us, and while many can see the beneficial outcomes of the work, not everyone can explain what it looks like to implement. More than just the creation of jobs, economic development is the creation of wealth from which community benefits are realized. Economic development implementation includes developing a strategy that integrates municipal goals with the needs of all residents and businesses, understanding a community's competitive advantages and disadvantages to create a path to the future, identifying goals and metrics of success, developing policies that positively affect businesses, job and income generation, and fiscal sustainability, and using government revenue to invest in services to increase residents' quality of life. Since every community is different, a plan is successful when it aligns with the unique vision and goals of the community. While economic development may not be a cure-all for every issue, it is the driving force behind creating the preferred future for a community and its residents.
