 what's up y'all welcome back to another episode today i'm going to be giving you the full grand tour of our self-serve honor system farm store and make sure you stick around to the end because i'm going to be giving you some extra tips you need to be aware of if you're wanting to open up one of these let's jump into it all right so let's start with the grand tour because i know that's what you're wanting to see so we got a local shed company to help us design this shed we did it online and they basically built it for us we wanted something that that looked good and professional and so we've got a little front porch on here just to make it feel cozy and inviting we've got a little chair we've got some sign decor we've got an open and closed sign we've got a little wind chime over here we wanted the farm store to look inviting and cozy so when you come on in this is basically just a unfinished shed building it does have a nice you know storm door on it where you can lock it and all that and then we did add some extra windows in this shed when we designed it because we wanted a lot of natural light we didn't want just some you know rinky dink looking shed we wanted this to be nice so when you come on in you know our decor is you know we got some decor we've got you know feedback bags put up we wanted people to come to our farm where they can see our chickens out on the pasture where they can see our market gardens and then they can come in here and buy food from us you know and i think that's the cool concept of a self-serve honor system farm stores people come to you they come to your farm store you don't have to pay a cashier you don't have to go to a farmer's market and so the concept is really cool and i think a lot of small-scale farmers should should do this more now we have a clear door commercial refrigerator here and it's kind of empty right now because we typically restock on thursdays and then we also carry meats from other local farmers basically we're buying these meats wholesale and so we make you know anywhere from two to three dollars per package of meat that someone buys so we've got beef chicken and pork we're not carrying every cut but we wanted the option for people to be able to purchase meat when they come to the store and uh you know because mainly we produce vegetables and eggs we wanted people to come in and feel like they could get you know some basic staples for their home we also carry coffee from a local roastery and then we've got the price board on the wall it's just a big chalkboard where we can change the prices um we can you know write stuff on there based upon what's coming soon what we have you know in stock so after they you know grab what they want they'll then come over to this table and we have a little cash box here where they'll just input their cash or their check they just slide it into this and i attached it to the wall here and the other payment options that we have for people is venmo cash app and then we just have cash and check which is for the cash box so we've got four payment options and that has worked really really well for us so far we also have a little thing here where they can join our text club if you're wanting to start a farm store i highly suggest you uh you getting people's contact information you know a lot of people want to stay in the know so we've actually had a lot of people sign up through this we have just this little qr code we've got some paper bags for them to pack their stuff we've got some pens that's one thing to think about put some pens out for people to write checks so we also added this little radio get it off amazon just to put it on a local station and just get some back down noise and i think it just helps with the vibe of the farm store so you may be wondering what if people steal from you how are you able to watch them we've got cameras up one up here in the corner of the farm store and then additionally we have one on the outside so this really helps us and i think too you know most people in our community are honest so you just want to make sure if you are going to start one of these in your community that you're in a safe place where you feel like you can trust the community and we've gotten a ton of positive feedback on this farm store and people really really love it and they're enjoying it now obviously starting one of these farm store does cost some money you know we laid a gravel pad i had to rent a skid steer for that we obviously designed the shed we had the refrigeration cost you know we had the cost of the cameras and the cost of you know putting up some decor and things like that but at the end of the day if you're able to sell your items and sell your farm products from your property then that adds a lot of benefit to you as a grower as a farmer because you don't have to spend your time in a farmer's market you don't have to chase down chefs or wherever your sales outlet is i think a lot of farmers should do this because even if you don't sell all your products from here you're still able to sell a good amount of them now some things to think about if you are going to start one of these are obviously where are you located and if you're located out in the middle of nowhere then maybe this isn't a good option for you because you are going to need to pull people to your property we're a half a mile off a major major highway and thoroughfare so it made sense for us you know we've got a nice sign that we designed at the top of the hill that people can see we put a banner out at the main highway and so we're able to pull people in but there are a lot of other things that we did to promote the farm store the other thing you need to think about is how are you going to get electrical to this farm store we actually got quoted by an electrician to trench and run electrical from the house which is about i would say 150 feet maybe 200 and it was going to cost us like six to seven grand so what we decided to do instead was to run two heavy duty extension cords from the house now i know if you're an electrician and you're watching this you're probably like you're an idiot you should not do that so we ran two heavy duty extension cords from two separate circuits for a reason because when those compressors kick on i think it double or triples the load of that refrigerator or freezer so we've got those running from the house we got 250 foot extension cords and that has worked really really well for us but if you're going to be running a lot of refrigeration then it may be worth running electrical and we may end up doing that down the road so you may be asking how much did our setup cost all in all i think we are in it around 13 grand so we have a four car gravel pad this shed cost us i believe about 6 500 or 6 800 and then we have the refrigeration that was another four and then we have just random knickknacks the radios the cameras the decor some other random items so how much are we doing in sales every week so we just opened the store just a few weeks ago and we're doing anywhere from 500 to 800 per week now it's also april so we still have a limited selection of crops because it's still early in the spring so i think as the season goes on and as people begin to hear about our farm store then we could push that a thousand dollar plus range per week in sales so i think with an established store in the middle of you know the thick of the farm season you know we could push well over a thousand dollars per week in sales however we currently are still going to a farmer's market but our goal in the end is to eliminate the farmer's market and sell all of our farm products from our store you
