 If you want a successful garden, don't make the mistake of using the same layout every year. Let's talk about crop rotation. I always knew crop rotation was a great idea, but I had no clue how to do it. So I'm going to make it nice and simple for you. Studies show that by using crop rotation, you can increase your garden's yield by 25%. By switching up plant families each season, you break pest and disease cycles and keep soil nutrients balanced. For example, legumes like peas and beans fix nitrogen into the soil, which leafy greens love. But root vegetables like carrots and onions are prone to soil-borne diseases like root maggots and nematodes. Planting them over and over in the same spot depletes potassium and encourages pest buildup. So here's the trick. Divide your plants into cooperative families like roots, fruits, leaves, and legumes. Then rotate your groups clockwise every season. And then use an app like Seed Time to keep track of your history. This strategy creates nutrient-rich soil for next year while eliminating last year's problems. All of nature's cycles rotate. Even the earth rotates. It really makes my day.
