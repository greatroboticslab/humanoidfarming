 Hi, welcome to my channel. Have you ever heard about resistance in pests? It is a phenomena that affects millions of farmers and growers in our country. Every year farmers are facing problems with pests attacking their crops with more than 40% yield loss in vegetable crops being attributed to insect pests. To get rid of that they use different synthetic poisonous pesticides. These pesticides are spread over all the crops. Overuse of synthetic pesticides can lead to the development of resistance in pests. But what is that? Pesticide resistance is a phenomena where pests develop the ability to survive the exposure of pesticides that previously would have killed them. Pesticide resistance can be a major problem for farmers, gardeners and others who rely on pesticides to control pests and disease. When a population of pests develop resistance to a pesticide, the pesticides become less effective and may even become completely ineffective in controlling the target pest. To manage pesticide resistance, it is important to use integrated pest management strategies that rely on a combination of different control methods such as crop adaptation, cultural practices, and biological control. Using herbal pesticide can help to diversify pest control strategies and reduce the risk of resistant development. Jivadana is an indigenous traditional knowledge based formula made from different Himalayan herbs like nirgundi, essential oil, camphor, etc. It comes in 10% ready to spray as well as 100% stock solution. You have to spray this herbal concoction occasionally on leaves, fruits, flowers, or stems of a plant. It makes the pests uncomfortable to live in the plant. As a result, they will escape. Ultimately, preventing pesticide resistance requires a holistic approach. Jivadana can help you achieve that. By using proper strategies and implementing responsible pesticide use practices, it can help you to mitigate the development of pesticide resistance in pests. To try Jivadana, you may call me or visit our website. All of my products are also available on Amazon. Thank you.
