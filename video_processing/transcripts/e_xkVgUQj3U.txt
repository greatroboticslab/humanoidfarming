 So we've a lot of farmers coming to us at the moment asking the question, are they slurry compliant, nitrates compliant? So what we did for, in this example here I'll show you, we did it for a farmer based in County Cork where we looked at his existing layout of his farmyard. So what we did is we went out to this man's farmyard and physically measured all the sheds and open yards with our GPS equipment. We measured the lengths and widths and depths of all these existing tanks. We measured any open tanks, slurry towers or underground defluent tanks that he already has. And what we did, we put down a schedule of areas and volumes of all these tanks and dirty yards. So as you can see here, what we did then is we looked at these required storage based on his stocking rate. So in this man's case, he had 126 cows, which for 16 weeks he needs 665 cubic meters. For his heifers, he needed 154 cubic meters. For his waning, he needed 110 cubic meters. For his two stock bulls, he needed 9 cubic meters. And we looked at the soil water storage for the dirty yards he has, he's 4 dirty yards. Which equates to 254 cubic meters. Total slurry storage required overall equated to 1,192 cubic meters. And what was provided then, what we had worked out was 1,126 cubic meters. Which gives him a deficit of 64 cubic meters. And also looked at his dairy washings and soil water storage. So he had a tank at the side of the parlour. We looked at the size of that. And then the required dairy washing storage for 126 cows at 15 days. And would equate to 51 cubic meters. So when you look at what he had in storage already, it was only 20.4. So he needed a soil water deficit of 30.6. So this man needed to look at providing new farms of slurry storage. So this is a handy tool just to give farmers an idea of how much slurry storage they have. Or whether they need more of it. So what we'll do is we'll follow through with videos. So keep an eye out for videos where we'll be covering all forms of slurry storage. So keep an eye out for videos. So keep an eye out for videos. So keep an eye out for videos. And we'll see you next time. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
