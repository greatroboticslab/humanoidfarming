 My name's Alex and this year I decided to grow a vegetable garden. I started doing the odd bit of gardening about three years ago and I've realised it's one of the most rewarding feelings being able to harvest and cook with fresh food that you've grown yourself. And when I moved back in with my parents at the beginning of this year I asked my dad if I could dig up part of his garden and plant some vegetables. Thankfully he let me do so and in January I started making plans for this year's garden project. I've just spent the last three hours reading through my book and making notes on my computer of the different species that I want to grow and the times of year which I need to sow the seeds and then harvest them. And it's quite overwhelming actually because there's like 25 different species of plant, vegetable that I want to grow and each of those different species has a different life cycle. Some need it warmer than others, some can't tolerate frosts, so I have to plant them after the last frost. Another thing I'm finding quite tricky is knowing the amount of each plant to grow. For example, how many onions do I need? How many potato plants shall I grow? Anyway, I'm going to need luck so please wish me luck with this growing project. I've got a horrible cold and a cough. I'm feeling not too great but today it's going to be the first day of working on the garden. We've got this space here which my dad has allowed me to turn into a vegetable patch and we've got to prepare the land ready for gardening. Currently there's a lot of plants there and we have got to dig up all those plants. There's bulbs, flowers, all sorts of other things growing in this patch and we've got to dig them out before we can then plant fresh seeds and my vegetables in. So today is going to be a lot of digging. We've got a variety of tools. I don't know what it's called. I'm going to call it a long spade. Post hole digger. Post hole digger apparently. Pickaxe, mattock and then we've got a fork and a spade. So these are all your plants which have been growing here for how many years? That's about 15, 16 years. We're going to dig them all out and put them on the grass and then go through them and work out what's worth keeping. Not only does it look like an onion, it also smells like an onion because it is actually related to the onions that we eat. It's a type of allium. I can sense this is going to take way longer than I expected. There's so many bulbs and different plants in here. If we leave any in, then as soon as it gets a bit warmer, then I guess the hog is going to start to grow up. And obviously they'll compete with the vegetables that I'm trying to grow. So we've got to try and get as much of this out as possible. And it's going to take a while. A few hours later and I can confirm that digging is my least favourite thing to do with my time. After digging out all the larger plants, we then used a sieve to remove some of the small plants and bulbs. We could also take out any large stones in the soil. We've been working all evening. I would like to say it's weed free, but it's not. There's going to be a huge amount of seeds from plants that have been in here over the past many years. And I've already just found a few more. I think these are allium bulbs. So we might have some weed problems this year, but we will find that out when the spring comes. The next job was to spread a layer of fresh compost over the bed. Luckily, we have a compost bin at the bottom of the garden, which we've been putting kitchen waste in for the last few years. It'll decompose into a load of nice compost. That would have probably cost me over £100 if I was to buy it from the shop. After the past few weeks of prepping the bed, it was now looking almost ready to plant in. However, the weather wasn't quite ready and it was still pretty cold. I was at a nursery this morning looking at trees and I came home with a brand new tree. This is a fig. The variety is brown turkey, which I've heard is suited to the colder climate here in England. Because figs come from warmer places and they're not native to here. But hopefully at some point we'll have some figs. It might be this year, it might be next year, it might be in many years, who knows. But I am a proud owner of a fig tree. It's going to go on the patio for now. Although it was a little cold to start planting into the garden, I could start some plants off indoors. Today I'm going to be doing some chitting. Chitting is the process of starting potatoes off earlier on in the year. By letting them sprout indoors before you put them outside, you're giving them a head start. I'm going to put some in an egg box. These are ideal because you can place the potatoes in and they're like perfect holders for the potatoes. I went to a garden center the other day and found two varieties which I have heard are pretty good to grow. Firstly, we got some Maris Pipers. I love eating these. I buy these from the supermarket and they are great for roasting. I believe they're a floury potato, which means they're really good at soaking up oil and going crispy in the roasting tin. And I've also got these. These are Charlotte potatoes. It says here, the most popular potato in the UK. And here is the potato. I don't know if you can see, maybe. There's these little eyes. I think they call them eyes. Where tiny little sprouts are starting to come out. There's one there, one there, one there. That's where the potato will grow from. So that's where the leaves will then expand and grow. I've grown potatoes once before in my life and it was an incredibly exciting and rewarding process digging up loads of these at the end of the year. But the way you're apparently meant to do it is you choose a few of these eyes to keep and a few of them to rub off. If you let them all grow, you're kind of the energy is being spread across all of them. Whereas if you just choose one or two, then I think all the energy goes into those ones and they're strong and good. So I'm going to rub off those ones. And we simply just place the potato in there like an egg. And we do that with all of them. I've also heard that if you've got a potato which has multiple sprouts on, you can chop them in half. Let's try this. Smells lovely. You let these heal over and then we can grow a potato plant from this bit and a potato plant from that bit. So we can naturally grow twice as many potatoes. Gosh, we've got so many. Keep my label on it so I know what ones these are. And we'll do the same with these Maris Pipers. These Maris Pipers have sprouted a little bit more than the Charlotte's. That's not a very nice looking one. That's covered in mould. We'll check in with them in a few weeks and see how they're getting on. I realised I wouldn't have space in the prepared bed for all these potatoes. But after getting permission from my dad, I dug another bed around a birch tree which would become the potato patch. The weather outside still isn't warm. And we can get frost here in this part of the country until I think middle of May. And the sowings I'm going to do today consist of lettuce, chard, salad, onions, parsley, coriander and dill. All these plants can cope with cold weather. They're what gardeners call hardy plants. Which means they can stand the cold weather that we might get. So I'm going to sow the seeds in these little pots. Grow them indoors until they are sort of filling out these little module trays. And then I'll plant them in the garden. Where hopefully they will survive even if it goes below zero. The process was pretty simple. Fill a module tray with compost. Use a pen to create little holes. And pop some seeds in. For germination, seeds need to be moist. So I sprayed the compost thoroughly with water and stuck a label in so I wouldn't forget what I had sowed. Over the next week, things started to germinate. Radish was the quickest, taking only three days to sprout. Chard took six days. Salad, onions and coriander, 11 days. Parsley and dill were taking slightly longer. But after a couple of weeks, I had loads of growing plants. It's the 13th of March and my seedlings that I sowed about two weeks ago have started popping up. The only thing that seems to be just not doing anything is lettuce. I don't know whether my seeds were dodgy or I did something wrong. I might have to sow some more of those. Or maybe they're just taking their time. Anyway, today we're going to start off the process of hardening off. Now, I've never done this before, but apparently when you start seeds inside and you want to transfer them into your garden, which is outside, you should harden them off. You should get them ready for the colder environment. So you've got to get these little babies ready for the real world. Yeah, because it's not going to be nice and warm under a grow light inside your whole life. This is possibly what I'm most excited about. These are salad onions. The variety is white Lisbon. These are multi-sown. I've seen gardeners do this. They sow like 10 seeds in one cell, plant them together, and then you pick them as a clump. I don't know if it will work, but we'll give it a go. One of the problems my plants will face when they are planted out in the garden will be slugs. These are by far the most annoying pests I've had to deal with over my short time as a gardener. I would absolutely love a couple of runner ducks to sort out the slugs. However, my dad didn't want ducks in his garden, so I turned to another species which eats slugs called nematodes. These are tiny worms that you can introduce into the soil in a powdered form which will feed on slugs and hopefully reduce the numbers enough to not cause too much of a problem. But as you will see later on in this video, it didn't stop the slugs completely. A couple of weeks later and the weather was looking slightly better and I wanted to get my onions in the ground. However, since the temperatures had risen, the weeds had also been growing and there were thousands of seedlings popping up. There's potatoes growing in here. This is a hoe. It's a weed killing machine. I cut the weeds off and hope they don't grow back. Just cutting off the tops of the weeds worked, but I could see me having to do the same thing in a few days time when more seeds germinated. So I opted for a more expensive method of putting down another layer of compost to block out the light so that the weeds wouldn't be able to grow. This would also add another load of fertility to the soil and help long term, so I saw it as a good investment. I could then start planting my onions, which I simply pushed into little holes so that the tips were just under the soil. I also got distracted whilst at the garden centre and bought some sweet peas and strawberry plants. Three for one offer. I managed to plant my radishes in the ground too. It's coming together. We got onions in today, 100 of them. I didn't realise that the onions would take up like a quarter of the garden alone. Anyway, that's not a problem. I really like onions and you need them when you cook pretty much everything. I got strawberries in and also some sweet peas. And over the next few weeks, as it gets warmer and warmer, there'll be more and more stuff to sow in the soil. And I'm excited. See you soon. My main aim of this garden project this year is to grow some food and have some fun. However, I can't help try and understand a little bit more about the science that's going on underneath the soil and learn a bit about how plants actually grow. I realised that you could send off a sample of your soil in your garden to the lab and get it tested so you can see what is in your soil. Because when you look at soil, you can't really see if it's any good or not. You can see the structure and the texture of it, but you can't see the actual nutrients that are available to the plants in there. You can't see those things. So you send it to a lab. I paid 40 quid, which you could say maybe isn't worth it. Soil analysis results for the veg patch. This is so cool. This is the most scientific thing I've ever done. And I didn't even do it. Someone else did. Soil texture. Sandy silt loam. Loam soils are considered the most suitable for gardening. Woo, we got loam soils. Organic matter content. 8.8%, which is apparently high. That is also good because organic matter is what feeds the soil. Fungi, microbes and other things eat the organic matter and turn it into the nutrients which plants can use up. Vegetables require a pH of about 6.5 for optimum growth. Your soil pH was measured at 6.7. This is reasonable for growth of vegetables and no lime would be required. Lime would make the soil more alkaline if it was too acidic. But apparently we're all good. You're probably getting really bored of all the scientific stuff. So I'm going to skip over this. Basically, the report told me that my soil is good enough for vegetables to grow. I was dreading having this report back and it just saying, your soil is terrible. Your plants are going to die. There's no way out of this. You should just give up now. But no, it was rather positive. We should expect some vegetable crops this year. As the weather improved through March and April, I continued to sow more seeds. Some indoors and some like carrots and parsnips straight into the garden. I've heard it's good to do this with vegetables with a long taproot to avoid the roots getting damaged when transplanting. I also checked up on the potatoes that I had put on the windowsill, which were now ready to put in my round potato bed. Quite a lot of people asked me in one of my other gardening videos, why are you growing cheap crops that you can buy from a supermarket for hardly any money at all? Well, the reason is because I'm not really doing this gardening for saving money. I'm doing it to grow my own food and have some fun. And I decided this year to grow crops which I enjoy eating and crops which I eat quite a lot. And potatoes are one of them. Now for the Maris Piper potatoes. My favorite type of potato is a roast potato. There's many ways to use potatoes. They're very versatile in the kitchen and that's why I'm going to be growing them. I sowed these pea seeds into an egg container which did work but you can't pick up the egg container because it's falling apart. So you have to put it on a tray. It's so daunting sitting a whole empty bed at the beginning of the season. But as it slowly fills up I feel more and more content and comfortable with how this year is going to turn out. It looks like we should have some food to eat this year. Of course there's many things that can go wrong along the way. I've got a few pots here with seedlings. I sowed the seeds maybe two or three weeks ago. I've got some chamomile, borage and red and white campion which I think I've heard are all flowers which bees quite like. So I thought I'd create a little flower patch here just behind the pond. Then the bees can come from the hives over there, feed on the flowers, drink some water and I'm going to create a little bee area in the garden. I didn't realise how quickly the garden would fill up with plants and stupidly a few weeks ago I ordered more strawberry plants. If I had known they wouldn't go in the bed then I probably wouldn't have got them but I've got I think 20 or 30. It's just these, I think they call them plugs. They're just the root balls of the strawberry plants and I'm going to pop them on into some containers. I put on my bee suit because there was one angry bee that kept on chasing me. So my plan is to use this as the base and then stack the pots up like that. And there is my finished strawberry tower. Hopefully in a few months we'll have some strawberries. On the 22nd of April I had my first harvest from the garden. Only 38 days after sowing the seeds these radishes were ready to pick. That's incredibly quick. My spring onions are still looking like they're going to take ages. My sweet peas haven't grown at all. Onions are growing but still there's a long time until we harvest them. But radishes, wow I can't believe how quick they are to crop. Not bad for the first crop of garden food. Now if I had done some pre-planting I would have sowed some more radish seeds that were ready to go in the place of these ones. But I'm not very good at thinking ahead. So there's some bare ground now. I'm probably going to sow some more radishes or actually maybe some more spring onions because I eat an awful lot of spring onions. And they will be very beneficial to have once these ones are eaten. I'm happy about that. Radishes are tasty. They're slightly peppery, spicy. That was really juicy. Nice radish harvest. I also started picking leaves from the chard that were perfect for mixing into my lunchtime pasta. Lots of the seeds that I sowed about a month ago are now looking really good. Look at this, we've got corn. I love sweet corn especially when it's barbecued. So I'm really excited about those. And then we've got a couple of different varieties of cherry tomatoes. This spring's weather has been pretty dreadful. But I think the next week it's starting to get a bit better. So I've decided to start hardening these off. Then I'll probably bring them in at night for the next week so they can get used to the weather. Whilst these plants have been loving life in the indoors and under the nice grow light, my plants outdoors don't look so happy. My baby, especially my fig tree that I bought. And its caught unpredictable, the wet flowers started. I could see that it was starting to grow. There were these little figs appearing. And then we had a frost. And they all kind of went black and died. So, I'm unsure whether we're going to get any figs this year. What a fidgle?」 There is actually a leaf starting to appear. Anyway, this fig tree is a long-term project. This fig tree is going to come with me wherever I go, so I can show you the journey of Mr. Fig Tree. The brown turkey. I soon started seeing damage to my pea plants and it was clear that the slugs and snails had been munching on them. Where are you silly little slugs? There's one. Some plants they've really destroyed. There's another slug there. There's none of these great big slugs. That one was hiding under the leaf. Caught in the act. You stupid little snail eating my watermelons. Get off there. Now what do I do? I don't want it to die. I'm going to go for the ultimate lob. Ready to go on the ride of your life. You can see the damage that it's done. Eating away at the leaf. And the more they eat, the less it can photosynthesize. Means the less it grows. All right, I'm going to go to bed. Stupid snails. I'm doing something called earthing up. Where you put earth on top of the potatoes when they grow. Which apparently some people say that you get more potatoes because you create a longer stem where more potatoes can form along. Other people say you don't need to do it. I don't know. I'm trying it out. It's fun. This is the crop which I'm most excited to plant this year. Because sweet corn is my favorite food ever, I think. Especially when it's barbecued. 15, 16, 17. I've got 17 corn plants. These ones are outgrowing their containers that they're in currently. But they seem to have done really well. But I think they're ready to go out. There's some yellowing of the leaves. And I think they're probably running out of food. So we're going to put them in the ground. And you can see all the roots curling up at the end. Corn plants, I believe, are pollinated by wind. So the wind blows the pollen from the male flower onto the female flower. And then the fruit can develop. And I heard it's very important to plant a few of them together to help with this pollination. Another exciting crop. Tomatoes. The reason I'm planting all this stuff today is because it's now middle of May. And we shouldn't get any more frost. And plants like corn and tomatoes, I've heard, can't withstand frost. So these can now go in the ground. Woohoo! Look at the garden. It is full of plants. There is actually no more space to plant anything else. I've already been getting some crops from the charred lettuce and coriander. Soon we'll be able to get the spring onion. And then the carrots and strawberries and parsley. And by the middle of the summer, this whole bed should look really full. Because obviously the plants that I put in are only seedlings. So currently it looks like there's lots of space. But actually once they all grow, it's going to all be taken up. There was no time to relax though, as the weeds were incredibly quick to grow. A bucket full of weeds. A bucket full of weeds. I've just been to the garden center to pick up some more compost. I've realized with gardening, compost is the most expensive thing. I had loads of my own that we've been making in the compost heap down at the bottom of the garden over the past few years. But still I've had to buy in a lot more. And it's kind of scary how expensive this is. But it kind of makes me think in the future making as much as I can is definitely a worthwhile investment of time. I'm going to be doing some container plants for the greenhouse. And I'm going to be growing some rather odd looking fruit. This is a Choyote. I'm going to put this in here. Cucumber. You can see that it needs a new home because it's full up with roots. And the last thing I'm going to plant today is this watermelon. I would have had two plants but the slugs ate this one last night which I'm very annoyed about. These slugs are causing me such a pain. It's fun putting little seedlings into bigger pots because it's like you're giving them a new home. You just know that they're going to have so much more food and so much more space to grow really big and strong. Last year I sowed my cucumbers so early I was harvesting them in late April, early May. Which is crazy because this year it's already mid-May. And this is what my watermelons look like. I can't forget to give it a water. This is especially important for greenhouse plants because it doesn't rain in here. All the water will be water that I've given them. So that's the garden planted up and the greenhouse pots planted up. I've still got a few cucumbers to put into bigger pots in the greenhouse and also some more melons. But the garden is pretty much there now. I just need to wait and be patient and see if any of this stuff actually grows. And I'm excited to see the results. Already there's been some crops which have just failed completely. Like my celeriac and celery. Both of those I couldn't even grow on past seedlings. I'm not sure why they just didn't seem to want to grow. Other things like the onions are looking really good. And the charred corn and tomatoes are also looking promising. And over the next few months we're going to find out how much harvest we can actually get from this. A little garden here. See you next time.
