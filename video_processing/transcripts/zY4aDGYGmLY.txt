 Hello and welcome to becoming a farmer here in Ghana. It's been a long time since we met and today we're going to talk about very important topic, farm profit. Farming is a business and just like any other business you need to know whether you are making profit or you are earning at a loss. But most farmers do not actually do their calculation well to know whether they are making profit or not. I have traveled throughout the country and I have met different farmers. If you look carefully you would get to know that or you would understand that more than 80 percent of our farmers do not know whether they are making profit or they are earning at a loss. I would explain this further so that you would be able to understand. I mean sometimes they only invest but if they are going to do the actual calculation and subtraction they will know that they are not making profit or they are making a little profit. Whatever that you do on the farm you need to pay. Your time has to be paid, your labor has to be paid, your workers must be paid for. So all of these things put together would get you the expenditure. So if you don't put all of these things together and at the end of the day you might not be able to know whether you are making profit or not. But mostly farmers only look at what they bought. I mean for instance they bought this amount of fertilizer, they bought this amount of agrochemicals, they have engaged laborers to do some work for them but they don't also add the overhead cost, they don't add their labor, they don't add their salary, they don't add how much their wife, their children should be paid for the work they have done. And so at the end of the day they don't know exactly how much they have made, how much profit they made from the farm. Today I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna take you through some steps, give you some scenarios of three farmers that I met and these farmers are using different processes or different steps to calculate their profit. Now, farmer A who has a very big farm does not add his labor to the expenditure. He does not also add overhead costs to the expenditure. After harvesting his farm produce, the income he gets, he subtracts it from the expenditure which is the fertilizers, the agrochemicals that he bought. Then he would assume that what is left is the profit. That is what farmer A does. So he doesn't add his labor, the cost, how much he should be paid at the end of the month, at the end of the week or how much he should be paid per hour or per day. He does not add. He does not also add the cost, the overhead cost. When we talk about overhead costs, we are talking about maybe traveling costs. You've, you've, you've, I mean, uh, made some repairs and other stuff. He doesn't add that to the expenditure. And that is what farmer A does. And he assumes that after subtracting the expenditure from the income, whatever that is left is a profit. Farmer B does not also add his labor, his salary to the expenditure or the expense that he makes. He does not add the overhead costs. He does not add the overhead costs to the expenditure. But farmer B keep records or keep tracks of the number of hours he spends on the farm. So at the end of the time. So at the end of the farming season, what he does is that he then subtract his expenditure from the income and get the profit. After getting the profit, farmer B would then divide the profit by the number of hours he spent on the farm. and he would be able to determine how much he's been paid per hour that's what farmer b does and then he would then be able to say okay i have i have paid myself this amount probably maybe 100 cities per hour on the farm so if he had done like 20 hours then he should be getting about 2 000 cities right 2 000 cities or so uh from from from from from from the farm now farmer c actually does everything he asks his labor to the farm to the expenditure he asks the overhead cost to the expenditure he asks um the workers including the children the wife to the expenditure so at the end of the farming season after he's gotten his income after he's sold he has sold the farm produce he would now subtract the expenditure which includes his labor his salary which includes the overhead cost which includes whatever he pays or he paid to the family the wife the children the laborers and other staff and subtract it from the income and then he would now get the profit now the reason why every farmer must do this is because you must know how much you have been you have made from your farm so that you can have savings for your children so that you can have saving for whatever that would happen have happened in future for instance if you fall sick you will need someone to work on your farm and you must pay the person to work on your farm so if you are not able to know exactly how much you are making on the farm so that you will be able to make good savings then you are not actually doing a very good business that is why we have always said that a farmer who does not keep records of his farming activities is actually i mean it would always fail and he would think that he's making profit but at the end of the day he would he's he's actually making nothing from the farm so it is important as a farmer to keep records of all of these things so that you know that i've invested 2000 ghana cities i've gotten my 2000 ghana cities back and this is the profit i've made you either use your profit to reinvest into the business or you save it for your future use for your children for your family for whatever you want to do so farm profit is very important and how you calculate it is very very important too don't just invest and after all you know you've invested 3000 ghana cities and at the end of the season when you get like 5000 ghana cities you are happy because you think that it was only 3000 ghana cities invested but you didn't include so many things you didn't include your labor you didn't include your salary you didn't include um and traveling cost like the overhead cost you did not include all of this so you you you you cannot just say you have made 2000 or 1000 ghana cities profit probably if you include those things you would know that there is more to be done next season thank you so much for watching i'm sure you have learned something from this episode and so if you are a farmer this is what you need adapt to the third farmer pharmacy who keeps records of everything and knows that he has made a certain amount at the end of the season thank you so much i'll be here next week with another episode you
