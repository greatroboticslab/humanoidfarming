Nonprofits & Activism
 My name is Dave Heilman. I am director of farming operations for the Highland Hospitality Group, and we supply restaurants in the Philadelphia area. I have always wanted to be a farmer, so this is my job of a lifetime. And I think if you really think of growing food in the right manner that someone chooses that I want the food that you produce because I trust you, once you get that relationship, that's pretty awesome. The operation here is a fixer-upper. This is a farm-to-table, and so we've been clearing the land and converting the fields from conventional no-till to organic production. This is the first year of our production. As I was looking for the next opportunity in my life, I knew I wanted to do something in agriculture, and I started looking into organic programs, and it was great that there was a college program available in the state of Pennsylvania. The academics for an old guy going back to school, I learned that I could do that, and you actually can dust off the cobwebs and get respectable grades. And the program itself got practical application into equipment, into animals, into crops, into soil. You could get your hands dirty and physically learn about it. The best thing about the program was the summer that we spent at Rodale. There's also a lot of wonderful hands-on through DelVal, the university itself. I'm very grateful to the people at Rodale and DelVal. They fostered my enthusiasm for organics and that there's a lot of opportunity out there in organics.
