 This hydroponic system produced by GNN has been in operation for seven years. Having withstood numerous heavy rains and intense sunlight, it still functions perfectly. The iron frames supporting the system remain free of deformation, and the channels show no signs of bending, proving their sturdiness. Meanwhile, water spinach cultivated in this system thrives remarkably. GNN's hydroponic systems are crafted from high-quality raw materials, ensuring long service life. With rational product designs, they not only enhance crop yields, but also reduce planting costs for farmers. If you need our products, please contact us by email or WhatsApp.
