These are some of the many examples where entrepreneurs with no expertise in the field have succeeded in setting up businesses based on agricultural waste management. So if you want to set up a business that utilizes agricultural byproducts to convert them into high value products, watch this video till the end. So welcome to EnterClimate, my name is Shaleen Verma and in this video we will analyze the opportunities in agricultural waste management business. So agricultural waste consists of post harvest waste from agricultural fields, byproducts from processing of agricultural produce on animal or poultry farms or fertilizers from runoff from fields. We know that large section of India's population is directly or indirectly associated with agriculture. But the lack of knowledge or expertise to utilize this waste profitably means under utilization of its value by our farmers. Traditionally agricultural waste waste has been used to make animal fodder. Some advanced units were using sugarcane to make briquets. But did you know that many innovative small scale and medium scale businesses are present in agricultural waste management? The pharmaceutical sector, nutrition and supplement brands, cosmetic industries and many manufacturing facilities are utilizing the hidden benefits of agricultural waste. So let's analyze this segment a bit more. India produces more than 620 million tons of agricultural waste annually of which only 25 to 30 percent is utilized as livestock fodder or energy production. The rest gets discarded. There are two main waste management approaches for waste management in farming. The first being the disposal of agricultural waste and the other being the recycling of agricultural waste or their byproducts. While the former method has limited business value, the latter is widely used by new startups and existing industries to make biodegradable and eco-friendly products. Agricultural waste management businesses have growth opportunities in an agricultural based economy like ours. For waste processing, these units can turn into full scale manufacturing units producing plant based products that are in high demand in domestic and international markets. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research has taken numerous steps in this regard by prioritizing small and medium scale industries to manage agricultural discards and convert agricultural waste into high value products. ICER also helps in the skill development and training of farmers and entrepreneurs and teaches them the techniques for value addition. They also assist in sourcing of equipment for the farmers. Let's now see some of the areas where innovative technologies are being used to convert this waste into wealth. The use of post-harvest waste from fields, waste from PC culture, horticulture, insect farming etc are also gaining popularity. Let's see some of the such examples. Handmade paper from jute waste, preparation of protein isolates and concentrates from de-oiled cakes, production of enzymes like cellulases by microbial fermentation utilizing groundnut shell, production of biocompost using organic manure, making paper plates from natural fiber biomass, essential oil extraction from crop residues of seed spices, producing calcium, collagen peptides and gelatin from fish waste, producing alcoholic beverages from nutraceutical properties of quinoa peels, isolation of antioxidants, pectins and dietary fibers from mango peels, making porous bricks from crop residue. The list is endless but how can one start this business or what are the requirements? Also which licenses and permits are needed to set up any of these above businesses? Many such questions may still be there. So let me give you an overview of the legalities involved in starting an agricultural waste management business. The business will need no objection certificate of pollution also known as consent from the concerned state pollution control board. Company registration, GST registration and factory licenses are some of the other relevant licenses that also must be obtained. For the above formalities you will need the following documents. The document for ownership of the site, trade license, electricity bill, details of the machinery installed, details of the pollution control devices, Aadhaar card, Pancard, GST certificate, layout plan and process flowchart and any other document mentioned in the application form. Now let's see the process of obtaining authorization as an example to understand the procedure of obtaining all the licenses and permits. You have to apply in form 1 of the solid waste management rules to the respective SPCB. The board will scrutinize your application and an inspection report will be prepared after the inspection of your site. Finally after meeting all the criteria the authority will issue an authorization in form 3. So maybe you want to set up a business or maybe you are already in a similar business.
