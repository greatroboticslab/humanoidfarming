Their innovation, combined with customer feedback, research and development, has led them to become the market leaders in bale feeding equipment. Hustler developed the SL700X bale feeder with cutting edge technology for efficiency and reliability. It's easy to use, designed primarily for feeding out round bales requiring minimal maintenance. Built with Hustler's proven, greasable, self-aligning bearings and protective covers make cleaning easy. The improved chain drive system is bulletproof, with toughest on the market 12,000 pound roller chains. The floor is slippery polyethylene, UV and shock resistant, and it won't corrode. Single lever control provides left or right feed out, and the feed bars. Not only are they the strongest on the market, but to withstand extreme vertical, horizontal and torsional loads. They're also protected from the ground by the chassis beams, eliminating any chance of being damaged. The unique Patenton Total Control Loading System is unparalleled, with just one hydraulic cylinder, providing faster cycle times, quieter operation and there's no need to adjust the hydraulics on your tractor. It also has an adjustable axle for stability, a single post draw bar for manoeuvrability, heavy duty parking jack, along with optional string box, mud guards and a side bar kit, which assists when feeding out square bales.
