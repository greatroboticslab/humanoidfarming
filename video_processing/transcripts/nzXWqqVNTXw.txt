 In a natural environment, sows form tight-knit social groups. They are intelligent and loyal animals who raise their young cooperatively. Young pigs live with their mothers in a close family group for about a year before forming their own social groups. Physical contact is important to pigs, and they often lie close together. Pigs are playful, active, and inquisitive. In an outdoor setting, they forage over several miles, rooting and exploring their environment with their powerful but highly sensitive noses. But in factory farms, pigs are not allowed to engage in basic natural behaviors. A hog industry spokesman stated, quote, forget the pig as an animal. Treat him just like a machine in a factory. Natural treatments like you would lubrication. Breeding season like the first step in an assembly line. And marketing like the delivery of finished goods. Factory farmers can find breeding sows for most of their lives in barren metal crates, which are just two feet wide. They're called gestation crates because the sows are kept there during their pregnancy or gestation period. The crates prevent the sows from exercising in order to save on feed costs and to allow every aspect of the animals' lives to be controlled in order to maximize breeding production efficiency. At the end of their pregnancies, the sows are moved to farrowing crates to give birth. When the piglets are two or three weeks old, they are taken from their mothers and fattened for slaughter. The sows are immediately re-impregnated and returned to gestation crates to begin another four-month gestation period. They live a constant cycle of impregnation, birth, and re-impregnation, with each sow producing more than 20 piglets each year. Breeding pigs imprisoned in crates suffer both physical and psychological disorders. They cannot walk, exercise, or even turn around, and their muscles atrophy. Standing on the hard, slatted floors causes foot and joint disorders. While scraping against the bars of their cages results in open sores. These intelligent animals are prevented from engaging in social behavior or from satisfying their basic needs. And this leads to frustration, chronic stress, and depression. The pigs routinely exhibit neurotic coping behaviors such as repetitive bar biting and chewing the air, which indicate that the animals are in severe discomfort. After several years of this process, the breeding sows productivity drops off, and they are sent to slaughter. Their battered, worn-out bodies are typically ground up and used for low-grade meat products like pepperoni and sausage. In some instances, the sows become so sick and crippled they cannot even walk, and many die before reaching the slaughterhouse every year. Gestation crates are inherently cruel, and they should be banned in the United States, as they are in other countries.
