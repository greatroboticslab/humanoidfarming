Education
 All right, perfect. Welcome, everyone. We're thrilled that you are here to learn more about the AgriScience and Technology Careers Programs, more specifically AgriScience Foundation Certification. I am Dominique Delbar. I am a Product Marketing Manager here at CertiPort. And joining us today, we have Nicole Case, who is a Content Development Manager, and we have Sabrina Beck, who is a Product Manager. So we are thrilled to dive into this new exam to talk a little bit more about how it was developed, why it was developed, and how it will truly prepare learners for rewarding careers in the AgriScience industry. With that being said, I'm going to pass the mic over to Sabrina, who's going to talk to us a little bit more about the certification program, and then we'll dive into more about how the exam was developed. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you, Dominique. So do you have the slides ready to go? Ready? The next ones? Or do I need to share my screen? Sorry. No, perfect. I got it. Excellent. Awesome. Thank you so much. So as Dominique mentioned, this is a new program for CertiPort AgriScience and Technology Careers. This program focuses on the AgriScience cluster within the CTE career cluster. These careers that are in this career cluster are really at the intersection of agriculture and technology. They focus on operation, maintenance, automation, agriculture, engineering, and design, agriculture equipment, and systems. It includes innovative farming methods such as precision urban and vertical farming to increase efficiency, productivity, and sustainability in agriculture. It's also a pre-filtrular economic growth. I don't know if you noticed on the prior slide, but agriculture include, agriculture accounts for 4% of the gross domestic product for the U.S. And in some of the developing countries, that can be as much as 25%. The agriculture markets in the U.S. are slated to grow from 2023 to the end of this year from 81.5 billion to 94.3 billion and have over 115,000 jobs in different fields every year. And if we go to the next slide, taking these into consideration, we wanted to make sure that we could provide a way for job seekers and students to validate that they have the skills related to these different AgriScience fields. Because the industry is responsible for addressing vital concerns necessities in food security and necessities in food security and sustainability. And because of the number of jobs that are available every year, and this is a growing channel, we really wanted to make sure that we validated that learners are ready for these entry-level jobs in food science, soil science, plant science, and sustainable farming technologies. The exam that we have created, AgriScience Foundations, has between 40 and 50 items. It is selected response. It's 50 minutes. And the required score, like all of our exams, are is a weighted 700 out of 1,000 score to earn the certification. So if we go to the next slide. These are, from a high level, these are the objective areas that we focus on with the AgriScience Foundations exam. We focus on health of agriculture systems, using and maintaining proper documents, workplace safety and procedures, animal science, plant science, and food safety. And if we do a little bit of a deeper dive into these objectives, you can see that it's really focusing on understanding the difference with health of agriculture systems, understanding the difference between what is healthy and what is unhealthy, understanding pest management. And also, a big one is using and maintaining documents, making sure that records are complete and accurate, being able to interpret the labels of different pesticides and different ingredients and just different chemicals and different things that are used, understanding weights and measurements and safety data sheets, understanding how to interpret and use those. Workplace safety is also super important. And you can see here that the understanding SOPs, understanding sanitation, and worker protection standards are super important. So, going to the next slide, these are the other three with animal plant science and food safety, being able to understand the different uses of animals, understanding the different species, and understanding basic handling and proper handling procedures of these animals, and also proper care, also understanding the biology of plants and nutrients and their delivery and explaining germination and seeds and all of that, the whole plant life cycle. And then also food safety, understanding the different temperatures, back to microbial growth, different allergens, and understanding food contamination. So, we want to make sure that our candidates are prepared to take the exam and that they have the, we want to provide the best pathway to success on earning their certification. And with that in mind, we have worked with our learning partners to ensure that we do have a courseware that aligns with the objectives of the AgriScience Foundation's certification exam. And that we have a practice test, and that we have a practice test, or sure prep practice test is available on our geometrics platform. And that there are different options as well with LearnKey and Pointe and Pointe and Pointe education, so that we, so that, so that educators who are integrating this new certification into their existing course, can have the tools that they, that they need that are right for their classroom in order to help their students succeed. So, with that, I think we can, I'll hand it back to you, Dominique, and we can chat a little bit more. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you for telling us a little bit more about the exam, and a little bit more about why it was developed. I know that, I mean, developing an exam, or developing the idea of this product just in general, it just, it doesn't happen overnight. When thinking about, Sabrina, the, this pathway forward, that we should proceed to provide an AgriScience certification. What feedback did you take from educators in the industry in the product development? Yeah, so we, when we first started out with the understanding, CTE in general is a huge area, current technology education is a huge area that helps prepare students for, for workforce. And we have traditionally been very technology focused with our programs that we have here. But, we wanted to make sure that we were providing, providing ways for, for students to get an edge on, on the workforce and understanding that everybody wants to go into technology. And in fact, there are so many other areas that are, are growing and are so vital to our, our ecosystem. As a society, we want to make sure that we were in the right areas at the right time. And so, we looked at a whole bunch of different data points. And we looked at the number of courses that are being taught nationally in K-12. The number of head count. We looked at job opportunities and job growth. We looked at earning potential for potential candidates when they have a certification. We looked at the needs that employers have as well in finding qualified workers with the skills that they, the skills that they, they need to fill jobs. And we also talked to educators to understand their needs in the classroom. What things that they, what, what holes currently exist and what different things that they, they need to be successful and really be able to focus on their students' education. And took it all into consideration. And agri-science was one of the, one of the top ones on our list to start with first. And when we finally made that decision and move forward, and I know Nicole will be able to speak to this a lot more on the content development, but. We really do rely on subject matter experts in the field, in agri-science, in various areas, as well as educators to help guide us on what the objective domains should be. And to ensure that we are assessing the right skills, that the questions are assessing the skills in the right way. And, yeah, we, we work hand in hand from right from the very beginning with industry experts, with educators. And to make sure that the exams meet the rigor and provide the validation that students need, that employers need. That's amazing. Yeah, thank you for diving into that. Yeah, really appreciate that. What I love about it is that it really helps provide like a holistic view into what a learner needs in order to be prepared for the job market. And I guess, Nicole, this is a question for you as you are the content manager over this program, making sure that it is testing learners what they need to be tested on. How do you how is this exam going to prepare learners for their jobs in the future? Thanks, I will sort of add to what Sabrina said with regards to how we developed the exam and I'll go through the last one. And I'll go through a little bit of the process. We started this process by gathering subject matter experts and we wanted to make sure that they encompassed a wide range of skills and backgrounds. We ended up with subject matter experts from nine different states from across the entire country, from Arizona, New York, Ohio, and down in Florida and others in between. And the subject matter experts included teachers and FFA ambassadors for H agents and some other industry professionals, as well as along with being teachers. All of our subject matter experts also work in the agricultural industry in some capacity beyond teaching the we had experts in urban farm development seed agronomists. We had experts with experience in large and small scale crop, meat and dairy production and greenhouses, nurseries and also working in laboratories for not just food safety, but all other agricultural science stuff that that goes along with that. And we met with the subject matter experts and we discussed and identified the qualities and skills that the minimally qualified candidates should meet for this exam. For this exam. We looked at various state standards and courses and discuss the skills that potential employers would want someone that has this certification to have. And so we covered the skills, knowledge and abilities that the minimally qualified candidates should be able to demonstrate to get this certification. And while discussing the minimally qualified candidate, we included discussions on potential jobs and what these candidates would be doing and what sort of jobs they would be obtaining that this certification would apply to. And many of the skills that we covered in the objectives relate to. And many of the skills that we covered in the objectives relate to applying knowledge that would be learned in academic programs or through job related experiences. And we wanted to make sure that the employees were confident and knowing candidates who earned the certification can demonstrate those foundational skills. So by applying knowledge that they learned in these courses, rather than just giving us information back, we can tell the employers that our candidates have the foundational skills that they're looking for that are listed in those objectives. Yeah, that's perfect. What I really appreciate about it is that, I mean, it really does showcase to employers that candidates have the skills that they need and it's something that employer can go back, they can check the ODs, they can also see the certificate and have confidence that this employee is ready to work and will require less training and will be ready for success on day one. And I also, what I also really appreciate about that is that it really does help them stand out against competitors when they're applying for jobs, because they can easily prove that hey like I have these skills. And I've proved it through the certification so thank you. So when you're developing an exam what standards or frameworks do you use to ensure that the lines with those industry expectations I know that we kind of talked about those. Oh, these a little bit but just to dive in a little more. Sure. So, for while we were discussing the potential jobs and the can't minimally qualified candidates we did reference the national agricultural food and natural resource standards that many states use for their agriculture course design. We also looked at multiple textbooks, including the Pearson agricultural textbook and our social matter experts that came from all of the different states and included their knowledge of their specific state standards if they don't didn't use the national ones. So we had Ohio that you know subject managers from Ohio that were able to say these, these objectives that we have aligned with our courseware at certain spots. And we also looked at the multiple foundational course outlines from different state programs and pulled information from those to guide us in determining the breadth of knowledge that is needed and how to quantify the skills that these candidates need to demonstrate. And with the wide range of geography and expertise or subject matter experts, we're able to align the content with a lot of these different courses and meet those industry expectations. I, what I really appreciate about that is that there are multiple points of view taken into consideration, because I mean, agriculture in Ohio is not the same as agriculture in California or Florida. So what I appreciate is how you designed it in such a way that it would be applicable to a learner anywhere in the US, and that it will help them build that foundation for them to continue to grow and learn on. So that's, that's really incredible. I know that I mean, especially in agriculture, there's a lot of things that are it's very practical right very hands on. And what do you do to ensure that the questions that are asked in this exam don't only just test conceptual knowledge, but also the practical and real world skills that learners need for success in this industry. So one, one thing to sort of preface my response to this with when we talk about the wide range of the different skills from the different states. We did want to focus on sort of know having the candidates know that regulations exist and know how different industry documents are presented and be able to understand that there are differences and not necessarily know the specific differences. So as you said, there's, you know, between Colorado and Ohio there's going to be different regulations there's going to be different agricultural needs and we wanted to make sure that our questions and our objectives. objectives were broad enough to cover everything that like to make sure that they it covered the concepts of parts of agriculture and understanding that there are different regional differences in each region and understanding that those differences exist. And so we didn't ask specific details about state regulations or regional regulations but knowing that those regulations exist is how we addressed those differences. And regarding the practical real world skills, we know that candidates will gain practical experience through the agriculture courses or through projects like with their FFA and 4-H projects and different counties. different county fairs or through work experience that they have that they've done over the years. And we embedded this knowledge into our exam so they need to have the practical experience in order to correctly answer some of the items on the exam. We use very real world industry documents and detailed images that as assets in the exam. And these items require that candidates find and interpret the information presented informants they would encounter in the real world and then apply their agricultural knowledge to solve the problems. So they aren't just pulling necessarily straight information off of these documents and you know so someone that doesn't have the agricultural knowledge wouldn't necessarily be able to answer the question just by reading it so they're not just being able to read and it's not a reading comprehension they have to apply their agricultural knowledge for that. And if you would like to show what I mean on these I can do that. Yeah, that would be amazing. Let me. Let me. Let me see. Oh, there it is. I have to. I have to. I have to. I have to. Can you see my screen. Not yet. Okay, let me. Oh, I have to pick the other button. Yes, we can now. Okay, do you see. I think it's sharing. Which do you see the agriculture test or do you see a little. Yes, we see the test drive. Perfect. So this is the test, the test drive that can be accessed through the CERTA port website and this shows. This just gives a feel for some of the questions and I'm going to just click through and get to some of these to show. So this is a safety data sheet that they would see. And then as you can see there's there's multiple questions that are asked about this. And then there's pictures as assets that have very specific details that are that they need to look at and apply their knowledge and what they would see. So they it mimics practical experience, but they have to have that experience in order to answer the questions. And then I'll show one more. So these are this again is another label for a pesticide that they would need to look at. And the last one is a maintenance for maintenance recommendations. And again, they have to go through and answer questions about these. So they are getting very real world experiences and we're we are providing those sort of practical experiences in the format that we are able to. So we do expect that the the practical knowledge is is there and we build on that as a foundation. Absolutely. That totally makes sense. I know that it's recommended that I believe one hundred and fifty hours of of preparation is recommended before a learner even attempts to certification exam. And so I I really do appreciate that how the best preparation is to get students in an FFA club or to, yeah, develop that hands on experience. And that hands on experiences will will prep will assist in the preparation for the certification exam. And those who do that will be more likely to pass. So that totally makes sense. And I appreciate you sharing the test drive, too. Yeah, I think there's some awesome examples in there. I know that I mean, as an industry, as in any industry, the standards continue to evolve over time. What is the standard in twenty twenty four? Well, might not be the standard in twenty twenty five or in twenty thirty as it wasn't the standard maybe in twenty fifteen. So my question is, as things continue to change as industries and educational standards evolve, how do we ensure that the exam continues to maintain its rigor and relevance over time? This question is for both Sabrina and Nicole. I can take it first. If you want to tag out onto the end. We can do that. That work. So our general policy is that our goal is to ensure candidates are ready for the workforce and we review the content of all the exams frequently and ensure that the content is relevant and up to date with evolving technology and standards. We maintain communication with our subject matter experts to evaluate any changes in the industry and identify if there are any shifts in the content or course where that no longer aligns with our standards or the industry expectations. And this comes with different emerging technologies. And as things shift over the course of the lifetime of the courses, we evaluate the performance of the exams and individual items frequently as well to ensure fairness and reliability. And we address any performance or bias issues indicated in our data that we get back with internally and with our subject matter experts to revise as necessary and adjust accordingly. So I'll hand it off to Sabrina. Yeah. Just to add on to what Nicole said, we do we do keep our finger basically on the pulse of industry and are always making sure that we're we're following trends to understand improvements in technology or and policies and different things that we may need to address within our exams. And under normal like traditionally, these changes are not quickly evolving, if that makes sense. So usually when we do do our reviews, there are any like major changes and we tend to do objective domain refreshes, as we call them, like to really refine those in just every few years. And and and and and we do make sure that we're we're always in step with our subject matter experts or industry experts to make sure that we are making the changes that that that the industry needs to validate the skills and that we are keeping everything relevant. And but like Nicole said, we are constantly reviewing our exams to make sure that the performance is where we expect it to be, that the items and the exams are performing appropriately. And Nicole's team is awesome about making changes and finessing different things as they come up with the psychometric data and everything else. All the all the different metrics that they they watch those item performance with. And so we have a very rigorous process to ensure that our exams meet the standard and continue to meet the standard and to make sure that we can update the exams in a timely manner to follow industry trend. Yeah, that's perfect. Yeah, that's perfect. And what I appreciate, too, you mentioned you both mentioned how the questions items themselves are frequently reviewed. What I really appreciate about what is done is that when a teacher is taking an exam or students taking an exam and if there's feedback, you can submit that feedback right there and all the feedback is reviewed. So it can continue, like you're saying, stay fair, stay relevant, make sure that the questions that are being asked are thoughtful and meaningful and are doing what we want them to do. So I really appreciate that. And I appreciate you both taking the time today to talk more about this exam, about how it was developed and how it will truly prepare a candidate for the workforce so they can start their entry level job in the agriculture world and agriculture technology. And have a strong foundation as they're continuing to grow within the industry. So thank you both. If anyone has any questions, please feel free to reach out.
