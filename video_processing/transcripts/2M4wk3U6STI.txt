 Hi there, I'm Shameless Trouble and today I'm going to show you how to plant crops close together. Like I have 12 gourds planted next to me. Okay, let's get to it. Okay, let's start by putting out two garden foundations. You don't need to use these, you can just easily use the ground, but I find it's easier to see them on the dirt, so it's easier for purposes of filming this. Now, I want you to put one gourd or whichever item you wanted to plant on this foundation. And this first foundation is going to be where we're planting our crop. And this foundation over here is going to be for the cast-offs. So put one on each one, and then you need to make a blueprint. Hold on, X on this one, and then X on the cast-off one. Okay, and create blueprint. Just create a temporary blueprint. I named mine zero. Okay, now store the cast-off one. And go to our blueprints that we just created. And you can see, see if you're going close, see the one that it's, the one in the middle? That's the one that it thinks is the anchor. So, if you put the anchor on this gourd, it won't let us put it on right here. But, if you move it away, see it can't really tell that that further gourd is associated with it. It thinks it's free and clear, so you can put it there. So, that's how you tell which one is your cast-off. Is, you know, zoom in close and do, spin it around in circles and see which one is the anchor. And then you want to just put them as close as you want them. And store this one. And keep on going until you have as many as you want. If you want, you can make a blueprint of these 12, so you can place it down at any of your camps. But you don't need to. You know how to make them now. Okay, there you have it. That's how you can plant crops close together without having to worry about their build boxes. I hope this video is informative.
