 Music Water is a precious resource. We want to manage effectively the water resource that we have, that we've been given. We have the water that we receive from the sky and we want to supplement that water so that the crop in the field does not have any stress and that it's able to reach its yield potential. Irrigation can be very important. On dry years such as we had in 1988 and 2002, it can increase the yield by 5 to 10 times. On a normal year, we're looking at an increase of a neighborhood of maybe 50% higher to double. Irrigation scheduling is the process of managing and deciding when and how to apply irrigation water to crop fields. It is the process of managing the inputs and outputs of moisture to a field. The first thing that's important is to keep tabs on the weather. The other thing that we need is the texture of your soil, the moisture status of your soil, the amount of moisture that the crop is going to use over a given day for example. You take some soil and feel it with your hand, make an estimate of how much moisture is in that soil and then use that information to decide whether irrigation is required now or in how many days, how much you're going to apply. We'll see you next time. We'll see you next time. Thank you.
