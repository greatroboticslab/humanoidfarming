 Hello and welcome to the Build a Soil YouTube series. This is episode 25. Behind me I have the 10x10 drying tent that you saw in the most recent episodes where we actually hung the plants up. Right now it's been seven days since we hung the plants. They're not done drying, but I want to show you what it looks like. And then I'm going to give you an update on how well this drying setup has been working and also some of the challenges that we've had. So first off, let's go inside there and I'll show you what we're working with. So we're at 52% humidity and it's 66 degrees. I'm going to check the reservoir. Water's good. So come on in. This has got a magnet on it so it sticks to the pole but it wants to fall so I just loosely taped it. You can see my humidity now. The humidity reading that I'm using is from a Niwa. And the Niwa is the same one I used in the other 10x10. And it's reading the humidity right over here. It's pretty consistent in both areas because we've got a decent amount of air movement. And the air conditioner is below it. Now the air conditioner only goes to 62. I'm sure I could mess with that with the remote and or bypass it somehow. But for now that's been good. I've been trying to just... It's been working pretty hard. And normally it's around 65 degrees in here. 66. I just opened the tent. And that's fine. That's close enough for me. I noticed one challenge we're having is that in the morning it's cool. Lately it's been slightly cloudy and rainy and that's raised the humidity up. And what will happen is this will reach 62 degrees and shut off. Well that means that it's not sucking the air out of here. Which means that there's no air evacuating. And although I'm not adding humidity, the humidity's been rising just a little bit in the mornings. So what I do is I click on the exhaust fan that I never took out of here way in the back. And I set it on low. That means no matter how cold it gets in here, I'm always moving a bit of air. To be honest I don't like to move the air out. I'd prefer to keep it all in here but I don't want too high of humidity. That's the weakest link. And so I'm adding it until it gets to 60. But if it goes above 60 and the air is not leaving here, it'll stay stagnant. So besides the 10x10 tent that we're in, which I like to have more space than too little. But it seems to be easy without the equipment to keep it more humid when you have a little space. Right? So consider all those things. With this equipment I can open it up to more space. Challenges is the tent is not insulated. So I knew I'd be running it a lot. But it's in here. Worst case if I was up to 70 degrees it'd be fine. I'm just trying to keep it as close to 60. Here's what equipment I'm using. I've got a fan which is not mounted anywhere. It's on the ground. At that angle is hitting a side of the tent where there are no plants. So it's not directly blowing on a plant. I don't like direct air movement. It dries it out a little bit too fast and it can make it an inferior product. But that is hitting there and it's swirling the air. This air conditioning is blowing this way and it's pretty far over here for the air conditioning to hit. And it's not that strong. Like it really isn't moving the air much. Because once the AC blows in this general area it gets hit by this fan and whipped up into the air. So there's you'll notice there's no plants really moving at all in here. So if you're in a 3x3 tent you can just put a fan on the floor and point it at the back wall. At least the air is moving in there. We're just trying to get that tiny bit of air movement. Mainly so that any moisture that is finally coming out of the plant gets moved away. We don't want it to beat up with any moisture, get stagnant and get any bud rot. So that's what air movement is really for. And then the cold temperature avoids bud rot as well. And the volatile terpenes that would normally, like the most volatile ones. The reason we do fresh frozen, I've mentioned that, is that it really preserves what's on the plant. Typically if you've not been instructed how to dry properly and slow, most people that I know, their first grow, they're blown away at the odors on the plant while it's growing. They are like, this is my new thing. I cannot believe I saw a bud develop. Like I knew what it looked like in the bag, but that's what those hairs are. That's what those leaves are. And you start to just fall in love with it. And then you probably put it in the jar just a little too soon, trying to overlove it, get the nice moisture in there. And then it smelled like hay. And you're like, why can't I get it to smell like it smells while it's growing? Some of those are volatile. And if you just dry too hot, too fast, any of that, the odors are gone. The terpenes are gone. The flavors are gone. Like some of the fiols, some of the gorilla glues. And it's hard to mess them up because they are easier to keep on the herb. But either way, no matter what, if you do this right, everything improves or at least doesn't decline. So the goal is to keep it just like it was on the plant. That takes cold air, air movement, and a humidity right around 60%. I'm fine with this 56 to 60. We're a weekend. So I know I'm probably not going to hold 60 perfect in this type of setup unless it was insulated and maybe in a room. We don't like these, the little packs, the humidity packs you can buy. I don't like them. I like just getting it right. But they sell a 58%, a 62%, I think 59. It depends on which brand. But that's about the agreed upon dryness. Some people like to smoke it a little drier. Some people like a little bit wetter. So in that 57 to 61% range is about where most people keep their herbs. So if you think about that here, obviously, if it can sit in the jar for months on end at this humidity, this is fine. It's not too humid. But the first time you grow, you're like 60%. No way. It's got to be like low humidity. I'm trying to dry, right? We want to slow dry to the exact target level that's going to be in the jar. That's how we preserve it all. That's the secret. You grow, you spend all this time, get this part right. A little air movement, cold temperature, close to 60 degrees if you can. Close to 60% humidity but not above. And right now, what we're going to experience is you get a little bit of crisp on the leaf like this is crispy. Let me get a leaf near my microphone here. You can hear it. It's crispy. It falls apart. And if you're brand new, you might be like, oh my god, it's dry. What do I do? I'm going to cut this off. It feels like you could smoke it almost. It really does. But it's tricking you. There's moisture in the middle of the bud. And there's moisture inside the stalk. And when you put it in the jar, nature finds balance. And it'll even out across all the herb. And it'll get moister than you thought it was. And that's when everything goes downhill. So we're going to wait longer. And we know that the stem is just all wet right now. It is not snapping. There's no stem snap. So, oh god, that smells good. I broke my own rule too. That one that had bud rot that I talked about. I got in there, took the tops off. And none of the other part of the plant had it. And so I think the moms were transpiring right onto those top heavy buds. And so I inspected it really thoroughly. And I decided to keep it. So if one of you calls me out asking which one that was. Just trying to be transparent about everything that we do. Oh man, that's the autoflower. It smells really good. All of them are going to be similar. So you can see we're not getting a snap right now. We're getting just a bend. Okay. Over the next week, some of these smaller plants might start to snap. It may not take all of 14 days. Because I'm able to hold humidity, I'll probably just leave it here. In fact, you'll know growers that are really good that literally leave it in their perfect dry environment until they're ready to trim it. It's literally like it's in a jar in here if it's the right temperature and humidity. I feel like the longer it's left undone, the more opportunity for problems. So I like to get it in the jar. That's a much safer place. And so we will be planning on trimming this soon. Next week, as we get closer to the 14-day mark, I'll be potentially taking some of the smaller plants and putting them in tubs in the same environment to really slow it down and see if they're really ready to be trimmed on. But this is kind of nice. There's so much space. We may just grab them right from here and go to the trim room like last time. I'm not positive when the trim day is going to be or how we're going to do it, but I need to get it all done soon. I'm leaving town in a couple of weeks. These are going to be ready in a week. So the window of opportunity is closing and I want to make sure this is all jarred up. So in the coming episodes, we will show you the final dry and we'll discuss trimming. We'll just finish it up with a full smoke report, which will take a few more weeks after that. But we always follow through. We always give you all the data and I want to make sure that you know that's coming. This humidifier, this is a commercial humidifier and it's got a water line and that water line is in a reservoir outside there. It's a brute trash can and I fill it up with reverse osmosis water. The reason I use reverse osmosis water is I want to make sure there's zero parts per million because when I put it in as a mist into the air, it'll get on anything that's in the room. So be sure if you're going to use something like this, reverse osmosis water or really the cleanest water you can get, you'll probably be safe. Now, if this was winter and I did not have the AC moving the air out of the tent because it blows hotter out and blows cold air in, the little tiny humidifier would keep this whole tent humid. I would not need a commercial one. But it's summer. My desire to keep it cold overweighed my ability to keep it simple. So I got an air conditioner. I'm stoked I did. Hooked up the commercial humidifier. And my logic to me was I'm about to buy one of these anyways for this tent because we're going to grow veggies in here and I'm going to show everyone how for our veggie series. And I thought, well, if I'm about to buy it anyways, I might as well put a new clean one in here for the dry room. So that's what I did. And then we had an exhaust fan all the way over here and it's just up in the top and normally I have an exhaust on the top because that's where the hot air rises. And that exhaust was actually in here while we were running all of the seed germination that we did. Which if you saw those episodes, we had the racks in here. We started all the seeds. We had that as the exhaust. So when all the lights were on, if it got too hot, we could exhaust the air. Well, I left that. There was no reason to detach it. I'm probably still going to use it. And what that enables me to do is when I'm getting a reading that it's too humid, I can go over there and just click the fan on low. And since, according to the Niwa, that only happens first thing in the morning, I'm here when it happens. I just click the fan on. If I wasn't going to be around, I would probably just leave the fan on the whole time and let the humidifier keep up with it. But I don't want that taking my fresh cold air out, right? So I just turn it off. That way I'm not paying extra electricity to fight against myself. All these are little things that you'll learn when you set up your dry room and you do it. It's common sense. Once you know the fundamental basics, once you know the target rule, use everything you have. Like if I didn't have this and I was really worried, I would get ice water, like ice ice water in a clean swamp cooler type thing. Or I mean, literally anything that I could think of to get the humidity up and the temperature down is fair game if it's your herb and you have the time to do it. Just avoid things that can ruin it if you're not around. I've had a humidifier go crazy and the exhaust didn't work and it humidified all the herb before and I saved it. But think of those things. Keep it cold. I think this is really going to work well. I'm pretty excited. I can't wait to do all the homework for the smoke report. Let's go in the other tent. I want to show you there's one plant that's not in here and I said I was going to leave it longer because I wasn't scared to cut it at some point and bring it in here. But I'm probably going to have to cut it next week because I'm leaving in a couple of weeks. I want to bring some of that herb with me. So let's go take a look at it. I want to keep it cold in here and I want to keep the humidity accurate so I'm going to close this back up. Now mind you it's a mess we just harvested but I show you how it is. It's so beautiful. I just love the mountain trap cookies. Oh it smells good. This one's a lot more tropical than the last one that I had. I like the last one because it was really like more fuel-y I guess I would say but this has this tropical-ness to it that I'm pretty excited about. Almost reminds me of like forbidden fruit or something. In any case, you can see that it's not really fading because it's a small plant and had plenty of nutrition but it is starting to crisp up and it is starting it turned totally purple like it completely changed color in here. We're starting to get some lower fade. This is the type of fade that I would start to see lighter colors and stuff on so I'm going to let it go as long as I can reminding myself that it's got to be dry in time for me. I may just let it go and tend to it when I get back but I kind of want to bring some. It's the one plant I wanted to go longer so I just wanted to show you what it looked like and to me it's worth it because it's finishing and ripening on time. If you remember why this one is flipped to 1212 from seed and so it didn't go into flower even though we were in flower for another week or two and so I'm giving it its final time to finish just like the rest. That's really what I wanted to show you today. We did the bonsai moms but not a lot has changed. There's nothing to show you today. We will update you and the air conditioner is blowing hot air right out here. In your bedroom that might be a problem, right? You might want to go in out the window but in a big warehouse like this with all the air moving we just do it right out in the open. We got the back door open and that's our setup. I hope you've enjoyed seeing it. I think it's really cool that we can do this right here in our business. People come in. I was able to share some NL5 today with somebody who has an older head and wanted to really take a whiff and see what it looked like and I just feel so grateful to be able to do this. Grateful to be able to have the YouTube series and share some of my passion with you as I never ever thought this is what I'd be doing with my life when I was younger and I got to say it's really cool. So thank you. Thank you for following along. Ask some questions if you got them. I know we covered a lot of ground on drying but I don't want you to skip over this. If you've watched the whole series this is the most important part. Like you got to get it dried right not going to be the same if you skip this part. So anyways until then I'll see you guys on the next episode. Same one. Dark Nights Share Share Share Share Share Rely received Will Curve Section Give Someone
