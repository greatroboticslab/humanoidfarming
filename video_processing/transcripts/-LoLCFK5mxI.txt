 Let's see what's ready to harvest in the garden today. All ruffles actually start as original flavor when they bud, and then as they mature, that's when you can start to see the different varietals, and this guy is definitely matured and ready to go. Once you see these sprouts, that is when you know your kettle chips are ready for harvesting. I let that grow so long it grew into party size. My goldfish fountain is producing fruit. Now, if hydroponics are new to you, it's actually a simple process. I just scoop out the goldfish with this mason jar here. Now, the next step you want to do after you fish them out is drain all that liquid and hang them to dry, but I've got to try one fresh out of the fountain. Mmm, so good. I only planted one Pringle seed, and look at all of these varietals that sprouted up. I guess it's true what they say. Once they pop, they don't stop. I am so excited to enjoy this bountiful harvest.
