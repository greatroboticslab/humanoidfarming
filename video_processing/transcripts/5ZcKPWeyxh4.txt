 I've heard this said many times that, you know, you can go buy a chunk of farm ground three counties away easy, but you can't buy one across the road. And that's so true because there is politics like you would believe in every community. And it is it's what's hard to buy a farm, but it's hard to find a farm for sale to buy. And I've heard that said many times, guys farm quite a ways away from their home. And when you ask them about it, it's like it's the only place that we could expand because we couldn't buy any ground around here. And I mean, that's just the that's just the nature of the beast.
