Howto & Style
 Last fall I over seeded my lawn by pre-germinating my grass seed. I was able to get germination within six days and this is the process of how I did that. First get a five gallon bucket and a paint strainer, then go ahead and fill that bucket up with your seed and then fill it up with water. As you can see the seed is buoyant so you're going to need something heavy to hold that down. I submerged my Kentucky Bluegrass seed for a total of seven days, switching out the water twice per day. The duration at which you soak your seed is going to be dependent upon your seed type. Check how long it will take on the bag of seed for your seed to germinate and multiply that number by one third and that will give you how long you need to soak your seed. Next you want to get an organic material to act as a binder with your seed. Mix the seed in with your binder. Then you are ready to go ahead and start spreading that out on the lawn.
