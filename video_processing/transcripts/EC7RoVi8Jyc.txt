 There are three keys to centropic farming. The first is pruning. This is done strategically to stimulate growth, create biomass for fertilizer, and maintain the balance of the system. The second is to cover the soil with organic matter. Leaves, sticks, logs. This feeds the soil and protects it from the sun and weeds. And the third is to plant intelligent consortiums. In this row, we planted a banana tree for biomass and fruit. Then next to it, we planted what's called a nest, which here included cacao and tomato. This seems like an odd pairing since cacao needs shade and tomatoes need sun, but tomatoes grow quickly and will complete its life cycle before the banana tree we planted next to it emerges. The cacao tree grows much slower than the tomato and will be shaded by the banana tree once it's mature.
