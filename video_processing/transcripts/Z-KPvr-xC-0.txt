 Drug addiction is a disease and staying sober is not an easy thing to do, but one farm in Texas is growing hope from the ground up. Here's Joe Bipaniker. To find the core, you must first get through the layers. There he is, guys, and that is no easy road. Four years ago, that's where the conversation first kind of started. Brandon Gwynne left teaching to build this place with his son. I knew nothing about farming. Just outside Austin on 10 acres. It was our journey together and our vision to build something different. Different because this is the farm where not just crops grow. We are planting hope, really. People do too. We're kind of layers kind of peeling back to get to that core. Ranch House Recovery is a drug treatment center and the people who work here. I've been in recovery for about two years now. Are also working on themselves. Family basically washed their hands of me. Words can't really explain the amount of gratitude I have for this place. She sees her boy again. Like she's got her son back. This is the place Brandon built with his son. Oh, this is a good one. For his son, Dylan. That underlying drive behind what I was doing was, this is going to keep my son sober. But it came at a price. His other children, his family, his friends. They lost my attention and love and support for a good while. Knowing that later, I mean, that, you know. Time he cannot get back. You know, it breaks my heart to this day to know that they suffered because of it. But Dylan was two years sober from heroin and two weeks from the start of the farm. He helped build. Here we are opening our doors. Then and the reality of the disease. It just like a gut punch. Dylan had relapsed. Jim Doster knows all too well about relapses. Alcohol was my poison. He came from Connecticut. The onions he's planting, they'll sell to restaurants for scholarships for men who cannot afford to be here. Giving the right care and the right space and the right nurturing. Just what Troy needs. And then we set these inside. He came from Colorado. It's almost like the growth of my recovery in this, the vegetables that we grow here. There he is. They all know true sobriety is a journey. And for Dylan, this is the next stop. Good to see you, man. We got a welcoming party here for you, man. I can see that. After time away at a treatment center out of state. What's up, buddy? Welcome back, buddy. He's back home. What's up, man? Glad you're here. This was really where my heart was. I felt like I had let a lot of people down. I couldn't let go of the fact that I had, like, hurt all these people that cared about me. They'll tell you non-addicts will never understand. The shame, the regret, the feeling of not being in control. Oh, yeah. They're all feisty. This place is about growing from the ground up. Literally. And if there weren't enough layers. And that way we can grow year-round. There is one more. This place, in a way, basically started out of his codependency towards me. My addiction to fixing my son was as strong or stronger than his addiction to drugs. The former teacher. This is their farm. This is our farm. It's his own lesson. We convince ourselves that our families don't care about us. And that's so far from the truth. They just don't know how sometimes to help us. Father and son are reunited. There is no magic wand. No one answer. That dream is now, you know, in action. I can't tell you how happy I'm to have my boy back and to get to continue on this journey. And that journey. I'm still on it and I'm still learning each day. Starts... With the layers. It was our journey together and our vision to build something different. In Elgin, Texas, I'm Joden Paniker.
