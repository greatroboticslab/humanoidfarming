Science & Technology
 This is my aquaponic ecosystem aquarium, and not only does it look beautiful, it also produces fresh herbs and produce for me to enjoy. And today, I'm going to show you how it works. It all starts in the aquarium. There are so many critters in here, not only the beautiful fish, but also tons of shrimp, snails, and micro-animals. And because most of the fish are genetically modified, it looks even cooler when you turn on a blacklight. As they live and eat, they produce nitrates which are toxic to them, but are nutrients for the plants. The water from the tank is then pumped up and out of the tank and is split into the six growing areas. These crop plants do a lot of the work removing excess nutrients from the water to keep it clean, though you can see that a lot of this is just starting to sprout as the system is still very new. From the grow beds, the water drains down into the sump, and while this could have just been a reservoir, I decided instead to make it a second aquarium and fill it with a dozen different varieties of colorful neocaridina shrimp. And then from there, the water is pumped back into the main tank to complete the cycle. There's a lot more to talk about with this system, like how I'm using it to breed more fish and shrimp, so be sure to follow for part two.
