Howto & Style
 Y'all, Vigo Gardens sent me their new modern metal garden bed. So easy to assemble, but first we're going to put down that chicken wire for the critters. Then I like to recycle the cardboard and fill it with rich organic matter that will feed my wonderful plants and help them to thrive. This sleek metal bed is 17 inches high, 27 inches wide, 83 inches long. Perfect for my salsa garden of tomatoes, marigolds, jalapenos, cilantro, and yes, onions.
