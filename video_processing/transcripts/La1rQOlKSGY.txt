 When using a drip irrigation system, should I irrigate every day? The short answer is not always. To begin with, when using a drip irrigation system, the plant receives the exact amount of water it requires each time. So intervals will be shorter between irrigation events compared to other methods of irrigation. The irrigation interval is determined by three parameters. The soil's capacity to hold water. The heavier the soil, the longer the interval between the irrigation events will be. The crop requirements for each growth stage. A young plant will require a higher frequency of irrigation, or in other words, a shorter interval between irrigation events. Climate conditions. When we face a heat wave, we need to irrigate more and increase frequency, or in other words, shorten the interval between irrigation events. Different combinations of these three parameters will require different irrigation intervals. For example, in heavy soil with mature plants, in moderate weather, irrigation intervals can be up to three to four days. While in sandy soil with recently planted crop under hot weather, you might need to irrigate every day or even in some extremes several times a day. So here's the key takeout. When using a drip irrigation system, your irrigation regime will change according to the soil's water holding capacity, crop growth stage, and climate conditions. Having the data on each of these parameters and understanding their effect will help you to adjust the intervals and provide the optimal conditions to ensure your crop success.
