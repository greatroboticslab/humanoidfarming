 Hi, my name is Anna Maasfeller. I have been a PhD student in the Junior Research Group of Fugustorm and CP6 since December last year. With my passion for behavioral economics, I investigate Pharma's decision-making concerning the adoption of existing and new technologies. Once we know which and how factors influence Pharma's decisions, we can derive clear policy recommendations that lead to cost and environmentally efficient policies. As Western agricultural production has been identified as one of the main drivers for environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, effective policies are needed. One way to decrease the negative impacts of farming on the environment is to reduce the use of pesticides. As for example sugar beet production is highly herbicide intensive and farmers are already facing legal restrictions in the use of chemical inputs, alternatives to control the weeds must be found. Therefore, I will focus on my research on mechanical weeding in sugar beets as an alternative to chemical weeding. In the third study, I want to use an existing data set from a survey of the Institute for Sugar Beet Research to find out about Pharma's motivation to use mechanical weeding. In the second step, I will conduct an online study with German sugar beet farmers to elicit how the socio-spatial network affects the adoption decision by the use of an interactive map. The results can then be used to derive implications for the implementation and use of new technologies such as weeding robots. in the next step, it is widespread ready to listen and find out A
