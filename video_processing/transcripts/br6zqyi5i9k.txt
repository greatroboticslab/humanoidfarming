Sovereign Metals has released results from its 2025 conservation farming program at the Kaseya Ruta Graphite Project in Malawi. Launched in 2024, the initiative is part of the company's commitment to support local communities and help small-scale farmers improve crop yields, protect their soil and strengthen food security. This year, the program expanded to 350 farmers, half of whom are women, and the results stood out. Farmers who completed harvests reported yields four times higher than conventional methods. Sovereign Metals' managing director and CEO Frank Eager said by restoring soil health and significantly improving yields, the program promotes lasting self-reliance for local communities in Malawi and reflects our broader commitment to sustainable development and responsible investment in Malawi's future.
