Howto & Style
 Do you get good yields? Are you satisfied with what you earn? Increase harvest and have better earnings through following the Atlas Fertilizer package of technology for corn. Proper management and technology produces healthier corn crops and a bountiful harvest. Land preparation would take two to three weeks depending on the availability of water. This can be done as early as right after harvesting or for rainfed, even after a single rainfall. Plow the land deep using a tractor or a carabal attached with the plow to turn over soil and bury weeds as well as the remains of the previous crops, allowing these materials to be incorporated into the soil and to be decomposed. The next step is to harrow the fields twice at one to two week intervals. This allows for the decomposition of weeds and stubbles. This is done to smoothen the soil surface. Once a finer texture is achieved, the field is almost ready for planting. Then make furrows at 75 cm spacing between rows. After furrowing, fertilizers can be applied as basal. Applying fertilizer at basal stage or before planting would help in the early stage of the corn plant. This provides the nutrients needed by corn during the early stage of growth. However, application of fertilizer can also be done at 7 to 10 days after planting or once seeds have germinated. Late application of fertilizers will slow down the growth of the corn and the yield may decrease due to the lack of nutrients. For hybrid variety, plant one seed per hill or two seeds per hill for open pollinated varieties . Seeds should be spaced at 25 cm apart then covered with soil. Controlling weeds can be done as needed simply by spraying herbicide into the field. This can be controlled either before they germinate by applying pre-emergence herbicide or after they germinate on the field by applying post-emergence herbicide. Side dress is needed before tasseling stage. This is done about 25 to 30 days after planting. Apply fertilizer 5 cm away from the base of the corn plant. As much as possible, cover the fertilizer with soil. It lists fertilizers top dress 17-017, provides nitrogen and potassium, plus sulfur, calcium and chlorine. It can strengthen the corn plant's resistance to pests, diseases and enable the plant to survive unfavorable weather. Applying side dress too early or too late can result to a reduced harvest. Pests and diseases can be prevented by monitoring the fields regularly. Monitor monitoring is important for early detection of pests and diseases to avoid crop damage and eventually yield. At the instance of a pest and disease occurrence, consult an agronomist on how to address the problem. Corn is physiologically mature and is ready for harvest when a black layer at the base of the kernel has formed. This can be determined by detaching randomly a few corn kernels from cobs and checking for a formed black layer. If majority of the detached kernels have the layer, it is ready for harvest. Corn crop is ready for harvest at about 55 to 65 days after silking. Harvesting the crop on time is very vital to maximize produce and its quality. Seeds harvested too early will have low quality grains due to higher moisture content. If crops are harvested late, seeds might also germinate even if these are still attached to the plant. Observe the correct package of technology to get the most out of harvests and minimize loss. Bigger produce also generates a larger income, leading to a better farmer's life.
