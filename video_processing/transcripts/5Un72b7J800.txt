 Hey everybody welcome to my channel. Today I'm going to show you how to grow vegetable indoors and have beautiful harvests like this. These are just a few nice leaves that I just harvested from my indoor plants. So the video may be a little long because I'm gonna give you all the details to help you through the process but I will provide links to each section so that if you want to skip directly to a certain section you can you can just check the the playlist in the description and go directly to that so you don't have to listen to the long video. I have done the videos many times before I'll link you to the previous videos if you want to see it but we're going to revisit because now is the best time to learn how to grow things indoor with so many things happening in the world. So I'm gonna show you how to do it using very simple things that you can find easily. I'm trying to make it as easy as possible. The things that I'm gonna list are things that you can find at your local Home Depot or Lowe's or you can even find them online. You can also make your own stuff if you need and it's pretty easy to do but here they are. What we're going to use is drinking cups right here. I recycle this and as you can see I've used it many times already so don't throw these away and you can reuse them. You can also use solo cups and as you can see I've used it many many times before and what you can do is just use your scissor and you see here just cut some slits just two one one on each side and this would allow excess water to just drain out if you accidentally water too much and this is also acting as the a place where the roots will come out because we're going to feed it from the bottom eventually so that is what it is and for this you're going to do the same thing you can just poke holes use a scissor and just poke these holes in there you can cut the side exactly the same if you like but these holes will work just fine okay and also because I have these containers that I bought from Amazon they're really really inexpensive and I bought like a whole box full of this I think they're like 50 of these containers and I gave a bunch of it away and four of these containers can fit into a 10 by 10 10 inches by 10 inches tray and because we're growing this indoor you're going to have to get a light setup some kind of artificial light so what I recommend is some LED lights you can get them very inexpensive if you don't know a source I can recommend one for you I will post the link to Brad's channel he's the owner of hidden harvest company and I've been using his lights for a while and they work really well so let me show you some of the lights set up that he has okay and this is one of the lights set up a very simple light very compact unit and you can actually set up a DIY post to hold these up and all you need is just something to hang it above your plants and you see it'll just go above your plants and the plants will grow right here or you can use a grow tent like me and let me show you the grow tent okay here is my grow tent and grow tent have gotten really cheap these days you can get something similar to this for like under a hundred dollars and then that's also a light setup by hidden harvest company I grew a bunch of stuff and I moved them out and now I have extra room so that's why we're growing these lettuce so I wanted to show you all that first before we go into growing the lettuce because that's what you really need okay so back to starting your seeds we're gonna do that first so these are the containers we're gonna use so we'll put them aside for now I'm going to start seeds in two different cups because I'm gonna grow two different varieties the first one is going to be romaine and the other one is going to be the red lettuce so let me show you what they look like outside so that you can see how beautiful the plants are and then you can continue with the video all right guys here is the romaine and that's how beautiful it will look if you grow them in your garden and these are just arugula and if you want to grow them like this you can watch my video on how to collect seeds for romaine arugula or any other lettuce and then you can grow them like this but here's a beautiful romaine right here and let me show you the red lettuce okay here is another romaine next to the red lettuce right there so beautiful they are these are great nice and easy to grow they taste great as well okay so for those that don't want to see the long introduction of all the items that may take a while and you're impatient I'm gonna put a timeline below so you can skip directly through and get to the part that you want to watch so let's go ahead and begin with the starting our seeds of course you're going to need seeds and these are seeds that I harvested in the previous season so this is these are romaine and this huge bag here are the red lettuce okay and because you've grown this indoor it's very important to get the correct type of soil because if you get the wrong type of soil then you could potentially have fungus gnats flying around in your tent so what I found was these here and these are the pro mix compressed potting mix right here and these don't have any fungus gnats in them but sometimes I have I put this in my garage and then I usually open my garage and fungus gnats do get in anyway so that's okay because it's in the garage so they're not as annoying but if you're grown in your you know wherever your living spaces and the gnats are there it could be very very annoying okay so let's go ahead and add some seeds so we'll take our container we're gonna fill this up okay so we have the soil ready now we're gonna apply the seeds to the top so we'll take some seeds here and you can just pull out these these fuzzy looking thing here just pull them out and then just squeeze them in your hand you see see those seeds so this is the romaine lettuce seeds and as you can see just one of those fuzz is a contain all of these seeds here so we're gonna try to space them out that way because this is just a container to start seed we're gonna transplant them to another container so there are the seeds on top you can see you can just pat them down a little bit then we just put another little thin layer of soil on top and now we're going to add water make sure it's nice and moist so that the seeds can make contact with the water so they can sprout all right so once you add some water then we're going to take a bag and we're going to place it on top just like that and then you put it basically anywhere you put it by the window you can put in your grow tent see seeds don't need light to grow but as soon as they sprout you must provide them light or else they become leggy and that those are not good to to plant because it'll be a challenge the plant will fall over and all that stuff so make sure you give them plenty of light enough so that they don't become thin and leggy so I'm going to put it into my grow tent and I'll show you where they go okay guys here is where the plants are going to stay so there it is make sure you put a label on them and they should sprout in around three to five days all right guys it has been seven days now and my seedlings have sprouted so the romaine was a little bit slower than the red lettuce but um they're good enough to be transplanted now and you may be wondering why I didn't start seeds directly in these pots you could if you want to the reason I did this was because I need these plants for other purposes so that is why so a lot of people may wonder and make comments there is a reason why I did this but you can start seeds directly in there if you want to so what we're going to do now is we're going to take the seedlings out and then we're going to put it into these containers here I'm going to grow two red lettuce and two romaine and then another romaine so for the red lettuce we're just going to dig them out just use any utensil you have just dig straight down because at this stage the root point right down straight so it's easy to remove okay so there it is and then we're going to put it in to this container just make a nice hold and fit them in push them down a little bit and then give them some water and then make sure the the soil has nice moisture and it's not running wet if they are running wet and your soil has good drainage it'll drain through to the bottom and then the tray will catch it so you you want to use good soil with good drainage all right guys so here is where the lettuce are gonna go it's gonna sit right next to my solar power hydroponic so there it is right there it has a tray down here to catch the excess water to keep my tent nice and clean so I have five plants going on right now you can do as many as you like here is a look at the tent it is a four by two by five that's five feet high and this is uh the light by hidden harvest company so I will post you all the links so you can check them out there it is we will be back soon once they grow and I will give you guys an update all right today is day number 13 and look at my plants they are looking beautiful I've added a few this is spinach right here and uh bok choy uh that one is uh I think those are um salad bowl lettuce and then the red lettuce is over there and then those two in the back and this one are romaine so in 13 days they are looking beautiful and growing nicely so um make sure to check the uh soil um condition because if it's dry like here you see sometimes it's dry at the top but at the bottom it's still pretty nice and moist so you don't have to water but uh if it is dry just get a spray bottle and then give it some water all right guys it has been exactly 23 days now and the plants are looking beautiful except for these over here so uh those red letters are not doing very well because I forgot to water these plants for a while and then a few days ago I had a baby so I left to go to the hospital and I didn't water the plants before that and then I stayed in the hospital for a few days so um when I got back these plants were pretty dried so I think this one was dead because uh it was just too dried I was able to save that one but it didn't do much it it just didn't grow I think that the roots were damaged but the rest did just fine and uh this is bok choy here salad bowl lettuce is doing awesome romaine back there and here's another romaine and then I have some spinach and you may be wondering why these here are growing so much faster than those and that is because uh for these here I separated them I grow them in cups as you can see they're double cups and I've been feeding them hydroponic nutrients to the bottom and when you do that when you feed nutrients directly to the roots it's like feeding candy to a baby they love it and they just soak up the water and grow like crazy so that is the difference so here I haven't been feeding them anything here I have been feeding them hydroponic nutrients so um that is the difference you can do that if you like so I will show you the process so if you want to boost the growth of your plants um you can do that so let's go ahead and and show you what what I did here this is a one and a half liter of water the aero garden liquid um plant food here and I will list where you can get this they're very easy to come by and these things will last for a very long time so you don't have to buy the big jug like here you can get a smaller one okay so for that we're going to use a medicine dropper here this is a three milliliter so I'm going to take just three milliliter and I'm going to put it into 1.5 liter bottle and then you just shake it up okay and if you don't want to use that type of nutrients you can also use these here that you can buy uh locally at your garden center or your home depot or lowe's anything like that these are very inexpensive um they I think they're under five dollars and then sometimes during the winter time when there's clearance these are like a few bucks so I usually buy them in the winter time and for this what I usually do is I use one uh let's see what they say here tablespoon so they they tell you a tablespoon um you can go a little less if you like but one tablespoon per gallon of water just mix it up and then feed the plants the same way okay so here is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take my plants here and I'll just lift the cup and as you can see there are roots all over the bottom you see and you want to give it so there's a line down there at the bottom the the first line uh I put a pebble in there so that I know um where I should fill so there's a pebble in there so I just feel above the pebble that's it you see just just a little bit just enough so that it would drink it up uh every day and then you put it back and then the next day you do it again and these plants would just soak up the the nutrients down there and it'll grow like like crazy now same thing with this you just see look at all the look at the roots and that's what happened when you feed uh the plants directly to the roots they will put out more roots to try to get the nutrients in and so there you go and so that is what I did to feed these two plants and to get them to grow so fast and um you see how clean they are I mean you can do like four of these or five of these or however many uh you have space for and then you have a ton of lettuce you can actually harvest right now just cut a few leaves and then they'll just keep growing back and same with those as well you can start harvesting this here and then they'll grow back so um whichever method you decide to go with it they still work the same all right guys today is day number 28 and the plants are doing really nice today we are going to harvest some leaves to make some salad so let's go ahead and cut some of these off you may notice that I have a bunch more plants than I initially had because I added a few I brought that hydro unit inside and out often because uh anytime it rains I have to to move it so this is a good spot for them because the light is strong enough you see that if you put it close enough it'll generate bubbles but anyway just this is for the lettuce plants so we are going to harvest this romaine some spinach and look at this beautiful salad bowl man it is growing so much faster than the rest and then the romaine back there those are the ones that uh probably lacked water when I neglected them so they grew a little bit slower than the rest but uh I fixed the problem so they should be doing well and I actually saved that one there the other one is dead so I took it out and I added some perpetual spinach if you have not grown perpetual spinach they love heat and they grow really well they look like swiss chard but they taste very similar to spinach so I added a few and these are going to be great plants to grow inside in the warm condition so let's go ahead and cut some of these and then allow them to grow back and then we'll cut again at a later time okay when you harvest lettuce you want to cut just the leaves that you need to use and then allow them to grow back because if you cut the entire plant then that is it so just cut what you need look at this beautiful leaves here and then for the romaine okay guys this is how much we harvested from these plants so far for 28 days that is not bad at all so I have romaine salad bowl and some spinach this is going to be a nice salad for lunch or dinner very low maintenance not much that I've done with the the soil plants for the hydro I just added a bit of nutrients every single day so here is what they look like I've added some radish some beets and some more radish here's the spinach that we cut off and perpetual spinach that is going to grow later this is the romaine in the hydro salad bowl there's really not much left of that the red lettuce this one is making a comeback those two romaine I also cut off so um that's what's happening in 28 days they should grow back very soon so I will come back and show you another harvest very soon all right guys it has been six days now since we harvested the plants and now we can come back and harvest again so today I'm going to end the video but before we go I'm going to summarize what we've done also I want to give you guys a few tips to make things a little bit easier when you do this on your own so uh the first thing is um uh as I mentioned sometimes when you grow plants indoor you may struggle with fungus gnats and uh to reduce the chances of getting those gnats inside your grow room is to use a soil that um potentially doesn't have any so like if you go to the big box store like home depot and stuff like that buy the bags that are stored inside they call a seed starting mix and they usually store those inside the stores and so those usually don't have any of those fungus gnats if you see the bags laying on the floor outside you know they usually have holes and stuff like that then those will have gnats in them uh also um fungus gnats usually uh lay their eggs uh in the top layer of the soil so if the top two inches of the soil is dry then they can't get in and doing do anything and multiply so um initially in the beginning that may be tough because you have to water from top in order for the the young roots to get enough moisture to grow but eventually once they get old enough the roots are all going to be way down here and from that point on you can bottom water so that when you uh when the water soaked up into the soil it goes to around somewhere here and then the top is like bone dry and that will deter deter fungus gnats for multiplying as well so i'm going to show you um the process that i used to water these plants now that they are really really big look at this the red lettuce actually made it back after a long time since everything else is already big and being harvested i was able to save the plant just one the other one's dead so i removed it and put perpetual spinach and believe it or not guys these here are started at the same time and i took these guys from here and they were actually right here so i dug them out and placed them there and the reason this one grew so fast was because it's in this little container here and then once i see roots to the bottom i fed the roots directly and so that's why it is so big compared to those so feeding plants directly to the roots will increase their growth a little or maybe a lot but anyway let me show you the the watering process um bottom feeding so as you can see i have this tray here um this is a 10 by 20 and a 10 by 20 can actually hold eight of these pots here i will list the pots uh where i got them on amazon so that you can use the same exact one if you want and also the trays so 10 by 20 will hold eight of those tray containers you can also use a 10 by 10 and it will hold just um four so uh here is my watering process and as you can see i showed you guys how to mix the nutrients and i use the aero garden nutrients you can use whatever you want you can use compost tea if you want to go with organic and just put it into a gallon and then just pour it into the tray you see that and then at the bottom of each of those pots there are openings so the openings will allow water to be kind of like absorbed into the pot i'll show you you see and then the larger plants like the lettuce here you see it has roots down there and that actually will help the plants get the nutrients and the water directly so it does increase the growth rate so it's only been six days and we can already harvest those those here and here so let's go ahead and do that right now all right guys look what i have harvested so far this is a good amount for um some nice lettuce and i try these the last time man these are amazing they're nice and crisp and very tender and they grow very fast as well so maybe the next time i do this i'm gonna grow mainly these because they're so good and they grow so fast and uh when i was harvesting you notice that i have a few fungus gnats flying around um it's very difficult to prevent them completely because sometimes i have my garage door open and uh you know they could fly from outside or it could be the soil that i brought with with me inside so yeah you can see that i added new plants and so um when you bring plants in and out uh you increases the chance of uh of fungus gnats coming in and out and i think that's what happened because i didn't notice them before but once i brought um these radishes here tobacco plant and um um a few of the other stuff then i got uh fungus gnats in here but they don't really bother me because this is inside my garage and um once um these plants are larger then i'm gonna i'm gonna apply the uh the top dry layer and they should be okay oh man i forgot one more plant that i didn't um show you guys because i i took it over there to do um pictures so let me go bring it here it is this is the uh the pok choy and uh you may have seen this in the beginning of the video and uh it is a gorgeous plant and i like to take pictures of my plants so i moved these things around and i forgot about them so um look at this very nice and beautiful and you know it right now it's pretty hot warm and so um this is why there are flowers here so these things like cooler condition so uh that is it guys i hope that um you find this information helpful and it is times like this that um you should learn how to grow things inside uh get fresh vegetable whenever you want and uh you know exactly where it came from and uh who grew it and all that stuff so it's it's a benefit to you all so i hope you enjoy the video and if you have any questions or comments please leave it below and thank you so much for watching
