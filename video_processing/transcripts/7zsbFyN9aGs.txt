Science & Technology
 Due to the many forms of insecticide resistance present in vector populations, it is necessary to use insecticides strategically. There are numerous strategies that can be used to prevent and slow the development and spread of insecticide resistance. These include rotations, mixtures, mosaics, synergists and combinations. Rotations are the rotation of two or more different insecticide classes, each with a different mode of action over time. Mixtures are the use of two different insecticides at the same time. When an insecticide no longer works as effectively, a synergist can be used in combination with that insecticide to enhance its efficacy. A mosaic is the use of two or more separate insecticides against the same vector in spatially separated applications. This allows for vectors of a single generation to be exposed to more than one insecticide. Intervention strategies involve the use of multiple interventions simultaneously, with each intervention using a different insecticide. By exposing vectors to multiple insecticides at the same time, you reduce the chances that a single type of resistance can develop. If susceptible individuals still exist in the population, and control programs stop using insecticides, the population reverts to being susceptible. From this, we know that being resistant is costly to the vector. Therefore, integrating non-insecticide-based methods into a vector control program can be a useful resistance management tool. Using different types of insecticide-based and non-insecticide-based interventions can be a part of a larger integrated vector management plan.
