 Today we want to talk about the different methods of applying top dressing fertilizer. Some farmers will apply using a fertilizer cup, some will apply by hands, while others will choose to use a vicon spreader, particularly if they have a large hectare. But today we want to talk about the Chola system of fertilizer application, which was devised by farmers. This makes use of a fertilizer bag or any bag that is available, where you open at the corner or the tip and you put a pipe so the fertilizer will be coming out through the pipe. So the aim is just to increase efficiency and workability when we are doing operations at the farm. We should never run out of ideas. So the top dressing fertilizer we are applying here is urea, 46% nitrogen, on a block of SC727. Farming is a business. Start right, start with the right seed and employ good agronomic practices.
