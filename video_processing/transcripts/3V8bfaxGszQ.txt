 If you're planting bulbs this fall, here's some do's and don'ts. First up is soil. Do plant all of your bulbs, including tulip staffs or alliums, in well-draining soil. You don't want to plant them in any type of soil that's going to hold on to water too tightly because most of these bulbs are susceptible to rot. So that means don't plant them in any clay type of soils. Make sure not to plant them in any puddling areas or low spots in your garden. Next is planting depth. Do plant your bulbs at the correct depth because if you plant them too shallow, they're more apt to fall over. If you plant them too deep, you might not even see the bulbs or they might not flower that season. If you're not sure how deep to plant them, you can always plant them two to three times their height deep. And our last tip, when to water. You want to make sure that you plant your bulbs in already moistened soil and you don't want to water them until you see those bulbs come up in the late winter or early spring. If you haven't planted your bulbs yet, no need to worry. You can still plant them all the way up until the end of December. Just make sure that your ground's not frozen yet. We hope this was helpful and thanks for watching. Thank you.
