 What's up guys it's 2025 and it's time once again for a Baker Creek Seed Haul. Let's see what I got this year guys. Now it's coming in two separate packages okay nice little designs here and uh or added bonus this year I asked for of course seeds for Christmas and I also got this sweet Baker Creek Seeds t-shirt as a Christmas gift so that was awesome and also these are my Christmas gift seeds which I'm not going to show you just yet I'm going to save these for the very end. Now I didn't specify what I wanted or anything like that and quite honestly I forgot what I got most of these have an idea but I've actually had this stacked away for a while waiting to do this video so let's go ahead and figure out what's in these packages to begin with I'll talk about which my favorites are this year maybe a little bit of garden plans and see what's going on so let's go ahead and get started right now. All right so let's start off with the smallest package first something else in there that's my receipt put that over there now first up let's see what we got so uh let's see these pretty little cards like this when you order from Baker Creek which is pretty awesome uh this is has a general manager on there and uh you know just like the website and like a business card pretty sweet they do a really fantastic job guys so first up let's talk about what I have first on we're going to talk about just curled parsley you know what this is guys it's not just for rabbits not just for decoration parsley is a great ingredient to cook with and I know some uh some chefs that would love that so definitely growing that by request now next up mountain mint this is a free gift if you order enough seeds from Baker Creek they always throw in a free package of seeds sometimes two or three depending if you go all out and buy you know tons of seeds so mountain mint that is uh I've never had this before I don't know what it is um really it's a perennial uh pollinators love it yet mammals won't bother it so most like just like deer they don't eat regular mint so hopefully that's going to be something that they don't munch on anyways next up we have okay Japanese parsley or Mitsuba okay uh loves the shade so I do have some shaded areas it's not exactly uh like parsley like the curled parsley or the culinary parsley or you're used to this is a Japanese um you can eat the stems roots and seeds even are also edible plant this in a cooler area it does not like the hot weather so that's definitely something to try this spring see what we got next we have Uluru okre tomato okay I forgot I ordered this I remember I wanted this and I think I forgot to get it um in this package so this is actually a second package I the things I forgot to buy right so it's a dwarf tomato project so this would be good for if you have a small area you don't have room for you know big tomato states and big cages like that so I'm going to try to grow this maybe on the porch as an experiment to see if I can you know get some really great tasting tomatoes on a small plant so that's kind of a experiment this year but I do love this color I mean check it out that is an awesome like green shoulders on it it's like that nice uh yellowish dark yellow uh flesh on it I do love some yellow tomatoes yep next we have dandelion italco rosso now this is uh a gourmet italian chicory uh the stems this more like going to be like a bitter green uh you're going to blanch this something like that it's not something you eat like in a salad but I've uh been kind of curious to try this out for a while I think this may be new this year I'm not sure but it is a uh something I definitely want to be uh experimenting with this year so I like trying some some different things you know kind of get bored using all the same herbs and spices and all the kind of things mix it up guys Baker Creek has tons and tons and tons of herbs and things you probably have never heard of before uh experience new things grow something different try it out you might like it here we go this is magic carpet time that's the creeping time uh makes like a nice ground cover you can walk on it and when you do walk on it releases a scent um I believe there was this if not something very similar I went to California visited some people there and where it's a drier area they don't plant a lot of grass because it takes water correct so they had this on the basically on a bank next to like their outside their house and it was fantastic you could just smell the flat the flowers and the time scent fantastic next up we have bloody dock now this is also by request not for myself personally but I got to mention I know a couple chefs and he actually requested this but they want this as a micro green they don't want full-size plants they use these as a garnish something to try out again I might even start some of these indoors in the winter time to kind of see what I can do with the grow lights since they're not going to be harvested at a full mature plant uh try getting some micro greens out of these but it is also a perennial but it is a typically grown as an annual so we'll see might plant some outside see if it does perennialize which I think it should if not believe it readily self-seeds so it'll just keep coming back I'm definitely curious to try this I don't even know what it tastes like quite honestly so if you've ever grown bloody dock before leave a comment down below it'll be interesting if anyone has grown that as well next up I'm trying to go so fast so if anyone has a comment or you want to have more detail about a specific pack or go back leave a comment down below I will get back to you and give you some more in-depth detail at the expense of making this video 30 minutes long people are going to get bored to click off understand how it works all right now this is the Nacotiana my friend Isaac over at Blue Creek Detectors check his YouTube channel out awesome channel um he always grows this in his garden things like this one of his favorite flowers he said the scent at nighttime is just amazing uh deer do not bother it whatsoever everybody said the scent on it is fantastic so I'm going to plant this by my front um that the stairs going down from my house hopefully it's going to just make the front of the house just smell awesome and uh deer are not going to eat it so that's actually really awesome next up giant parsley you know what this is guys you've you've grown parsley you've eaten parsley this is typical culinary parsley again by request from my friend the chef he said grow as much parsley as you possibly can they'll use every bit of it and then still need to buy more they go through tons and tons of it so challenge accepted sounds like I'm planting a lot of parsley guys this year it's at least curly giant and the japanese parsley now see what we got here um a little flower design in this package right here so I'm trying to keep my hands out of the way but not really working out I should have planned this out for a letter but you know what that's how things work sometimes okay there we go now the receipt get that out of there this is the free gift and let's see who we got here another business card from deb she's a seed supply and logistics manager again pretty nice touch agar creek top-notch organization recommend them wholeheartedly not sponsored not endorsed just a guy who likes seeds and who I like buying my seeds from now what do I have here is the free gift ice queen lettuce a french heirloom dark green kind of curly awesome can't get enough some fresh lettuce guys now this is asparagus I have grown this before this exact one I'm not going to really get into it too much basically I grew tons of this stuff and at the plant sale farmer's market I sold all the plants basically out I only left one for myself and uh yeah I want more this is the kind you can actually kind of blanch this out kind of keep it covered but the kind of one of the varieties they use in Europe to get like the white asparagus so definitely going to do some experimenting a little more cautious about this and these are not going to be for sale I'm using these for my garden next up we have purple beauty peppers now these are uh not really doesn't look like they're very big bell peppers but they're definitely amazing they're four inch uh fruit on plants that are about 18 inches high now I've heard this before people say their plants their pepper plants are always small I always end up with gigantic pepper plants I got a steak up that the branches break off of today so many peppers on it so if you need any advice on growing peppers ask this guy I do kind of make that one of the things I'm pretty awesome with growing peppers and I'll do some more videos about growing peppers again leave a comment specific question maybe I will make a video from your comment now this this is Neif carrot this is a very very very rare uh carrot that is from Switzerland now if you watch uh YouTube uh the Baker Creek seed channel they do like seed highlights this is one they did a complete episode on it's like five minutes long guys go check it out uh a little bit of the backstory if you're not going to watch it like one farmer in Switzerland in some little valley was growing this uh wasn't fashioned a long time ago fell out of fashion for more you know modern type varieties but uh they you know built the seed stock up and now we have it here in our hands um definitely into growing different colored carrots and things like that not just a standard orange carrot awesome we have now now this one I'm actually really excited about uh as an experiment I've heard some uh some pretty good reviews on it this is the white soul strawberry but these are alpine strawberries not the red ones you get at the store which are extremely expensive by the way I have no idea why they are so expensive but anyways I digress they go bad if you get them for like a day so anyways moving on now what I've heard and watched other people's videos and did some reviews on it because they are red birds will not eat them because they don't see them as being ripe I guess they're attracted to the color red just like peppers and berries and things like that so when these are perfectly ripe they'll be soft to the touch they're a little bit smaller than the standard you know giant strawberries you buy at the store however they are supposed to be very very sweet with an intense flavor somewhat like a little bit of pineapple flavor mixed in with the strawberry flavor so very excited to try this out and also just a quick uh quick little tip uh probably make individual videos on a lot of these varieties especially this one about growing it from seed from your seed to harvest things like that so check back for that but um these don't have runners they stay compact so we'll put in some big containers since I don't need to worry about you know let it run and all that kind of stuff they split a little compact little plants so definitely another bonus if you don't have a lot of space grow alpine strawberries instead another one of my specialties growing dahlias I don't know why don't know how but every time I grow dahlias the ones I've always started from seed are massive huge flowers you get some pretty awesome colorations like that I might throw some pictures in here somewhere some I've grown before but I've never grown the cactus dahlias I've bought seeds before on ebay that were supposed to be cactus flower dahlias they were not imagine that so I'm really hoping I'm really hoping these actually are the true cactus form uh dahlias definitely going to give it a wholehearted effort on this because I do love dahlias uh also deer don't eat dahlias you might see a theme here we have tons of deer pressure in this area and if you don't want to try to build a giant Jurassic Park fence around your property grow dahlias deer won't eat them they're also beautiful and these open centered ones like this are great with pollinators as well tons of bumblebees and things like that absolutely love dahlias next up we have tokenashi turnips now these white turnips from japan which the traditional vegetable from japan uh sweet taste rich flavor nice and smooth crisp white flesh excellent quality love it love turnips uh you can actually for people who don't want a lot of uh starch and things like that you can actually substitute turnips for potatoes I made uh turnip el gratin or el gratin whatever it's fantastic turnips are amazing uh these are supposed to be extra sweet extra tender if you harvest them early which uh you know some of those big you know the traditional seven purple top purple top turnips maybe they get really hard and woody and they can get away from you in the split and crack and the heat etc giving these a shot I heard these are amazing reviews looking forward to that definitely now free seed even though the doesn't have I'm not sure landis winter lettuce now I've actually bought this before in the past grown it it's fine it's great lettuce nice little small heads on it it's a very cold hearty um it's a descendant from a now extinct 1700s variety I think I might have actually reviewed this on my previous baker creek um seed reviews so I don't go into it too much but you know what more lettuce fine with me next we have scarlet kale purplish kind of kale eat your vegetables of color especially purple ones full of anthocyanins uh anti-cancer antioxidant type properties to it um kale is very cold hearty I love putting kale in salads uh you can saute it cook it um I'm not really into green smoothies per se but you know kale is used for that purpose maybe you have a nice purple smoothie instead add a little color to it looking forward to it you might see another theme here you haven't noticed a lot of these vegetables this year guys are going to be purple purple or dark red colors so I'm trying to do more of a purple theme for 2025 so if you have a theme in your garden this year let me know down below what do you do what theme do you have in your garden this year next we have another purple vegetable lennox lettuce a rare variety in the u.s which means it's probably from europe or somewhere like that um it doesn't really say doesn't say where it's not rare uh very slow to bolt which is awesome uh it's a rare very good choice I like it so nice purple lettuce we got some purple kale other things like that and what else is purple eggplants you guessed it the stada de gandia I'm saying this wrong but you're it roast me in the comments that's cool healing from spain's a spanish eggplant eggplants are awesome use no fresh totally great those big purple ones you get at the store I don't really prefer those it's like a tomato like any like grown homegrown tomatoes fantastic right you get tomatoes from the grocery store eh right eggplant you grow it yourself way better so if you've never grown eggplant give it a shot because it's not it does have a much better flavor especially these old heirloom varieties much better than the stuff you buy at the store in my experience um definitely looking forward to that oh by the way eggplants have giant spikes up here on the little up in that area so when you reach in with your bare hands and try to grab them and pull them off it hurts you heard that here don't do that next another one ooze bed golden carrots I've grown these before I made a video about harvesting carrots go back check that one out leave a link there and uh yeah these are fantastic I plant these in the fall so then hold on to these plant these in the fall let them kind of ripen and mature in the cooler weather get a couple nice frost on them fantastic these are not your standard orange carrots you get from the uh danvers carrots whatever from the grocery store have a much sweeter milder flavor so if you're kind of turned off on like a really strong orange carrot type flavor this right here will be uh definitely something to impress you they're very delicious guys very very very delicious and the last one I have from the seeds I ordered before we get to the surprise seeds is the kakai squash or pumpkin now these I'm growing for the seeds yes these seeds do not have a hull on them as in you know if you get seeds from like certain brands at the gas station or grocery store you got to like crack the seed and get the little kernel out and spit the shell out they're not like sunflower seeds they get gummy slimy things like that so it's really not the best however pumpkin seeds are full of proteins and things like that that are really really good for you um these are semi-compact they're not the you know pumpkins will typically vine 30 feet in some cases right humongous leaves these are a little bit more less running I'll put it that way at least what I what I've read what I've been told so I will definitely definitely trying these out and again for the most part deer typically leave things like these alone the leaves have little spikes on them little prickles deers have sensitive little tongues they typically stay away from pumpkins take a get take a gamble on that plant these outside of the garden fence maybe keep a couple back hopefully they have plenty of room to run I get some nice seeds to uh to munch on so that's amazing looking forward to that now here's what we gotta do these are my surprise Christmas seeds and they're already taken out of the package so nothing I can open up the question is are any of these duplicates are any of these double I don't know so I'm hoping that all these are different and I didn't just double up on some seeds I already have did I not maybe I don't know oh by the way did you guys get seeds for Christmas because that's the best present you can ever get I'm gonna tell you people want cars and TVs and clothes buy seeds way way way better for you first up we have oh nice tamarillo dwarf tamarillos nice all right so the tamarillo native to South America it's in the salam there's no it's a siphomandra okay family I thought these were related to tomatoes it's a miniature version of the regular tamarillo which okay I'll do some research on that this one they were in the same family as tomatoes like or at least maybe a distant relative check it out so I will definitely be trying this out that's a warm season of course you know tropical type area plant these out in the summer I will let you guys know how that works out pretty pretty excited to get those get those rolling now next up I have the same package of seeds I think maybe I have two of these now so I guess I'll be uh giving some plants away that's okay now what I get here some free seeds Dr. Weish's yellow tomato all right cool so that's my second yellow tomato this year love that orange jubilee although it's not technically yellow it's orange's color one of my favorite tomatoes ever uh hopefully these are just as good there go about one pound nice tropical sweet taste with heavy yields and very productive okay making yellow tomato sauce that's gonna be pretty interesting oh all righty so a purple tomatillo another purple vegetable again this is all by random so I like it I've tried to grow 10 tomatillos once before and really giant pepper plants I was telling you about that were like five feet tall well I turned into this giant hedge and I almost forgot that I had the tomatillos because they got buried and I got like two fruits out of it because they just got shaded out and taken over by these massive pepper jungle thing I had going on so I'm definitely gonna make sure these have some space to run because a little purple uh tomatillo like salsa for some tacos or something like that okay giving that a shot and I have another one purple tomatillos I think maybe these might be accidentally got two clicked it button twice maybe or I guess I'll be giving away some purple tomatillo plants that's cool people like free stuff okay black strawberry tomatoes not nice check out the color on this look at the color 60 days so this is a very fast growing tomatoes usually take a lot longer than that so 60 day one ounce fruit uh marble blue scarlet and gold I like it so that's pretty sweet sweet and tart balance perfect farmer's market yeah it'll be very interesting if you grow these tomatoes and brought them to a farmer's market they look so different than anything else you'd be selling you probably sell out really quick even just out of curiosity definitely checking it out man guys this garden this year is gonna be epic 2025 is gonna be a fantastic gardening year hopefully this video is not taking too long I've been able to keep your attention but again pretty excited and I have a giant pile of seeds in front of me this pile just gets bigger and bigger uh now I'm not sure how I'm gonna grow all these tomatoes all these plants uh we'll be we'll be having to probably expand my growing area yeah that's not a bad idea brad's atomic grape tomato whoa check this out dude oh my look at the colors I think I'm almost 100 positive this was the tomato featured on like the 2023 or maybe 2022 baker creek uh catalog I never bought it because I was in it buying way too many other things now I have it that is that is cool man uh wow that's pretty exciting guys if you've ever grown these before let me know how they taste that's gonna be amazing they look awesome hopefully the taste matches how cool they look all right loving and miss this is a flower I believe yep okay yeah I've seen these growing before these are these are pretty sweet looking flowers a little uh a little bit of color on them there cool I don't think these are much of a fragrance think these are just yeah these are just kind of like an ornamental which is still fine a little nice nice little touch there all right let's mix it into the middle Jordan farm manager check it out there you go thank you Jordan for what you do at baker creek never met you but you seem like a nice guy maybe how all right I'm not gonna try to say this because I'll say it wrong some type of burdock okay it's like an edible root of some kind uh top choice in Japan top choice ingredient of adventurous American chefs okay never even heard this before so I'm gonna I can't comment I don't know I will uh I'll grow it do some research get back to you I don't know what to say um it's a it's a root top choice in Japan so it's an Asian vegetable okay cool antique rose mullein okay cool all right another pretty little flower here rosy blooms on tall spires it's a perennial nice nice drought tolerant gets two and a half to three feet tall pollinator friendly short-lived perennial that easily recedes now that's the only thing I do like guys I love plants that just reseed themselves um once you plant it get established it just comes back I like it that's a nice that's a really cool looking flower though sweet definitely gonna be a very very awesome 2025 guys and hopefully your gardens do amazing as well let's see what we got here double sunset galardia okay another oh nice I've seen these flowers before but never in this color look at these colors I've only seen just the yellow ones North American wildflower so it's going to be doing just fine here self-sews easily once again so these are going to be mixed together a little little naturalized like kind of cottage garden kind of thing I knew exactly what I'm going to do with this where I'm going to put it like a little naturalized area let these guys reseed go go go and of course why not thanks a lot maker creek I guess you're telling me eat more lettuce good and last one now I'm actually kind of kind of impressed I'm actually looking forward to this I actually wanted to buy these this year and I completely forgot and it is a there you go Japanese winged bean now these look legit cool right now if I'm not mistaken you can eat these immature pods for the seeds kind of ripen as like almost like asparagus something like that I don't know I think they're just kind of cool just little little ribs on them whatever you call it on the seed pod that's awesome again do all your research guys before you go around eating things out of the garden make sure what you're eating is actually edible but this uh the very least that's little uh traditional bee bean slash pea flower on it cool um popular in okinawa blue zone all right so blue zone food there you go guys this will be healthy for you from the blue zone you don't if you don't know what that is look it up people uh live longer time they'll have um super healthy diets so wing beans add that to your garden so that's it guys I know that was a lot and I know the seed videos can get kind of boring and mundane hopefully I kept your attention guys hopefully it wasn't that bad so right now what you need to do is you need to comment down below which of these seeds I reviewed to you guys today was your favorite which ones you have already grown uh which ones uh you decided to go out right now to baker creek rare seeds.com and buy them yourself again thanks for watching guys hope your 2025 is off to a great start the 2025 guys I mean
