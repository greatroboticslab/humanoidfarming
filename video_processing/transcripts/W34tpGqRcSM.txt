 Just behind me here we've actually got a four kilowatt solar system on the top of the shed. The reason that we put solar in is we're getting charged up here around 36 cents a kilowatt. We're burning on an average of around 25 kilowatts per day. So therefore it's quite a fair expense in electricity. The electricity that we run here is obviously the geothermal heating and cooling, plus the normal operations of the house, plus some pumps and the septic system and general use of appliances. So basically any farm can put a solar system on. And again you're looking at cost savings and there's huge cost savings because we've actually, with putting the solar in averaged around about a 60 to 70 percent usage decrease on electricity per day. In Victoria you generate around about three and a half hours of electricity across the 365 days a year. So therefore what we also do too is we time the appliances. We're putting large appliances on like dishwashers, washing machines, vacuum cleaners. We do that in that peak time when the sun's out. And again it's just another smart way of reducing electricity costs on your farm. The geothermal system as we spoke about before is a system that actually runs on electricity. But it's only very small amounts of electricity because it's only a quarter horsepower motor and you've got a very very small pump to pump the water around. So therefore the natural thing to do is put solar in to actually offset the cost of running the geothermal system that heats and cools the house. We're looking at the heart of the geothermal system here in this little valley. Basically what we've got is we've got a loop configuration and we've got four trenches that are about 1.8 metres deep. At the bottom of each trench we've got class 12 25 millimetre pipe and that's the closed loop system that actually runs the hot and cold water through the ground for the heat and cooling transfer. And down the bottom as well we've got the dam as you can see and there's loops in the dam that actually feed the geothermal system too. But again we're not using water. All we're doing is heat transferring and using the ground as a heat transfer to actually make the geothermal system a lot more efficient. Alright we're down here at the moment and this is the bottom dam. We've got the dwelling up the top there. The geothermal system actually has a pipe system that actually runs down this valley here and the closed loop water system actually ends up transferring the heat or the hot and cold water and it's thermally conducted into the dam here. And that's how the geothermal system actually works. We're not actually using water in any way shape or form but we're just using the dam as a thermal transfer to actually make the geothermal system so much more affordable and effective as a heating and cooling system. The geothermal system is used again to heat and cool the house across the year and we have temperature extremes up here of basically plus 45 degrees Celsius down to minus 7. We've actually had snow here as well. The system also too, this module here, is actually the module that heats the potable hot water. So that's basically a byproduct of the geothermal system. So the potable hot water is almost a free product that you can use as your hot water for your showers and dishes etc. And over to our left over here we will have a swimming pool at some point as well. And the byproduct of geothermal again is actually heating and cooling, well not so much cooling, but you can do it in summer, heating more so the swimming pool. All of the water that comes out of this and all of the function of the geothermal system is not adverse to the elements. So if you've got a very, very hot day or a very, very cold day, no matter what, that geothermal through the heat transfer through the dam that you saw before and through the ground in the valley, comes back at a constant temperature of 16.7 to 16.8 degrees, making it extremely efficient. Now again, as I mentioned before, this actually runs on electricity and the solar system offsets the cost of running this, but the running costs are extremely minimal. There are also many other applications for the geothermal systems. Now the way that this is heated is actually using a duct air ducting system. So heating and cooling the house is actually via ducting, but you can also use hydronics as well. So you can actually pump hot and cold water out of this system to actually use hydronics for heating and cooling the dwelling. But there are a lot of applications and especially for farming. If you've got piggeries or chicken farms where you're actually running hot water through a slab and you're using hydronics, especially for piggeries, I've heard of some piggeries getting charged around $300,000 a year in LPG. Now this system is so easy to install. It's just basically an excavator and if you're a farmer that's got an excavator and you haven't got too much rock, you can drop pipes into trenches and do it yourself or you can use the dam that's already on your property as well. So for cost savings, especially if you're using LPG where natural gas is not available for heating, you can have a payback of around 6 to 12 months in putting a geothermal system in. So again, making your farm sustainable and using technologies that are out there. And unfortunately geothermal has not really taken off in Australia. Definitely in Europe, all across Europe and Canada mainly, in very cold areas, geothermal is used widely. But in Australia, unfortunately, it hasn't taken off and I hope to see these geothermal technology taking off in many ways because of the cost savings. Renewable energy makes sense if you spend a lot on electricity and gas. In Wayne's case, he spends $100 per week on LPG. Also, if you can get at least 4 hours per day electricity production from your solar panels, you can mimic some of Wayne's savings. Geothermal energy may also work for you if you have access to water for the heat transfer and your land isn't too rocky. If so, the investment in renewable energy could pay off in 1 to 2 years from electricity and gas cost savings. Renewable energy can also provide a useful hedge against rising electricity and gas prices. Gas, especially, is expected to increase because of the opening of liquefied natural gas or LNG export terminals in Queensland. With renewable energy, you can reduce your exposure to volatile energy prices by producing some of your own energy at zero marginal cost. The greater your bill now, the more you save with a move to renewables. Is it another key to offersınet justification for starting a day喝'd? No, the more central.
