 My name is Karen Scalf and I am owner and farmher of Carnegie Hereford Farms. We run an operation of about 50 brood cows, all hereford based genetics. Our farm was started in 1949 by my mom and dad, Gene and Cecil Carnegie and he loved cattle. He loved Hereford cattle. They are known for their grass genetics, their great beefy flavor and their docility, they're easy to work with, they're easy to move and they just make a great end product for beef. As we go back to the soil and understand that's the foundation for our farming, we have to make sure that we're making sustainable decisions so that that soil continues to have the ability to grow the crops that we need. Regenerative grazing is going back to working with nature and moving the cattle on a daily basis so that you actually improve the soil. It's making the grass more nutrient dense and reducing our inputs so that we're actually more profitable and more sustainable with all the decisions that we make. In our pastures we use a diversified mix of seed that we drill in rather than just a monoculture. And by using different types of grasses the cattle get a better balanced diet. And by using different types of grasses they have different types of root systems and those root systems will aerate the soil, they will capture more rainfall and the cattle just perform much better with a wide diet. It feels more natural working with mother nature. When there's a dry period the grass actually continues to keep growing so that the forage is not stressed, the cattle keep getting their diet met and it all moves on. In the last three years we've been able to reduce our inputs. We've been able to reduce chemicals completely. No loads of nitrogen in four or five years. So we went from having to buy potash fertilizer and liquid nitrogen. And I would be going up and down this field at least five or six times a year just you know either spraying chemicals or putting out the fertilizer, putting out the lime, putting out the nitrogen. The investment into regenerative ag practices is not an overnight success. But through time it is an investment in our soil. An investment that really pays off. And it's actually like the cash crop. We invest in the soil, and the soil pays us back with the returns. There's always new opportunities on the horizon and our goals for KH Farms is to network with other regenerative farmers to market our products. The consumer would love to have full access to the beef, pork, chicken and all produce grown regenerative products. We look forward to having a network of those farmers marketing through our farms, from our farm store. I just love cattle. I love Hereford cattle. They are so beautiful and gentle. The red and white color on a green pasture. It's fun to watch the end product knowing that it's the very best that you can do. And it's also continuing the legacy that my mom and dad started. I grew up on the farm. It's been my life. And that's the pleasure is being out in the pasture outside with the cattle. People say that I have the best job in the world. They're so right. I enjoy just getting out there. And whether it's sunshine or whether it's the rain, it's always a great day to be on the farm. Totally worthCu impulses. Sorry I'll check this in on keep going. I chuy see a lot of money pulling you up. Exactly indeed. I just read my perspective propositions, Gearmenrius on. Awesome. I'll see you between 2- 1986 and 30- unwillingly and do 7- motherfuckers going. The Entry Show using essas пjaス. The Entry Showing says that if you are mostly getting put back on it. I glad you asked that if you are but hopefully it is an edge gift, but I have not been taking place on the direction of this board. The Entry Show. mass���re Jaguaho佛
