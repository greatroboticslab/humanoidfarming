Pets & Animals
 This boy decided to take all of his farm animals on a ride. To do this, he built a little train and filled each carriage with an animal which he kissed on the head before the trip. After every single chicken and rabbit got kissed and sat still, the ride could begin. The little boy sat in his tractor and started the ride, making turns around his farmland. His goose friends even followed him around, and if you think he is living a dream childhood, subscribe.
