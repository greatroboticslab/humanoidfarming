 Welcome to another episode of the Cattle USA Daily Podcast. Today we are talking some uncomfortable things. And I want to start out with a question. If you had to sell your operation tomorrow, would it help your family or would it hurt them? Today we are talking depreciation, succession planning, and some mindset realities. And the whole concept of if you didn't get it from the title, is your ranch an asset or is it a liability? It's a really hard question to have. And here's the thing, guys, we are going to be pretty direct today, not doom and gloom, but this is an episode about taking ownership and seeing the opportunity to do that. To continue to grow and to continue to develop. So what is depreciation? What do I mean when I say depreciation? What is the definition of depreciation? What does it look like for us on ranches? Here's the thing. Depreciation doesn't just mean value loss. In ranch terms, depreciation, it's not just rust on a tractor or depreciation of our products, but it's also the slow fade in value of equipment, fencing facilities, and more. So here's the IRS view. Depreciation is a tax benefit. It lets you write off the cost of certain assets over time, reducing your taxable income, even if the asset is still technically usable. So for example, you can depreciate a squeeze chute or a barn over the next 5 to 20 years, even though you might use it longer. And here's the thing. The same depreciation doesn't mean you've saved for replacing those assets. You've just lowered your tax bill, not banked the money for repairs, upgrades, or replacement. The bottom line of this, guys, is tax depreciation can make your books look better, but it doesn't equal cash in the bank or rising operational value. So here's the thing. Many producers confuse a good tax year with good financial health. Just because on our taxes it looks like we had a good year does not mean our operation is actually sustainable. Does not mean that if everything hit the fan today, our operation would still be successful. I also, outside of depreciation, want to talk about succession. Succession is often looked at as a, I'm not ready to retire, so why do I need to talk about it? It's not something I'm worried about. Here's the thing. If you're not planning for the next generation, your ranch may be a ticking time bomb. We never know what tomorrow holds. And I don't want to get doom and gloom on this, but I come from a family, thank God, who has talked about this my entire lives. But you want to know why we have talked about succession my entire life? It's because my dad's dad died when he was 13. We didn't, they didn't have the opportunity to set up a succession plan. It wasn't put in paper what happens next. And that is stressful and that is not fun for anyone. So be the person that does it. Be the person that asks yourself these questions. Do you have a plan for who takes over? If you get in a car wreck, if you die tomorrow, or if you just break your legs, like if you fall off the tractor and you break two legs, who's going to help you take over? Who's going to help you during that situation as well? Next, have you communicated that plan? So cool, you have a plan for who takes over, but have you communicated it? And are you grooming the next generation with skills, not just responsibilities? Actually implementing skills and responsibilities into the next generation is so vital to the success of the operation as it goes through a succession. Succession planning works really, really well when it is done right, but it can absolutely wreck a family legacy when it is done wrong. Everything that you have spent the last however many years putting together for your operation can be gone in the blink of an eye if you don't take succession planning seriously. So here's the thing. With the business mindset of all of this, we've talked about this a lot. So we've talked about depreciation. We've talked about how it doesn't necessarily mean that you've had a good financial year of health just because your taxes said that you did. Just because the tax return that you submitted to the IRS looks good on paper and it says that you made $80,000 in profit this year does not mean that you necessarily have great financial health. And so here's the mindset shift that I want to talk about with you guys today. There is quite a few, but the reality, like the whole thing of it is breaking it down like a CEO, looking at your business like a CEO, and remembering that there is a difference between owning cattle and running a business. They can be two things that are running along parallel to one another and can be done extremely well and successfully if done right. But you have to think like a CEO. You need to be tracking your income and expenses monthly, not just annually. At the very least, sit down every single quarter and do your monthly income and expenses. I like to do mine every single month, if not twice a month, if it's been a really busy month or if I find myself with a little extra time or I know that it's going to be a busy end of month. Do it now and do it consistently now. You will thank yourself, not just from a being able to compare year over year, but also when tax season comes, you and your tax advisor will thank you. I want you to be measuring your return on investment on every single major purchase that you make. That ROI is so important to continue remembering and continue to look back on as you go throughout your year, as you go throughout your next 10 years. If it's a major purchase and an investment, you need to be looking out on that. And measuring your ROI is going to tell you whether that was a safe and good financial decision or if it was some financial decision that we make every once in a while that maybe we should have second guessed a little bit more. Then I also want you to pay yourself a salary if you can. If you are in a situation where you are able to start paying yourself a bi-weekly salary, a monthly salary, please do. Your personal finances will thank you if you are able to start separating business income and expenses from personal income and expenses and paying yourself a salary, even if it is a salary that fluctuates, will help you in this aspect. So here's a question for you guys. Is your ranch profitable or are you just staying busy? You need to start treating your ranch like an appreciating asset, not a lifestyle you're surviving in. Look at your business like a CEO, challenge yourself to grow and look at it from a business standpoint of how can we continue to treat this like an appreciating asset and not something that we are just getting by day to day. So as we round out this podcast, I have a little quick litmus test for you guys on whether your ranch is an asset or a liability. So I've got five questions for you guys that I want you to be so real with yourself on. Sit down, be honest on every single one of these. Because if you're not honest with yourself, then what's the point of actually listening to the rest of this episode? Like, sorry, but you can just leave now. If you're not going to be honest with yourself on these next five questions and let yourself self-assess. Question number one, can your ranch operate for three months without you? If you were to leave today and go on a three-month hiatus into the backwoods of Alaska, would your ranch survive without you? Do you have a plan in place if you were gone for three months? Is your operation currently building equity or bleeding it? This is probably a situation where you might know this off the top of your head. You might have to go talk to your financial advisor. You might have to go talk to your tax person. You might have to go to your QuickBooks account and go figure this out for yourself. Number three, do you know your breakeven cost per head? We've talked about breakeven before. I want you to know your breakeven cost per head. In the volatile market that we currently have, it is so important to know our numbers, not just from an overall standpoint of our business, but granular, know our levels. And so going from a breakeven cost as an operation to a breakeven cost per head is actually going to be quite eye-opening for you, especially when you're able to take your expenses and your costs elsewhere, such as feed, hay, land, equipment, and break that down to a per head cost. It is very eye-opening. And it's eye-opening in an aspect from not just a self-reflective standpoint, but from an expansion standpoint as well. So when you're looking at expansion or different ways of running your business, whether you're expanding, shrinking, whatever, looking at it from a per head cost standpoint is actually really insightful because you can look at your operation right now and say, okay, I'm running 200 head and this is how much it costs me per head. I could up it to 250 head, get some more land or dry lot, and this would be my cost per head. And it's cool to see how different operational choices make your cost per head go up or down. So definitely do that. Number four, is there a written, emphasis on written, succession plan? And preferably signed and notarized if I'm getting picky. And preferably done with a lawyer. Is there a written succession plan? Have you written something out for the next generation to plan for the future? If you stopped today, would your ranch help the next generation or would it burden them? That's a hard question to ask yourself. That if for the last 20 years, 50 years, 60 years, 150 years, we've been building this ranching operation to be something that is a legacy, something that we want to continue to push forward and grow and develop and provide for our next generation. And then you sit down and you're like, actually, I think this might be a burden. I think that this ranch is a liability, not an asset. I think that the way that we have been running this ranch is not helping the next generation, but it is going to hurt them. And when you get out of your own head and you think about the people around you and the people that you are going to hand this operation down to, it makes you be a little bit more honest because it's no longer just about you and your life. It's about your kids' lives. It's about your non-familial succession planning lives. It is about other people around you rather than just yourself. So be real with yourself. And I want you to remember this and ask yourself this question. Is your ranch setting your family up for success or is it setting them up for stress? No one wants to be stressed. It's not fun. No one wants to hand down a liability, a burden, a stress. You want to set your family up for success. You want it right now while you're still here to be a success. You don't want it to be a liability. Outside of succession planning. So don't let it be. I want you, after that litmus test, after everything else we talked about, I can guarantee you almost every single one of you listening to this has something that you can go to. Someone you can call, a question that you can continue to ask, somewhere you can dive deeper, whether that be into your finances and you're calling your financial advisor and you're calling your tax person and you're calling your banker and you're digging deeper into your finances to actually get a hold on them and understand them. Or whether you're getting a hold of a lawyer or an attorney and getting that succession plan and that trust set up and everything else that goes along with that. Or whether you're just sitting down and sitting around the kitchen table with your next generation and talking to them about the succession plan or where the ranch currently is. I encourage you to communicate these things. There is power in keeping things quiet and it gives power to things that don't deserve any power. And it can be really embarrassing. It can be really touchy as far as finances go and where the debt to income ratio is of ranching operations. But don't let it be. Don't give that power to something that doesn't deserve it. Because if it has power over you, then you're not discussing it with those around you. So I really encourage you to discuss it with those around you and be the person that having these conversations regularly with the people in your lives, with your family members and with everyone around you. Your team is here to support you. So let them and continue looking at your operation from a CEO standpoint of how can we continue to grow and develop and build this operation to the next level.
