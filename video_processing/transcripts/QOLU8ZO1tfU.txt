 Learn to. Learn to. Hey there, Chloe here, and you're right on time. Today we're spending the day at the farm. We're going to see horses, chickens, goats, and so many more cool animals. But before we get started, we have to find Tyler and Benny. Have you seen them anywhere? Whoa! Oh, hey, Chloe. Hi. All right, I can't wait to show you all I've learned about this big tractor here on the farm. But first, we need to find Benny. Have you seen him? No, I haven't. Hmm. Cheese. Oh, there you go. Oh, there you are, Benny. Hi, buddy. Hi. Hi, Benny. Are you ready to explore this big farm today? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, we're going to learn all about life on the farm, and you can learn too. Learn too. Me too. Learn too. Learn too. Learn too. Learn too. I learned something new, and you can learn too. Learn too. Learn too. Learn too. I learned something new today. Yeah. We're gonna do it. Learn too. I learned something new, and you can learn too. Learn too. Learn too. I learned something new today. You'll do it. Okay, the first thing we're going to do on the farm is check out this big tractor. Now, can you tell me what color this tractor is? Yeah, it's the color green. And it also has what other color right here? Yes, it's the color yellow. This is our big green and yellow tractor. Tractors just like this one are used on farms all around the world every day. Tractors are used for preparing the fields, planting seeds in the fields, and harvesting the crops that grow each season. And tractors can haul really heavy equipment and drive over really bumpy ground because they have powerful engines and really big wheels. Now, just like on Benny's little tractor, you can see it has a steering wheel and it has four small wheels. And on our big tractor, we also have a steering wheel and we have four big wheels. Look at the size of these things. Now, the yellow part here is the wheel. And then this black part on the outside is the tire. Just like the tires on your car, except these are massive. Hmm. What's back here? This is called the back blade. So this is a tool that's attached to the back of the tractor that helps the farmers do different types of work around the farm. Let's go check out what's on the front. This right here is the front end loader, also called the bucket. So this is a really useful tool that a farmer can use on the front of his tractor to scoop dirt or different things around the farm to make the work a lot easier. Isn't this tractor awesome? It's humongous. I got to drive it one more time. I got to drive it one more time. I got to drive it one more time. That's a great choice. I think I would pick a green one just like we saw today here at the farm. Now that we've learned so much about tractors, let's see what else we can learn about here on this farm. So on the farm there are big animals like cows and horses and they have to eat a whole lot of food. So what farmers do is they grow fields and then they harvest those fields and turn them into bales of hay. And the horses and cows can eat on this hay all year long. So we thought we would see how good it tastes. You guys want to try some hay? Yeah. Alright, let's see. Ugh, not very good. I don't recommend eating the hay, but it's also really fun to climb on and play in. You guys want to play? Yeah. Alright, let's do it. Don't just watch us play. Look around you. What can you use to pretend that you are playing on hay bales too? Yeah, great. So come on, let's play. Let's play. Let's play. Let's play. Let's play. Let's play. Let's play. Let's play. Let's play. Let's play. guitar solo guitar solo guitar solo Okay, we are here to look at some animals on the farm. Now, inside of this little house here, there's a bunch of animals. Bennett, do you know what kind of animals are in here? Chicken! There's chickens in here! Okay, do you know what a chicken house is called? Uh, a wooden. It's made of wood and it's called a chicken coop. So the chickens live in a chicken coop. Now, who can tell me what do chickens lay? They lay... Eggs! Yeah! Now, what's cool is inside of this, we can see the eggs that these chickens have laid. So, let's see if there's any eggs. Hmm. I don't see any over there. Let's look over here. Hmm. There's one! A chicken laid an egg! Did you see that? Yeah! Chickens can lay up to one egg per day. So, this thing's full of chickens. There's one now. Hey, buddy! Alright, we're gonna let you guys out. Should we let these chickens out and feed them? Alright, come on, over here! Take the eggs! Can you see yang?君? Oh, wow. Daniel? Okay. Oh, yeah! Nice. Nice. Do you know what those things are all over the chickens that make them so soft? Feathers! Yeah, those are feathers. And all of these chickens have normal feathers except for one. One is extra fluffy. Look closely. Can you spot the extra fluffy chicken? Yeah, there it is. See how fluffy she is? What a cool chicken. Now we're walking with the chickens over to their favorite spot to eat. Yeah, these chickens are hungry. Yeah, and we're going to feed them some chicken feed. Chicken feed? What's chicken feed? Well, it's kind of like cereal for chickens. Breakfast cereal? Not exactly, Benny. Chicken feed is made from cereal grains like corn, wheat, barley, and rye. Hey, do I ask like a chicken? Yeah. How do we do that? Because your arms like wings. And make chicken sounds. It's like this. Can you act like a chicken just like Benny? Let's see it. I'll see tomar if you look at it. Okay. That's matter. There you go. These chickens were really cool. Let's see what other animals we can find on the farm. Every farm has a good farm dog. This is Coda. He's a husky. Say hi, Coda. Everybody has a job to do on the farm. Even dogs! That's right. Some dogs are herding dogs and they help gather herds of animals. These dogs are called sheep dogs. Sheep dogs are sheep dogs. Yeah, they're helping the farmers move the sheep where they need to go. Oh, that's awesome. We watch a2021 home, Jesus, and even the corn are<|zh|> We would get some dollar and fish them around. So far they are going to anyone in the farm. Next, we got to get in the pen and hang out with some goats. Everybody say, hi, Mr. Goat. Hi, Mr. Goat. Oh, and don't forget about the miniature horses. They're like big horses, but only small. I got to pet the horses. Oh, wow. Was it scary? I'm kind of scared to pet them. It's not scary. Yeah, it's not scary. These horses are really nice. Hey, you're right. They are really nice. Hey, here comes a goat. You're right. I wonder what he wants. I think he's hungry. Hmm, so what should we do? Let's feed him. Good idea, Benny. What's it like to feed them? It tickles. Yeah, you're right. It does tickle. These goats and horses are really hungry. You're right, Benny. They sure are. Yay. It's fifty bears. I'm a monkey friend. I can plead with you. A movie friend. A movie friend. They're still alive to me. They'll be able to voluntary. They'll be afraid of you. You're right.icky brings them to the Tyson's. Dexterity.

Drum roll, please. Alpacas! Look at these alpacas. Aren't they neat? I've never seen anything like these guys. These alpacas used to be fluffier, but they recently got a haircut. These alpacas look really hungry. Let's feed them. You're right. I'm a little bit scared to feed them, though. What if they bite me? It's okay to be scared, but they won't bite you. You can be brave, like me and Cloverbeer. You guys were brave. Okay, I'll choose to be brave, too. I can do this. Yeah, this isn't scary. These alpacas are eating a lot. You're right. I think these alpacas were really hungry. And you were right, because it's not scary to feed them. These alpacas are really friendly. Yes. Yes. You're right. Okay, while we're here on the farm, I thought it would be cool if we sang a song. What do you guys think? Good. Okay. Will you sing a song with us? All right. The only thing is I couldn't think of any songs about the farm. So, can you help me? What song could we sing about the farm? Do you know, Benny? How about Old MacDonald? Old MacDonald. That's a great one. Okay. Let's sing Old MacDonald together. Old MacDonald had a farm. E-I-E-I-O. And on his farm he had some... Chicken. Chickens! Cows. Cows. Cows. E-I-E-I-O.

Okay, before we saddle up and go horseback riding, we're going into the barn here at Horses of Hope in Lapeer, Michigan to meet some of the amazing horses they have. This first horse we're going to meet is named Angel. Wow, she's beautiful! Hey, do you want to know something cool about horses? Yeah! Horses can sleep while standing up. Isn't that neat? Guess horses do that? Maybe I'll try that something. With as much energy as you have, Benny, you already practically do. I do have a lot of energy, see? You can say that again. This horse's name is Willow. Hi, Willow. Thanks for letting us pet you today. Okay, are you two ready to meet the next horse? Yeah! This horse's name is Sunshine. Oh, hi, Sunshine. What's her name?
