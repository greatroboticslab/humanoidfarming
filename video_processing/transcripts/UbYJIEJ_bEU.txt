 Hi, Johnny here from Country Farm Supplies. Just jumping on here today, we're just a local farmer here. We're just showing you the stock and water trough. Basically it's where a farmer wants to utilise what space he has in his mobile pens for his whalings or his calves. It's a very handy system. The two little brackets here on the back, get straight onto your gate, just hook up your water and you water for your livestock straight away. And this goes in when you're taking down your pens or whatever, it's just as simple as hook off again once your water is disconnected. And if you want to drain your water then, there's a handy little bunk here at the bottom, just screws off, water is out. And again you're straight back onto your next paddock. Very simple. They're retailing at the moment for 85 euro. including that. You can get them on countryfarsupplies.com So like that. happylean public parks make. I'm out from now that sizable clothes. Awesome. Hello Julene toshow to you for your price? Back to yourself. Awesome. Bye. you
