Howto & Style
 I grew an entire summer's worth of squash in just three square feet. Squash plants usually sprawl all over the place, eating up valuable space in your garden. But what if you could grow your squash vertically like a tomato? All it takes is a steak and some twine. As your squash grows, gently tie it to the steak. But this method doesn't just save space. It improves airflow so you won't have to deal with as much disease. And it's easier to see your squash instead of digging around, only to find it's overripe. I started growing my own food over 12 years ago, so follow along if you want more tips like this.
