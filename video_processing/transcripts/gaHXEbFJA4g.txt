 Hey everybody welcome back. In this video today we're going to show you how we process our hay for winter storage. Our haying equipment consists of an older John Deere seven foot sickle mower. We locally purchased this machine used and had some new hydraulic hoses made up to use the tractor hydraulics to lift the cutting knife. We bought the terrain rake and tedder this spring to use this hay season. It can easily be switched between spreading, flipping and windrowing for rapid even drying of many types of forage crops. This machine has made gathering the seven foot cut of the sickle mower into swaths easy for the narrow uptake of the mini round baler. The terrain mini round baler has been the perfect solution for our homestead haymaking. It pulls easily behind our John Deere 1025R tractor and can produce 80 to 100 bales per hour. The bale size of this unit is 20 inches by a long time. It pulls easily behind our John Deere 1025R tractor and can produce 80 to 100 bales per hour. The bale size of this unit is 20 inches by a long time. 27 and a half inches wide. The auto twine tie system with self-contained hydraulics means no external tractor hydraulics are required to operate. Any small tractor with 20 to 40 horsepower and a five inch inch of the bay is a long time. The tractor has been the perfect solution for the home.

Any small tractor with 20 to 40 horsepower and a 540 PTO will pull this little unit. Last year haying season we made 330 bales and this year we've put up almost 400 bales for winter feeding. Some of the things we like about these bales are they can be easily picked up and moved by our children and rolled out for the sheep or tossed in a feeder. They are lighter than a traditional small square too. If you carefully pull the twine off rather than cut the strings you'll end up with a long reusable amount of twine for the garden, mending fences, etc. There are not a lot of mini options for hay equipment in Canada as most farm operations here are quite substantial and have very large equipment. Farmers cash purchase hay or even crop share with custom cutting and baling operations. We also want to disclose that we have no relationship with terrain whatsoever other than just sharing our experience and operating footage for the benefit of other small farmers who want to see these machines in action.
