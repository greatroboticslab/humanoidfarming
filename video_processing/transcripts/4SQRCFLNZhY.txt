 This week's tailgate conversation is presented by Pinnegar Chevrolet. Whether you are a large or small contractor, homeowner or farmer and rancher, here at Wildcat Tool Rental, you'll find something you'll want to take home. We started our business in 1997. There were no rental stores in the area and I do like working with equipment. We decided after I worked a full time job at night, I wanted to work at our own business. So we started out small and we started growing and eventually we got to where we are now one of the biggest independent rental stores in the state of Missouri. Some friends of mine I used to work with did a lot of the work around their own house by themselves and they were telling me they used to go rent equipment. I'd only rented some stuff from some small companies before but nothing big. So I went and helped one of my buddies and we rented a small backhoe and I just thought that was the neatest thing ever and he told me I should look into doing this myself. I liked it so much. So I started and me and my wife went all over looking at rental stores and eventually we decided we were going to do it. So we started out with a small backhoe, a concrete saw, a tile saw, an appliance dolly, a few other small pieces of equipment and every time somebody came in and would ask if we had something we would keep track of it and eventually go buy it. And we've done that ever since and we have more of the strangest equipment that nobody would ever see anywhere else. We rent one of the more popular items for the agriculture industry is our stock trailers. We have horse trailers, gooseneck stock trailers, bumper trailers. We also have the round bale dump trailers. We also have tractors, bush hogs. We have a miniature skid steer that will fit through a 32 inch stall door for a horse stall to clean. Clean it out and then we've got the stand on ones also. We have also the post hole loggers for building fence. Anything from a T-post driver to a 10 inch steel post driver that actually does all the work for you where you don't even have to pick the post up. When you come in the store we only require two things, a driver's license and a credit card. That's it. The only other thing you need is your insurance company will have to provide proof of insurance to rent a truck. That's the only thing we need insurance on. And it will cover anything that happens to the truck and there's no extra charge. We have a brand new website that will show you everything we have. You're also able to reserve equipment and contact us and ask any question and you will get an immediate answer. Scott has been in business for 23 years now and continues to take pride in his employees when hiring them to work at Wildcat Rental. We have been in business almost 23 years and since we've started we try to hire as many of the veterans as we can. We work with the state of Missouri on hiring heroes. Get a lot of very good help, trustworthy, very diligent on doing their job right. We hire many kids out of Rogersville High School that will come over here and work through the summer and a lot of them will come and work after they get out of school. They like it so well. Being from this area pretty much my whole life I know a lot of the customers and they are kids or family from people I knew since I was a small child. They come to rent things from us because the expense of buying it for a one or two time use is not worth it. But we can spread that out through all our customers and make it where it's an excellent deal to help their business and their farm. You will also see many different visitors throughout the store that have four legs and welcome you with kindness as you walk in to visit with the Wildcat Rental Team. We are called the Wildcats in Rogersville and we do have five wildcats and a wild dog that we took in from the road and they will meet you every day when you come into the store and they will be there to help you sign your contract on the counter. As you can see Wildcat Rental has it all. In fact they are one of the top five largest independent rental companies in the state of Missouri. what's its to do for y Excuse me bothering you?am
