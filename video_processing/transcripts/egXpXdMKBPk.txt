Howto & Style
 Hello my friends, welcome back. I've got a quick gardening tip for you. You're not going to want to miss this one I'm going to share with you how to grow the largest bunches of grapes that you've ever grown before. This applies to everybody regardless of your grapevine growing style. If you've got it perfectly pruned and trained on a trellis, if you've got it growing up a garden arbor covering your patio as a privacy screen, what have you. You're gonna have a bunch of bunches of grapes developing and there's a simple little trick, a couple different things you can do to ensure that you get the largest bunches of grapes. So the name of the game here is really to reduce the plants overall energy expenditure, what it's doing to produce more foliage, more grape bunches. We want to kind of take that back a little bit so that it can focus its energy on each individual bunch that we leave. So first things first, look at the base of your grape vines. Do you see any shoots popping up at the base? Well, those are suckers. You're gonna want to pull those out. Those are gonna take up nutrients, take water away from the main plant. Next you want to go up about two to three feet up the base of the trunk of the vine. Do you see any shoots that are coming off down low? They're just gonna be touching the ground, inviting insects like ants to crawl up into your vine. Well, those are called water shoots. You want to prune those away. Next you can go down each cane. That's going to be the shoot that has developed off the main cordon branch. And you can go ahead and reduce those grape bunches to two per cane. And whether you do all that other stuff that I just mentioned or not, this is what's really important here. You want to take off the bottom part of each one of these grape bunches. Just like that. What this is going to do, once again, is allow this bunch to focus its energy on the grapes that are remaining on this little bunch. It's just like fruit tree thinning. You take away some of the fruits. You allow the remaining fruits to get larger. Same concept here on the grapes. So whether you're pruning the rest of your grape vines to be orderly or not, if you could just go around and clip off a bunch of the bottom sections of these bunches, you're gonna get larger grapes. So if nothing else, you can just go around and do this. Now what I found over the years growing grapes, and this variety back here is the Thompson Flame Seedless, is that a lot of these backyard varieties, it doesn't really matter all that much exactly how you prune during dormant season, whether you're doing cane or spur pruning. I've actually done both styles on this grape vine and got equal results. And then this year I did no dormant pruning. I just let it go a little bit more wild. And I'm really liking what I'm seeing here. So just keep in mind that when you're growing grapes at home, it's different from being a commercial grower. So it's good to know the proper techniques on how to grow and train grapes. But experiment a little bit and see what works for you. One of the best things I found that you can do is actually summer pruning. So when these grape vines really start taking off here later in the season, you're gonna want to take back some of that foliage and allow the sun to penetrate. You want good airflow and good sun penetration throughout your entire vine. And remember, the grape leaves also have edible qualities. If you ever had dolmus, well, you can make things with the grape leaves so they don't need to go to waste. Harvest those as a food crop as well. So there you go. There's my tip for you. Helping you to grow some large, delicious bunches of grapes. It's easy to do. Hopefully you're growing some grapes in your backyard. So with that, I want to wish you all a great rest of the night. Until next time, this is Dan from Platteabundance.com. Take care. I'll be talking to you again soon.
