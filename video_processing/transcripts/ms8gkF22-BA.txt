 Whenever people are asked to describe important factors that contribute to growth of crops, they tend to forget biotic factors. It's easy to remember things like sunlight, water, sorotep, and the likes, but what about the activities of living things that could affect corpid either negatively or positively. Let's take pests for example. Pests only have negative things to contribute. Some of them are vectors and spread diseases, others destroy plants completely. That's not all though. There are certain soil organisms that aid the fertility of the soil. They are needed to aid the absorption of nutrients by the plants. These living factors can all be referred to as biotic factors. Biotic factors include soil organisms, pests, and parasites, and we'll be looking at the relevance of each of them. Soil organisms include organisms like bacteria, fungi, earthworms, and termites. Some of these organisms cause diseases. Others aid aeration in the soil, percolation, and fertility. They aid in fertility by decomposing plant materials to form humus. Pests are not biotic factors and they include insects, rodents, birds, and some mammals. They reduce the yield of crops and animals, reduce their quality, and reduce the income of farmers. They also significantly increase the cost of production. Another biotic factor to consider are parasites. Parasites include ticks, liver, fluke, stateworm, doda, and micellar too. Just like pests, they reduce the yield and quality of production. They could also lead to death of the plants and animals. They reduce the farmers' income and cost of control also increases the cost of production. Soil羽生, we'll be talking the same. See you in the next lesson. See you next lesson.
