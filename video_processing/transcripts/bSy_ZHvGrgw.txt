 Hi, it's Mike with AskTractorMike.com. Have viewer mail today from Kim. And Kim and her husband live in Idaho. And they're trying to get a tractor to use on their property that they recently purchased. And in the letter, she tells me all about their property and what they're trying to do. And she says, my husband has been racking his brain trying to figure out what would be the best scenario for him. Tractors are very expensive, all shapes and sizes, which is true. They've thought about options like buying a tractor outright, leasing a tractor, or renting a tractor. And she says, it seems like every scenario is kind of pricey. Well, Kim, it is. Just about any way you go, getting a tractor is kind of pricey. And today, I'm going to talk about something I've not talked about before, and that's leasing a tractor. And there are reasons to lease a tractor that I'm going to talk about today. And then in my next video, I'm going to talk out of the other side of my mouth about why not to lease a tractor, because there's reasons not to as well. So let's talk a little bit about leasing. My experience with leasing started in 1998. I was a salesman for Massey Ferguson Tractors. They had just come out with a 4200 series, which was built in the U.K., a tractor that was perfectly suited for southwest Missouri. The mid-range utility tractor, great hay tractor. And we were selling a few of them. And one morning, I get up, and I open my email, and holy cow, they have come out with a mother of all lease programs. Now, the company had been leasing larger tractors to farmers, but they never come out with a program to lease smaller tractors, like, you know, 55 to 100 horse tractors. And those were the kind of tractors that I sold. And when I saw this program, I'm like, oh, my goodness, I'm going to sell a lot of tractors if I get on the ball here. So we had three ports that southwest Missouri pulled from to get these 4200 series Massey tractors, Baltimore, Charleston, and Houston. And I was on the phone to one of my dealers who loved an opportunity to sell a bunch of tractors and make a little money. And I'm like, you're not going to believe this lease program they've got. And basically what it was was a pretty low interest rate program with a gigantic residual at the end. And I'll explain those terms in a minute. And he immediately knew we had a winner. And so we started getting on the phone to distribution saying, how many tractors do you have? How many can we get? And we started ordering tractors and we cleaned out Baltimore, Charleston, and Houston. Got all the good tractors headed to southwest Missouri. I sold a ton of tractors. Got to buy a house. Got to go on the trip. Everyone wanted to be like Mike. I was the king of the world for one year. But it didn't end well. And I'll tell you about that at the end of this video. So what's a lease? And how is it different from a financing program? Well, in a financing program normally you'll have a down payment, which is a balloon, shaped like a balloon, big number here. And then equal payments out to the end. With a lease program it's kind of just the opposite. You have low payments to get started and then a balloon at the end, which is called a residual. And so you start making payments at the beginning and you go to the end. And if you want to keep the tractor, you pay off the residual and it's yours. Or if you want to get a different tractor, you just let it go back to the company and trade any equity out of that tractor back to the dealer and walk away with a new tractor, which is what a lot of people do. Leasing is done all the time in cars. And if you've done it with a car and had good or bad luck, put it in the comments below. But not a lot of tractor people do it. It's an option for almost everybody, but it's not really used that much. Today I'm going to talk about eight reasons to lease, eight advantages of leasing and why you should look at a lease when you're getting a tractor. Well, the first advantage of leasing, and this is not for you, but it's for the industry in general. And it's why I think the car guys really push leasing. It builds a nice supply of late model, low hour used inventory or low mild in car business used inventory. So when you lease a tractor, a certain percentage of people are going to make those payments and they get to the end. They want a new tractor. They're going to trade that equity out, start lease payments again and get another tractor. Well, the tractor they turn back in is a low hour late model tractor and is very attractive for a dealer to sell to somebody else. And if you've been shopping for tractors, you know the supply of nice quality late model used tractors is extremely limited. And if dealers would push leasing more, we'd have more supply there for the person that doesn't want to buy a new one. The lease return would come back. A dealer could recondition it and sell it. And actually, generally, dealers make more money on used equipment than they do on new, so it'd be a tremendous profit center. So I don't know why more dealers aren't trying to do lease programs because it builds late model, clean, good, used inventory. That's the number one advantage of leasing. The number two advantage of leasing, and this is the one everybody knows about, you get a new tractor if you turn the old tractor back in every two to four years. Generally, a lease will go from 24 to 36, 48 months. And at the end of that lease, if you want another tractor, you just turn that one back in. Like I said, trade the equity and get a new one. So if you're the kind of person that likes the latest and greatest technology and new shiny paint ever so often, maybe a lease is the way to go because it gives you the opportunity to get a brand new tractor every few years. Number three advantage of leasing, when I've done leasing before in the dealership world, I would try to tailor the warranty to the lease program. And a lot of manufacturers have pretty long warranty periods. And let's say you've got a five-year warranty and a four-year lease. Well, that's perfect because the person that leases the tractor to begin with is always going to be covered under warranty, has no worry about major breakdowns. And then when the dealer gets it back, if he does get it back, it's going to have a year remaining warranty, which is going to help him sell it to somebody else. So you get peace of mind that your tractor is always under warranty if you ask a dealer to make the warranty correspond to the lease term. And they can do that by buying an extended warranty if it's not long enough to begin with and just rolling that into the lease payment. Now, the number four advantage is there may be tax advantages to leasing. And don't ask me to explain this because I'm not a CPA, but I know that with lease payments, you can expense the payments. And if you're buying a tractor outright and using it in your business or on a farm, you can depreciate that amount. So if you've got all the depreciation you need going right now, you can lease a tractor and expense the payments off of your taxes. So number four reason to lease is it might give you a tax advantage. The number five advantage to leasing, and this is not always the case, but in a lot of cases when you're financing a tractor, that down payment is pretty big. So it could be 20% of the selling price. It could be 25, could be 30%. So you've got to come up with a slug of money to get into that financing program and then make payments after that. If your cash flow is a little tight, and maybe you've got a business that takes a lot of cash and you don't want to tie all that money up in that down payment, you can do a lease program and get into that tractor cheaper. A lot of times on a lease program, if you've got monthly payments, you make three payments in advance. The first, the second, and the last. If it's annual, semi-annual, or quarterly payments, a lot of times you make one payment up front. So the trick there is if you're tight on cash flow, do a lease and do quarterly payments, and hopefully most of the time you can get by with one payment up front. And that'll get you started using that tractor as cheaply as possible. The number six reason to lease is when you get to the end of that program and you've got that residual there, that might be negotiable. Now, not always, but sometimes I've got a friend that bought a couple of pickup trucks by leasing them, and he got to the end of the residual, and the dealer, for whatever reason, didn't want it back, so they cut the price of the residual a little bit to get him to keep the trucks. And this may be the play right now, guys, because we are short of inventory right now. There's hardly any tractors to choose from. So if you lease that tractor and you get to the end, and all of a sudden the pipeline is filled back up, and some of the people that have bought tractors, and we've sold a lot of tractors in the last few years, are returning them, or they're defaulting on their loans, and there's surplus inventory, and you get ready to turn that tractor back, and the finance company really doesn't want another tractor, they might negotiate that residual payment. So if you bought a $30,000 tractor with a 30% residual, and there's $9,000 remaining, you might offer them $7,500, and you keep the tractor, or $8,500, whatever, and they might roll that into a financing program, and then you continue to make payments, and you own it. You might win the game doing it that way. No guarantees on that one. The number seven reason to lease a tractor is it budgets for mistakes, especially if you're a first-time tractor buyer. You may not have a good idea of how big a tractor you want. So if you lease it, and you got the wrong size, at the end of the lease, you could just turn that back into the dealer, and lease the next size up or down, whichever way you go. I always say, generally, get the biggest tractor you can afford, unless you're going into the woods or a tight area somewhere, because you always seem to want the next bigger size tractor. You'll start with a 30-horse tractor like this with a 5-foot bush hog, and you go around the field a bunch of times. I got to have a bigger tractor. You get a 40-horse with a 6-foot bush hog. It makes it faster. Pretty soon, you've got a 90-horse tractor with a 15-foot bat wing, and you probably still want a bigger one. So doing a lease budgets for having the wrong product. And at the end of the lease, you just turn it back in, have them roll the equity from that lease program into either a down payment on a bigger tractor, or it could be smaller if you want to go down a size, and just roll that into a financing program. Number eight advantage of leasing, and I don't recommend this, but if it fits your lifestyle, this may be what you want to do. At the end of a lease program, you can walk away from it, give it back to the dealer, no strings attached, as long as it passes the inspection. And there's people that do this. Let's say that you bought a little place in the country, and you know you're only going to live there for four or five years. Maybe you do a five-year lease, or a 48-month lease, whatever fits your schedule. And at the end of that, you know you're going to give it back and just walk away from it. You don't have the hassle of trying to sell it or trying to trade it, or having people come to your house that are looking on Craigslist. You just give it back to the dealer, no strings attached. And that fits some people's lifestyle. You generally lose money by doing that. If you're going to do that, get the biggest residual you can at the end. And generally, after Massey Power Lease, you don't see huge residuals anymore. But if you can get that big residual, that'll get your payments down, and you'll have less equity in the tractor at the end, and you can just give it back to them and be done. Well, those are the advantages of leasing. I'll tell you the disadvantages of leasing in my next video. But to finish my story, Massey Power Lease was great for Mike. Everybody wanted to be like me. When we go to a meeting, they put my face up on the screen for selling all these tractors, and a lease actually counts to a company like a sale. And then the following year, they realized, oh my goodness, we've got too high a residual. These people are going to bring these tractors back at the end and just dump them on us, which they did. And it's going to cost us a bunch of money to get them ready to resell and get them gone again because it was recourse back to the company. They belonged to the company. And that's exactly what happened. People used the tractors for two or three years of the lease and then turned them back in. Now what they did to me, they raised my goal 15% in 1999 and took the power lease program away, and I was screwed from then on. So if you're in sales, you've had this happen. You have that one year where you sell everything and you're great, and then the next year they expect you to do 15% more, and there's no way to do it. I had that year, and it went on and on. And I went from being the most popular guy in the Massey Ferguson organization to be someone no one wanted to sit by because they were afraid someone was going to come around and fire them at the meeting. And so I got really unpopular really fast. And in the end, I heard they lost $26 million on that program, and anybody that was involved with it when they looked at you, it looked like they'd thrown up a little bit in their mouth, and it was like you'd stolen from the company. But they hired me to sell tractors, and by golly, for one year, Tractor Mike was a tractor-selling machine. Appreciate you watching my videos.
