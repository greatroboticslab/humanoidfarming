 Hello everyone, good afternoon. It's quite sunny noon. So today we are here at a place called Vantage View, a tropical experience, which is very closely located to the Western Ghats. And from Koyamathur, it's exactly a one-hour drive and quite pleasant area too. So here we have Mr. Rajan sir, MD of Green's Property Developers. So let's get to know what exactly Vantage View is about. Sir, hello sir, nice to meet you. So I had an overview of this project when I entered into this. So this is completely new to our Koyamathur people and surroundings everyone. So can you tell us about this project, sir? Actually, the project name is Vantage View. Okay. What we have visualized is the project captions we give are tropical experience. The thing is, a lot of vision we have visualized this project. And a lot of plans and with a lot of thoughts, a lot of innovations. I can assure the whole of Tamil Nadu, no one has done a project like this, a farmland. I can damn sure assure because with a lot of visions and with a lot of experience, actually I've been traveling in this farmland project for the past five to six years. So I've done a lot of projects. I've completed many projects. So I want to do this project with some high values like, so we started this project and almost 70% of the work has been already completed. So I'll be telling about what we are visualizing in this project, what we're going to do, what we're done and what will be coming up. All this I can explain to you. Sure, sir. Sir, so far we have done so many projects regarding to farmland everything. But this particular project, when I entered into it, I found most unique thing is like, we have all the amenities in a single frame. So how that is possible, sir? And also I wanted to know what are the amenities that you're giving in this farmland? Rightly, sir. Actually, what we have planned is, this is a project as I already said, it is Vantage View, a tropical experience. See, we wanted to do some international standard amenities initially and do the project. So what we have done is, once we enter inside, you can see this area. This is Balinese Park we have done. This is all to international standard. One already can show that what we have done over there. Likewise, opposite we have done in restover. Okay. Restover in the sense, that will be indoor actually. You can have 25 seater indoor. Okay. We have done a kitchen nearby. Apart from that, we have done a restaurant. What we say is, it is a restaurant come bar. Oh, nice. So that is 25 seater restover we have done. And outside people, around 130 people can be accommodated for a restaurant. So anyone from outside also can accommodate this restaurant? Yeah, yeah. A lot of, I'll explain you how these other people can come in also. I think people can access the restover and come here. Access the restaurant and come here. Yeah. Likewise, we have done a clubhouse there. Oh. That is, you'll be having a lot of things inside the clubhouse. See, once they come and a customer, as rightly said, once a customer comes in, they'll feel all these amenities in a particular place. See, they can use this restover here. They can use a restaurant there. They can use a swimming pool. They can use the club activities over there. They can use the spa here. This is all Thai spa here. So all these amenities combined, we have done a place like this. So what we mean is, see, something done unique in Coimbatore. I can challenge that. This will be the best project no one has done so far in Tamil Nadu. Yes, sir. I truly agree with your point. Because usually when we travel for a retreat or something, usually from the swimming pool, we need to travel for a clubhouse for a half a kilometer or something. Most of the time goes by walk. Yeah. But here I could see like all the things are in one place. Yeah. So that people will be very easy to access this and we have a very fun moments ago. Yeah. So what we have done is, as I said, a lot of things we are developing also, sir. In the other phase, what we are going to do is, we are doing a gym over there. Okay. And apart from a shuttle court, a pickleball court. Okay. And a kids playing zone. Oh. All these activities will be done. So what we, I mean is, this actually is a farmland. Honestly, saying it is a farmland, the minimum fragmentation is done is 21 cents. So what we have done is, any customers actually, any high-end customers, I mean, H&M in a sense, they want to have a place like this and they want to live in or they can have a weekend homes or a guesthouse, whatever they can plan, they can do it here. This place will have its 100% value. What I like to mean is, with a lot of vision we are doing, what the thing is, actually, the price what we quoted and what we are selling out also is very reasonable. I can compare the price also. What I say is, if a customer is going to purchase a cent of land in Shaibaba Colony or a half a cent in RS Puram, same cost if you are going to invest in this, with this international standard world-class amenities, you can purchase a lot from here. As I said, it is a minimum fragmentation is 21 cents. 21 cents. Okay. So what are the other benefits apart from amenities you are giving to the customers? I said, last four or five years I have been travelling here, this real estate. See, we have done some other projects. One project is named as Farm Retreat. Okay. That is in Oathareg. And we have done a project named Safarifa. You would have visited that. Yes, sir. It was quite a good project also. And we have done another project named Tritidat. Now presently we are doing another two projects. One is at Sholeur. The project name is Varahanate. And another project we are actually, that is around 54 acres of pan. It is free. India is based for electric area and it is going on. So in all these projects, we are developing the infrastructure as well as the amenities. Right now, if you take Farm Retreat, there is already we are given a restaurant there. There is Balinese type villas are there. Okay. We are given a library. Get together please, you are there. Likewise, in Safari Farms, you are done in a restaurant. Villas have been there. All these projects we are there. All of our palates. Any customer who purchase a property in Vantage View, we will give a privileged card to them. So the people who purchase from here also can access other properties. Yeah, other properties they can access. The major advantage is we give an offer for the customers who have this privilege card. They will be getting flatly 25 discount for all the projects. Oh, so this is something interesting and good thing to goza. Because we purchase from here, we have access to multiple projects. Because your projects, everything is a unique place. So right now we have five projects. Okay. After that we will be developing other projects. Any customer who holds a privilege card in this Vantage View, we will be having this offer to use all this stuff at least. Nice, nice to know sir. Because I think people after purchasing from here, they will ignore going to Resorts All the Aries. Yeah, sir. They will be traveling with the company itself. Yeah, yeah. Completely with Green's property itself, they will be developing like a bond, everything. So whenever they come over here, so they can spend some time over here. After next week, they can spend over with a different project. Yeah. So for that, you are giving the discount. Yeah, discount. This is only for the privileged customer. Those are going to purchase only in Vantage. Not other projects. Okay. Apart from that, we will be giving around 400 preferred cards to the customers. Okay. What we are going to do is that 400 cards will be selling at Rs 1 lakh per card. Likewise, if they are going to have that preferred card, they can use the amenities here in Vantage View or all other five projects. They will be getting 20% response. Is there any timeline for this, sir? Sir, 10 years we give. 10 years. Okay. It's a quite long period. Yeah, a long period we give. They can use this card for 10 years. 10 years. Not only them, they can bring in three other people along with them for using this. Okay. So totally four people can be accommodated once they have the card with them. Okay. Friends or cousins, whoever they be, they can bring in. So see, what happens is nowadays everyone runs in their lives essentially. Some H&S, I mean, some NRIs also run. They want to have a place where they want to have a peaceful street. Everyone is tense nowadays. They, their routine work they do. Lot of, even you take any professionals or any business people to like any NRI. They need a place where they should have such happiness. Like an uttered person assured to pancake you, this tropical experience. They will 100% per adult and they'll definitely be happy and they'll enjoy their life once they fracture their property. Yeah. Completely, sir. This could be something very private. Yeah. So they will have their own time within their circle. Say what will happen, see the nature, the air blows, sir. There won't be any noise pollution, air pollution, water pollution for generations to get us. Even if it is some 10 generations, if they want to own this asset, this place will remain like still in the same. Yeah. Usually, sir, like if we buy a project or build a villa, means usually family comes or two weeks, once or monthly, once or twice only, we will be able to. So other days the house or something flat will be, remains very calm. No one will be using our dirt. The main people's motives like that, we have purchased it, but we are not using it. Yeah. So main end of the day, when it comes to money that we are investing and doing everything. Yeah. People expect something should be on the return. Yeah. What we plan, see, with so many amenities, sir, I believe, a lot of hotbed, feed meetings can be done here. Oh. Even you can plan for some wedding marriages, wedding a cure. Okay. And you can have some get together, some birthday parties. All this place has been provided. So what will happen is, suppose any party, if they come, the villas are there, they can stay there. They can use all the amenities. Tic-tac-tick. They can have a corporate bedding also. Like, it's not just selling out a farmland, fragmenting the land, just making some stones over there, just selling a project. It's not like that. We do project with the International Center. We have done it. So if a customer is able to value this project, actually, I mean it. Customers really will like this particular project. Because comparatively, I have done many projects. But this is something very unique and crystal clear about. Because usually they don't tell about the return on interest. But at the end of the day, they will be like just selling us to the project and they will be moving out after a short of time. So this is what happens. All the other projects, what we are maintaining. The hospitality will be maintained by the company, lifelong. So nothing to worry about the customers. See this restaurant will be maintained by the company. It will be 25 hours into existence. So this place will be ideal for everyone. Sure. Sir, as you said, this particular project is very near and connecting to Ooty Road, everything. But still, people who watch this video should know about the exact location of this project. Actually, if you take it from Kwaimata, if you travel, you know Perinakambalai. Yes, sir. From Perinakambalai towards Wellingad Road. This particular place is Thayanur. Thayanur. The place where this project is located is Thayanur. Actually, as I rightly said, we have access for all the major roads. Thank you so much, sir, for your wonderful time to explain about this project entirely. And I had a view of this project when I entered it. But it was completely different and unique one comparatively to other projects whatsoever I have done. I really put a word or initiate everyone to just have a look on this project. Definitely, this is quite very interesting one. You would have never seen such projects in Kwaimata or surrounding so far. So, further details, you can contact to the given number in the screen. So, thank you so much, sir. And thank you for your valuable time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For now, I am going to go to the next episode of Kwaimata.
