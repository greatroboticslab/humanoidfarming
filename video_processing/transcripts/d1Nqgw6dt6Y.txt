 Each year, more and more livestock producers are finishing their cattle, lamb, and goats on pasture in North Carolina. Though there's a tremendous opportunity for producers who finish their livestock on forage, there's also a number of challenges associated with this system. The most notable challenge to forage finishing systems is the variable forage quality and quantity seen throughout the year. The goal is to have maximum forage quality and quantity coincide with peak nutrient demands of the herd or flock. In this case, we're talking finishing for meat. Understanding how this impacts animal performance and subsequently meat quality is key. Producers have options when it comes to creating a desirable meat product that consumers will like in a time frame that is economically viable. For producers with land that is accessible and easy to work, seeding stands of high quality improved forage is a great option. For instance, a producer could graze their cool season forages such as tall fescue or orchard grass in the spring and fall. A warm season forage like pearl millet in the summer and then winter annuals such as winter peas or wheat in the cold months. Cool season forages mixed with summer and winter forages make for an almost year-round grazing system. This system comes with high costs of establishing a stand, as well as the risks associated if that stand doesn't persist, but it does ensure good gains and a delicious meat product almost year-round. For those producers with land that can't easily be worked, a couple of options remain. Examples include frost-seeding perennial clover into cool season perennials or inter-seeding annual forages such as rye or winter annual clover into Bermuda grass. Farms with Bermuda grass have a great opportunity for extending grazing because it goes dormant in the fall when cool season grasses thrive. Climate does play a role in quantity and quality of forage, but the largest factor impacting this is grazing management. It's vital to understand your farm's overall stocking rate and how stocking density, length of stay, and paddock recovery time change throughout the year. Good grazing management also means an emergency reserve of harvest forage and a sacrifice pasture for times of drought. Regardless of farm system and grazing management, there will still be instances when forage quality and quantity are too low for finishing animals. At these times, understanding when and how to supplement feed, either harvested forage or concentrate, and what the additional production costs will be is key to the success of the operation. Having a supplemental feeding plan is especially important if you're finishing beef, lamb, or goat and direct marketing it to consumers. Factors such as times of malnutrition and low gains can impact the quality of your final meat product. In short, good forage quality and proper pasture management produces a quality meat product.
