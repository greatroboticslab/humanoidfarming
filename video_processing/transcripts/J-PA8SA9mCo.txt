 The crops here are mostly grown by machines with the help of just a few humans. This farm is one of the earliest to apply intelligent mechanized agriculture in Chongming, Shanghai. We have applied intelligent technology for about two years, working via apps and computers. Fertilization, ploughing, sewing, and so on can be done by machines. We are now about 75 percent mechanized and we expect it to exceed 80 percent. Machines do the tedious tasks. The crop is given just the right amount of water at optimal temperature and humidity. And computers control the growing conditions. But there are still things that the machines can't do that people have to fill in. The entire process only requires labor for the last part, picking. The rest can be mechanized. As there is a variety of vegetables, the shape and edible part are different. That's hard for a machine to deal with. China aims to make decisive progress in completing basic modernization of agriculture and rural areas by 2035. For the recent statistic data, the farmland or cropland digitalization level currently occupies just 17.7 percent. And for the agricultural greenhouse, it's up to 41 percent. But for the aquaculture digitalization level, just only 16 percent. Perhaps in the future, farmers may just stay at home and control robots that do the work.
