 You Thank you. Come, come. Pranam sister. God bless. How are you? Very good. Yeah, okay. What's wrong brother? Why is the double still burning? What? Double. That doesn't burn. But why? Papa. There she comes. Mummy. Oh my darling. How are you? I'm just fine. How about you? I'm fine. Seeing you after a long time. Okay, relax. Let me get something for you to drink. Sure, mama. Okay. Daddy, I need to talk to you on something very pressing. Do you know? The whole world says, we should not burn stubble. It causes a lot of harm to us. And as I was coming home, I saw in some fields, stubble is still burning. Why, Papa? Jyoti, I've explained to people a lot, but no one listens. Things must happen fast. Firstly, the field gets cleared and the sowing of wheat happens in time. See Atul, you have no idea this stubble burning is very damaging for us. If it continues, it's very harmful. I know, I know. But how do I explain to other farmers? Jyoti, listen to me. Tomorrow, there's a farmer's meet. We can go there and you can explain to them. Yes, Jyoti. You must go and attend the meeting and explain this to all. Oh yes, why not? After all, my sister is an agricultural scientist. Everyone will listen to you. Okay, enough of all this. Let my girl eat and rest a while. Drink, Paish. Drink, Jyoti. Drink, to her good health. Ah, there comes our Jyoti, friends. Good morning. As you all know, this girl from our village is now an agricultural scientist and today, she makes us all proud. Let's all give her a big hand. So, Mahinder, having done her studies, will she teach us farming as well? Ramesh, there is nothing to laugh about. She is a girl from Haryana, always ahead in everything. She has studied agriculture. In our today's farmers' meet, amongst us, amongst us, we have Dr. Jyoti, to share with us, some modern methods, and techniques in agriculture. Firstly, I seek blessings from all my seniors, and a heartfelt namaste to all. I have come to my village after a long time, and I am feeling much at peace coming to my village. But, to be honest, I am also feeling a little sad today, because stubble is being burnt in our village even today. But why? See, Jyoti, the land is ours, the stubble is ours, the damage is ours. So, how does it matter? Am I right? No, sir. The stubble that you burn, is not only bad for you, but is bad for others too. My child, we have been burning stubble for years now. Now you are saying it's bad. Uncle, the waste that we burn, creates great air pollution. Are you even aware, how many diseases it causes? like asthma, burning of ice, even something as bad as cancer can happen. Not just that, by burning stubble, your land also loses, nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and other very important elements of your land. And now, let me show you some more details on this. India produces over 500 million tons of agricultural waste annually, out of which approximately 70% comprise paddy, wheat, maize, and millet. Stubble burning causes release of greenhouse gases, which are a common cause for global warming, and also increase in frequency of floods and droughts. This stubble neither melts nor decomposes. How do we get rid of this? Uncle, the world has changed. It's time for us to change as well. See, I completely understand your problems. And today, I've come to share with you many new and brilliant ways of managing this stubble issue. Come on, first of all, let me show you a video on this. There are two ways of stubble management. In situ, this is when we resolve the agricultural waste within the field itself. The other method is called ex-situ, where the stubble is taken away from the fields and utilized. Our farmers can utilize the poosa decomposer in varied applications. Firstly, if we talk about stubble, we can use it both in the fields and also outside. Inside the field, mix 10 liters of poosa decomposer in 200 liters of water and spray in the fields. Then mix the stubble and the mixture properly, irrigate the land slightly and leave it. After 10 to 15 days of irrigation, you can sow any seeds of your choice. After harvesting with the combine, you can do the sowing of wheat with the happy seeder machine. Thus, we can have very good germination. In ex-situ, a modern machine called bala is also used. The stubble that lies in the fields can be made into blocks or bales and can be taken away from the fields for better management. In a one-acre land, with a bala machine, one can make 12 to 15 quintals of bales. Our farmers burn stubble. So, they don't burn it and NCR of Delhi does not get polluted. We pay money and buy the stubble and convert them into biomass pellets. Now, instead of burning away the stubble, farmers are getting an additional income. Secondly, the pollution is decreasing. Thirdly, we supply all big power plants and MNCs that have boilers with biocoal and biofuel. Thus, their benefits as they don't need to buy coal. Signed coal is essentially imported in India. The country now is safe by importing less coal. Progressive farmers today who have adopted modern methods and technology instead of burning stubble, they are, in fact, helping the country in converting agricultural waste to wealth. My child, you told us a lot about paddy. But I am a banana farmer. Do you have something for me as well? Well, Uncle, let me show you how. In India, approximately 80 million tons of crop residue comes out of banana farming annually. This banana waste has tremendous industrial utilization. But because of lack of knowledge, we fail to encash its benefits. The banana crop residue is a source for many by-products. from banana pseudo-stem, we derive fabric, ropes, and other packing materials. Thus, banana crop residue selling is highly profitable. We dehydrate the banana stem and derive banana fiber, banana bricks, and manure. The crop waste helps make high-quality organic fertilizer. If all farmers adopt these techniques, then they surely will make double profits. On one hand, without any expense, they will have organic fertilizer. On the other, they will make a better future in this trade. banana pseudo-stem contains high degree of potassium and nitrogen. That's why after harvest, if biostimulants made out of residue are applied to the field, the soil regains all its rich minerals. waste management of banana is a must. Our endeavor is to ensure that this waste management should benefit both the farmers and the environment. For this, our efforts are on. It is also the dream of our Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi how to encourage our farmers to use less of chemical fertilizer and pesticides and adopt traditional means of farming. how to encourage them. I am working on whatever produce comes from their fields basis that how to provide them with biofertilizer cost-effectively so that they can also benefit more. Similarly, the residue of cotton plants can be used as fuel. For our biomass plant, we buy residue waste of cotton, coriander, fennel, etc. from farmers. The cost is say rupees 1 to 1.5. Then, we sell the processed material in the market at a price say around rupees 5 to 6 or 7 depending on the market rates. after the extraction of oil from the groundnuts from the residue oil cakes that are healthy cattle feed and fertilizers that help increase the nitrogen level of the soil that's very beneficial for the next crop. Jyoti, you know, to help farmers earn profits from the crop residue, Kripco Green Energy has been established. Yes, sir. I am absolutely aware of this. Wait a minute. I also have that video of Honorable Mr. Amit Shah. Kapaas Tob Smith Let's hear about our 46 cál лес and he will also be able to build this culture. And this center of Krupko, will be able to build a new foundation of the living of the living of the living of the living. Well, today I have taken a lot of your time. And I really hope that today's learning and meeting will really benefit you all. And yes, in our village, stubble will not be burnt anymore. Wow Jyoti, you have opened our eyes today. So friends, from today we farmers will not burn stubble. Rather, we will create wealth out of this waste. What say? God bless you my child.
