 Welcome to the Agronomy and Farm Management Podcast. I'm Amanda Doritas. And I'm Elizabeth Hawkins. We are both employees of Ohio State University Extension, and we're excited to bring you this podcast on what's happening in the field and farm office. We'll be releasing a new podcast every other Wednesday, varying topics between agronomy and farm management. Our goal is to help you stay up to date on changing field conditions, crop management, grain markets, budgets, and farm policy. We'll invite experts in who have a direct line to the heart of these issues, so join us every other Wednesday to learn more about improving your bottom line.
