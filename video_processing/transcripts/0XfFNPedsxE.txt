 With precision agriculture, farmers need to know precisely what inputs are needed where, in what amount and when. This requires collecting a lot of information from different sources and in different parts of the field on things like soil nutrients, the presence of pests and weeds, the level of greenness of the plants, inputs applied, and the weather forecast. Once collected, this information needs to be analyzed to produce agronomic recommendations. For instance, given the developmental stage of a plant, its level of greenness may reveal its nutritional needs. This information, combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant is located and a forecast of the weather, can be used to determine how much of a certain fertilizer should be applied to that plant the next day. Delivering agronomic recommendations on time to farmers and ensuring they are able to apply these recommendations is key. Farmers need to have all the necessary inputs at hand and be able to translate the recommendations into actions in the field. To solve this problem, big farmers use sophisticated machinery that collects geo-referenced information on soil characteristics, yields, and greenness of the plants. These machines are often connected to the internet and send the information automatically to ag big data firms that analyze the information and send agronomic instructions back to the machines, which are able to automatically apply them in the field. For instance, using robotic devices attached to GPS-guided tractors. However, solutions like these may be economically infeasible for medium and small-scale farmers. These farmers lack the scale to afford that sophisticated machinery, lack the knowledge to operate the non-automatic aspects of the machines, and lack the resources to hire a person who knows how to do it. Sometimes, many of the necessary complements are not readily available, or there is no connection to the internet, or there are not sufficient skilled workers. However, a number of solutions are being developed to many of the problems that medium and small-scale farmers face when trying to implement precision agriculture technologies. Easy to operate, economic sensors to measure soil humidity, salinity, and nutrient content. Portable networks to transmit the data collected by field sensors to a central location, as well as economic ways to connect to the internet. Remote sensing through the use of satellite imagery to assess the health status of plants in an economic way, and without requiring that producers know how to operate a device or interpret complex data. The new sharing economy is creating opportunities for farmers to just pay for the services they need, whenever they need them, very similar to the way that Uber operates. And there are many firms competing to provide other services such as drones, data analytics, and forecasting. All of these technological developments are pieces of a puzzle that needs to be put together to make precision agriculture a real option for medium and small-scale producers. All of these computers.
