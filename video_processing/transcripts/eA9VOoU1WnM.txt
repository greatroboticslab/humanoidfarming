 Andrew Markley here with Wiese USA. I'd like to give you a little tutorial of why you should use Wiese Rental for all your material handling needs. The true backbone of Wiese Rental is our service department and technicians. They are second to none in the industry with countless years of experience. Here at Wiese Rental we have one of the largest and most up-to-date rental fleets in the industry. We are constantly cycling out equipment in our fleet to ensure you receive the latest and most advanced technology on the market for your operations. This also ensures that your company is getting the maximum efficiency possible out of our equipment. When we come up on a forklift we like to look around it and check for any oil spills, leaks, or any damage that could be caused to the forklift from any previous users. Second, after I'm sure there's no oil leaks, I like to come over to my LP tank and I like to turn on my LP tank a quarter turn. All the fluid is not rushed in the system and wants to slow intake. After it sits for a second, I like to turn it fully open and now I'm ready for operations. You never want to get on the forklift on the passenger side due to safety of accidentally hitting the levers. I like to walk around to the driver's side of the forklift where I have three points of contact at all times. This way I ensure there's less chance of flipping falls and it's better for safety. Contact your local Wiese rental department for all your material handling needs.
