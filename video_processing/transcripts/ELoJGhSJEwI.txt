Education
 Jamil will never forget the day his brother Mukta came back home. They lived in a very poor community in northern Nigeria. Mukta had won a scholarship to study abroad when he was younger and had been gone for five whole years. Mukta always said that he would come back to the community one day and change it for the better. Mukta stayed true to his word because when he came back, life in the community never remained the same again. Farming in the north has its peculiar challenges, one of which is the pronounced dry season. It rarely rains and as such many crops do not do well. They mostly experience periods of food shortage until the next rainy season when they can plant again. So what exactly did Mukta do? Mukta began to organize training and demonstration programs educating the people on better farming practices. He taught them about how they could plant in the dry season by using better soil moisture conservative techniques. Mukta simply engaged in something that is called agricultural extension. Mukta brought back information on newer agricultural techniques that had been discovered through research and were of immense benefit to his people. Agricultural extension can therefore be defined as a process, system or service that assists farmers through educational training on improving farming methods and techniques. You can also describe it as an informal voluntary agricultural educational program that involves the dissemination of information from researchers to farmers. Mukta became a link between researchers and his local community. Agricultural extension has so many benefits and one is its potential to completely raise the standard of living in a community. Let's ask Mukta himself. The standard of living in Mukta's community greatly increased because Mukta didn't just teach them about new agricultural techniques. He taught them how to market their produce as well by identifying proper marketing channels. Mukta showed them how to access loans in order to boost their productivity. And to top it all, Mukta's community began to experience rapid development because their economy had improved. Agricultural extension has the potential to accelerate the development of any community and is vital for the success of any local farmer. Thank you so much for your time. See you next class. Bye.
