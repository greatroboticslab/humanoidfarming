 You were tired of grocery shopping so you went out and bought some chick this spring. And five months later you're ready for her to start carrying her own weight by giving you fresh butt nuggets. Well here's five tips to make sure everything goes smoothly. At 16 to 18 weeks you'll want to switch from a grower feed to an actual laying feed. These feeds contain less protein and higher amounts of calcium. Most feeds are scientifically designed for the right amount of calcium for proper eggshell development. But not every breed or feed are the same so it's still a good idea to have a source of supplemental calcium readily available. Make sure you have enough nesting boxes. A good rule of thumb is one nesting box for every four birds. And you'll want to make them nice and comfy with these natural aspen nesting pads from Eat and Pet and Pasture. Just like us humans an egg is around 75% water. So without proper hydration a hen is going to have a difficult time laying eggs. Keep the fresh water coming. To avoid stress and distractions it's best to leave them alone in the morning time. These are prime laying hours so it's best to leave your chores and treats for the afternoon.
