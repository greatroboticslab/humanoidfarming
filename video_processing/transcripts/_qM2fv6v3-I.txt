Science & Technology
 Healthy soil is the foundation of organic farming. USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service can help organic farmers with conservation plans that build and maintain healthy soil. Plant and species diversity improves soil biology. By rotating crops across their fields from season to season, organic farmers add biodiversity and increase resilience in their operations. They also reduce pesticide costs by naturally breaking the cycle of weeds, soil-borne diseases, and some soil-dwelling insects, while increasing their soil's organic matter. And instead of leaving land fallow after each harvest, many organic farmers grow cover crops throughout the year. These versatile crops also provide valuable ecosystem services that improve soil structure and increase its moisture-absorbing capacity. And by keeping the ground covered, they help trap and store nutrients to support future crops. Cover crops also prevent the loss of valuable topsoil by reducing soil erosion and runoff. Runoff that would otherwise degrade the quality of streams, rivers, and water bodies, and pose a serious threat to human and ecosystem health. Cover crops can also work as mulch to effectively suppress weed growth. And at the end of their growing season, the residue of these cover crops provides an additional source of soil cover, as well as nutrients that sequester carbon and build soil organic matter. Decaying vegetative matter and food waste can also be converted into compost, an efficient fertilizer that reduces the need to bring in additional nutrients from off-farm sources. These are just some of the soil-building practices you can develop with your local NRCS conservationist. They can provide you with both technical and financial assistance, ranging from assessing your farm's soils and resource concerns, to developing soil health management plans that maximize your soil's productivity through the use of beneficial conservation practices. To learn how organic farming systems use conservation practices like cover crops, erosion control, crop rotation, and nutrient management to build healthy soils, contact your local NRCS office, where they can help you help your land organically.
