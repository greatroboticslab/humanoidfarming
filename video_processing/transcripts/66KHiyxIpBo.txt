 My name is Bhuban Tapa. I am the lead author for this paper on strategic placement of urban agriculture using special optimization. Other co-authors for this paper are Rudy Vanerchey, Jeff Wilson, and Samantha Hamlin. So today I'd like to give you a brief overview of this paper. Many U.S. cities are facing challenges related to access to stress reduce, obesity, and bacon plots. For example, a quarter of U.S. population today lives in urban areas of which one-tenth don't have access to stores that cell stress reduce. Similarly, obesity is a serious problem in many U.S. cities and at the same time what we have noticed is that we have seen an increase in vacant and abandoned properties in U.S. cities and that is partly due to de-industrialization, disinvestment, and sub-urbanization of the city areas. So to address this problem, many U.S. cities are trying to integrate or trying to convert these vacant parcels into urban agriculture and urban green space. These policies are partly informed by the emerging research and potential benefit of urban agriculture in improving food access, community health, and urban environment. So our main goal of this project is to use spatial optimization to improve site location for new urban agriculture so that we can optimize food access while also incorporating obesity factors. Just to give you an overview of the study area, we conducted the study in the city of Indianapolis in Indiana, which is the 15th most populous city in the U.S. with roughly around 880,000 people. As noted on this figure, the city has major problems with obesity, food inaccessibility, and vacant parcels. So we use P-median optimization for our study and we incorporate different weights as I have mentioned here related to economic factors, geographic accessibility factors, and also information access factors. And as I've already said, we have used stakeholder input to determine the weights on these criteria variables. And also, we also looked at different scenarios with various combination of weights just to see how the spatial locations are affected by by the weights. This is one of the results from our study. This shows you the optimal locations of new urban agriculture sites while for different scenarios. The red dot, for example, represents the obesity-focused weight, whereas the green dots are stakeholder-driven weights, where the weights are determined as stakeholders, the blue dots are the same. The blue dots are the same. The blue dots are equal weights. Overall, the main points of the study are that the spatial optimization are more efficient in identifying locations than any randomly selected method. We also find that there is no significant difference between the three policy scenarios, which implies that those different scenarios are very, very interconnected with each other. And finally, what we find is that the location of the garden is influenced by the weights. For example, in obesity-driven weights, those locations are more in areas that are obese. And finally, we believe that the site selection is a very complex process and stakeholder inputs is very important in why we are making these decisions. And optimization method could be one technique that helps to really select the site based on some objective criteria. Thank you. you my
