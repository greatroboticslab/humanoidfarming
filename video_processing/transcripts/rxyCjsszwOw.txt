 Imagine never having to throw away expired food again. That's every prepper's dream, right? Well, guess what? It is possible. In this video, I'm going to go over 11 foods that never expire. Now, this doesn't mean that it's going to last 350 years. But a lot of these foods may outlast you. In uncertain times or emergency situations, having a stockpile of survival food can provide you with peace of mind knowing that you and your family, your loved ones, are taken care of. Certain pantry foods like box meals and dried fruit, those things you get from the store, are known for their easy storage. However, there are some specific types of foods that can surpass others in terms of shelf life. These endurance champs are essential for any prepper looking to bulk up their long-term food storage. In this video, I want to go over a few foods that, when they're stored properly, will last indefinitely. They can be stored away without you having to worry about whether they're going to expire in a year or so, or if they just get completely forgotten about and you have to throw them away. So the first one on the list here, and this is actually one, two, and three, and this is salt, sugar, and honey. The reason I wanted to do these all three together is because these are probably something that are the most well-known. Salt, sugar, and honey are three common kitchen staples known for their long shelf lives. Unlike many other foods that have expiration dates, these three ingredients seem to last indefinitely. So why is it that salt, sugar, and honey never expire? Let's start with the salt. Salt's a mineral composed of sodium chloride, and it's been used for centuries as a preservative. The way it works is by dehydrating the food and creating an environment that's inhospitable to bacteria and microorganisms. This is why salt meats and fish last for long periods of time without spoiling. Now, as for table salt, this goes through a refining process that removes impurities and additives, so it makes it even more stable and resistant to spoilage than just regular salt. Now, keep in mind, this is as long as they are stored in mylar bags. As long as it's stored in a cool, dry place, these will remain safe to consume indefinitely. Much like salt, we have sugar. Sugar attracts and retains moisture, which inhibits the growth of bacteria and molds. Sugar also has a low water activity level, which further prevents microbial growth. While sugar may harden over time due to it absorbing the moisture, it doesn't spoil or become unsafe to consume. Properly stored, sugar can last indefinitely without any loss of quality. And then finally, we come to honey, and honey is a natural sweetener produced from bees. Honey is highly concentrated and has really low water content, making it inhospitable for bacteria and other microorganisms to survive. Furthermore, honey has a low pH level, which also inhibits the growth of bacteria. So, when it comes to salt, sugar, and honey, they all have properties that make them resistant to spoilage and allow them to last indefinitely. Salt's ability to dehydrate and preserve food, sugar's low water activity, and honey's antimicrobial properties all contribute to their long-shell lives. Okay, so on to number four here, and this is canned meat, a protein powerhouse. When it comes to survival food, canned meat is the top contender. Not only does it provide a good source of protein, but it also has an impressive shelf life. Canned meats like chicken, beef, and pork can last much longer than the best-by date or the expiration date printed on the can. The key is to ensure that the cans are in good condition. They don't have any dents, they don't have any bulges, or anything that would indicate that the food inside may be bad. Also, when you do open them, make sure and do a visual inspection. Smell them. That's your best tool. It's probably your nose. The main reason behind canned meat never expiring is the process of canning itself. Canning involves sealing the meat in an airtight container and subjecting it to high temperatures. Effectively, this kills the bacteria and the microorganisms that could cause spoilage. The absence of oxygen and the high temperatures used during the canning process create an environment that's inhospitable to the bacteria. This prevents their growth and ensuring the meat stays safe to consume for years and years. Now, it is important to note that while canned meat may not technically expire, its quality and taste may deteriorate over time. So, the texture and the flavor may change, and the nutritional value in the meat may decrease. It's still going to be safe to eat. So, number five here, we have white rice, long grain rice. White rice is one of these survival foods that shouldn't be overlooked. Researchers have found that when stored properly, like mylar bags with oxygen absorbers and at room temperature, white rice can maintain its nutrient content and its flavor for up to 30 years, makes it an excellent option for long-term food storage. Rice has been a staple food for centuries due to its incredible longevity. So, it's really no wonder that it's become such a popular choice with preppers or those seeking long-term food storage options. Now, unlike brown rice, white rice has a longer shelf life due to the absence of the natural oils. The absence of these oils prevents spoilage, ensures that the rice will remain edible for extended periods of time. So, keep that in mind. Brown rice is, you've only got a few years on, and white rice is much, much longer than that. Number six here on the list is pasta. And pasta is not only a versatile ingredient in the kitchen, but it's also a reliable survival food. With proper storage, pasta can last for 20 or 30 years. Now, in the kitchen, in the packaging that comes from the stores, you're looking at a couple years. But, if stored properly, it makes an excellent addition to your long-term food storage supply. Now, to ensure the longevity of your pasta, make sure you store it in airtight containers like five-gallon buckets, inside mylar bags with oxygen absorbers in a cool, dry place. This will help prevent moisture and pests from compromising its quality. With pasta in your long-term food storage, you can whip up a comforting meal, even in the most challenging of times. Whether you're talking about spaghetti noodles or macaroni, there are many different types of pasta to choose from. One of the main reasons pasta lasts so long is because it's made from durum wheat. And durum wheat is a hard variety of wheat with high protein content. This high protein content makes pasta less susceptible to spoilage and degradation over time. Also, the low moisture content in pasta inhibits the growth of bacteria and mold, which further contributes to its long shelf life. Much like rice, the simplicity of pasta makes it an ideal choice for long-term food storage because it requires minimal preparation and can be cooked with a variety of different ingredients, which makes it suitable for a wide range of meals. Whether it's being used for base sauces, soups, casseroles, or just simply, you know, making spaghetti by itself. Pasta provides a filling option for long-term food storage. All right, so number seven here on the list is beans. And this is the prepper favorite, right? Beans and rice. Dried beans are a nutritional powerhouse and also an essential component of any survival food pantry or anyone's long-term food storage. They're rich in protein, fiber, essential minerals, which makes them an excellent source of sustenance during emergencies or long-term situations. While the overall quality of beans may decrease after 30 years or so, they're still considered acceptable for consumption. Just like everything else, to store beans for the long haul, you need to ensure that they're properly dried and free of moisture before sealing them in airtight containers with mylar bags and oxygen absorbers. This all helps to prevent mold and insect infestation. When the time comes that you have to rely on beans or any of these on this list as a survival food, you'll be grateful that you have a supply of these nutrient-dense beans at your disposal. Number eight here on the list is canned fruits and vegetables. In times of crisis or when fresh fruits and vegetables aren't available, it's crucial to maintain a balanced diet that includes the fruits and vegetables, and it's important to include these in your long-term food storage. Canned fruits and vegetables are an excellent option for this because they retain their nutrients and flavor for extended periods of time. And just because the best-by date on the can says it's going to last a couple years, canned foods, much like the meat, last far beyond what the manufacturer's stated expiration date or best-by date is. The main reason these manufacturers put those dates on the can is a recommendation when that food is going to taste the best, when the consistency is going to be the best, but it doesn't mean that's when the food starts to spoil. The process of canning itself ensures that the food inside that can, as long as the can is not damaged, is going to last for years past that quote-unquote expiration date or best-by date. Number nine here I've got on the list is alcohol. And this may not seem like long-term food storage. It does have its merits. Certain types of alcohol, like vodka, have an indefinite shelf life. Although other flavors may change over time due to oxidation, as long as the bottle is sealed properly, the alcohol will remain safe to consume. In addition to providing a source of relaxation, comfort, or an escape, depending on how much you drink, during challenging times, alcohol can also be used for medical purposes. It can serve as an antiseptic, a disinfectant, and even a pain reliever. Just remember to, in a situation like that, you may want to escape the realities of the world, but consume alcohol responsibly and in moderation. To me, alcohol is so versatile and has so many different uses. Even if you don't store it for consumption, it's still something that's nice to have around. You put it on the shelf, and you don't have to worry about it going bad. You don't have to worry about rotation and inventory, anything like that. Number 10 here on the list is rolled oats. Good old-fashioned oatmeal, right? When it comes to long-term food storage, rolled oats are a breakfast staple and shouldn't be overlooked. Not only are they hearty and nutritious, but they also have an impressive shelf life. When stored properly in a cool, dry place inside of Mylar bags, rolled oats can last 20 or 30 years. While rolled oats are pretty versatile, they're not as versatile as, say, the rice or the pasta, but they can be used in various recipes. Like I said, the oatmeal, you've got granola bars, you've got cookies, a lot of different things you could do with those rolled oats. So their versatility and super long shelf life really make them an excellent addition to any long-term food storage plan. Number 11 here on the list is powdered milk. And in the absence of fresh milk, powdered milk is a reliable and long-lasting dairy alternative. It's not going to taste as good as regular milk, but it is an alternative. It's a popular choice for survival food due to its extended shelf life and ease of storage. Storing powdered milk in Mylar bags is an excellent way to ensure its long shelf life and that it maintains its quality over time. The shelf life of powdered milk stored in Mylar bags really depends on various factors, like the quality of the milk, the storage conditions, and the specific brand. When stored properly, though, in a cool, dry place and away from direct sunlight, powdered milk can typically have a shelf life of around 20 years or more. So like I said, this extended shelf life really makes it an ideal option for emergency storage. It's good if you have children that are eating breakfast cereals or even yourself. It's good for baking and different recipes that require milk in them. Just a great option to have in your long-term food storage. So when it comes to survival food and your long-term food storage, stocking up on some of these long-lasting options is essential. Whether you're a prepper or you're just simply somebody looking to be prepared for an emergency, having a supply of durable and nutritious foods will really give you peace of mind. From canned meats to rice to powdered milk, there's just a wide range of options to choose from. And by incorporating these survival foods into your pantry, you'll be ready to tackle any situation that comes your way. And another great thing about all of these foods is they really are a fairly low-cost option to bulk up your food storage. It does require a little bit of work putting them in mylar bags with oxygen and absorbers and inside a five-gallon bucket or storage container. But it really will save you a lot of money and it really will bulk up your food storage plan. And you will be glad you have them when the time comes.
