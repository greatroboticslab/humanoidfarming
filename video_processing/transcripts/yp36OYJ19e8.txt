 Good morning folks. Welcome back to the mountain. I'm Tony. I'm Joey from Gagnage Mountain Homestead. We know it's been a while. We've been so bad. I'm sorry. But today's a special video because today for the very first time ever we're gonna what? Milk goats. We're gonna milk goats. So you get to learn with us as we do it. I did make a milker so we don't have to do it by hand. We'll show you that in just a minute. We got to finish with the bun buns back here feeding them and then we'll get to the goats. We'll see you in a minute. Alright. We're gonna be milking. We're gonna release the babies first. So last night we separated the babies from their mothers for the first time. That's why they're all real loud. So we're gonna go in the barn now and check on the mothers and start milking. So I explained that I built a milker and this is our milker right here. And all this is a mason jar. I know right? And I know. I took a 20 milliliter syringe that goes on the teeth. And then this automotive vacuum pump for bleeding brakes. And that pulls vacuum into here and it just pulls the milk in. And that's it. So we're gonna try that in just a minute. The girls are being noisy because they want that feed. So, look at that. Alright. So now we're gonna pull out a goat and try to get her in the milking stand. Who's first? Gina, you're first. Come on, Gina. Come on. Come on. Jaina, you're first. Come on, Jaina. Come on. Come on, Jaina. Come on, Jaina. Come on. Come on. Good girl. Jaina. Good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Alright, well that was easier than expected. Yeah. Good job. Alright, now what I'm going to do, take our milker and we're going to find the teat and clean it off. Okay. Come on. It's okay. Yep, she's got milk. Oh yeah. Cool. Alright. I'm going to put this on the teat and start the suction. Come on. I'm going to stand up. Okay. You've got to stand up a little bit. If you can. Ugh. Ugh. I'm hungry. She doesn't want to go up break with this. Can you reach over and stand this jar up? Yep. There we go. Oh. Put it in front of him. There we go. Oh goodness. That thing does not want to stay up. Too much pressure. Oh look at that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Look at that. Look at that. Wow. Look at that. Oh, it's pretty good. Wow. Oh, it's pretty good. Wow. You want to keep your pressure between 7 and 10 psi. I know. You see mama? Yeah. On the little label. Wow. You're getting a lot of milk out of her. You see mama? Yeah. That's the one that was kind of full though. Remember? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're much more kind of full though. Remember? Yeah. And then as the pressure goes down, just pump it up a little bit. Pretty good. I know. You see your mama hot appara? Yeah. Good girl. Good job. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Stand up. I think that one's about done, isn't it? I'm not getting any more. Am I getting more? Not getting any more. I'm getting, it's not getting any more. Yeah.

So that one's about done. Nice. That's our first milking. Okay, so at least the pressure, go to the next tee. I can't see. You might have to put it on. I'm going to clean it first. So we're using baby ones just to clean anything that might be on it. Can you see in there? I can see. You're all right, Gina. All right, where is it? Put it on. Tell me when you're on. I'm on. Okay, I'm getting a little bit of pressure. Go back in. What are you doing? You getting milk yet? No. Nothing's coming out of her. She's got nothing to me like the other one. Okay, it might be empty. Yeah. It's odd. Okay, let's put it back on this one. Okay. I don't think I'm on good. I'm not getting any vacuum. There we go. There we go. No, she's not releasing. No, she's not releasing. I can milk her by hand a little bit. All right. All right. You certainly got pressure. I can milk her by hand a little bit. Yeah. She's taller than she's. So that's what we got for one side.

I'll give it a couple of... That's about 9. And we're getting a lot of milk out of her. That's awesome. Are you able to do this by yourself two more until we? We'll find out. If we get them into a system this week, we should be okay. And if you can't, you just don't do it. We'll do it that afternoon. That's all. I mean... Things happen. The unsurred will get used to the system and they'll be happy to get any bucket of food. Alright, I think... Yeah, she's about done with this one. Okay. Hang on. She'll try. Yeah, she's done with this one. Little button down here. I press that. It releases the pressure. Comes right off. Not bad for one side. Fresh goat's milk. Mmm-mmm. You get it? Yeah, I'm trying to squirt some out of it. Here. I'll show you. Just... I'm going to pinch and pull down. There we go. Okay, that's all. Just get a couple squirts out of it. Just clean anything out. Put it right in the pit. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right. Get pressure. Nope. I just lost it. There we go. There it comes. There we go. There it comes. There we go. Is it still coming? There it goes. Nope. Kind of hit the... Water a little bit and get things flowing. We're getting some. Ooh. There we go. See it coming in? See it coming in? There it goes. Okay. That's awesome! A lot easier than hand milking. Is she still doing work there? She's still coming out of it. Still streaming? Do it. Is she still good? She's still good. Still streaming? We're not going to completely milk them dry today because we want the babies the first day. We got half the cord already. Still streaming? Yes. Is Chuckle too? He wants mama. I've gone all night without milk. I want my milk. Still streaming? Yes, actually. We'll just keep running this side. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're so sweet. Here. Some of the alfalfa will be good. How are we looking at this? Just stay motivated. Yes. How are we looking at this? It's still streaming. Okay. It's gone now. Gone? Yep. We're going to release the pressure. This should slide right off. Yep. Alright. There. Okay. Come on, baby. I'll see you, babies. Out you go. Out. Out you go. Alright.

Go outside and get the hemlock. Go get the hemlock. No. You don't get it. No. It's alright. Where's the other full jar? The white one? Okay, Jaina. Diana is blue. We got another blue one, but that's okay. Alright, so, did you wipe? I did not wipe yet. So, not bad for our very first time milking goats, huh? Uh-huh. So, pinch and pull. Yeah. Pinch and pull. Yeah. Okay. Pinch and pull. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, not bad for our very first time milking goats, huh? Uh-huh. So, pinch and pull. Yeah. That's why the babies slam their heads into the others. She's standing up nice and tall, too. There we go. Here it comes. She's standing up nice and tall too. Here we go. Here it comes. Oh yeah, we got a stream in there right? Uh huh, oh yeah. Not getting much out of there. Here it comes. Okay, she's producing. How's the other side feel? Is it full? It feels more full. Here it comes. It's coming. She's not producing as much. But that's okay. Well, here it comes. Okay. Maybe. She wasn't streaming like Diana was. Diana was pouring straight out. Looks like Diana's gonna be our milk producer. Uh huh. There's some, but no water coming out. Oh, did you finish? Oh, it's all back. She's got a wicked full on her back here. I'm gonna try to get a better... Yeah, but her other side is... The side's really full too. She should be... Here it comes. Should I try to get a better... Yeah, I'm gonna try to get a better. You're not getting more, Diana. You can pen over to them at Peppelin Snow Isle if you want. See the most food motivated one we've got. That's Diana. Yeah, she loves food. She loves snacks. She wants more. She wants more. She will butt the other girls out of the way just to get more. This is a small stream, but it's not a... It's not huge. I bet the other side will have more. It's coming. It's just... Yeah. Little. It's not like... not like Diana. Diana's gonna be the milking queen. Milking queen. And her children are all over her. A little bit. Like... chasing her around. She's trying to come in. They're on her. Gimme, gimme! Gimme! She's still got plenty in there. Oh yeah. Well... Mom! I think we just have to learn better. Mm-hmm. So... Like I said, we're just learning this now. This is our first time milking goats. We just... We just happened to watch a lot of the juke-tube. And the juke-tube shows you how to do this. So... That's... That's how we learn to do it, huh? Yeah! So once again... Is it coming out? Yeah. I'm just keeping this between 7 and 10 PSI. We need more towards the 10. It's coming... Just slow. leaning more towards the tent it's coming just slow i can see a little stream it's still coming she's got a lot in there she's got a lot okay this side is getting emptier she got a lot on this hold on here i'll give you more i'll give you more too so chill out a little stream coming down look at that no jana at your heels good huh hi diana hey jana nice newbie no jana i'm butting you out of the way of the food ha honey they're gonna like it they're gonna like this just because they're getting fed and nobody's bothering them they're food motivated getting more it'll get easier so what will happen within the next couple days they're gonna just as soon as we look they're actually gonna start fighting each other for who comes out first right and they're gonna hop right up on this thing put their head right through all on their own yeah because they know they get their food and they get nobody bucking them in the bucking them out of the way and plus they're probably getting more than they would have over there because they only get like a handful yeah so now they'll get more and they'll be like okay let's go i'm just trying to make them understand that this is a good thing right now is it just the alfalfa or you doing the other stuff i did a little bit more of the chow the chow well the chow's good it's got added protein sugar in it for them to help to produce milk she's still got a very small stream that's how it's been the whole time it looks like it's going down yeah she's going down oops it farted not often you hear booby farts blood blood blood blood she's producing some not a lot actually that's just one side so we'll see what the other side does we do want to leave some for the babies this is the first milking so let's release release that did you clean the other side yet not yet grab that yep goat milk so we've explained this in the past neither joey or i like goats we never liked goat's milk till we tried the nigerian dwarf goat's milk you good i don't have anything coming out yet it takes practice give me your finger hold out your finger there it is got it that was joey's very first time manually milking a goat okay she's wrong but you got the feel of it yeah got the feel of it nothing somehow you think there's more involved all right yeah we're getting a lot more of this side aren't we yeah i know did you run out of food did you run out of snack yep i think alfalfa is so basic it's just alfalfa grass compressed is all it is i don't mind giving them more of that but they love it i know what a bummer so back to my story about goat's milk joey and i both we never liked it till we tried the nigerian dwarf goat milk and it tastes like raw cow's milk i grew up on raw milk nigerian dwarf goat milk is 28 butter fat you can actually like make ice cream out of it so i did not grow up on cow's milk at all quite the opposite but i really like straight from the moo to you as tony puts it straight from moo to you we're gonna come up with a different one for those great from bar to you better work on that one good good good time in nivia it's still coming good isn't it have great faith that you will come up with something this side's much better how's she doing okay she's holding back on the left side she is the left side yeah she's holding back so she gets to the baby it's okay sorry nubia i want some too darn it good girl nubia yeah good girl how's it coming still looking good yeah she's still producing okay her right side is definitely better than her left side good girl nubia this is actually going a lot better than i thought it would it helps there's three of us in here joey and i can do this and i'm gonna show judy i'm gonna show this is judy she's coming to visit the farm for a while judy's joey's sister say hi judy hi hi hi hi judy hi judy all right he likes getting us out of our comfort zones yes but that is my sister judy she's in from illinois she's come to visit us for a few days and that makes

just like joey just she's a a sweeter version of joey and then joey gave me the face and i said am i wrong and she goes no no good girl newbie you did great don't you do that funny coming out she's still streaming she's doing whoops what a lot of people do is they put restraints on the back legs from back here they'll tie the back which we didn't do but look at that that's awesome damn it ready yep you're whistling i know she's really good girl how we doing now you're good so this is what we got from nubia so far so nubia and diana did awesome jana well not so much she does only have one could be the reason she's still streaming i don't see anything do you see anything coming over there no here i think she's uh what a little bit no i think she's over she done giving us milk i think she's done okay a heavy release i think this was a great first time awesome first time good girl nubia okay so that's what nubia gave us so now what we're going to do we're going to bring this milk in the house and strain it then we refrigerate it so see you in a few so here we go this is what we got diana nubia and jana right right so now we're going to filter these and all we're going to use is one of these copper coffee filters the jute tubes showing that these are the best eh so joey's going to hold that and i'm just going to put what i'm just going to pour the milk in now we weren't sure do you mix them do you keep them separate we don't know but we're going to mix them morning henry and diana the big milk producer okay we really didn't filter anything out did we no no i see two little spots of something that's it but there's no blood in there there's no snotty stuff in there or anything it's just cool awesome and this is fresh goat's milk right here you can actually see the cream on the top already all right now we put it in a container and put it in the fridge all right here we go we're going to taste our first okay lie because we already tried it but we're going to do it for the camera our first taste of our own goat's milk that is awesome yeah i'll be honest i grew up on raw cow's milk and this tastes a lot like raw cow's milk it really does doesn't it it's fantastic so this is what we wound up with on our first day okay not too bad um the girls hold them back a little bit for the babies which is understandable and we're learning too we don't we don't
