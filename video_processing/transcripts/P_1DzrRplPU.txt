Howto & Style
 That's right. We can build a small shed, or in this case, loafing barn, in less than a day. Let me show you how we do it. We go through first and drop six holes in the ground and put four by fours. In this case, there's eight foot on the short end and ten foot on the long end. And we put two by sixes to stabilize the four by fours that we dropped in the ground. As you can see, we've got two by fours going across the top, which metal roofing will be attached to. This has all been done in a matter of about three hours. I'm guessing we're about halfway done at this point. And by the way, my just-turned-18 grandson has built 90% of this. Until next time, I'll see you down at the barn.
