 We're not saying that we're better than soil-based farming. We're not saying that aeroponics is better than soil-based farming, but what we can say is that we do save 95% water compared to soil-based crops. This can really have a massive impact on countries that are experiencing droughts or water shortages or places that have water scarcity, countries that are located in hot desert climates or for places that don't even have farmable land, for places that don't have fertile soil. All these places can benefit from water-saving agricultural methods that can really revolutionize the way that we approach the food supply chain.
