 Welcome to another segment of Notes from the Field. As we all know, when hay is down, it's important to get it dried and ready for baling, quickly, to maximize yield and quality. So today we're going to take a look at the 34 Series Hay Tedders from Frontier. There are two models in the series, the 3418 with a working width of 18 feet 2 inches, and the 3427 with a working width of 26 feet 6 inches. Both models incorporate high-end features in an affordably priced machine. Let's start with the new Finger Joint Drive System. When the Tedder is unfolded into operating position, the fingers fold together and lock into place. These joints reduce the number of moving parts and wear points and provide a more direct transfer of power for longer life and improved performance. The Tine Height can be adjusted using the Tine Height Adjustment lever. Turn clockwise to raise the tines or counterclockwise to lower them. Depending on stubble height or crop moisture or adjustments on the go, just use the tractor's selective control valve to raise or lower working height. The 3427 is equipped with a cart that the rotor assembly folds onto for transport. The cart's transport wheels features a hands-free locking mechanism that automatically locks the wheels in a straight-forward position for increased stability when the unit is in transport. When the unit unfolds into operating position, the transport locks are released and the transport wheels can then rotate freely for better maneuverability in the field. The 3418 features an over-center hydraulic folding design. So when changing from operating to transport position, there's no need to leave the tractor seat. These Hay Tedders are just two of more than 600 Frontier implements and attachments that are available exclusively from your John Deere dealer. No matter what you need to get done around your place, your John Deere dealer is the place to go for advice and equipment to tackle any job. So remember, for implements and attachments that help turn your tractor into the workhorse it was built to be, think Frontier and your John Deere dealer. soft reckonronics Ovid voting we havegeben Super Moose Aife оргans We have
