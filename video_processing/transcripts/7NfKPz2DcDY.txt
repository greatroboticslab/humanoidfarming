 So, overview about our institution and our focus and our role in the Swiss research landscape. So we are not a university or research institute, we are a part of the Federal Office of Economic Affairs, Education and Research and connected to the Federal Office of Agriculture and doing research in the ecosystem of all what is related to the food stuff. So what we see is our main drivers is in the moment driven by upcoming climate change, loss of biodiversity, but in the same sense, bringing food security and food safety for 10 million people in Switzerland soon and 10 billion people globally. Out of this part, we have a four year strategic program where we coordinate our research work. And so in the moment, the program is running from 2022 to 2025. So we are in the middle of this research program. And we are focusing to so six. I think I need to switch this here. In this six focus areas, my research division is mainly acting in this area here, sustainable and healthy foods. But we have also, we define us as systems research covering real, all needs from primary production on farm to functional nutrition biology, how we as humans consume and get value out of our food. So this is driven by agriculture in changing climate, protecting the natural resources on one hand, getting most efficiency out of it, but also protecting those natural resources for the following generations. For all this production system, we are following a co ecological definitions. We have also research group looking for cost efficient and species appropriate animal husbandry. And in the other part, we need to look also set on the economical part, this farming and Swiss food manufacturing to stay competitive also in terms of economic sense. Just to give you a brief overview about the size of our institution, we are about 1100 people. Based on the fact that we are no universities also as PhD candidates we have in our institution are all based on partnerships with universities. Our output is also given in this balance that we want to create new knowledge. And the key priority of Acroscope is to transfer this knowledge as quick as possible to the practitioners, either farmers or with a special focus also to SMEs, food producing, food processing in Switzerland. You see this also we have about as a scientist is key for scientific publications in the upper right. So it's about 600 publications a year. But our main focus is real on this knowledge transfer. So we have also 800 practice oriented publications and more than 1200 presentations and posters to transfer this knowledge. What you see also is even if we don't have an obligation to teach because we are a pure applied research institute, but with all these collaborations we have with universities, our scientists also are embedded in a lot of teaching in Swiss universities abroad. Also based that we are a Swiss part of the Swiss government, it's key for us research is not going in a national silo. So if you see here, our research network and our actual collaborations, you see there is a focus to Europe, but we have also a lot of collaborations outside Europe with all over. So this is real driven by our, by our research interest where we find the best partnerships to move on with this research. In my division, the key part is this sustainable and healthy food. So we have four main areas. One is researching for microbiome in a, in a definition from soil to guts. So we want to have the overview about the function of microbes in the soil, in, in the food processing, like fermented foods, but also in terms of how, how we need. Uh, those microbes like in our gut microbiome. On the second side, we would, we are active in research and lowering some microbiome risks and antibiotic resistance based on food. And we are promoting quality and product innovation for food, as well as for feed. And we are looking, as mentioned, we see the human body itself as a biological system and doing their functional nutrition biology. Now I would like to give you some, some examples. So if you look to the global biomass, and this is in the moment, like in this actual analysis, we see about roughly 70% of plants. But if you look also to, to the microorganisms like a clear viruses, bacteria, protests, fungi, this is huge. And interestingly on the plants, we know pretty good. So the uncertainty is only 20%. If we look to the uncertainty in this estimates of the, and I've just take out of the publications of bacteria. In the moment, we even don't know the species and not the average. So we see here's uncertainty as a factor of 10. So this means it could also be the majority of the, of the global biomass could also be microorganisms, because in the moment we just don't know. And if we look to this short part of the animals, which are less than 1%, I have here just to spread out to show we as humans is just of the human biomass, almost neglectable. And I think so statistic is good to have in mind when we see our following research ongoing. So with our nutrition, we focus more or less to livestock and humans where we want to optimize feed and food, but also the health factor of this impact. But if we have the climate change in mind, we need to keep also this picture here very, very strong in mind with our activities and with our research questions. So within our institution, we have a real nice culture collection of about 80,000 isolates, with a very strong focus on lactobacteria, which is used for fermentation for the famous Swiss cheese as well. But we see more and more that just having this culture collection, we need to have more information about such collections. And these are all this bioinformatic pathways, which we have today. And you see the small blue sets apart of our culture collection, we have about 1000 now metagenome analyzed sequenced. And this is the way how we need to do this microbiome research, which is converting from traditional biochemistry into a more science based discipline, which is driven by molecular biology. And having and we have and seeing this, we can got such nice results so like seeing that research out of this was the science cover story, the most famous journal on this planet, showing what could be done with this bioinformatics, and seeing how quick microbiome like being tamed or modified and we come back to this later, when we see how we can easily change microorganisms by rapid evolution. But showing this next generation sequence and analysis of our genetic resources. So for us, it's key to to have standardized workflows that if we partner with us, so also strain collections are very emotional collections and ownership is pretty defined, but we need to find like a virtual layer data layer that we can combine different culture collections. So that's the reason why we have started with standard sequencing procedures, but also with complement with a data processing subsequent that we work on standardized workflows and we have. We have this is now like open source available through GitHub said everyone who would like to to sequence the culture collection or just some strains can use this platform. And at the end, and at the end, the researchers can commonly share this data platform if Sarah in in the searching for phenotypic genotypic research and have open access to this data. And when you find an interesting strain out of such a collection, then you need still to have material transfer agreement or you need to go in contact with this, but just to have the information that there are interesting strains around makes the research work much, much easier. So it's interesting to see how to be in the research work much easier to be at the same time and the research work. So in this available functions we have all these annotations we have filters that you can work with this data, you can search for annotations of the phenotypic description. There are pathway maps that you can already look to genetic islands where certain functions are localized. So this is one part because those culture collections or this process is behind to get more information about strains is key for the subsequent work. And based on this, we look also for how can we leverage this knowledge or how can we transfer those bacteria into the food sector. So we have actual in work a new method for the conservation of bacteria. So today you most use leuophilization for bacteria. Leuophilization is not as easy like for the microalgae and microalgae is getting a second highly interested area of research in my department. And we have found this new method for conservation of microorganisms suitable for bacteria and microalgae as well. It's highly energy efficient. It doesn't need a cold chain, has a long shelf life and very, very convenient in handling. And the best part, it could be used for neat materials. So just for the bacteria with a given CFU value, but it could also be used to prepare functional surfaces. So we can like code fibers as you see on this pictures on the right side. This fibers which are covered with a defined small consortium of bacteria. I think this is a very nice platform for bringing applications in food or also in feed industries or in substrate based plant production to bring microorganisms into those production systems in a very convenient and easy way. For our out of our culture collection, we have also a targeted research to find protecting cultures. So the goal here is to find to suppress the pathogens in food through feed competing with good bacteria, which have not an impact onto the health status. You see just some examples of Glostridia in cheese. Where you see, so these are both contaminated, all pictures are contaminated to cheeses. And you see these huge mistakes in terms of evolving gases coming from Glostridia. And then you have in the middle picture, a low dosage of this protecting cultures. And on the right picture, a high dosage. And you see already with a low dosage, you can reduce this impact. And with the high doses, you can completely suppress the negative impact of Glostridia in cheese. So we are now working with protecting cultures against Glostridia and against E. coli's, which are, I think, in dairy processing, the most harming food pathogens on the microbial basis. And being positive, also having those cultures in this new conservation method, which is then very convenient to use them in food industry during like food fermentation to access. So we can bring this functional surfaces to the inner part of food packaging, where we then can avoid the food pathogens to grow within the food facing part of the packaging. Coming to nutrition, which is also part. So on a high level, I think our know-how, which is generated with our research organization, has two main priorities. One thing is to promote economy in Switzerland in terms for farmers or for food processing or food manufacturing. And the other part is to ensure, with our knowledge, a healthy and sustainable diet for the Swiss population. If you look to the left-hand picture, this is a pyramid. This is a recommendation how our society should feed herself. On the right picture, you see how the society behaves actually. So it's not a pyramid. It's more a pagodi, which is not good for our health and which is not good for the environment. So you see we have too much high protein. We have too much of snacks, alcohol, sweets, too much animal fats, too less vegetable oils, too less fresh fruits and vegetables. So this is just the actual situation. So this is just the actual situation. How Swiss society consuming food or defining their individual diet. If we then look to the negative consequences for health, and this is more or less globally, so the Lancet study said dietary risks. And there is not a difference. The left-hand picture are the males and the right-hand pictures are the women. So there are some differences, but the dietary risks is the highest risk factor for diseases. And this shows us that this type of diet as we are using now in Switzerland is not healthy for us. On the other hand, we see also, and we did this calculations, this models. So the left-hand side is how we behave today. If we would move back to the pyramid, which is shown in the middle, we would reduce more than 50% of the carbon footprint of our individual nutrition. So this shows like the win-win situation we have with changing our dietary behavior in the society. And the society needs to be trained. We need to transfer knowledge to the society for this change in our dietary behavior. And I'm also convinced that there needs perhaps some modification in the legal framework, but the main motivation should come from each individual because it's a real win-win situation, how we should change this behavior. Again, because we are working with microorganisms. So looking to the microbiome diversity. And this shows just what diversity is needed. And this is just our, into the gastro part of our body. It's not what is on our skin and what, what we have other, but looking the biodiversity and, and the red dots here on this side is showing out of this genetic wheel. And this is also different microorganisms in our gut microbiome are originated. And this, this diversity shows to us, uh, that it's huge. It's huge. So we, as organisms, the human is much closer to any food, like a tomato or on a, on a genetic basis, as those bacteria sitting side to side in our gut. And this shows us also the chances and the risks of dietary, how we can influence this microbiome. So having here, good nutrition with a lot of dietary fiber, uh, fibers, with a lot of phytochemicals, with all these antioxidants, with prebiotics. And this side, the diet as we have today with, with a low amount of dietary fibers, with a lot of processed food, high amount of red meat out of this, a huge range of obese people. So having, um, having this, we see the host benefits to our gut microbiome. We got a lot of, in this blue part as positive part, we have a lot of gut immunity. And this negative side, we have all this, uh, uh, porting, this, in fact, and with this diet, we are reducing those risks. So we have no benefit here. And we are supporting that effect. And this shows us, if we compare this with macroscopic view, if you see this here as a picture of, of a good gut microbiome, this is huge. And this is also Alpine Meadows where Switzerland is famous for, which are really very rich, very diverse. This is also translated because we can't see our gut microbiome. And I want just to take this as a comparison. This is how our gut microbiome should look like. With our strong, this Western diet, as we do, the gut microbiome is coming into something like this. And when we send try to re-configure this with a change of dietary, it's not easy to go from this side back to this side. The probability that we go to this side is much higher and not having this diverse, just very limited. And on the right side, we see how this happens. So if we have this Westernized diet, as we have shown in this Pagodi, we enrich this red. It's a very small number. And we deplete the green ones, which we should have. So we are going more into such a picture than going back in like such a picture. I hope this comparison helps you how we try to do our research for how can we drive and promote a good gut microbiome by the impact of nutrition. And this is also for us, one of our actual research projects, which is named Fair Food, where we want to promote consumes of fermented foods. So we have shown that this selection of beneficial bacteria and fermented foods with a potential for this nutritional and health benefits. So we can drive the quality of fermented foods, which is very easy for the gut microbiome to handle with those nutrients. And then wanting to transform this into a public health part to bring this fermented foods into the Swiss diet. This is also based on on nutrigenomical research to show the effect of this change. Today, nutritional science is very much based on experience like medicine as well. And what we want to do here with biomakers, biomarkers is to show in nutrition research with methods, as we know from clinical diagnostics, which is really evidence based science. So if we find those biomarkers for good and positive nutrition and find biomarkers for not so good nutrition helps us a lot in defining the new dietary recommendations and send brings this to public health. So what we also do is just looking into like alternative novel foods, which are approaching the market, like with a lot of alternatives for animal based food, which are now designed with this plant based foods. So this picture shows just what we got into shop as alternatives for cow milk. And on the on the right hand, you see a scheme of a process how we get out of lupines. So a protein isolate, which is then used to formulate such a protein drink. And what we see is that. In this comparison, only the soy milk is roughly comparable from this does not mean that this other products are not good food materials, but you need just to take into account. Just take in consideration why you take individual foods into your diet. And if you compare this. So the protein content. So cow milk and so soy based alternative is pretty comparable on the protein content. And also in terms of the of the minerals and micronutrients. But if you look to this other like oat milk or which is very the protein content is on less than 15% of what milk cow milk has. And this is also when you send look to the life cycle assessment of those products. So life cycle assessment is normally done on a weight base. And I think the life cycle assessment of food materials should be done on a nutrient base, because why we take those food into our diet, because we need those nutrients, we need proteins, we need calcium and other micronutrients. And when we want to compare those products on one thing, we need to compare them on taste and on physical behavior, like the milk products as a ready to prepare a foam or something like this. But for me, the key priority is what is what is what is what is the nutrient density of those products, because only with this knowledge, I can integrate them wisely into my individual diet. Another part I mentioned is how to find out this evidence based. So how do we find biomarkers, which represent a good nutrition. This is in the moment mainly done with methods, as we know from clinical diagnostics where we take urine or blood as biometrics, but these are special as a blood is invasive method. We are now in a research consortium where we explore the exhalome. So what we press out to use this exhalome as biometrics to find metabolites. And you see, this is a very wide consortium of research institutions where we are part of a lot of research institutions like MPa or ETH or Paul Scherer Institute, but also most of the university hospitals. And we are here focusing with our activities into the metabolomics parts. So also a little bit in microbiome nutrition science, but we want to see or our goal is to find in the press nutrients metabolites which represent a good nutrition or not so good nutrition. So this is just Jones. So high resolution mass spec platform to do this. There's a press is coming from here to see source here and send we find those metabolites. And based we are not only interested in in the humans, we also apply this technology now to our animals. So we are going to show special here to show special here picture for for ruminants, where we show the effect of different diets in the exhalome sampling and looking for metabolites. For like exhaled volatile fatty acids or methane emissions, which are in the ongoing research for the ruminants quite high priority. So last part of my presentation, I would like focus to microalgae, which is also in the moment I've shown the role of microorganisms for food fermentation or in terms of food safety. Like so, but now I would like to go into microalgae, where we see the micro organisms themselves as very effective bioreactors for real high value nutrients like proteins or omega three fatty acids or lipids. And the main interesting part of those microalgae is that you can integrate the production of the bioreactors into buildings without any use of Arab land. And this is our goal that we can like in the in the livestock part that the farmer can produce the high protein feed materials themselves. So like a vertical integration also in terms of the value chain and on the other part that you really do not use Arab land to produce feed material. So we see also that Arab land should be used to produce directly for human nutrition and not for feed materials. So just go into the area of microalgae. It's such a huge biodiversity, which is in the moment, perhaps to a quarter explored for the rest, especially in the aquatic systems in the marine systems. We just do not know in total what around a species. And just looking also to the microscopy picture, which I think is a huge artwork of nature seeing the biodiversity of microalgae. So if you compare them on a visit with glasses of a scientist, if you compare, if you produce soybeans on a field, the best breeds. And we do also plant breeding and agroscope with a focus to adopting soys to Swiss climate. But this is a task to use soyssoy directly for human nutrition on one hectare. So on 10,000 square meters with the best soy breed we have today, we can produce protein to feed the protein demand of 40 people. If we take 1000 square meters and do a photo-autotrophic cultivation of microalgae, which means we do not need arable land. This could be roof surface or any area. With this, we can produce the annual demand of 520 people. It would be even better to plant sugar beet and to convert this with microalgae into protein. So this just shows the efficiency of this single cell bioreactors of microalgae or other microorganisms like yeast or fungi as well. Also looking to the scheme of the life cycle assessment of having centralized production of feed materials. We need fertilizers, plant watering, electricity for transportation and for processing labor you need for and then bringing this to the livestock part, comparing this to a photo bioreactors which are integrated on farm to the existing buildings. We haven't quantified this yet. We haven't quantified this yet. That's part of the ongoing projects. But just seeing the scheme of the LCA shows you that there's a huge advantage to be better with those on farm landless production of nutrients for animals as well as for humans. This shows where we are today in this. So we have scaled up from the flask to 200 liter tubular photo bioreactor. So we have already shown a scale up of 2000. But when we want to bring it to the buildings. And if we calculate for average Swiss farm, we need like a photo bioreactor volume of 50 to 70 cubic meters. There is still work to do, which we are happy to do. The other part of this nutrients by micro algae, we all know that salmon is very rich in omega three fatty acids. But this omega three fatty acids are not produced from the salmon. It's produced from the micro algae, which is feed of the salmon when he is in natural condition. When we aqua farm the salmon and feed it with soy powder. You see here how the content of omega three fatty acid decreases in aqua farm. Now it's increasing again because also in aqua farming process algae are used to feed the salmon again. But the cool part is seeing this result. So if we feed pork or beef with micro algae, we get the same amount of omega three fatty acids in beef or in pork meat as we have in salmon. And so we can add not only as advantage of not using Arab land, but also having a nutritional benefit to animal based food material. So that's how we want to integrate this in our research. So this is in the moment under construction for one new research campus sets animation of artists who I know personally who showed me some visualization. How that bioreactors could be integrated into buildings that we don't have this competition feed food, which is actually ongoing. And this was rough my overview to this with how a close group engages this in the research for food feed and nutrition. And now I'm happy to discuss. Yeah. I just don't want to relate to the size. I Maybe see. I either be confused as some peculiar concepts or something reals you made aיד flow. And now I'm happy from posting it up to the nationalppen겠어요 agency. I'll be sure to stay<|bg|> комнаate. Now see." So I've seen the image. I'm happy I know this is figurawol Wamb лож diamond ice madness. And now I'm happy to call it back to this��. Great, good thank you. I'll definitely help with it. I'll even help with it to try dizzy for the size of the skin.
