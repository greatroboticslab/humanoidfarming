 See how farmers are earning thousands of dollars by farming a certain type of mushroom. They use logs and drill holes in them, then fill the holes with a substance that looks like corn. The farmers sprinkle water on the logs for 10 days straight, after which the mushrooms are ready. Finally, the logs are put inside machines that separate the mushrooms, and they are sold in markets.
