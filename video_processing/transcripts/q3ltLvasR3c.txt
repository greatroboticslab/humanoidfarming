Howto & Style
 If you're ready to get more tomatoes off your plants this season, you got to have this in your compost pile. Take a look at these tomatoes and how they were so heavily pruned by an expert. This is how you do it. So you're going to prune a tomato to one main stem at the bottom. At about one foot tall, you allow them to branch out. And then every single week, you're going to cut off the leaves, only leaving the fruiting branches. The only leaves you leave on the plant are the ones right at the top to provide a canopy and a little bit of shade for your fruit. Look at all these leaves they've taken off their tomato plants. That's because they're directing the energy from their tomato plant to the fruit, not to the leaves. So they've got all this going to the compost pile and loads of fruit coming on their tomato.
