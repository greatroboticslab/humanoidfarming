 In the year 2050, there will be 9 billion people. How do we feed them safely, fairly and well? And make sure every mouth is fed. 40-year-old Munmohan Tiwari was working for a top financial firm in India's thriving capital, Delhi. A thousand people reporting to him. He had it all. Then he gained weight and lost confidence. His fight with obesity had begun. Now, in the last year, he's lost 30 kilos. My weight was around 97 kgs when I started in February 2011. And I reduced it to around 67-68 within 9 months. I used to look very unpresentable. There was a time that I used to feel that it's not possible for me to reduce my weight. I mean, life is so hard in a nucleus family where husband and wife are there and they both are working. So if they come back in the evening at 8 o'clock, now what to do? It's better for them to order a fast food kind of a thing rather than cooking a chapati or rice or a dal and sabri. For Munmohan, future food is healthy food. He's cupped the junk food, sugars, fats and salt and says there's a lesson for us all. Let's live a long life and a healthy life by having a discipline and a good food. Munmohan's won the battle. Prosperity without obesity. Now the rest of the world faces the same dilemma. How to feed the future without a new kind of malnutrition. As people have better incomes, the diets change, the culture changes, they want processed food, quick, fast. A double-career family. They all come back from work at about 6, 7, 8 p.m. What is the fastest food to cook? Open the can, open the packet and dump everything together. It's junk food. Every day as India awakes, 1.2 billion people need to be fed. By 2050, it could be 1.7 billion. Traditionally, Indians have eaten the healthy cuisine of India's 29 states. But as people move to the cities, there's a growing demand for fast processed food. The so-called junk food, accused of causing obesity and chronic health problems. Now India's a country on the edge of two possible futures. A future that's well-fed and healthy, or a future with Western diets and Western obesity. Now we are going into this whole Western sense. We think about burgers, we think about french fries. So it's like the hamburger assault. I like eating junk food at times, but it's not like I hate healthy food. Just banning junk food at school doesn't stop us from having junk food. As people have moved to the cities, they've become dependent on highly processed foods, which are heavy in sugar, in fat, in salt, which are processed in order to have a long shelf life. Instead, we must allow urban consumers to have access to fresh nutritious foods that are produced locally, because that is most healthy. Tulika Verma lives in the Delhi suburbs. She doesn't do junk food. She eats nutritious fresh food with husband Rahul and their son and daughter. They're appalled there have been no systems or guidelines in India to keep junk food away from schools, where they feel children are especially vulnerable. I don't rely on junk food because we are not sure what kind of ingredients they have and it's preparation also. These kind of foods can make them happy for a few minutes, but in the long time it will be... It will increase their problems what they are facing. Yes. Tulika and her husband run an NGO, the Uday Foundation, helping children with serious medical conditions. Mostly it's disease or genetic defects. But for many city kids like these, junk food is an increasing issue. What we notice is that some children are having health problems which are inborn or due to some disease. But some children are getting into it due to excessive consumption of junk food in their routine. And that is really harmful for their health. Malnutrition, experts say, can be an illness carried across the generations, especially by women. And prosperity is no guarantee of an end to malnutrition. Well, malnutrition is not that correlated with wealth in India. What you find is malnutrition can take a variety of forms. You can have low-calorie malnutrition, you can have high-calorie malnutrition. In the developed world, we're seeing an era of high-calorie malnutrition. In the developing world, we're seeing both. What I think is happening is very rapid economic growth is putting wealth in many new hands in contexts like India. So you have children who were born of mothers who were, you know, poorly nourished. And yet, as they grow up, they get access to more and more fat, more and more protein. We find that children of low birth weights, children with poor early childhood health, are at more risk of becoming obese, developing heart disease, developing diabetes, developing stroke. But those poor health indicators in early childhood give them a propensity to contract these types of illnesses later on in life. School kids in India are less likely to be overweight than young people in China, Russia, Brazil and the USA, where one in six young people are obese. But it's far from being entirely good news. Delhi-based Dr. Anup Mishra is one of the world's leading experts on nutrition and obesity. He's specially concerned about junk food's impact over time. I think it's damaging to all age groups. But the earlier you start, the worse it is because if you start from 9 to 11 years age group, and we have studied this particular age group, the obesity tends to become much more harmful within a short period of time. And these children exhibit a whole lot of biochemical problem that we find in adults. US-based writer on food Raj Patel has studied the effect of growing prosperity on India's diet and health. He says a switch to processed food is already taking its toll. If you walk in the streets, you won't notice people who are as overweight as they are, say, when you're walking in the streets of New York. But appearances can be deceptive. And actually, if you look at the diabetes rates, India's cities have diabetes rates that are far higher than the United States. If you look at some of the southern cities in India, diabetes rates are at 20%. That's an epidemic. So things are already very bad in India. And that's a mixture of the shift in diet plus genetic predisposition and a range of other social and biological factors. So things are already apocalyptically bad in India. Junk food gives the body energy without fibre, vitamins and other nutrients. Critics claim that can cause a health time bomb, potentially causing serious illnesses like diabetes later in life. Now these kids who are developing these obesity problems from 9 to 16 or 18 years age group, they will develop diabetes very soon. So maybe 20, 25 years age group and by 30, they will develop other complications, maybe heart disease. My advice to the Indian government is to take this very, very seriously. To look at what we already know about the causes of diabetes. And to get very aggressive with limiting the exposure, particularly the children have, to the marketing that encourages children to want these goods. But also to start getting very aggressive about thinking of new ways in which diet in urban areas can be transformed to leapfrog the public health issues that we already have in the United States. And to deal with the massive public health issues that they already have in India. A recent study revealed that already over one in six school children in Delhi are overweight and almost one in 14 are obese. It's one of the reasons why the courts are considering a call for a ban on junk foods in India's schools. Among the petitioners leading the campaign are the Uday Foundations, Tulika and Rahul. Today they're in court calling for India's Food Safety and Standards Authority to set up a new framework for the future of food in India's schools. Today we had a date in High Court regarding banning junk food in schools. Junk food should be banned. The government is very serious about this issue because it's related to the future generation of our country. That FSSSI might get the guidelines for banning junk food in schools. That's what we are fighting for. 21st century life is fueling a demand for quickly delivered food. Fast food that's too often unhealthy junk food. A younger population, more working women, hectic schedules. The increasing wealth of middle class professionals, usually office based. Some say it's not so much fast food as these new more sedentary lifestyles which cause obesity. And what's more, people have every right to eat what they want. I'm against laws that some people might be calling for to ban fast food or even junk food. That while this might be an issue for a tiny segment of India, it's not an issue for most others who are struggling just to get their midday meals. So how is it going to work? Would it mean that you extend the law to tell parents what they can feed their own children or not? In Delhi, fast food is not just Western style burgers and pizzas, but Indian equivalents like fried baturas, fried pakura and alu tikkis. The fast food industry in India is growing by a third a year. But does convenient fast food always have to be unhealthy junk food? Devyani International operate the North and East India franchises of KFC and Pizza Hut and their own Vango chain based on South Indian food. Their CEO says fast food in India has an unfair reputation. My personal take is anything that you over consume is bad for your health. Anything that you over consume here. When you look at the fast food, it's quite healthy, I would say. We use, I'll give examples, like we use zero trans fat oil, we cook a lot of salads, we cook a lot of soups in our options. My personal take is that fast food is not so bad what people perceive it to be. It's not just the big chains promoting the idea of healthy fast food. Tulika is visiting famous nutritionist Ishi Khosla. Remember Monmahan? Ishi Khosla is the woman whose healthy eating advice changed his life. Meet yours. She's founder of India's Whole Foods and she's been called one of the country's 25 most powerful women. Is it a status symbol of having junk food or fast food? Well it becomes a trend, it becomes like, you know, peer pressure or whatever. Future food could be health food disguised as ordinary pizzas, sodas or burgers. You don't say no to a burger but you make it healthier. You don't say no to a cookie but you make it healthier. Even the party here has flax seeds and we are using fantastic oil, rice bran oil which is a monounsaturated fat. So you silently do the health thing without a person getting that tag that I'm eating something very different. But can the global obesity epidemic be solved at the retail level? Some say obesity's fundamental cause is the way foods produced, the industrial, often subsidised farming of a few crops, transported over huge distances and heavily processed. So is there an alternative? Hulika's been doing some research, looking at TV films on how most foods still grown in India. There's Narayan and his wife Naseva in Andhra Pradesh. They use a blend of traditional knowledge and scientific techniques to grow seven different varieties of crops and vegetables on just a hundred metres of land. They only make about two dollars a day but that's still more than many small farmers in India and the rest of the world. Are you making money? Yes, I am. Do you eat your produce or do you sell it as well? We eat the produce and sell it as well. Half a billion small scale farmers like Narayan still supply most of India's food. For some who believe in market driven economics, this is not efficient. They say that in more advanced economies, farms are bigger and specialise in just a few crops, benefiting from economies of scale. That means fewer farmers who are, per person, more productive. The number of people who are dependent on agriculture is not a sign of our strength. It's a sign of our weakness. Every country which has developed agriculturally requires a very small percentage of the population capable of feeding the rest and beyond. A few years ago, there was a big survey in India which found 40% of Indian farmers want to sell and move out. But they can't. Because where will they go? India is often the number one producer in terms of volume. But way behind in terms of productivity. And this is a price that the farmers tend to pay. The poverty in agriculture is a reflection of this low productivity. But there's another vision of future farming. Tulika's driving 200 miles north of Delhi to Deir Adun. She's here to meet Bandana Shiva. She's a globally famous development expert and the force behind the Navdanya network of organic farmers. Tulika wants to know their answer to obesity and malnutrition. She's here to find out that in a country like ours, there are so many healthier ways of growing crops, healthier ways of making food. Still we are going into the trap of this Western junk food, which is harming us, our future generations also. So what according to you is the way to come out of this trap? And what option we can offer to our future generations? You know, this country is a land of diversity. Anything you touch here is a source of nutrition. Behind you, this beautiful curry patta that the South Indians put in all their Assam and Sambar. One of the richest sources of vitamin A. I don't think there's any culture in the world that eats as much diversity as the Indian cuisine. Why are the fast foods of the West so wrong for our body? First, actually they're not fast. If you take the full chain of supply, food was taken, processed, frozen. So it's actually a very long chain. It's not a quick food. In future, say Navdanya, Indians could eat far more like they do here, cooking a rich variety of healthy indigenous crops. Now, if we were to take a thali of everyday eating, my guess is a minimum of 25 plants go into our jeera, sarzon, this turmeric that's growing all over out there. Now known to be an antibiotic, now known to be good for Alzheimer's and memory. The world is just starting to discover the wonders of the indigenous Indian cuisine. These things we are unknowingly... We are letting them disappear. So we get rid of our food diversity. But that means we get rid of our biodiversity. All the crops that could give us healthy and good food. So Vandana Shiva's recipe for future food, eat local, eat seasonal, eat traditional. So the answer to healthy eating is right here on our land and right here in our culture. It's time to stop the inferiority complex. That everything from the West, including their junk food, is superior. We need to be discriminating and choose healthy, including that which comes from our own heritage. Bija Didi works closely with Navdanya, saving the seed of indigenous crops. Crops that could become future food. Right now we have 560 varieties of paddy rice and 150 varieties of wheat which I have stored here. These are pure seeds just like we have in the hills. Our work here is to preserve the seeds that are becoming extinct, like certain kinds of paddy rice, wheat and barley. Wherever we can find the seeds, we preserve them. We will save them. Small farmers grow a multiplicity of food items. Today our diets are restricted to perhaps 4-5 crops. Corn, wheat, barley, maize. Rice, sorry. Four major animal meats. Chicken, pork, beef, lamb. Go to any rural areas. Small farmers are actually the custodians of our biodiversity. They are growing so-called often crops. More nutritious. These have been conserved from generation to generation, passed on. Today modern society is restricted to what is on the commercial market. So their role is not only of preserving the biodiversity but also of preserving good diets. On the journey back home, time for a quick chat with some of India's small farmers. The food is very, very expensive. The food is very expensive. I am Tulika. I have come from Delhi. I wanted to ask you, have you heard of junk food? In cities, people don't have time to cook. They don't have time to cook proper meals like you do, when you harvest fresh and eat fresh. They eat things like pizzas and burgers. Oh yes, they get ready-made food. And all they have to do is to heat it. And they call this fast food. All they want to do is fill their stomachs. I think it is quite unhealthy. So you mean it doesn't have the required nutrients? No, they don't have any. People eat this to fill their stomachs because it's tasty. Have your kids ever eaten chips, burgers, pizzas? Have you ever eaten junk food? Forget having eaten it. I am hearing this name for the first time ever from you. So could India's small-scale farmers do more to feed the future healthily? One problem, there's far too much fresh food still being wasted. We have one of the smallest share in processed food. A consequence of that is the enormity of wastage, particularly in fruits and vegetables, on a daily basis. The estimate is 30% of fruits and vegetables rot even before they come to the market. So the processed food and the fast food industry could play a big role in reducing this level of wastage. But supporters of small-scale farmers say there's an answer. Studies show small farms are very efficient per acre and rural jobs often badly needed. So why not make it easier to get indigenous fresh food to market with better distribution and infrastructure? Basically, policy has to be such that we invest in rural development as well as invest in agriculture. How does that help obesity? You eat better. You eat better food. You stop eating canned and packaged foods that come from the Western world or from factories in the urban areas. It helps you diversify your diet. Obesity is a form of malnutrition. Poor diets. It's not just simple having access to food. Having access to the right food at the right time. The role of government should be really to rebuild local food systems and to use fiscal and regulatory tools to encourage agriculture to shift to the production of foods that are diverse, that provide a full range of micronutrients to those depending on those foods, rather than to focus on a narrow range of commodities that are inputs for the food processing sector. So what happens when the future generation is asked to decide for itself? Could it be what happened in Soda Patel with Yalea, one of Delhi's top private schools? The pupils were given a vote. They declined to ban junk food. What they did vote for, a policy to buy only fresh produce wherever possible, cooked according to India's many local cuisines. We are very aware of the wonderful diversity of food that is available in our country, that is suitable to the climate of our country. It's easy to digest, it's healthy, it has a huge variety. We are not saying no to non-Indian food, no we are not. But we would pick up the healthier options too because feeding children is a responsibility. To encourage healthier choices of food in the school, students in the early grades are fed a daily midday meal. A balanced, nutritious and tasty way to build good eating habits early on. Delhi is so culturally diverse, we have a multitude of food preferences that can be achieved anywhere. You go to a street, there are street vendors. So when we think about fast food, why are we just limiting ourselves to this western idea of fast food? There are so many healthy variations that you can find everywhere. So how to feed the world without obesity? Is it a question of consumer decisions or agricultural policy? Hello, it's Raj here. Can you hear me? Tolikas talking on Skype with Raj Patel. Can the problem be sorted at the consumer level or the retail level? Where can we settle this problem? It's a great question. I think the way commodities are produced today and the way food is produced today, it is very much a bulk commodity. And for as long as we shift our agriculture towards producing the kinds of crops that end up being either in the United States turned into corn syrup and destined to be turned into these processed products, then we can see this sort of trend of increasing obesity and diabetes and the rest of the, you know, the rest of these problems continuing. So I do think that we absolutely need to shift the way we market our food. But I also think we need a change in the way that food is produced and in the control over how food is produced. I think maybe this is the big issue for me. However foods produced, there are marketing campaigns, social norms and taste buds which can intervene. Vishal Bhante and Sanjay are among thousands of Delhi rag pickers collecting the food industry's plastic wrappers. When they manage to make 200 or more rupees a day, what do they buy? I like pizzas and burgers. If I have the money, I love to eat them. I have been eating them since I was seven or eight. That's the kind of fast food habit that's led Tulika to campaign for a ban on junk food in schools. And India's High Court has just found in her favor. Today I'm quite happy with the judgment of the court. And the court has instructed Food Safety and Standard Authority of India to make new guidelines and a comprehensive health policy for the schools. And I expect that after that guidelines, the schools will have more healthy options. There will be no junk food, there will be no unhealthy options and kids are going to eat healthy food, nutritious food in their school cantons. It's an important potential victory and an indication that governments can act to promote a healthier and more sustainable diet. So I think what we need to be doing is pulling back from a wholesale subsidy of a broken model of industrial agriculture and for government to be moving not only towards restricting the actions of these corporations, but positively funding sustainable agriculture and the kinds of diets that are going to help our children lead not shorter lives but longer ones. India is facing a conundrum many richer countries are failing to solve. What kind of future food will keep people on the move, farmers working, local cuisine alive and children healthy? India is still trying to find the answers. India is seniorкинская, where the global church places? India is Endlasts India, where is that still early know goalず, everyone has to be MODIFIED.
