 Oh Jesus! I got it! Welcome to Ron Ron! Today we are on a 150 acre ranch out in the middle of Vermont. Ronnie has no idea what we're doing today by the way. I do not. All I know is that we have dreams of owning a farm one day so we're getting the taste of farm life right now, today, here on the Ron Ron Fam channel. So make sure you're subscribed and let's start farming! Now with the cattle, especially if we want to have the best possible reaction, just lower voices and be chill. I like how he looked at me when he said that. So I'm Morgan Gold and it is Gold Shaw Farm. Gold Shaw Farm! If you haven't already, follow this guy. He was nice enough to let us come here after meeting him only one time. But it was a good one time! It was a good cup of coffee! Oh yeah! Today he is going to put us to work. I want you to push us. I can get with that. To where we're crying and sweating and just ready to get off this farm. I try to be too nice of a person. You got it! Aaron, we want to enjoy this experience. We aspire one day to own land, so we're going to get a taste of it today. Probably ten years ago, my wife and I were in a similar position with you guys where we lived in the city. We didn't have any agricultural experience and we had this dream of like, oh wouldn't it be cool to one day have a farm? So you can do that, but it doesn't come without some cost. So we'll see those today. Okay, okay! Foreshadowing! Da-da-da! So my wife and I have owned Gold Shaw Farm since 2016. We've been raising animals here since 2018. We raise ducks, geese, chickens, cattle, trees, bees, pigs. It's just a mixture of things and we try to do it in a way where we're friendly to the environment as well as friendly to the animal as well as friendly to ourselves. And that's how we run our farm. Alright, so here's the herd. Morning ladies! When we first got here, we were like, what's the biggest concern? And he's like, probably the cattle. And that's what we're gonna start off with. Look at them! Oh my gosh! I feel like I'm being judged. Oh, doodos! Watch out for the doodos! Look, if you're gonna be a farmer, you can't be afraid of poop. Calm today. Alright, let's get you moved to fresh pasture. It'll just take me about five minutes to set up the fence. You guys wanna try to do that? Yeah! Sure! Alright, come with me. So here's how today's gonna go. I'm gonna crush it. Ronnie's gonna start something and end up after it. And it's gonna be on repeat probably the entire day. So I would say the bar that I have for both Aaron and Ronnie is kinda low here. Look at them! Why do they remind me of Guppy? Everything reminds Ronnie of Guppy. I'm not gonna give them anything too difficult or too challenging. Is this what I do? Well, let's see how they do with some of these basic farm tasks. I love Ronnie, but I just don't know if she has what it takes to be a farmer. Comment in the comments below. Let's go Farmer Ronnie! If you think I can do it, please! Show support! Alright, what do we do? Alright, here. Hold those. I'm gonna show you what to do here. They're so cute! Okay. So this is what's known as polywire. So this has like metal filaments running through it. Like you can actually see it. That gets electrified and then that keeps them in place and from moving anywhere. Okay. And so what we're gonna do is actually set up a new one right down here so that I can open this gate up and have them move over here to start eating. Okay. I definitely grabbed onto that wire earlier without thinking. Do you want us to follow you? Over the last 24 hours my cattle have eaten all of the grass in the paddock that they've been in. And so we gotta move them to fresh pasture ASAP. So you hold that and we're gonna basically make a straight line all the way through here. Dropping in posts every, I don't know, 25, 30 feet or so. Just boom. Just like that? Just like that. It's that easy. Easy! Yeah. Oh, it's super easy moving cattle. I know. We're gonna feed you in a minute. I know. I say this is easy but why am I the one slacking? Right about here. You're doing a good job though. Thank you. Ronnie. Woo! Almost just fell. I'm okay. Do those need to be tighter? You just wrap, give it a couple wraps around and it'll tighten right up. How did you do it? Like that? How did he do it? I called it and this is just the beginning. She didn't tighten the fence enough. It's okay. You can tell people you did it. I did it. Good job, Ronnie. That looks great. Alright, you guys ready for me to move the cattle? Yeah! This is my favorite part of the day, 100% no doubt. Hey, Kils! Come on, Kils! Fresh grass, fresh grass, come on! That's very satisfying. What they're doing is known as kind of rapid grazing or intentional grazing. So they get exposure to an area like this for about 24 hours before moving to the next spot. This spot they had for 24 hours and you can see where it's all eaten down. Oh yeah, it's all trampled. And there's like poop everywhere. Yeah! The weeds are all trampled. That's actually them helping the pasture because now this grass will regrow very quickly. It's got the nutrition from the manure and yeah, that's like the cycle of life out here. Wow! Alright, what's next boss man? Alright, well I need some help because we still have some things to do for the cattle because we moved them to a new spot. I need to move that shade cart over to here so that they have access to shade today. One, two, three. Uh oh, uh oh, we're tipping, we're tipping. Oh! Oh! Are you okay? I do not hurt myself! Okay, what do I do? Alright, you're not going to be able to... Alright, we got it? Yeah! How are you guys feeling? Good, I almost injured myself already. My hat? I got your hat, Aaron. Good job guys! You guys okay? Yeah, I think we're good. Why did you get so strong, Ronnie? Oh, sorry. There we go. Alright. Is that it down? Ta-da! Yay! Bye-bye! It was nice to meet you. We're going to Ron Ron Ranch. So cute. Alright. Alright, on to the chickens. Ronnie, if I don't make it as a farmer, I can at least be a photographer. Whoa! What an incredible photo. Also, if you guys don't know this about Ronnie, besides cats, the one animal she really wants are... Chickens! Hello chickens! Hello, my name is Veronica. I will be taking care of you today. Hey, it's time to eat your breakfast everyone. Come on. Ronnie, you got it. Keep going. I'll pop up the water. Isn't there like a thing where you're not supposed to stare at them in the eyes? I just did. This is a mobile chicken coop. So, you notice it's built on wheels. Yeah. The chickens will follow the cattle and so usually have them about three or four days behind the cattle. Okay. So, their job is to pick through the cow pies and spread them around the pasture so it spreads more manure and it eats the insects that grow in it. We're going to have to actually move this later tonight. Oh, really? Okay. Yeah, we're going to have to actually move it down to where the cattle are. That's going to be one of the jobs we have to do. Let's see what we got. Alright. Wow. That one looks like it's all covered in poop. I think that nesting box needs to get cleaned out. Do you mind cleaning it out for me? Okay. Oh, I have to actually scoop it out. Just don't look. I can't look at it. Okay. I'm going to let you guys in on something. Last night when I was talking to Morgan, I was like, let's see how far we can push Ronnie. And he was like, how about having her clean out the chicken pen where there's a lot of chicken poop. Oh, but I put it all in that one. I scooped it all out into the bottom rack. She went right in. Hands in, poop, everything. I can't even get her to pick up some of Guppy's certain poop. Honestly, I'm surprised she went in there. Okay. Almost gag-type. I smell that one. That was sticky. That smells like a Guppy poo. I smushed the poo. Oh, man. Step aside. It's in the top one. It was like more... Did I do a good job for the most part? Not bad. I'll give you like a B, B minus, somewhere in there. Take it. I'll take it. C's get the grease. You got to see these chickens in there though. Stick your head in there. Can you just touch chicken poop? Uh, we're dealing 75% poo. Here's the law of farm life. Your hands are going to get dirty and gross. Have a nice dirty sweatshirt that you wear, dirty overalls. And then when you go inside, wash your hands immediately. Yeah. And while you're outside, don't put your hands in your mouth. Yeah. But I just bought this. We just bought... I bought this whole outfit yesterday. Brand new. So that is a cow pie that's been probably about a week ago. A week and a half old. Have you ever stepped in a cow pie? No. Do you want to? You have farm boots on. You might as well give it a shot. Will this make me a true farmer? It'll make you on the road to a true farmer. Okay. I'll do it. In order for me to be a true farmer, I gotta at least step in some cow poo. And I did. With one foot. So am I like... I'm halfway there. Oh, it's pretty solid. Okay. That's because it's dried out at this point. See? Like you can break it up. Doing stuff like that actually helps the pasture. All right. So Ronnie, if you can open that and give them two scoops of feed from there. Oh yeah. Are they going to come at me? Nah, probably not. But they'll be definitely interested in it. Two scoops of feed. Whoa. What is this? This is not like a guppy scoop. Come on. Chickens! Breakfast! You guys say it in chicken language, Ronnie. It's running. Chook, chook, chook, chook, chook, chook! Chook, chook, chook, chook! Chook, chook, chook, chook! I fed the chickens. Speaking of breakfast. We still got more chores to do, man. We don't eat until the animals eat. That's the rule on the farm. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. That's a good rule. All right. So should we head back down the hill? Side note. I'm like 95% sure that Ron Ron Ranch is going to happen. I mean, this is like bringing back crazy memories for me, like growing up on the farm and stuff. But I'm so impressed with Ronnie. I'm not even like, like I did not expect her to do this well. I thought the chicken coop thing was going to be her breaking point. Did you see that? She only gagged once. Oh, this is cool. Okay, Ronnie. This isn't go-farts. Don't go crazy. So just so you guys know, this fence is electrified and it can and will shock you and it hurts a lot. Here's how you can test an electric fence. Oh. To know if it's on or off. You just take a piece of like wet grass, put it to it, and you can feel it just a little bit. The pulse of the electricity. Oh, you do. It just feels like a little like this. It's not bad at all. You already touched it. You didn't. You were faking. No, I was weird. Hi, Toby. Toby. Hi. Yeah, this is the legendary Toby Dog. Toby, Toby, Toby. Hi, Toby. Star of the book, Toby Dog of Gold Shaw Farm. Oh, yeah. So Toby lived outside with the ducks and geese and chickens. Oh, you do. He keeps all the predators away. You're the protector. Should we go let out some chickens? Yeah. Yeah, one. So these are the young chickens. Come on in here. Come on out. Wow. Oh. Oh. Oh. You want to hold the chicken? There you go. And then you're not. Oh. Can't drop the feed. Can you help bring it over? Yeah. Just open the door up top. Come out. Fancy chickens. Oh, look at that little afro. I got you. I did it. Oh my gosh, I did it. No one back home is going to believe she just did that. I just did that. You guys know Ronnie. She's afraid of bugs. Last night there was a wasp in our room and she completely freaked out. But there's a chicken completely fine. You know, she even had a chicken and the chicken started freaking out in her hands and she was just like, I got it. Where has this Ronnie been? Alright, now Ronnie, try to catch the red chicken right there. This guy? Yeah. Try to catch it? Yeah. Hey. Hello. Come here. Come here. Oh. Oh. Oh. Alright, let's go feed the ducks and geese. You can hear them yelling at us. Look at all of them. Hi Toby. Oh yes, are you going to introduce us to the geese? Our farm is actually one of the largest goose farms in Vermont. Look at the, that one's so tall. They're basically like dragons, but a little bit smaller. Quack quack, quack quack quack quack. That's a good one. It's like the scene in the Aristocast. Dun dun dun dun dun dun. Look at that. Oh my gosh, that's amazing. Okay, I'm going to have you guys, what you're going to need to do is empty out the pools. I'll get the water hooked up. We'll start giving them fresh water first. Where are you going? You're going to miss breakfast. You don't have to be that precious, just you can dump. Oh really? Yep. The geese are so funny looking. Like there's like different kinds. There's the big ones, then there's the tall ones, and then there's just the ducks. I don't know what I'm looking at, but they're all really cute. I would do this every single morning. Honestly, this would be like a good break from having to like, think about work, think about YouTube. It's like a good way of like just working without having to think too much. He's swimming. All right, what animals are next? We're going to go check on the heifers. Let's go. Okay. What you call me? Come on Toby. Toby's loving Ronnie. He might try to herd you. If he's getting bossy, just let me know. Oh, he's hurting me? Yeah. Oh! Because he's got such a strong protective instinct. That's so cute. Like he basically will like try to think, take things that he thinks are under his protection and be like, okay, you need to go here, go there. Oh. We need a Toby. I will gladly be herded by Toby. Come here. Is this on? Actually, no, I just turned it off. Okay. So when you come at them, they don't see that as, oh, let me get closer now. You actually almost want to relax and let them come to you. Because again, remember, cattle are prey animals. So anything that sort of your hand can pique their curiosity, but if you go right at them and jab your hand in, they'll be like, oh, this is like a threat. Oh. All right. You guys ready to go take care of the pigs? Oh my gosh. Yes. Pigs. Toby heard me. Toby. I'm struggling. Help. Help me, Toby. Ronnie. Most of the recycling that happens on our farm happens with our pigs. We try to raise our pigs by feeding them a mostly recycled diet, whether it's apples that have fallen on the ground or expired produce or the grains from local breweries. We try to actually make sure that the environmental impact of the food that the pigs have is as good as possible. Oh my gosh. They're ginormous. Hey, best, best, best, best. So if you want to start by dumping just one of those bags of apples out for them. You do it, Aaron. I'll do part of it and then you do the rest. Let it rain. Just let it go. Just, yeah. Aaron, you can take this and split it between the two blue feeders that you see over there. Me, best, best, best, best, best. They're strong. They, like, buckled my knees in. Pigs are thick. And Ronnie really enjoyed slapping them thick butts. Go ahead, slap the ham. Smack the pig's butt. Okay. Watch. Ready, Aaron? The booty. I think this might be the cutest animal on the farm so far. It's 350 pounds. Of cuteness. Leave a comment below if you think we should get pigs. Along with any other animals you think we should get. Alright, pigs are set. What animals are next? Humans. It's time for us to eat breakfast. Oh, look. He's one right. Whoa! Who wants to try it? No. I'm sorry that's enough.енная to game. Whoa! Whoa! protesters pleads with zeer, and they Skills is boiling. It has��ní everywhere! No way! Who wants to try it? I've never done this. What you're gonna wanna do is have your hand up here and then let it come down. Cause what you want is more about the momentum than your arm strength. I don't think I'm gonna do this. Just try it. Yeah! There we go. There you go. There you go, that was a good whack. Aaron you go. Go for it. It's been years since I've done this. Wow! Oh. I'm impressed. That was very easier than I thought. Almost. Almost. I'm not cut for it. Three, two, one. Yeah! Yeah! Woo! That's my girl! High five! Good work! I did it! That's my wife for her! Yeah! Alright so Ronnie, since you seem to be such a fan of the chickens. Oh gosh. Yes, I am. I've got another chicken chore we gotta tackle today. Okay. Today I've got a chicken coop that I'm gonna have Ronnie clean out and I'm gonna have Aaron help me set up the winter yard for the cattle because probably in a couple more weeks I'm gonna bring them into the barn for the winter and so we need to be ready. Here it is. So what you're gonna have to do is sweep it all out so you can have this scoops, this kind of pushes. Okay. You don't actually have to be too exact with it because I usually just put it out here to let it compost. Toby, you wanna help me? Housekeeping! I'm the new maid! Did the chickens bring that stick in? Hm. So, what we're gonna have to do is I wanna shrink this down a little bit. Oh. Yep. Firm, right there, right there. Stack them on top? Yep, right on top. You can just leave them there. It's only a temporary spot for them. That's all chicken coop right there. It's just the same as cleaning a litter box. Got it. I was really expecting Ronnie to struggle with cleaning the chicken coop but I am super impressed. She was out there brushing it out, getting a spick and span. She might have the makings of a farmer after all. Why don't you line it up against that post? Alright, so we need to put these posts in so the cattle don't push the cattle panels when they're in there in the winter. So what I'm gonna need you to do, Aaron, is use this tool which is called a post driver and just bang them into the ground. So there's really two ways to drive a post. There's the manual way and then there's a special gas powered way. We're gonna have a little fun with Aaron on this one. My hands hurt. You can be honest, you won't hurt my feelings. I'm not like Ronnie. I can take it. It's a little not straight. Um, yeah you wanna be straighter. You don't wanna be leaning out like that. Okay, so redo? Yeah. So when you have to do a hundred of these, it's better to use this one than that one. Oh. Alright. Ronnie, you done yet? No. This is a lot of work. There's all this in this corner right here. Alright Ronnie, you can make it rain. Oh, that's fun. It has to be perfect for the chickens. Ronnie and her chickens. Hey Morgan, how is that? This is looking really good. You know, if you actually want chickens of your own, I think you probably could be ready. Oh my gosh. I mean, I wouldn't say you should get as many birds as I have, but like if you started off at like four or six, and I think it's great. I'm sure I'm ready. And I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to take one. I'm ready to go. Oh my gosh. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go. You started off with like four or six chickens, like in a little coop. I could do that. I could manage that. You'd have fun. Morgan, you're killing me, man. I mean, this would be a task you'd have to do if you got chickens, so. Yeah. You've done well. Thanks. Now that the sun's setting, we've got to go move the chicken coop and get those chickens on some fresh pasture. This is a really dangerous job because that chicken coop weighs more than 1,200 pounds. All right, ready? Yep. Johnny, we almost made it a full day working on a farm without anything going wrong. You're jinxing us now. Yeah, I am. I want to see if anything's going to happen or not. Daylight's burning. We've got to get this done quick. Because if it's dark, we're not going to be able to do this. Can you go over to the coop, turn off the electric fence, and then make sure we get all the chickens inside the house. And as soon as they're all in there, close the door. All right, coach. You've got to press the little button there. Will this help, though, with the darkness? No, it really won't. The cow even said no. Let's see about that. All right, how do you turn off the fence? Don't touch it. This looks like it's a... It's electric, and... Okay. How do we test it? He told us how to test it. Uh, with a piece of grass. Yeah. Just to be safe. I ain't trying to get shot today. I'm going to go for it. Ah! Psych. Ha! All right, chickies. Go in your coops. Come on. Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it. I know. This is critical. We're losing light, Aaron. We've got to get the chickens inside. Go, go, go. Can you grab the UTV? Yeah. You've got to back it up to the... Over where the trailer hitch is on the other side. I'm so interested to see if she can do this. If she can do this, I will jump up to 100% Ron Ron Ranch is happening. I can do it. I can do it. After spending the whole day with Aaron and Ronnie, I'm pretty impressed. They've got a little bit more to learn, but deep down, if they want to have Ron Ron Ranch, I think they're going to be ready. You're pretty close. Let's see how we can get in there. A little elbow grease here. Boom. Nice. Did you take the eggs out? No. You never want to drive with eggs inside the egg mobile. Ah! There's an egg. He's about to let us make a scramble. Ay, ay, ay. Okay, one. This is like a great final exam for us. The final test. We're moving, we're moving, we're moving! How are the eggs? Watch the chickens. I did it. Okay. We also stepped in a bunch of poo. Oh. I'm a true farmer. I'm a true farmer. I did it without even noticing. Oh my gosh, I didn't even avoid it. I'm a true farmer. I'm a true farmer. I stepped in poo. I didn't even know I was stepping in it. So happy. Thank you guys so much for watching. Don't forget to subscribe. Also, thank you to Morgan for letting us come onto your lovely farm. Make sure to go check out his channel and all of his socials. We'll put all the links in the description below. And... One last question for you. Should we do Ron Ron Ranch? I would love to visit Ron Ron Ranch sometime in the future. Do we need a little more practice? Maybe a little bit, but there's always tomorrow, right? Always tomorrow! Be sure to subscribe and we'll see you guys next time. Bye! Bye!
