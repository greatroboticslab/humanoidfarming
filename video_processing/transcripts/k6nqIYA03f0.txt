 If you're superstitious, then this is not a plant that you want to be bringing into your home. You're probably seeing cow parsley everywhere on your woodland walks right now, and that's because it's one of the most common hedgerow plants in the UK. But this familiar flower also goes by a much darker name of Mother Dye. It was believed that picking this flower, or worse, bringing it into the home would cause a certain death to the mother of the household. As sinister as that sounds, it likely served as an important folk warning to scare children from picking this plant, as it does look almost identical to the deadly poison hemlock. Now, cow parsley is actually an edible wildflower. It also goes by another common name of wild cherville, because it shares a similar scent and flavour to the cultivated herb. But since this plant does look so similar to the deadly hemlock, it is definitely not one for beginner foragers.
