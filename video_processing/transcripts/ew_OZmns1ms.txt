 good morning everybody how you doing today my name's andrew i'm daniel i'm lauren i'm pop pop i'm jolly and we're some of the veggie boys and girls and we'd like to thank you for stopping by if you're new around here please consider subscribing because we can grow a lot of stuff on the farm but one thing we can't grow is this channel without your help we'd also like to give a big thank you to thrive market for sponsoring today's video let's go let's go it's looking so empty here so we had no eggs in the farm market so we quickly got one and two full boxes graded i think that's enough welcome back everyone it's so nice to have you with us today as you can see we are currently out in the fields my dad and daniel are working on bringing some equipment back because we've got some planting to do we have reached the time of the year where we're basically full throttle into planting time we've been working on getting so many different things planted we've been working on planting some corn some peas green beans a little bit of pumpkins watermelon cantaloupe right here we have some eggplant and peppers lots of peppers i mean like lots of peppers and today we're going to be changing it up just a little bit because we're getting started on planting our tomato crop now we do multiple plantings of tomatoes but what you see in front of us all this blank canvas is soon going to be painted with tomatoes that we're going to be putting in the soil now personally i am pretty excited about this harvesting tomatoes is one of my favorite jobs and getting them put in the soil in the soil today that means i'm one step closer to that goal before we get started with planting tomatoes today i have to show you guys something that had just recently showed up on our doorstep it was an order from thrive market what's cool is our order that we got arrived in one of these boxes thrive market box and it was completely covered with packing materials to make sure that everything was delivered safely i mean i ordered some of these chips and i like about these chips that got a short list of ingredients i ordered these chips and it doesn't sound like any of them are really crumbled up real bad that's good that's very good behind me are a few of the things that we ordered we ended up ordering a few things for the kids i think over here i ordered some of these mangoes sometimes mangoes have like all these extra ingredients in them that they don't need and my daughter cali loves mangoes i was able to get the kids some squeezable pots i also got some protein bars for the wife and i little known fact been losing a little weight kind of proud of myself and thrive market's also been helping me with that one of the things that's really really cool about thrive market is it works with so many different diets i think it's like to up to 90 different dietary needs that they could help you with uh if you're looking to eat more high protein which i was they were able to help with that if you're looking to eat a little less sugar they also could help with that so what's really cool is thrive market wanted to work with us here on the farm they saw a lot of the stuff that they raised they saw they've seen a lot of our ideas and not only did they want to work with us they wanted to work with you my audience so what's really cool is on your first order they're actually going to give you 30 off and they're even going to be offering a free gift so what we're going to do is have a link down in the description and you're going to visit thrivemarket.com slash the veggie boys and that's where you're going to be able to place your order once again i just want to give a big shout out to thrive market for sponsoring us today and let's get back to planting those tomatoes as you saw right away this morning we loaded a mess of tomatoes here onto the wagon we've got some plum tomatoes we've got a few different varieties of round however to get our day started off we are planning a few unique varieties we have a few heirlooms that we're putting onto the planner and we also have a few cherry and grape tomatoes right here we have some chocolate cherry tomatoes we have some brandy wine up here on top we have mr stripey what else we have here we have some amish paste tomatoes we got some sweet 100 cherry we got some yellow cherry and i believe yeah if i look here and we got some orange cherry and some juliet tomatoes which those are like a large cherry once we finish off planting all these different unique varieties we're going to be moving on to our first planting of round tomatoes now we've got a few different varieties here but to get started off we're going to be transplanting primo red we had an entire wagon full of tomatoes and we still forgot a variety so daniel just ran back with the side by side to grab that while daniel's gone we're going to get our planter put into place a lot sunnier out today sure is beautiful you know we call a day like this hey drying weather did you find them oh you found them look at that we got a lot of varieties on here today you know that what are you doing what are you doing oh daniel i'm just so happy we get to work together today it's like the last couple days isn't it great so much fun i'm just kidding i love you so the first thing we're going to be transplanting to start off the day is our sweet orange cherry uh we actually didn't have any of these set aside for ourselves so um we borrowed some of the large ones from the farm slow it down paul i'm gonna think i'm planting these large cherry tomatoes i don't want to break them we already finished off the orange sweet cherry so now we're transplanting some red grape we're going to be flying through these early varieties pretty quickly and after we finish off these red grape we're going to be moving over to the large cherry variety called juliet who has those you have those daniel's going to be planting those those plants daniel was just putting in the soil those were our sweet 100s we had some yellow cherry that we're going in uh we also had the juliet and now i've got chocolate cherry all right you can pull it forward we don't know what this tomato is we just know it's an heirloom that we're putting in right now the tomatoes i'm putting in right now these are called amish paste so these are really good for sauce mr stripey tomatoes changing it up daniel has a pack of cherokee purple so a lot of these are heirloom varieties that we're planting right now and some people ask why we don't plant a lot of heirloom varieties and truth be told a lot of the tomatoes that we sell are for sauce and a lot of people that buy these heirloom tomatoes they don't end up using them for sauce although they can be really good for sauce uh the round varieties that we raise are very very popular for sauce oh and that's everything when it comes to the smaller varieties now we're moving on to the round we can go a little faster dad that's one row of tomatoes down and many many more to go daniel so daniel of everything that we've been transplanting so far what's been your favorite right now it's tomatoes why is it tomatoes you go faster you go faster you get a little breeze yeah i will say it's cool to see going so fast right now it is cool to see the amount of peppers that we get transplanted down to the soil but just you move so much faster you cover more ground when you're doing tomatoes even though you're putting less plants into the soil it still feels like you're doing a lot because you're moving through the field so quickly i can't tell you how i know the difference between 0.5 and 0.7 yeah i can tell lightning speed we just got finished off with the primo red tomatoes and now we have moved on to red deuce red deuce is a very popular variety that we planted for a few years now and the interesting thing is every single one of these tomato varieties that we're putting in the soil they mature at different rates so some of these tomatoes are going to ripen up a little quicker than others that's something that's very important to keep in mind because when we come out here and we start harvesting we know which variety to start picking on so one variety will start ripening up a little sooner and then the other varieties will follow suit we basically have an entire row and a half of primo red we're hoping to get the same thing out of the red goose and then the following round variety if we can get two rows out of that that's going to be really good for us all together we want four to four and a half rows of round tomatoes to start off our beginning planting there's quite a bit of space here but if we can get it filled up with tomatoes pretty quickly that'll be nice on one of the previous videos i had uploaded where we were doing some transplanting a few people were asking if we keep these old plastic trays and the answer is yes we do keep them the only problem is after you keep them for a few years they really start to break down uh this tray over here this one's probably about four to five years old we've been using it every year and we're gonna have to retire this one because it is falling apart as we use it here i mean maybe we get one more year out of it but this thing is very flimsy and we don't want to lose any tomatoes just because we're being careless we're all loaded up and ready to start planting again sometimes the trays can be a little fuller than others so there are moments where i have to let daniel plant by himself and he has to let me plant by myself we try and keep everything as even as possible even though the next variety that we're going to be planting is also a round tomato we like to make sure that everything is exactly where we need it to be and a reason for that is because we like to know which planting does better uh under the circumstances that it has that year so if we have a dry year it'd be important to know which particular planning did really well not that we can predict if we're going to have a dry year or not or a wet year but it's just nice to know in future so if we do need to sell one of those plantings to somebody who has a drier climate we can do that oh daniel we've got someone out here watching us oh my goodness look who it is it's my wife and the kids hey lily hey ronnie hey mommy you out for a stroll yeah all righty that looks pretty good go have fun i bet you lily can plant faster i don't think lily can plant faster than me right now but give her a couple years maybe a couple months she'd be probably going as fast as you daniel we just got our entire variety of red juice tomatoes put into the soil now we're on to our last variety of round this is builtmore if you've been following the channel for any amount of time you'll know builtmore it's one of our favorite varieties who do we have over here hi buddy hi baby you in your little hat you guys riding on the side by side it's snack time huh yeah yeah having a snack out in the field doesn't get much better than that ronnie wants to get out i know he probably wants to go on the transplanter the other day we had him out here he was sitting in the tractor a little bit sitting in the transplant he loves he loves being out in the fields lauren just told me she saw two deer you chased him out over there right yeah that's over by her broccoli and you chased him away right i guess so that's one of the coolest things ever getting some tomatoes planted every little family come out and see you callie's at home she was making cookies with grammy this morning can you believe that i shouldn't say she was home she's at the farm that's home the farm is home but yeah she was making cookies with grammy we've only got a few more trays of round tomatoes and then the rest is all plum well we're trying to get some work done and this guy parked right in the way i was supposed to get those next rows planted i was just thinking the same oh my goodness and guess what we're probably in your way no it's okay oh oh now i feel bad you're not in our way joel that's my brother that's my cousin this guy's hanging out on my arm i don't know where this spider came from but i don't want him there for much longer spider man joel was just rolling up with the rake how much of the hay did you get rake last night quite a decent amount right yeah so daniel flipped everything in he did about 40 acres and now joel is coming through and he's flipping everything out hopefully we'll be able to get some of our hay bail today and then we'll get started working on joel's hay either tomorrow or the day after we have about 100 acres of hay that we end up baling i think we were able to get like 80 acres down we had a little bit of trouble with our disk mine but very soon we'll be able to get all that done but that's enough talk about hay we're planting tomatoes right now give me some tomato talk daniel um tomatoes wherever they're from they started feeding them to the poor because tomatoes are in the night shade yeah they thought tomatoes were poisonous poisonous yeah and then poor people weren't dying and they were like hey they were up in the mountains eating tomatoes and like this ain't that bad and then the royalty started eating tomatoes wild and now you got us eating tomatoes look at that just some simple farmers out here planting and eating tomatoes pretty large update we just got our first planting of round tomatoes all into the soil and now we're moving on to our plum tomatoes it's very difficult to tell the difference between the plum and round tomatoes just by looking at the plants but uh that's why we tag everything because if we didn't tag we'd have one crazy field to pick and that would get matthew all fired up right matthew used to hate when you get everything mixed up out in the field it's like ah it's not that big of a deal but now i see where he's coming from i hate it too i like when everything is kind of near each other so when we are harvesting we don't have to run all over the field looking for stuff it's just all right together this neighbor's really noisy oh that guy over there raking the hay yeah i think i know him joel you're being noisy we just got our first row that is just fully plum tomatoes put into the soil we're gonna hope to get two more we were planting a plum variety called marianna and now we're moving on to a variety called shelby yeah see these this tray is old it's tearing apart i'm coming daniel he already got started by himself there is a little difference between planting the marianna and the shelby these shelby are a lot smaller than the marianna where these uh got planted a little bit later on it wasn't too too late for our first planting they're just a little bit smaller it doesn't really matter because as we move into the time of the year that we're getting to we're going to have longer days we're going to have more sunlight and that equates to more growing hours sometimes getting stuff planted earlier on it'll make you feel good but it doesn't mean it's going to be ready any sooner than some stuff that you would plant later a lot of times it depends on if you've got sunny bright weather and if your ground temperature is nice and warm because if your ground temperature is cold well things are going to be running into a little bit of transplant shock when you put it into the soil a lot of times your trays because they're not in the ground they will just adapt to whatever the like current air temperature is so these plants for example they've been sitting around 70 you know 65 70 but once you move into the soil the soil can get pretty cold at night and that's where a lot of this black mulch comes into play because it helps to warm up that bed and kind of gives these plants a little better opportunity to start growing now one thing i will say because we're having more growing hours we're having more growing light it's really going to help out these plants in the next coming weeks we're going to have some really warm temperatures with some rain so that's only going to help these tomatoes to get rooted and grow like crazy i got the last plant right here i would add one whole extra that's okay and there you go starting right here we got all these rows to the left of it all planted with tomatoes today wow what a good feeling i'm surprised that we were actually able to get our whole first planting of tomatoes put into the soil today now the thing that's going to be interesting is we're going to have extra planting so we got some space here for tomatoes but it looks like we're going to have to lay some more mulch for peppers which isn't really a problem because i think we're going to have to lay mulch for our last planting of cucurbits too but as of right now i'd say we've had a successful day so far getting all this stuff planted makes you feel good let's see what we're having for lunch it looks like we're having tacos for lunch today taco tuesday and is that a rhubarb pie oh my goodness once we got all finished with lunch i got this tractor unhooked from our water wheel transplanter and we've now got it hooked to the cultivator daniel has got the round baler hooked up he's been working with the round baler yeah we're already getting started with hate today we were worried it wasn't going to dry out enough but the weather is like perfect for it and joel is still out there raking now dad is coming back with me just to make sure this is all set up for the coal crops but then after that i think he's going to go and plant corn so everybody's working on something different and everybody is very busy today those run bales look pretty good i'm happy with that so so so so so so a little update for you things seem to be working out pretty well the cultivator is doing a fine job cultivating is never a sprint it's a marathon you want to make sure you have some really good coverage near the base of the plant what i'm basically trying to do is just loosen up the soil and disperse any of those weeds that are sitting on top if i can get those weeds underneath that's only going to benefit us going to make sure the plants get more moisture and nutrients and those weeds won't be sucking it up the only issue i have is where i'm at right now kind of a pretty nasty wet spot so i'm having to be very careful around the middle of the field but once i get past that wet spot we're good to go towards the middle and back where i started of this field there doesn't seem to be too many rocks but as we get closer to this ridge that i'm going over i'm starting to see a lot more it just means there's going to be more drainage on this side it doesn't look that it had affected our planner at all because all the coal crops seem to be looking great over here but it's something to just keep in mind for when we're rock picking again maybe we'll have to go over this hill i'm currently cultivating the kohlrabi and what i've done is i've lifted the cultivator out of the ground quite a bit i don't want to get any dirt on top of where the kohlrabi is forming because it actually causes the kohlrabi to rot and we definitely don't want to have that problem we sell a lot of kohlrabi at the farm and if we don't have enough to satisfy the customers oh we're going to be in trouble so what i'm doing by having the cultivator raise a little bit is throwing just enough soil to get it to basically the base of the plant but not enough to pile it on top of the future kohlrabi so that's the kind of stuff we have to watch out for every vegetable is different daniel and i while we were working on the transplanter today we were talking about jobs we enjoy doing he had talked about how he likes harvesting corn and hauling corn around loading corn into the bin this is one of my favorite jobs i told him my favorite job was picking tomatoes you know that's just i enjoy picking tomatoes but this is a close second i just love cultivating and i just think of all the good it does for the crops it makes me feel good we're just about finished with this job so i wanted to take a moment and show you guys what i was really trying to do back here you can see this broccoli behind me i have a little section here that i did not hit right here where the broccoli plants actually would be we've got tiny weeds popping up and that's a little bit of a problem as i've stated before that takes a lot of moisture away from the plants that we had actually put here it also takes a lot of nutrients out of the soil so what we're trying to do is just displace those weeds we're trying to turn soil on top of them essentially killing them and what that's going to do is just make sure that our crops can benefit the most from the nutrients and the water in the soil now i am trying to take some of this soil and throw it up underneath the plant you can see we've been pretty successful in this row and again that's just to prevent the weeds from being right around the base of the crop i think i mean i think i did a really nice job here the stuff looks really really good the only thing i would actually be concerned about would be the kohlrabi i did come through here with the cultivator and i think i did okay i didn't get any dirt on top of the heads that were forming so yeah that looks good right there at the base you can see there's a little kohlrabi's forming very cool all things considered i think it looks really good and i've been happy with the way the coal crops have been growing now the other day dad had went through the potato crop with our new cultivator that we have for potatoes and these also look outstanding these potatoes down here they're going to take a little bit longer to get ready to harvest but we have a couple early plant things all the way up here at the top you'll notice the size of these plants they look really good but look at the plants that we have up here they're like almost double some even triple the size of what we've got a little further down the hill but that's okay with us it's just going to extend the potato harvest we've got a couple beautiful fields here we got a nice crop of wheat right there right down into our potatoes and then after our potatoes we've got the coal crops and they all look outstanding as well i mean that'd make a pretty good meal maybe some bread with potatoes and some broccoli cabbage sounds good to me so what we're going to do now is just finish out this row that we're working on get this taken back to the farm find out what the boys are up to i know daniel's bailing hey he's probably making a lot of progress that's good it looks like we had a runaway a runaway right through a wheat field so got a little change up of jobs i went straight from cultivating to getting this thing hooked up to the wagon and look at this we're harvesting hay i just got back to the farm with our first load of bales what we're actually going to be doing is storing some of these bales in the back here where we feed the cattle so i have a few things on the ground here i need to move but then i don't know how many bales we're going to be able to fit but we're hoping to get like maybe 20 in here 25 if we're trying to go a little crazy whatever the case we're just going to try and move some stuff around here make some room for bales and get it filled up so so so so so so so so so dad is now bringing down his wagon full of hay bales but i got five hay bales stuffed here into the corner i think we're going to be able to fit a decent amount we just need to make sure that we have enough room to move cattle from one pen to the other and just that we can get in the back and feed so so so oh wow i'm now home mama's been working on dinner we've got some spaghetti in there and then she already had her salad but look at the salad she's got prepared for me what a nice girl what a nice lady i love my wife oh my goodness look over here what do we have the spaghetti monsters yeah hi you eating spaghetti i'm daddy yes one last thing i'm daddy yes one last thing i'm daddy yes one last thing
