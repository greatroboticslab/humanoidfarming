 Music Today I'm going to be talking to you about the differences between round baled silage and round bale hay. As we're often asked the question, what should I feed my cattle as I've got access to both. Today some of the key practical aspects we'll start with is around quality. Silage bales being wrapped in plastic, it's very hard to determine their quality simply by looking at them. The true way to get an indication of the quality of both hay or silage is really through getting a feed analysis taken. Consider getting a feed sampling kit such as this one here which is available from local land services or New South Wales Department of Primary Industries. The kit contains instructions on how to sample hay or silage bales appropriately to ensure that you get a representative analysis of the nutritional quality, that is the energy, protein and fibre of the material you're considering purchasing or have made on farm. The other thing is when it comes to both hay and silage, the quality aspects of both hay or silage really depends on the type of pasture or crop that was cut and baled as either hay or silage. The growth stage of that crop is also just as important. The next area that impacts the quality of both hay or silage is from the time that it was cut in the paddock through to the time it was baled, were there any significant weather events such as heavy rainfall? Both heavy rainfall on hay and silage can begin to reduce the nutritional aspects of it. Once the bales have been made, it's where are the bales being stored? Are they round bales of hay that have been stacked in the open and therefore exposed to a significant amount of weather? Or have they been silage bales that have been wrapped in plastic and stored appropriately as well? Significant weather damage in either of those areas or tears in the case of silage plastic are all going to reduce the nutritional quality of the material presented. That's why it's so important to have a feed quality analysis taken via laboratory sample. So when it comes to the practical on-farm assessment of hay or silage, there are a few things that we'll talk through today that are handy when making decisions whilst waiting for laboratory results to come back or in the case where you're unable to get a laboratory analysis. First of all, when it comes to main differences, the silage bales typically weigh substantially more than hay bales do, even though they are both four foot by four foot bales. The silage bales you can see here, this morning we weighed, it was 600 kilograms. We simply weighed that by placing the bale on a set of cattle scales. Alternatively, you can ask the vendor of the silage or contractors what their average bale weights are when the silage is being made. There can be considerable variation in bale weights, and this again depends on the material the silage was made from, but also the moisture content or the dry matter percentage which we'll talk about a bit later. The hay bale, you can see here, when we weighed it this morning, again on cattle scales, it weighed 300 kilograms. So instantly, the practical level and the common question is, well, what should I feed? I've got a silage bale that weighs 600 kilograms or I've got a hay bale that weighs 300 kilograms. When making a feeding decision on farm, we really need to understand how much feed is available in each of the bales. Now, earlier this morning, through collecting a sample out of them, we were able to calculate the dry matter percentage. That is basically removing the amount of moisture contained in the material that is in both the silage or hay bale. The silage bale actually contains 40% dry matter. So what that means is, even though this bale weighs 600 kilograms, only 40% of it is actually dry matter, which is the feed. It contains the energy, protein and fibre that cattle use. So the 600 kilogram bale as it sits here actually only has 240 kilograms of feed available in it to the cattle. The hay bale, as we mentioned before, as it sits there, weighs 300 kilograms. However, when we dry it, remove the moisture from a sub-sample of it, it came back to be 85% dry matter. That means it is much drier than the silage. So even though the bale physically weighs 300 kilograms, when we remove the small portion of moisture that is in the hay, that bale actually provides 255 kilograms of dry matter or 255 kilograms of feed to the cattle. So in actual fact, even though there is a significant physical weight difference between the silage and hay bale, both these bales are more or less providing a very similar amount of feed if you were to feed them out. So to further help people understand why hay is much higher in dry matter than silage, and it's basically to do with when the paddock is cut for either hay or silage making, hay tends to be cut and left to cure or wilt in the paddock for substantially longer than silage. Therefore, a lot of the moisture is lost in the paddock prior to baling. Being baled more dryly means it's able to be stored without any plastic wrap. The silage, on the other hand, tends to be cut and baled much sooner or in a shorter timeframe. It hasn't wilted as much as hay. Therefore, there is more moisture in the plant material when it's baled. This results in the heavier bale weights for silage versus hay. So one of the biggest impacts dry matter has between silage and hay is really around cost. Now, as we mentioned before, we've got the 300 kilogram, four foot by four foot round bale. Let's just say it's available to be bought for $80 including GST per bale. We already talked about earlier its dry matter percentage being 85%, meaning there's 255 kilograms of dry matter in that hay bale. If we go $80 per bale, divide that by 255 kilograms, which is the amount of dry matter available in the hay bale, we get a figure of $0.31 per kilogram dry matter or $0.31 per kilogram dry matter. To convert that to a per ton dry matter cost, we go $0.31 or $0.31 multiplied by 1,000 kilograms because there's 1,000 kilograms in a tonne and we get a figure of $310 a tonne dry matter. That's for the hay bale. If we come across to the silage bale, as we mentioned before, it's 600 kilograms and it's 40% dry matter. If we say that that silage bale is currently available to be purchased for $90 a bale including GST, we calculate the dry matter percentage as being 240 kilograms, that is 40% of 600 kilograms. $90 a bale divided by 240 kilograms of dry matter, again being the amount of dry matter in that silage bale, we get a figure of $0.37 per kilo or $0.37 per kilo dry matter. $0.37 per kilogram dry matter multiplied by 1,000 kilograms, again being 1,000 kilograms in a tonne, we get a per tonne figure of $370 a tonne dry matter. So quite quickly you can see the hay bale that physically weigh 300 kilograms for $80 actually costs us $310 a tonne on a dry matter basis. The silage bale is weighing 600 kilograms and costing us $90 a bale, it's actually costing us $370 a tonne dry matter. That in effect is $60 a tonne dry matter difference between the silage or the hay bales. Another really practical aspect of considering should I feed hay or silage on my property is the machinery capabilities you have access to. Is your tractor suitable to handle the heavy weights of silage bales compared to hay? Remember silage generally in excess of half a tonne, hay generally less than 300 odd kilograms. If you have any more questions I'd encourage you to contact local land services for any hay or silage making advice and also animal feeding advice. 10-000 kilograms in a tonne and actions to get:「 ." Hah, Thank you.
