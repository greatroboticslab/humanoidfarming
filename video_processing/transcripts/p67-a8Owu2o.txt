 More and more people are considering joining the ranks of hobby farmers. Some are looking to make a business of it, while some are looking for a little more independence, and still others are seeking a different lifestyle. Whatever it is that's driving you to consider a hobby farm, it's not a decision to make lightly. Today, we'll give you three reasons why starting a hobby farm is a great idea, and three more reasons why you should skip it. We're the Hobby Farm Guys, I'm Brian, that's Steve, and our pal Eric is helping us out on the other side of the camera. We're all hobby farmers ourselves. To varying degrees, we raise our own fruits, vegetables, and meat to feed our family, and maybe make a little extra money. But we don't make a full-time income from our farms. Each of us still works a full-time job. In fact, that's how we know each other. But our hobby farms provide us enjoyment, healthy food, and a little independence from the crazy of the supply chain issues and inflation. I love hobby farming. But as I'm out there tooling around on my tractor, I recognize that I'm not actually a farmer. It's a hobby. I could quit tomorrow, and while I might have to make a new budget, I still have a job and income. And that's the first reason we say yes to starting a hobby farm. It can be wonderfully therapeutic. Nothing engenders hope, quite like starting seedlings indoors as the cold of winter lingers, or the sheer joy you can experience just watching the chickens chase grasshoppers in the field. Yeah. And by keeping it a hobby, you can roll with the punches. Many times when people think about starting a hobby farm, they envision running a small farm that pays many if not all the bills. That's a small farm business. And unlike a hobby farm, a crop lost to a late frost or animals lost to disease or predation can spell disaster. By starting a hobby farm first, you get a chance to learn how to garden and how to raise animals before you need to do it for a living. Also, you get a taste for how much work it can be. Better learn now that you hate pulling weeds and detest canning before you have to make your living that way. Reason number two to start a hobby farm is that it's practical. A simple look at that grocery store received reminds us that the cost of food continues to rise. Fruits and vegetables are simple to raise and can be grown in small spaces. For the price of a seed packet, you can have a year-round supply of many fruits and vegetables. And they're fresher, healthier, and more nutritious than what you bring home from the store in most instances. Maybe you're concerned about pesticide residues or GMO crops. Growing your own is a practical solution to ensuring you and your family are getting nutritious foods. Once you've tasted your own eggs, green beans, and pork chops, you may wonder what it is that they're selling in the stores. And reason number three to start a hobby farm is to be more self-sufficient. Pandemics, wars, government policy, we've seen how quickly and drastically things can change. By producing some of your own food, you gain some independence from vulnerable production and distribution systems. And a little self-sufficiency can be a great thing in good times and especially in bad. But while a hobby farm can provide you with some self-sufficiency, you know what it won't provide you with? Tax breaks. Which is our first reason to skip the hobby farm. If you're looking to invest in infrastructure like fencing, machinery, plants, and animals, it will become very expensive very quickly. And if you're doing it as a hobby, you won't find a lot of tax breaks available to you. And the second reason to skip the hobby farm is that, well, it's a lot of work. Raising crops and animals doesn't just magically happen. It takes work. Work in the blazing sun, the icy cold, the drenching rain, and the dark of night. Traipsing through the snow to deal with frozen water in the winter, mucking out dirty pens in the spring, pulling stubborn weeds all summer, and lifting and stacking heavy hay bales and feed bags through the fall, your hobby farm only succeeds by the sweat of the brow. Which leads us to the third reason to skip the hobby farm. In addition to being a lot of work, it's also a lot of responsibility. Plants and especially animals require constant care. You want to go on vacation to leave town for the weekend? Brian, what does that look like? Well I have to find somebody that can come by and check on my animals, feed and water them, collect eggs, water the garden, and pick vegetables if needed. Seedlings, baby animals, and dairy animals all require extra care. Hobby farming creates a lot of added responsibility that some people just don't care to have added to their plate. So while there are reasons to skip the hobby farm, there are also reasons to go for it. And for us, we're all in. Hey, we're the Hobby Farm Guys. What's your list of pros and cons?
