 yo guys welcome back to the channel this is going to be a video covering everything you guys need to know to get started on a herd management grind out here on the call the wild guys from why we do it to instructions how to get started doing it guys so don't forget to drop a like on the video guys subscribe to the channel if you don't if you haven't done already guys we stream this every single day over on youtube um yeah just sit back guys enjoy the rest of the video and i'll catch you all in stream next time guys i appreciate you right guys so starting off with a white tail on our map at the minute um we have over 11 level threes down with potential level three white tails on the map at the minute guys and that's all down to herd management you see here we've got two in the zone already um and a lot of level ones and what herd management actually is you shoot all the bigger size animals on your map so for the white tail i'd be shooting all my level twos and all my level threes and leaving all the level ones on my map which then would generate the game and manipulate the spawns a little bit the spawning the bigger size animals as you can see it's been working fantastically during stream guys we do stream this every single day over on youtube um so you definitely jump into stream and ask some questions if you like to but it's very very very simple to do so for the white tail level twos and level threes to shoot leave all your level ones on your map so there's not no shooters here for me to shoot at the minute um i'll just jump over to this tent and see if we've got any more over here guys i want to try and find a level two for you guys to see so i can just show you how it works how we've got some here so in this zone we have got two level twos to shoot so we've got none in that other zone because they were level threes and all level ones so for white tail do not shoot your level ones shoot your level twos and your level threes we'll get over here and we'll take these two twos down and that would then generate hopefully generate some more three spawning in or what we're after really is a super rare white tail and this does work guys i put into practice with the rocky mountain elk um we managed to spawn in a super rare rock mountain elk doing this herd management technique fairly quickly within a couple of weeks so two twos shoot your twos leave your ones do not shoot these guys or that guy and it's that simple guys that simple right guys now we're over to tiaroa where we've been grinding fallow deer trying to get super rare fallow deer down unfortunately i can't show you the red deer as well on there because my tent is set up for the fallow deer at the minute but we have managed we have managed a super rare red deer um we managed a melanistic diamond red deer doing this herd management technique and the red deer are so simple to do guys you shoot all your five six sevens eights and nines guys leave your fours and below on your map do not shoot your level ones twos threes and fours for the red deer it is so so simple once you get the hang of it um and for the fallow deer it's fairly similar to any of the other ones you shoot your level threes and your fours and your fives leave your level twos you see here i've got a lot of level twos on this um these zones here leave all your level twos and all your level ones on your map guys and shoot your level threes fours and fives it's so so simple to do guys if you do have any questions about any of this herd management we do have a disco survey guys definitely drop in there ask any questions you want or jump into a stream guys i'll answer any questions leave a comment down below i answer every single comment you can go through my videos and check it i do answer every single comment that i get on a video if you do have any questions guys jump in there and let me know and i'll do my best to answer it if not i'm sure somebody in there will answer the question for you guys and the last one we're going to go and check out is in fact the rocky mountain elk the rocky mountain elk are so so easy to do guys you shoot all of your level threes fours and fives do not shoot any level twos my map is highly populated now with level twos and level ones i've got two level ones on the map and some level twos a lot of level two so leave your level ones leave your level two shoot your level threes your fours and your fives guys and it manipulates your spawns to a point where you start spawning in a lot of level fives guys we were getting some zones where we were getting three diamond rocky mountain elk in the same zone this is a perfect example you see this lake is now all level twos there's no level threes at this lake guys i'll jump over and try and try and find a lake that i know is populated with um some shooters and what i mean by shooters is level threes right guys as you can see this lake is now in fact this lake is all level twos this this is herd management has took effect hard on this rocky mountain elk so this rocky mountain elk grind the herd management took effect for me super quickly as you can see this lake is heavily populated with level twos i'll go over to this tenant and see if there's any in this zone that i'm sat on as you can see over here all level twos as well guys so and i'll struggle to find this only for you but what i'm trying to say is leave all your level twos and ones for the rocky mountain elk shoot all your threes fours and fives guys and this has been put into practice on multiple animals for us guys and it's worked out very very very quickly um if you do have any other questions i haven't done moose yet so i don't really i don't really want to comment on the moose guys because i haven't started a moose grind yet we're at the minute on stream going to a rev on tula grind um after a great one and a super air if possible that's what we got with the red deer so we're going to get into that one and then we're probably going to jump onto a moose grind maybe after we have got a fallow day grind going at the same time so definitely jump into a stream guys um let me know how you're getting on with your herd management i'll be there to answer any questions that you've got um i hope you enjoyed the video guys drop a like on the video subscribe to the channel guys and hopefully i shall catch you all in stream next time guys enjoy the rest of your day
