 Well, if you saw my last video then you know that I recently sold my bull and four cows at auction. They were all getting up in age and I believe they were negatively impacting my calving efficiency, so it was time to sell them. And now that I have some of that money in my pocket, it's time to start thinking about replacements. And the first thing I'm going to do is to buy a replacement bull. Now, I like to use an Angus bull on my Brayford cows. The reason is that the resulting calves tend to come out darker colored and tend to fetch a higher price at auction. So I already know what kind of breed I want to get and then it comes down to what actual bull should I buy. There's a lot that goes into that decision and you know you have to look at things like was the bull a low birth weight bull meaning that the calves it throws are going to also be low birth weight so that they don't endanger the mama cows while they're giving birth. But then again, you want to make sure they have a high weaning weight so that when the calves are weaned from the mamas, they are stocky and will fetch a higher price at auction. There's a whole host of other considerations that go into it. So what I'm going to do right now is head down to a place here in Howitzville that has a really good stock. They have been breeding Angus bulls for a long time. I believe it's since 1991 and I'm going to meet up with Mark Yannick and this is a J. Barr Angus in Howitzville. So I'm going to talk to Mark about his stock and also what kinds of things he looks for whenever he is raising bulls for sale. So I've got the trailer hooked up to the back of the truck and I'm getting ready to head out the door and go meet up with Mark. So let's go ahead and take a road trip. Now at the beginning of the video I mentioned two factors that you want to look for that is low birth weight of the bull and also a high weaning weight. Those factors fall under the heading of EPDs which stands for expected progeny differences. I know that's a mouthful. Essentially those are numbers that indicate the likelihood that a particular bull will either be higher or lower than the average bull in its breed and class for certain characteristics and there's a whole host of characteristics including like I mentioned calving ease, calving weight, weaning weight, yearling weight, there's also things like marbling, rib eye size, size of the scrotum which is an indication of fertility. There's a whole host of things that fall under EPDs and if you look at one of those EPD charts it can look very daunting like how do I interpret this. So essentially when you see things on here that indicate that something is a positive it means it is more likely for this particular bull to have that characteristic than the average bull of this breed in this class. So that is something that you want to take a look at and use that as a tool when you are going to look at bulls in particular registered bulls which I'm going to do today. Now if you are raising calves for sale at auction, you're not raising calves for your own breeding program, then some of these factors may not be as important to you but they are still important overall. For example, calving ease is a very important one because you want to make sure that if you introduce a bull to your herd, let's say you were running heifers that have not yet been bred, you want to make sure that you have a high calving ease number so that you have less likelihood that your heifers are going to have to be assisted in giving birth whenever they do have that first calf. So for me I have cows which are animals that have already given birth at least once and so I am not as concerned about calving ease but at the same time if I later introduce a heifer to my program I do want to make sure that my bull can also service her and not have any problems. So overall it's best to try and find a bull with a low birth weight and with good calving ease so that you don't have to worry about your cows and heifers later on down the road. Armed with this information I look forward to meeting up with Mark to find out more about his breeding operation and check out his Amos bulls. I think this is it. How you doing? Alright, how do you pronounce your last name Mark? Yannach. Tell me a little bit about your program. Well we have a Seasock program. We sell cattle to people that want to use Angus bulls and promote the Angus genes and we sell a couple hundred bulls a year. Oh wow. We have a sale here at the house first Friday in December. We sell 100 bulls there. Then we sell private treaty bulls to people like you all year long. Okay. So we have I think about 20 bulls now available. I know that you know the EPDs it's the traits the characteristics that you know are expected in a particular bull. How do you predict whether a bull will be above or below average? So first off we send all of our Burt weights and wean weights to American Angus and then they process that within contemporary groups and generate an EPD from that. As far as the marbling and rib eye we do ultrasounding and scan the animals and then that's also the the process. There's a new thing DNA testing that we're doing now. We just started that a year ago. It's supposed to be up to five times more accurate than EPDs. Is that considered genomically enhanced EPDs? Yes. Awesome. Okay. So you know we're looking at the same traits that we're looking at as far as EPDs on genomics but it's kind of pushing it farther down the line as far as predictability. Generally an EPD on a young animal is about 5% genomics but it can be up to 50%. It moves the accuracy up that much. Wow. That's significant. At this point I asked Mark if he could give me a quick tour of his breeding operation and also explain their bull calf vaccination program. We do a trick test on some of the bulls that are herd bulls and we never had trick you know show up. We have a few bulls that are not registrable. The new rule is now you have to trick test all of those. Okay. We've tested probably over the last five years 100-150 bulls and all negatives. So we're good with that. Then as far as vaccinations at three to five months we do a blackleg, a Vib6, a deworming and then when we wean them we do a booster like an eight-way blackleg again, a Vib6 plus VL5. We do a couple other shots of a foot guard shot and a mycoplasma shot. Here's where we we actually you know weigh the cattle and work the cattle is our hydraulic chute. A scale right here electronic scale. Bring them down right here and then you know just put them in this uh nice. I got my get my weaning heights I got it labeled on here and just get my weaning heights off of there and and on a on our yearling bulls when we test them we get a scrotal measurement and a weight and then this is where we also semen test the bulls. I was curious to know what percentage of their bulls are kept as breeders versus sold at auction and also whether having low birth weight bulls is an important consideration in their breeding program. Okay, so probably when we started out in 91 we were probably at 10 to 20 percent at weaning time cut off and sell to the barn. Now after rigorous culling processes we're probably only at five or less percent. Wow! And uh we try to use all low-birth weight bulls but from time to time we get some higher birth weight calves and you know if their birth EPD is uh not acceptable for heifers. Uh we have quite a few breeders that use bulls for F1 Brangus or F1 Tiger Stripe cows and they actually need a little more birth weight. Everybody's scared of the birth weight and and the Angus breed has ran so far down that you know they're in the negatives on this birth EPD and you know you get little jacks rabbits out of it you can't expect the growth from those calves. Right. Uh we stay around a one to two on birth weight and we can have all of our heifers, cows, they're all calving unassisted with you know not us right on top of them. You know we try to have a calving season so we're checking cattle every day day and a half uh on these places when we're calving. But they're doing it on their own. And so most people are coming to me I want the lightest bird weight bull you got. Well you know we we don't just shoot for that real super extreme low birth weight because you feel like the growth then don't come along with it. Right. I also want to hear your thoughts on registered versus unregistered. I've always bought registered uh just because people recommended it to me. I noticed that you did have a couple of unregistered on your website. They may have been sold already but what is your thoughts on buying registered versus unregistered? There's less predictability of what it's actually going to do a non-registered bull but calving ease wise you still wouldn't have a problem. Especially on these F1 type cattle. you know when you're not registered. There was a sire we used way back when 10-15 years ago. Bonnevue new design 1407 and he threw a lot of white underneath and they got some stipulations where the white can be. And so uh that's one reason why maybe some of the mamas that we kept uh they didn't qualify and and we thought really good cows so we just kept them in the register program. Or I collect the records. My wife processes the records. And so I don't know why did you get this or why didn't you get this or why didn't you get this and I don't have a big workforce. It's myself and my son help working and we're running about 300 Angus cows and sometimes you just can't get everything done as everyone knows that but sometimes if it don't line up the parentage uh or just whatever it is uh we just go commercial with the female or or even with the bull. And commercial meaning unregistered. Yes. Unregistered pure Angus bull. And so therefore three guys are grading these bulls. bulls when we sell them and if they grade out where we think they're uh they fit in certain prices well that's where they go. It don't really matter if they registered or non-registered. Very few of the people here are buying registered bulls for registered cows. I'd say 95% of my buyers are commercial people like you. Like myself. Right. Yeah. Well let's go take a look. The red tag bulls are three quarter Angus quarter Bramer bulls. Green tag bulls are all uh Angus bulls. Now what are the ages of these bulls here? Uh these bulls are born in uh probably end of February and March. I was kind of looking for something more in the 18 to 24 month uh range. Do you have anything that might fit that bill? Probably right at the moment no. The last month we've had a run on bulls. Uh so most of our older bulls are are pretty much gone. One thing I would say though depending on the size of your cows uh these bulls are weighing 1100 pounds. Angus bulls are bigger as breeders and if there's a way to get it done they'll sure enough get them cows bred. If you got some kind of giant cows well then that's a different story but these bulls still have a lot of growing to do. We've been telling bulls to go out to breed at this 14-15 months of age. Up to 18 months but the last month like I said sold probably 30 bulls. Knocked out all those older bulls. Gotcha. Although Mark's bulls looked to be in great shape and had amazing genetics to boot, given that my cows average around 1450 pounds each, I thought it best to hold off and try to find a little bit older bull for my remaining cows. Although I wasn't able to procure a replacement bull on this trip, I appreciated all of the information that Mark provided. In addition, Mark's son Jordan was kind enough to give me a tour of the property. As we were driving along, I noticed that they had electrified swinging poles instead of gates. This avoids having to open and close gates behind you while also preventing livestock from passing through. Clever. Only downside is they do scratch, put a little Texas pinstripe in the garage. Right. So do other things out here, mesquites and other things as well. But what impressed me more were the Angus bulls that the Yonox are raising for their December sale. These will be the two-year-old bulls that we sell and we'll have another 50 to 60 yearlings that we'll be putting a sale. So we'll have around 100 bulls, you know, offered on that day. Wow. And this will be in December of this year? Yes, sir. First Friday in December. One thing is for certain, the Yonox raised some good-looking Angus bulls. So I heard your dad say earlier that you guys also do some meat packing and meat processing. Tell me a little bit about that. Yes, sir. I guess it would have been my great-grandpa, I think about 85 years ago. He got into the meat business. Well, back then they sold just about anything. Feed, they bought pecans, they sold your flour, anything, you know, whatever you needed for the house, they did. Back then there wasn't no refrigeration, so he built like a 10 by 10 building and it was meat lockers. So people could come here, drop their meat off, have it frozen and then pick it up when they need it. About 10 years ago, we had bought it out, my grandpa and my dad. We harvest every Thursday. The people on the floor are my dad, my grandpa, my uncle, and then me and my brother. So it's still a family business. Do people from around this area bring their own animals? Yes, sir. We probably do anywhere from 10 to 20 a week. At BN, we have J-Bar Angus. We do about 15 or 20 calves a year. We fatten up and then sell them to people to then have them processed there. So we can take care of you any way you need. How about that? At the end of the tour, I thanked Jordan for showing me around and agreed to try and check out their December sale. But in the meantime, I still needed a bull to cover my cows this season. Fortunately, as I was heading home, some good friends called to let me know that they had a young bull for sale with incredible genetics. Could this be the one?
