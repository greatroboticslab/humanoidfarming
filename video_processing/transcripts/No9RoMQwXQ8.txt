Howto & Style
 Hey folks, we're gonna do a little corn planting today and I want to carry you all through the process now keep up because I'm moving quick So I get my BCS tiller out there and I'm gonna work my spot real good One last time before I get ready now. I'm gonna carry you all the way through the process here Working the soil drip irrigation planting and turning my drip irrigation on So what I did back during the winter times I had a tarp on this spot right here and I left that tarp on their all-winter long So when I got ready for corn plant time, I just simply took that a tarp off and I'm tilling it one time here And I'm gonna be ready to lay off my rose and put down some drip tape You see my BCS tiller here. I love that thing there. I got it from Joel over at earth tools I've had a Grillo before too, but man I love these things a little pricey the Grillo to me is just as nice as the BCS It's got a few less bells and whistles, but works fine. Now this thing's pretty heavy duty So it's gonna wear you out if you're used to working I like to offset my handles or walk beside of it So I don't walk by directly behind it leave those footprints that last row you're gonna leave a few all right now We're getting ready to lay off our rose now use these little electric fence post and string Because I like to have straight rows now. That's not necessarily something you got to do But it's just what I like to do. I like my rose be nice and straight and And I lay off my rose and I get all the rose exactly the same distance apart So when I get down to the end of the row, I just simply take my uh simply take my My string and move it over measure off keep me a tape measure in my pocket And I'll move it over now you do this two or three different ways You go ahead and lay off your rose at one time Just kind of draw your little indention in the soil area. You can do it each time I like to keep that string up just high enough so that it straddles my wheel and I keep it directly in between my wheels on my wheel hoe there now these plows I'm lay I got to put together there and I'm laying off what we call A furrow and I'm gonna lay my drip tape in that furrow for my sweet corn I'm gonna have about six rows here Now I'm laying these off at 36 inches apart You can do 30 inches I've done 30 inches before works fine this particular plot worked good for uh 36 inches but that's what I did so I got my uh furs laid off Now I'm putting that drip tape down with that drip tape layer attachment Just simply roll it through there and this thing here makes uh makes it easy work for me Used to back in the day it took two people to roll this thing out But when we invented this thing here and got it perfected It's changed my life on putting drip tape out I can get it right by myself and do it you kind of notice there I use these little pegs that come in your drip Tape kit that I peg the tape down on the ends and that keeps it from pulling when I start off Now I also keep me some lineman scissors I buy them Klein scissors at the home depot And that's what I keep in my pocket to cut my tape with There I'm laying that uh spike back in there holding that drip tape Run down through there and man it just don't take no time to put this drip tape out On my drip tape from corn I like to use the 8 mil tape because that's the one that works best for annuals is the 8 mil now you'd use the 15 mil if you was doing something you're going to leave it there four or five years but I'm probably going to remove this after this year so the 8 mil works fine This row here has about 1500 feet on there and it'll last me a long time Now with corn I got six rows here you always want to plant your corn in in plots instead of two or three long rows there's maggie making her appearance and that's because corn is pollinated by the wind not by insects so you want to make sure that you got at least four rows I like to have at least six rows so you get good pollination Now I plant sweet corn in this plot right here and we love to grow sweet corn sweet corn is something we really enjoy we put a lot of it up in the freezer and it provides us a good food source all winter long it's a good bit of work when it comes off and it's ready to pick it's ready to pick and we have to get to it and we normally take a day off to get our corn put up you'd be surprised how much corn you'll get off a little bitty plot like I'm doing right here right now All right, so I'm through laying my drip tape now it's time to put my mainline tubing out I'll take that same spike there and I'll lay this tubing out and I'll pin it in on the ends and let the sun hit it for just a minute and that'll cause that tub tubing there to straighten out on me and it won't roll back up Now I'm laying my fittings out getting ready to hook up my filter regulator combo Now I got these risers in my garden, but that's just simply a water hose fitting so a water hose would fit nicely to this if I had to do it over again, that's probably what I would do them risers kind of getting in my way sometimes So I keep it uh pinned down on ends and I start putting my filter regulator combo in and I'm attaching my mainline tubing to that drip layer combo So Get it all ready now What I'm doing is putting my roast arches in now here's a little secret use those scissors there on these roast arches And get you a good straight cut A good straight cut is important to keep those things from leaking excessively Kind of have to wiggle them a little bit. I like to keep the dirt out of them keeping them as clean as possible And after you do this a few times you'll kind of get the uh hang of it Take my hole punch twist it get my hole in there for my bar fitting There we go And then kind of wiggle it on there now sometimes you may have to go back and readjust these a little bit if you got an excessive leak It's one of those kind of things you could use another hand sometimes But uh once you get everything laid out it kind of goes pretty quick Yep, so here's the ends now what I will do here is I will turn my water on and flush these ends out because I've probably got some dirt in there and I want to flush this out. So I will turn my Irrigation system on and I will put my figure eights on right here And what that does is double this main line over so it won't leak The first thing I do is flush it out. So I flush those ends out I put my figure eights on there after I flush the main line Then I go to the end and then I start trimming my ends off And I'm getting ready to put my uh End closures on my drip tape. I like to flush it out good to get all that dirt out of there Here's the end closures kind of fold them over a couple times pull them And they work good. Now we're getting ready to plant a corn with our horse garden souter I'm planting a variety this year that uh Was sent to us for us to try to see if we'd like it. We could offer it y'all next year. It's a SH2 variety It's a SH2 type I might say So I got my rows laid out straight and that's one thing I like to use my string because it gets those rows straight You know, we do a good bit of videos. I like what it looks nice and pretty And uh, there we are planting that seed corn Short work of it now after I got it planted you can see the drip tape is got 12 inches of meters there And it's getting ready to kind of run up and I'll let that kind of work together and get that corn up and growing If you want to learn more about vegetable gardening and growing your own food check this out So So You You You You You You You You You
