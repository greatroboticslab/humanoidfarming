 Excuse some of this but some of it looks nasty I've been trying to tidy it up but this is the tallest plant oh one more step up on this ladder tallest plant we have this year I just measured her in at 82 82 inches almost seven feet this is blue haze one of the first seeds I had like three or four blue haze seeds so I had blue haze one and two I think this is the second one no this is the first one the second was down already this is the first one and this was the tallest one of the two seeds so production wise just come down here um height wise yes it looks nice but in all honesty you really only get if this branch is about three and a half feet you might get half of that branch will give you good moderate production and then everything else is going to be the trash popcorn nose you know what I mean this this tree these these trees inside the greenhouse had constant defoliation and they were topped at least twice um once in veg once in flower and they all stretched um in five gallons of um of peat moss perlite and then this all had the botanic hair uh formula I was pretty much feeding it uh the pure the pure soil not the soilless medium and also the veg formula as well and you know what I'm happy with the thickness of the colas these have to get wet uh wet cut so you know don't be too too fooled by the size but we did get a little bit of anomalies I found a weird branch here that maybe didn't get enough light compared to its next branch right next to it so this another reason I took this point also early is because this is seven feet tall this greenhouse is not um so everything was starting to push and press you can see the blue cheese is right here in the back I'm going to pull that towards the middle to try and buy a little bit of space but everything's kind of pushing and it does have a negative effect on the buds structure and its development so I'm trying to gain space as much as I can but I'm trying to pre-prep all these plants to get cut down and dry gelato blue cheese I can't remember this is what happens again when I write the name on wooden popsicle sticks and after four months you can't read the shits anymore so I gotta remember what this two gallon one is and I have no clue I think this is my Jamaican one this one's getting like I don't know a foxtail is what you call it when just a very in cold it gets so heavy everything just bends over but this one I think is a Jamaican one here so I think it looks very familiar to last year when I ran it but I have no clue what that one is here and then our cabbage is actually coming back believe it or not and these are all the clothes oh it's kind of a clones from the blue haze plants one two three four five six six back there those are all the clones from those ones and then tomatoes and whatnot's heavy back there but yeah that's pretty much what we got going on where we're at we're pretty much middle of harvest and we're gonna just keep working on these ones here until I can get them all down but so far so good with the first set of harvest stick plants they're all sitting in cure right now but no complaints so far we're gonna get rocking trying to get some of these this foliage down so I mean again this is why I did a scrub net to keep this thing tight and low and not high and growing out of control and seven feet tall and ruining bud structure and stuff like that and you know so you live and you learn but yeah this is definitely a different difference in genetics when you sit down and really kind of play with it and understand it and see what yield difference in yield and genetics and everything and how that comes into play in your growing environment so I'll get working on this bad boy here but you can see where you know wasted space to be honest wasted space all this is wasted space so I don't know if I defoliated too much or what I don't know but it caused a lot of this wasted space but it is what it is what it is we got something on the top so keep it going
