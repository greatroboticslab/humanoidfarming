 On January 1st, I started my onions from seed in my basement. In March, my onion seedlings got planted in the garden, and now on the last day of June, I harvested 143 beautiful onions that are now starting to cure for storage. It took me three years to be able to grow onions this large and beautiful, and I'm so proud of all the hard work that went into them.
