 Methods of Soil Conservation Soil plays an important role in the sustenance of life on earth. However, the quality of soil can get degraded over time due to soil erosion. There are several methods to conserve soil. Let us look at some of them. First, let us look at mulching. Mulch is a layer of material such as leaves, twigs, straw and farm waste. It is spread on the surface of the soil around the plants. Mulching prevents soil loss and the loss of moisture from the soil. It also enriches the soil and protects the roots of plants from heat and cold. Now let us look at contour bunding. Cover bunding is the practice of building barriers called bunds across slopes. The bunds follow the contour or the relief of the land. They slow down the speed with which water flows down the slope and thus prevent or minimize soil erosion. Sometimes, trenches are made in front of the bunds to hold rainfall and increase soil moisture. Plugging is another method to control the erosion of soil. Sometimes, in places without tree cover, surface runoff carries away the top soil leading to the formation of small valleys or channels known as gullies. These gullies can grow over time and destroy the soil. To prevent this, the gullies are plugged in with piles of rocks which then slow down the flow of water. Intercropping is another method of soil conservation in which two or more crops are grown in alternate rows in the same field at the same time. When it rains after a crop is harvested, the second crop holds the soil together and protects it from erosion. Terrace farming is an effective method of conserving soil in places that have steep slopes. The slopes are converted into a series of gently sloping platforms where crops are grown. This helps in slowing down water during rains and reducing surface runoff. Another effective method of soil conservation is afforestation. Afforestation refers to the planting of trees or forests in a place that lacks substantial tree cover. The roots of the trees bind the soil and prevent it from getting washed away. These soil conservation methods help in sustaining the productivity of soils and conserving them.
