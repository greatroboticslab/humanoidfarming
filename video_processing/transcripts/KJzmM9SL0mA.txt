 Farms are places where people grow food and raise animals. Almost all the food we eat, whether it's a shiny apple, a crunchy carrot, a fresh egg or a glass of milk, comes from a farm. There are different kinds of farms. Some farms grow things like fruits, vegetables, grains and nuts. Fields may be full of corn or apple trees loaded with red apples. There are farms that grow wheat, tomatoes, lettuce and loads of other fruits and vegetables. Other farms are where animals live. Here you might see cows in a field eating grass, pigs rolling in the mud, sheep grazing all day long or chickens pecking around. Growing plants on a farm is called crop farming. Farmers who grow crops start by getting the soil ready. Then they plant seeds or young plants and take care of them by giving them water and making sure they get enough sunlight. They also keep the plants safe from bugs and remove any weeds. When the plants have grown, they're harvested or picked to be eaten or used in other ways. Animal farming is another important part of a farm. This is where farmers raise animals. Cows, for example, give us milk and meat. Chickens give us eggs and meat too. And pigs are raised for pork. Farmers make sure their animals have enough food and water, a safe place to live and that they stay healthy. Farmers use different machines and tools to help them on the farm. Big machines like tractors help to prepare the fields and plant seeds. Machines called harvesters are used to collect the crops when they're ready. Farmers also use tools like shovels and rakes for planting and taking care of the plants and animals. After the crops are picked or the animals are taken care of, the food has to get to us. This can happen in different ways. Sometimes food goes to the store when we buy it and sometimes it's sold right from the farm. Farmers also help take care of our planet. They use ways of farming that are good for the soil and water and that don't cause pollution. Some farmers use what's called sustainable farming. This means they farm in a way that's good for the environment now and that will still be good for the environment when we grow up. Farms are really amazing places. They give us our food, help people in our community have jobs and teach us about how important it is to take care of the earth.
