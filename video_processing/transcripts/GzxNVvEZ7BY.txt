Science & Technology
 This time-tested method involves alternating different types of crops in the same area across seasons, enhancing soil quality and boosting yields. From ancient Chinese practices to the medieval three-field system in Europe, crop rotation has a rich history. Farmers knew that crops like legumes could replenish soil nitrogen, a key nutrient. This led to cycles where nutrient-depleting and nutrient-enriching crops were grown in succession. Traditional practices emulated natural ecosystems, reducing erosion, managing pests organically, and maintaining a balanced farm ecosystem. This wisdom laid the groundwork for modern, sustainable farming. By rooting current techniques in these historical practices, we harness age-old wisdom to solve today's agricultural challenges.
