 Agricultural Waste Management Agricultural waste is unwanted or unsalable materials produced wholly from agriculture operations directly related to the growing of crops or raising animals for the primary purpose of making profit or for livelihood. Agricultural waste is composed of organic wases such as animal excreta in the form of slurries and farmed manures spent in mushrooms composed of soiled water and silage effluent. Agricultural waste includes natural waste, animal waste, and plant waste. Field wases, weeds, and straws, animal wases, animal dung, or dead bodies. Agro-industrial wases such as sugar cane molasses and peels. Waste management is an important element of environment protection. Its purpose is to provide hygiene-efficient and economic solid waste storage collection, transport, and treatment of disposal of waste without polluting the atmosphere, soil, or water system. Composting has become a preferable option to treat organic wases. Composting is a method in which organic matter present in agricultural waste is decomposed by aerobically or anaerobically through a biochemical process and converted into humus.

It requires the introduction of oxygen to composed piles to allow aerobic microbes to thrive. An aerobic composting decomposes waste without oxygen. Organic materials are piled up and breaks down naturally. This process does not need any type of maintenance and will not need to be turned. Compost is used to improve the soil fertility in gardens, landscaping, horticulture, urban agriculture, and organic farming. The compost is beneficial by providing nutrients as fertilizer to the crop acting as soil conditioner, increasing the humus or humic acid content of the soil, and most important action of introducing beneficial colonies of microbes in the soil. Waste management helps maintain healthy environment for farm animals and can reduce the need for commercial fertilizers while providing other nutrients needed for crop production. If wases are not properly handled, they can pollute surface and groundwater water and contribute to air pollution. The purpose of waste management is to protect the environment and the public. mondo
