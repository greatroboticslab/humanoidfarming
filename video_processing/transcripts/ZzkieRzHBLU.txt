 In Kenya's Makueni County, Caroline Masimbi farms black beans through a process called conservation agriculture. The process aims to achieve sustainable and profitable agriculture. With this method, she has solved some problems such as soil degradation. I started conservation agriculture after training, where we were trained by master trainers. Dorothy Kanini is another farmer who has gotten good results by practicing conservation agriculture in her cowpeas farming. I used animal manure and when I planted, I noticed a huge difference on the farm. The produce was much better too. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, CA holds great potential for all farm sizes and agro-ecological systems, although it is most needed by smallholder farmers. Since 2015, more than 26,000 farmers in Kenya have adopted conservation agriculture. 3,500 of them now have market linkages with contracts and are developing cottage industries. I'd say it has really helped my business as well as gaining a lot of knowledge with regards to farming. Disadvantages in the short term might be the high initial cost of specialized planting equipment and the completely new dynamics of a conservation farming system. It requires high management skills and a learning process by the farmer. However, all these problems can be resolved as soon as the farmer gets experience. We'll see. We'll see.
