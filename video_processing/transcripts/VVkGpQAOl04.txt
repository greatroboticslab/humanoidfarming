 When your tomato plants reach 30-40 cm in height, it's time to perform an important technique called bending the plant. This involves carefully bending the main stem of the plant to a horizontal position. Choose a sunny afternoon between 3 and 5 p.m. to perform this task. The purpose of bending the plant is to reduce its apical dominance, which encourages the growth of more lateral roots instead of just one main root. This increase in root mass leads to a stronger and more productive plant.
