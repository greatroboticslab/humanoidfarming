 Are you using the shotgun approach? Hi, Brenton Ford here. Welcome to another EffortlessSwimming.com update where swimming fast is easy. If you look at what the top swimmers do in their training, they focus their training for one event in particular. So they won't use a shotgun approach where they're targeting the 1500 freestyle and the 100 butterfly and the 400 medley all at once. They target their training towards one event in particular. So if you're racing a number of distances or a number of different races over your racing season, you're better off targeting your main event and training towards that than trying to cater for all of these different events and distances while you're doing your training because that way you probably won't get as good a results for your main event. You might get a slightly better result across the board, but if you're looking for a really good result in your main event that you're targeting for the season, you're better off focusing your training towards that one distance and that one event. If you'd like help training towards that one event, whether it's a triathlon, an open water swim or a pool swim, then I'd love for you to join me in Swimprove.com, which is our online coaching program where we've got workouts, we've got technique programs, we've got a whole bunch of stuff to help you target that main event for the season.
