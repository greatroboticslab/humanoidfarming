 You John's been here 35 years. Our dad ran it before that. Seems dad had a name for this place. The beacon. Hello? Oh, hello, Johnny. How are you? We got some rain last night? Must be a little damp this morning then. Yeah? Why don't you try it and shoot a sample in it? I'll run a moisture test on it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh, the permit book? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. You're missing the application form, are you? Yeah, well, that's in the mail today. Okay. Yep. All right. Bye. Array. Good morning, we're hayden quicks out of town, by the way.

Not too bad. Well, are you going to weigh this thing right today, John? I always do, don't I? Not bad, but it sure is a wild windy day today. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know.

Pays off. Pretty good-looking derby got here, Joe. Now, it all begins with the farmer when he comes in and dumps his grain in the pit down under the elevator. I know that. The furthest farmer comes from about 12, maybe 15 miles, and it's all big trucks. 300 bushels or more. And a fellow brings in three, maybe four loads a day. And John, he doesn't just stand there. It's harvest and a lot to be done. He's responsible to about 100 farmers or more. There's checks to be issued, permit books, quotas to be noted. And in the end, he's got to keep track of how much grain he takes in. Well, I'll be in the room with a whole, huh? Yeah. A little bit of birds. A little some for the birds or the chickens. Right. Okay, we'll see you later on. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, we'll see you later on. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You got to keep in the room with a little bit of birds. A little some for the birds or the chickens. Right. Okay. We'll see you later on. Okay. Okay. Okay. See you later. Okay. Okay. Come on. Okay, I'll get this thing in there now. I'll get this thing in there. I'll get this thing in there. Okay. Okay, I'll put that derby in the bin to seven. This elevator is made up of 20, 21 storage bins for different types of grain and various grades. The grain is elevated by cups on a belt called the lake. And at the top, the grain falls into a funnel-like thing they call the gerber. Now. ehhh... Oh, my. It looks so bad it could be dry. See what she says for temperature. We got some hot stuff here. stuff here look. of course the sun's been shining on it. 26 Celsius reading here about 38 38 and 50 uh oh that's good 13 9. sure you can give her a hell now. okay thank you. so I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. The gerber spout is controlled from the bottom down here. It's connected to it. We have a dial here and it's numbered according to our bin numbers. And to make sure it's sitting on the right saucer down there, we have to go up and have a look. Because sometimes she doesn't work all the time and it gets out of place a little bit. And you probably think you have a number nine bin and you're probably on number eight. And you could run into a problem there. Now when John's loading boxcar, he stands mainly behind that hopper there. The grain comes from the bins. And he'll draw, I think it's 22 hoppers to a boxcar. He checks the grain and then he weighs it. A little too much left to add another 10 bushels on here. Okay, we'll see what we got here. John records the contents and the weights on the way bell for the railroad. 580. I guess we got another five more to go. The leg elevates it back up to the top. The gerber shoots it into the waiting boxcar. Get some of this dust that way. I can see how you get your elevator clean, John. It's the farmer that comes in here and sweeps it for you. You've got all the deductions off, John? The block sold and whatever I got during the last couple of months. Don't get it entered in the farmer over here. So that does me for this time around, eh? No, I think you're firm. Quota-wise. Very well looks after it. Okay. Close enough. Okay? Yep. Looks good, John. So long, George. Now, mind this is not a very big shipping point. John only loads about 150 boxcars a year. Your technology needs water. I bet you save yourNe한bin or no like that. Let's put a method on a Rs on aêve din fast. Yeah. It was a huge drop and like this.
