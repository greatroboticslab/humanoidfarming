 We're in one of the last fields of pumpkins I have to harvest here on Ramsire Farms. We have about 700 acres. We're farming about 600 of it. We are in Wayne County and we're right in the middle of the pumpkin patch. We're raising corn, soybeans, wheat, pumpkins, and I like to say we raise M&Ms. We have an ag entertainment part of our farm and we like to make memories for the public and so that's where we get our M&Ms that we like to raise. Well we're trying to save the land for the future generation. You can't produce new land and so once it's gone, it's gone and you lose that lifestyle that is so important. So right now we have just over 7,000 acres total between five Ag Security areas. That includes 97 different property owners or properties. The ASA is an agricultural incentive tool more or less. What it really does is it allows us to create a buffer and kind of preserve our farmland while still providing an opportunity for farmers to receive tax incentives to further invest in their properties to make their farmland even more viable than it already may have been. Well that gives us added protection that we can preserve the land and for future generations to be able to enjoy what I've been able to enjoy and what our families enjoy. In order to be part of an Ag Security Area you have to have a minimum of 500 contiguous acres. It's not something that they have to commit to for life but it is a way of preserving farmland and if they are looking to possibly build say a new structure they have possible opportunities for incentives. It lasts for 10 years. It is pretty easy to renew it but again a person can pull out of it after 10 years with no penalty. We have the city just right on our doorstep. We butt right up to the center of the road with them and they are just going right down the road buying farm after farm. And so I am trying to do all I can and I hope our neighboring farms will join in and try to preserve the land so that our future generation can be able to raise crops and enjoy a rural life.
