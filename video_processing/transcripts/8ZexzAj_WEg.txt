 Bextra Feeders, research proven to reduce hay waste by up to 75 percent. Designed by cattlemen, for cattlemen, the Bextra is convenient, cattle friendly, and built to last. The Bextra features balanced positioning, keeping the bale centered, durable bottom sheeting that saves hay in the manger area, and restricted top feeding. This prevents hay from being pulled from the top and dropped to the ground. When every dollar counts, the Bextra Feeder maximizes your feed investment. Trusted by cattle producers across the country for nearly two decades, the Bextra Bale Feeder is available in three models. The Green Bextra is a great option for smaller herds and younger cattle. Our best-selling feeder, the Black Bextra Heavy, is built from thicker, stronger carbon steel. Durable and designed for larger cattle and all size herds, the Red Bextra Extreme is just as heavy duty but constructed from galvanil, providing best-in-class corrosion protection ideal for wetter climates. Whatever your land and cattle demand, there's a Bextra to suit your operation. Bextra by Tartar, now exclusively available through your Tartar retailer.
