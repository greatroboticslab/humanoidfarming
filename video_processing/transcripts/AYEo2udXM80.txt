 I'm Lothar Bowman and here's a little bit of advice for people that want to get into farming. First of all, I'd say it's got to be something that you love doing. You've got to be able to adapt. We started out doing one thing and we are completely off that track now, which eventually we'll get back to it. But farming is not only an occupation, but it's more than that. It's a lifestyle. You can experience stuff that you can't experience in other places. Another thing I think, and I've talked to some Amish people about this, you're about as close to God as what you can possibly be. Because this is where life starts. And you are right. You're probably at the pulse or the heartbeat of life. And that's what farming is. And if you get a farm, whether it's small or large, sometimes I think I wish I could have bought 40 acres of prime land and paid $10,000, $15,000 an acre for it. I'd be better off than what I have having 400 of this, you know. But, you know, land is something that it's not more being made and you can leave it to your children. And hopefully you'll have a person who will have at least one that will follow in their footsteps. My name is Bryce Bauman from Lazy A Stock Farm, Paintlet, Kentucky. I think the advice I would have for someone just starting out is to start small. Start selling in local markets. We operate a CSA, which is quite a commitment. I don't think that's the way to learn how to grow vegetables. You need to kind of get your feet wet, sell at the local farmers market, have some small projects, figure out what it is that you're passionate about, and expand from there. That's what farming is to me. I mean, it's a way of life and community.
