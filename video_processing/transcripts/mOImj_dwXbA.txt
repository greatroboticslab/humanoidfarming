 Hey there eSparkers! In this quest you're going to use what you know about root words, prefixes, and suffixes to figure out the meaning of new words. Wait a minute, what are root words? Root words are words that stand alone without prefixes or suffixes. New words are made when a prefix or suffix is added to the beginning or end of the root word. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Here's an example of a root word, play. If you add the prefix re to play, the word becomes replay, which means to play again. If you add the suffix ed to play, the word becomes played, the past tense of play, which means to have done something in the past. In this quest you will learn how prefixes and suffixes can change the meaning of root words that you're already familiar with. Good luck and have fun eSparking!
