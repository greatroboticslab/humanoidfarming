 100 feet below London's busy streets, there are rows of green, farmland like you've never seen before. Leaky greens are possible, microgreens, heads of lettuce. The project called Growing Underground relies on a World War II air raid shelter to hold its tasty harvest. I can eat this. Yeah, you can eat it, yeah. The first of its kind, this farm provides an innovative alternative for urban agriculture, growing herbs like parsley, chives, and cilantro. Unlike traditional farms, the sun is replaced by this LED lighting. The temperature is also very carefully controlled, allowing crops to grow year-round. Farms based in cities have a smaller carbon footprint. Here we can harvest, we can deliver into our customers, some of them very, very close by in a few hours. One stop on their delivery route, the restaurant Eska, located just above the farm. Chef Eric Jansen uses the herbs in his signature dishes. It makes it very good looking and presentable. The crop concept surprises many customers. Well, it's amazing, isn't it? I didn't know that. I mean, it tastes amazing anyway. It tastes really good. So it doesn't taste any different? No, no different. It tastes really good, really fresh. Growing underground success has encouraged other cities like New York to start planting similar farms. There's a vast amount of underground space all over the world. Meaning the next farm could soon be growing right under your feet. Gwen Baumgartner, CBS News, London.
