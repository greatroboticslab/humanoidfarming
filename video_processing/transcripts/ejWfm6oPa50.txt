 How's your microphone? Should we go ahead and get started? Can everyone hear me? Okay. Yeah. Fantastic. Okay. Let's get started. Welcome and thanks for joining this C-GAP ISF Advisors webinar on rural livelihoods in a changing food system. I'm Jamie Anderson. I work at C-GAP. We're a think tank on financial inclusion housed at the World Bank, and I lead our work on rural and agricultural livelihoods. At C-GAP, we see financial services as one mechanism, among others, that people living in poverty can use to build resilience and capture opportunities. Our work's about more than simply increasing the number of people with a bank account or who are considered financially included. Instead, our approach to financial services centers people living in poverty and customer value, asking financial services for who? To do what and in what context? For who, meaning how we differentiate and design for specific client profiles and needs by livelihood, gender, life stage, location. To do what? To generate income, access essential services, protect basic living standards. To what end would that service be used? To generate income, the number of people living in poverty and people living in poverty and live in poverty, living in poverty, and living in poverty, and living in poverty. To generate income, and living in poverty and living in poverty. And for rural and agricultural livelihoods, that means we're talking about food systems. Which brings us to today's conversation on the trends and tensions shaping food and financial systems, and rural livelihoods. I'm really pleased to be hosting this webinar with Matt Chakowskoy from ISF Advisors. Before turning over to Matt, just a few housekeeping points to make as we get started. Note that we're recording today. We'll share a link to the recording and the deck in an email to follow. Please share your questions and comments in the chat box as we go, and feel free to direct them to a specific panelist. The chat box is over there in the right-hand column, and make sure you choose all participants in the drop-down box. We'll have about 15 minutes at the end to cover as many of your comments as we can. We'll also share a link to a Google form toward the end for your reactions and to continue this conversation. And finally, hope for the best on technology. Sometimes there's a time lag or a connection issue, so if anything comes up, please be patient, and we'll work through it. So with that said, I'll invite Matt to start the discussion and bring our three stellar panelists into this conversation. Thanks, Jamie. So in providing a bit of a starting point for this conversation, as Jamie started to introduce, it's useful to consider the sheer scale and complexity of the global food system. We're talking about a system that represents more or less 10% of the global economy at roughly $8 trillion. And it's possibly the most important system we have on Earth. And you think that it's critical to sustaining global population. It underpins the livelihoods of over 2 billion people. And it's such an important cultural dimension to many countries. But it's also incredibly complex. And it looks so different in every country and even down to each region and city. So as we talk about the future of the food system, that conversation necessarily needs to happen at different levels, around different issues, and with different constellation of actors. However, I guess we believe that what's happened over the last six months with COVID is rapidly disrupting, I guess, decades of more incremental development in our food system. And what tends to happen with that more sequential, incremental development that we all see unfold over years and then decades is that there's inherently a set of values and beliefs and ways of organizing things that get institutionalized. They just become the world around us. And we become aware that that's the way things are. So as we've reflected as ISF and CGAP on what's been happening, we believe COVID changes that trajectory in some part, reminding us just how important the food system is as different parts of the system are strained, compromised, or in some instances completely shut down. So this is a challenging time, but it's also an opportunity to revisit our vision for parts of the food system, rethinking our mindsets and how we approach our work, the values we implicitly apply, and a time to really reflect on what the food system is set up to deliver. So with all this in mind, we, along with CGAP, have convened to this conversation as one part of what will be much larger, longer running sets of conversations, debates, symposiums, negotiations, conferences, to revisit some of the fundamentals of a food system that we've all become deeply entrenched and embedded in. And we believe this new conversation needs to be bold and it needs to be different to match the moment and the incredible progress the world has made over the last 20 years. To us, I mean, as we've reflected on it, different means being much, much more multidisciplinary and working across silos and areas of expertise, bringing as much of a system thinking lens to that conversation as possible, being much more direct in confronting some of the tensions that are inherent and being cognizant that this is a system that at its very heart has people involved. And we can often quickly lose sight of that very human aspect of the system. So one of these key constituencies, one of these sets of people that are highly impacted is the 500 million or so rural households who directly rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. And in this conversation, we want to put this constituency at the centre of the discussion today and widen the lens to think sort of long term in the 15 to 20 year horizon about things like where the smallholder farming households fit in the future food system, how technology will continue to transform their prospects and involvement. And I guess the role of governments in shaping and enabling this change in different directions at a country level and between countries and regions and even globally. So we're incredibly lucky today because each of our panellists works at the front line of many of these issues and are definitely systems thinkers. And over the next 50 minutes or so, we're going to give Debbie, Christabel and Siaka a chance to share a part of how they see and think about the world from these different angles. So as we get started, let me first welcome and introduce Debbie. Debbie is the co-founder of Proximity Designs, a social business in Myanmar. That's the country's largest ag services platform focused on empowering rural families. Now Proximity is one of those ever evolving businesses that over the past decade has responded to a multitude of challenging moments in Myanmar's history, but at present is organised around the areas of farm technology, advisory services and finance and reaches hundreds of thousands of smallholder farmers in that country. Now, having spent some time in Myanmar with Proximity and Debbie, one of the most unique things I experienced there is their focus on having this growth mindset. In fact, Debbie and her co-founder Jim find this such a compelling concept that all staff at Proximity need to be trained to have this growth mindset. And you can see it reflected in the hallways in almost every aspect of how they operate. Learning and flexibility are definitely the heart of the Proximity culture. So it wasn't a surprise when I caught up with Debbie a few weeks ago that her immediate reaction to this once in a century crisis was to be thinking optimistically in terms of opportunities. So Debbie is exceptionally credentialed and experienced, but very humbled and we're really excited to have her perspective on this call. So Debbie, I guess just to provide a very quick framing for your comments, as we consider the present moment, it's hard not to think about how far we've all come in understanding more about rural households and their relationship to agriculture. And in many ways, the human-centered design movement that you've been a big part of in this space has been matched by this transition from quite a, I guess, a static view of rural farmers to a much more nuanced, dynamic way of considering their needs. So to kick us off, as you think about a food system that's going to continue to industrialize in different ways over the next 20 years, is there even a place for smallholder production and small agri-SMEs? And how do you wrestle with some of these long-term questions about their role? Debbie- Thank you, Matt. And thanks very much for kick-starting this very important discussion. And it's really important, I think, to articulate and name what's not working on this topic. I'd like to answer your question about the role of smallholder farmers for the future by sharing with you how one of our customers, a rice farmer in the Irrawaddy Delta, sees his role in the future. It's about Ute Allen and his wife and six kids who are rice farmers. And they were ready to give up farming. And there's always something wrong with their crops. They didn't know how to choose the right seeds, apply the right amount of fertilizers, and fight against constant pest attacks. Their neighbors urged them to use chemical pesticides. But, you know, Ute Allen's resistant. He said, I want to grow food that is safe for people to eat. So this family was becoming worse off every year. And there was a turning point when he had access to extension support. And they learned practical and simple ways to farm from seed cleaning and proper plant nutrient practices, managing. And now he feels he's in control of his crops and has doubled his yield. He's especially proud that he actually overcame a destructive attack of a stem borer rice pest, a very nasty pest, by using a purely organic solution made from margoza leaves that are commonly found. And so his neighbors are starting to turn to him for advice, farm advice. And, you know, his three eldest children have not finished university and the younger children are able to finish high school. But here's the thing he said. He said, I am most proud that I can leave a legacy of a residue free prosperous farm and a bright future for all of my children. So, you know, he knew he had a larger role to play and that he had dignity and that farming was something that he could be. He wanted to be proud of. So, when I think about the role of smallholder farmers over the next 15 years, I think farmers like, I mean, we see them day in and day out are extremely hardworking, eager, resilient, conscious and entrepreneurial and they aspire to participate and contribute. So I think they have a very critical role to play in the broader context. They grow and make available nutritious, safe and affordable food for the planet's growing population. They directly care for our earth, our soils and water and environment. They provide jobs and income for a majority of the workforce in poor countries. They're serving on the front lines of climate action and directly engaging in mitigation and adaptation strategies. And collectively, they can be an engine for economic growth, food security, child nutrition and poverty reduction. It's well documented that GDP growth that starts with agriculture is about four times more effective in reducing poverty than GDP growth in other sectors. And finally, I think the investment in smallholder farmers can reduce political instability in fragile countries like Myanmar and help reduce uncontrolled migration. So, for the next 15 years, I think ag development is going to mostly be about small farms. And in fact, small farms are multiplying and in some countries becoming more dominant in land distribution. About 90% of all farms are now located in developing countries and most predominantly in Asia and Africa. And despite the growth and national per capita incomes and urbanization, we're not seeing the kind of farm consolidation that happened in economic transformation of today's industrialized countries. So I think small farms will play a critical role for the next 15, 20 years. And we have to examine the value and roles we are assigning to them and ask ourselves at least some key questions. Number one, questions like, how might we reframe our relationships to small farmers and do a better job of listening to their voices? I think it's really about relationships that affirm their dignity and give them choice. Number two, how might we envision a world where small farmers are not squeezed out, but are included in participating profitably in modern food ag food value chain? And three, how might we take out the drudgery associated with smallholder farming and support youth and women to participate? And then, you know, there's a young farmer. You know, there's a young farmer. I met a 30 year old farmer in in Myanmar, who has a degree from university in computer science. And he was using he's farming now returned from the city with his degree, and he's making full use of our online agronomy services and helping other farmers become more digitally connected to these resources. And fourth, how might we be concentrate risk away from small farms and redistribute this burden of vulnerabilities and resources, especially in the space of climate change and pandemic? And lastly, how might we rethink what it means to be efficient? And place value on supply chain resilience locally and improve biodiversity and ecological resilience. And so, in the end, I think it's about what it means, as Matt said, what it means to be human, our connection with other human beings, and especially our connection to small farmers, to the people who grow our food and who take care of our earth, soils and water. And these are social political choices we all need to make. So I'll leave it at that. Thank you. Thanks, Debbie. Such a great way of starting to anchor the discussion here. And I think the word that resonated a lot as you were talking was reconsidering smallholders as real stewards of their role and the natural resources and products that they're producing. I love the way that you connected a very micro level view there to just a very big macro questions. So our second panelist today is Christabel, who is a strategist and development expert that's worked at the forefront of a number of programs and initiatives over the last 10 years through a work at Dalborn Advisors, with Mercy Corps, AgriFin, Accelerate, and most recently at IDEO.org, a leading not-for-profit design studio. And one of the unique aspects of Christabel's experience is that for many years now, she's worked on how emergent technologies come to market and can transform systems. And this has taken her from very tactical considerations of how technologies are adopted by different client segments to solve real problems, all the way up to country and sector level strategies. But having known Christabel for a few years now, I also know her as a part-time philosopher who's always wondering after the much more complex should type questions of her work with that great combination of curiosity and optimism and critical thinking. So Christabel, in the last six to eight years, tech has been the big change that we've witnessed. And particularly in digital agricultural service provision, we've seen this explosion of services and some really exciting new innovations and sort of everything from drones to digital money to e-commerce that now truly reaches almost the very last mile in many places. But as a counterpoint, we've also seen that the power that's created by many of these large technology platforms in the developed world has started to have some negative or questionable outcomes. So I guess from your perspective, how do you think about what rural households can expect from a technologically disrupted future? And is there a dark side of this evolution that we should all be concerned about? Great. Thanks for the introduction, Shaq. When I was thinking about how to use the six minutes that I've been given today, I figured the people in this room probably know more than I do about all the interesting ad related tech solutions that could change how we form, access information, connect markets, et cetera. So I thought rather than focus on the landscape of those technologies, I think I would want to sort of take a 10,000 foot view just to explore. What might it mean for us to realize the promise of technology to revolutionize our ag and food system and then sort of tap into some of the concepts that we've given Shaq. So just provide a bit of context market focus for the next decade, such as that a digital agricultural evolution within us shift or the fourth industrial evolution, which then in theory could help ensure agriculture meets the needs of the global population in the future. And so for me, when I think about the main challenges for other systems in Africa, things come to mind. One is how do we see the growing population to how do we do it sustainably? And then three, how does smallholder farmers who feed almost 70 to 80% of the population in sub Saharan Africa capture value in the advertising? And sure enough technology can help address these challenges, but how do we get there? And at scale, and I have four, so four hypothesis that I've been modeling over and I wanted to walk us through through those in the next few minutes. So first and foremost, I think the economics of smallholder farming, especially in Africa, not necessarily attractive. It's labor intensive, relatively low yielding and most smallholder farmers barely break even. And primarily they end up farming for food security purposes. With this baseline, I think it's a little bit unrealistic to expect that small scale farmers can adopt and realize the benefits of tech and able farming practices without a few shifts. And I think there's an implicit need to actually perhaps change the structure of small scale farming and move a little bit more towards consolidation of farming farms and land holdings in order to then leverage from economies of scale. I think it's a little bit hard to have a farmer who's on an eighth of an acre to move into something like small scale mechanization and leverage technology in that way. But I think consolidation of farms and land holdings can be really tough, especially given the cultural norms around land ownership, but perhaps there's opportunities. There's potential to explore land consolidation without necessarily transferring land ownership. So I think point one is that it can be a bit hard to leverage technologies and realize the benefits of technologies if we don't figure out the economics of smallholder farming in the first place. I think we also probably need to shift a little bit from smallholder farmers to maybe exploring how industrial growers can meet the demand for food and enable farmers to actually grow crops in quantities that can be sold at commodity prices. Obviously the investment capital investment to actualize this is quite significant, but I think as we're thinking about technology economies of scale network effects, et cetera becomes important. Maybe to think about that shift as well. Secondly, I think innovations around applications in agriculture and food systems can be difficult to adopt, especially for all the generations of farmers. Just ask anyone who's had to shift from a Samsung to an iPhone, it's going to be a bit hard to change your operating software. So this means that I think the digital revolution in agriculture will largely have to be led by youth, given that the most agile and most able to adopt new farming practices. And as a result of probably looking at this segment, we'll likely see a shift in the nature of farming. I think we can expect to start to see you venture into other value chains that either have a short, shorter life cycle, or less labor intensive, capture more commercial value, and maybe require small land sizes. So, for example, we expect to see a shift in youth being involved in horticulture over cereal farming, for example. I think sadly, for the culture to become a viable source of livelihood, we need to think about how we can capture more commercial value. What would it take to rebuild the ag sector and start adding value to raw materials locally? What innovative business models can we adopt and how smart technology actually then lower the cost of doing these activities in rural communities? This is, I think that's just some of the questions that we should be exploring around the ability to capture more commercial value in agriculture. And then I think lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic has really disrupted both global and local supply chains. On a local level, I think we're starting to see an increase in more digital delivery of products and services. So, for example, advisory services that are happening over phone or WhatsApp. And I think we might be able to actually capture this moment to drive adoption of digital solutions. I think as we explore how tech can play a role in ag and food systems, there are definitely a couple of issues you can think about. I think the two main issues for me, which Shaq was referring to as the dark side of this evolution. I think the main one is the fact that there's going to be a disproportionate benefit from increasing digitalization of ag and the food team. There's a digital divide that is driven by many factors, gender being one of them, literacy, low literacy levels, weak technological infrastructure in rural areas, high cost of technology to just a few. And there's a risk that those who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods are actually then the same populations that are left behind in this digitalization process. Secondly, I think, so, yes, we managed to increase production leverage technology and we can increase production, but will this actually translate into an increase in income for family population? I don't think so. If farmers don't necessarily have high value and stable market. So if you believe in the market driven approach to production, can you imagine what would happen to our ag systems if we had policies that allowed for ease of trade, let's say within the African continent? So just to summarize, I believe that developing economies can, or the emerging markets can benefit from a digital ag revolution. However, I think it will require a shift in thinking of the structures and the roles of small scale farming. And I think, as we talk about building back better post COVID, I think we really should be thinking about building differently altogether to ensure that either the programs we're running or the policies we're putting in place. Do not continue to keep rural populations trapped in the cycle of poverty, but actually enable them to grow. So, Shaka, I'll just stop there with the results of thoughts. Thanks, Christabel. I think it's refreshing not to hear the standard narrative of all the bright and shiny ways in which technology is going to transform the world. But to be anchored again back into the real way in which a food system works and how that gets integrated. So some really interesting thoughts there, Christabel, and a provocative, I guess, way of thinking about technology. Just a quick reminder, if anyone has any questions for our panelists, please do pop them in the chat function and we'll pick those up and consider them after we hear from our third panelist today, who is Sieka. SIEKA is the deputy program director for the Mercy Corps AgriFin program and also spearheads all of their work in Nigeria. So AgriFin, as many of you will know, is a program that's focused on smallholder farmers living on less than $2 a day and works to catalyze how digital products and services come to market in new ways. Now, SIEKA has a long tenure in working with these technologies as he works with the IFC and Airtel, their mobile money platform before joining AgriFin. But what strikes me about SIEKA is, I guess, his sophistication of understanding around how ecosystems really function. And for anyone who's worked in Nigeria, that is certainly one of those agricultural finance and technology ecosystems that is in no way short on complexity. So SIEKA, COVID has clearly put government front and centre again in the crisis and particularly in managing those complex values based trade offs between health and economics and security outcomes. And just this ever changing environment. So as we consider the ongoing development of the food system and how that translates at a country level, how are you thinking about sort of the role of government alongside private sector going forward? We got you SIEKA? I think you might be on mute. Thanks, Matt. You can hear me. Yeah. And thanks for that illustrious introduction. And it's a great question right there. And it's tough to follow Cristobal. I've worked with Cristobal for quite a number of years. And we share a lot of thoughts. I mean the technology space and a lot of disputes in terms of the work that we have for 방법, and in a multip makan programs, with Ph Clan-��� and power platforms form. And so that, audience speaker is fine. But we're thinking data – there's something really interesting. And we share a lot of thoughts in the technology space and a lot of disputes in terms of where the space should move. I'm typically a technology biased person. So, but I have a question. I think I'd like to borrow from what Debbie said about small farms and small farms is the big agenda, especially in a lot of African countries and Asian countries that see the proliferation of small farming. And the times that population where certain economies of scale and certain technologies and abilities are not available to those small farmers. So I'd like to coin this as smallholder farms to virtually big farms, because I believe that even though the prevalent landscape is actually smallholder farms, there is a potential to consolidate as said, and create probably virtually big farms. So from a, from a government perspective, I think it will be important that the government starts to rethink the fact of production that such as land in a new, new ways. So thinking about new models of how to kind of democratize this land to create new avenues for asset development for the smaller, the farmers that, that are in those, in those locations. And of course, as Debbie mentioned. I mean, the increase in pressures of migration needs that means that this is an even more important need for governments to focus. However, the governments really need to look at the cost involves involved in actually this reimagination of how lunch should be handled in rural populations. So issues that are actually subsidized, and this new potential and this new asset base that can probably uplift smallholder farmers from the challenge to face and actually contribute positively to food production. And I think as we start, as Christopher mentioned, as we start to democratize land, we can start to see gig economies taking shape and maturing, you know, providing new avenues for small the farmers to actually not just engage in farming, but allow professional bodies to actually then support the farm in various ways, whether it's through asset provision or whether it's actually supporting the entire production process, allowing the small the farmers to get better returns or better returns from the investments or their land asset that they have and ensuring that productivity is reached at significant levels. However, once, once the government looks at this as an opportunity, they definitely have to look at the possibility of the potential of cannibalistic attitudes or intentions from private sector playing in this field of new land and potentially coming up with policies to see that in such a scenario. And we have begun to see such models emerge where we've actually seen significant increases in incomes for small the farmers and some productivity gains as well. But to move back down into a micro level again, the government needs to really start thinking about the role of new public goods that have been enabled by digital technology. And so I think it's long overdue that that extension services need to move to e extension. You know, the whole, the, the, the, the, the, the in that one of the biggest government interventions and has an extensive extension worker workforce, but we know that right now that's not sustainable ratio of extension workers to farmers is greatly under underserved. And so the government should now start thinking about how do we support the extension services and provide this as a public good. I think maybe thinking too forward thinking and using my technology bias, we're not overdue for an E-Series, an E-Extension C or an E-Extension Alexa that will provide farmers with knowledge on good agricultural practices, and that's what they're doing. ...makes to be a current situation. This is probably too far-fetched in terms of maybe digital deployment and penetration has not reached the levels where they can consider providing such kind of services, then potentially as a basic need they would look at probably providing specific situations and maybe sprinkle it with a little bit of agronomic advice just to give that added value to smaller farmers. So some of the things need to be public goods that allow smaller farmers, if they're going to continue to perform in the same context, to enable them to actually then increase their productivity and incomes and actually be a positive good. ...what the current challenges that we face in terms of food production. As we got the civil society and private sector, I think now more than ever, there's importance for, or there's a big need for collaboration, real serious collaboration. And that's one of the fields that really address and plays deeply in. As a civil sector player, it's really looking at how we can collaborate and work much closer with private sector players to come up with the right products for smaller farmers. ...approach towards, looking at how the problems are affecting different communities and coming up with solutions from those problems. Whereas the private sector would typically take a deductive approach, looking at solutions and then finding a problem to solve. Yeah, so having that close collaboration where civil society then works closely with the private sector to identify how those problems and the solutions they've come up with can meet at an intersection point where they provide the valuable services to rural populations to ensure that they can actually improve. ...the incomes and actually provide ... ...but I'll stop there and talk back to you, Matt, and the audience for questions. Thanks, Sieka. I'll pick it up, actually. Thanks a lot for the fascinating discussion so far and also picking up this point that you're making, Sieka, about the tensions that we see in this complex system and the role of technology. I hear a lot of echoes between what all of you are saying, and we have a number of questions we'd like to ask you as well. This is the point where we're going to shift into Q&A. We're going to start bringing questions from our attendees and our participants to the panelists. We're getting questions from all sides. It's great. We've got the chat box going. We're getting questions to us individually, so we're sort of, we're trying to juggle all of these. Let me first drop into the chat. Here's a link to a very short Google form for you to share your reactions to this webinar, areas where you and your organization see concern, opportunity in food and financial systems, and rural livelihoods, just to give us some feedback to the discussion and where we go from here. So I'm going to ask our panelists the first question, and if the three of you could each give a response, that would be great. And we'll just go in the order in which you were just speaking, Debbie, Christabel, and then Sieka. So here's the question. As you all mentioned, there are tradeoffs between cost, availability, and quality in food systems. So the question to you is, where do you see the biggest challenges and the leverage points for positive change, looking out into food systems and that 15 to 20 year time horizon? So, Debbie, let's go first to you with a question, these tradeoffs between cost, availability, and quality, where you see a challenge and a leverage point for positive change. And Debbie, I think you're still on mute. There you go. Okay. Yeah, I think for farmers we're working with, we see such low yields, such a low starting base that we feel like there's low hanging fruit to deal with closing the yield gap and dealing with increasing their productivity for very low cost. And so that's why we have focused a lot on just giving access to basic, basic, you know, agronomy services that can improve yields for very low cost. And then that's part of the design challenge also is to how do you make these things affordable and rapid payback for the farmer on how you design them and these products and services. And so I feel like that's where that's where the challenges are, but also where there's low hanging fruit. Great. Thanks, Debbie. Christopher. Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jamie. I think we have safe cost is a huge driver, especially when you're operating at a small scale with low volume. As I was saying, I think it becomes difficult to leverage economies of scale and actually reach a break even point. But I think at the same time, the quality of food systems is also a difficult issue to deal with. So we're still using traditional agronomy practices and could potentially adopt newer or good agricultural farming practices as well as leverage check to farm smarter and more precisely. I think one of the ways where this shows up, for example, in Kenya, where we end up importing rice from Pakistan, whereas a few years back when we were sort of growing up, rice could be grown in what are there? But you're competing on quality and price with rice that's coming from other import markets. So, I'd say cost is a huge driver quality of food systems and how we actually farming is also a major driver, but all 3 of them compounds to make it really and competitive for small scale agriculture to drive on the continent. So, I think that your reaction. Yeah, so I mean, I would agree with what Christopher said, and I think covered in what we both discussed around the consolidation of land, the reimagination of the way we use land and the way we land ownership in rural areas. Think about factors such as how we can address. Think about factors such as how we can address the issues around . Produce opportunities where one professional can support the investment in the land. So, we're trying to ensure that all the farmers can then get gainful returns from their investments or their tenure of the land. So, totally in agreement with what you said, and I think that's passionate. How can we look at the market? How can that also be rolled out in a similar model using gig economic type of concepts and what you can improve their effectiveness and efficiency towards delivering valuable products to the communities? How can we look at all things up for things like that? So, thanks, Sierra. I mean, nice way to round out that question. I think that word that you keep using in terms of reimagining is a really interesting one, because often we just think about sort of finding a systemic lever to pull, and then making this adjustment to the way a system works. but there is this opportunity to also just completely reconceptualize, like Debbie was saying, the role and positioning and agency of a smallholder, or like you were saying, just the way in which farming as a system works in some of these countries. But I am maybe, in terms of asking a follow-up question around some of your underlying beliefs around change. So question for all panelists again, and maybe to tease out this question, government policy, consumer preferences, and the private sector, in terms of global food companies, can all be actors in a change process. Which one do you believe is most effective? And which one do you think can be leveraged in the most powerful way to effect change going forward? Maybe let's start with you, Siaka, because I know this picks up on a thread that you were just pulling on. I'm sure thanks Matt, and the line was breaking up. So I got bits and pieces of that question. I had government produce organizations, et cetera. And we want to be more effective. And it's always hard to choose between the two, because I think it's a concerted effort. There definitely is room for government level interventions. What we're seeing from the program is that information that can be costly to actually disseminate to an individual farmer level. If it's left to the private sector who has responsibility to their shareholders, we have a price point for provision of such services. Hence, there is a rule that government has to take and take advantage of and the government has to take advantage of the government. And that's also notwithstanding the private sector then has to then look at this would be a price point for provision of such services. And that's the rule that government has to take in terms of ensuring the minimum services are available for smallholder farmers to actually then prevail in the activities that they're doing to ensure that there's food, there's good productivity. But that also notwithstanding, the private sector then has to then look at this rural economies as a potential marketplace to deploy products. In Nigeria, what we've seen a lot is that the usual default is the opportunity cost of investing in either an area where you have higher literacy rates, less issues around literacy and other issues pertaining to adoption of a service. And rather than invest a lot of resources in those locations, then look at rural locations that need a little bit of work, a little bit of cultivation. And also the importance of the civil society in terms of the support in areas where the people are most of these advantages or in places where the market is not yet just the advantages come to bear for those participants. So it's a tough question. I don't know if it's a chicken and egg thing. Like who is most important? Who should jump in first? So I'll refrain from actually choosing one of my colleagues like this. I think that's a good question. Christabel, are you willing to make a choice or are you going to hedge as well? Let's see. I might go a little bit with CSS cop-out, but I think philosophically or a matter of personal belief, I think taking a private sector approach is a bit too neoliberal and you end up perhaps ignoring the social needs of a community in lieu of profits. So I don't think going one route completely is the right approach. I think the framework that I would propose is a mix of both where it is primarily a market-led approach, but with government interventions at the right moment to ensure that we're also paying attention to the social needs of constituents. I have to borrow your words that you used earlier. And I think this sort of lends itself to how PPPs are supposed to be structured and supposed to work. I think that's what I would push for. I think in terms of customer preferences, for me, I might deprioritize that a little bit just because I think customer preference is largely driven by what the market signals are. So I remember sort of when I was in Zambia and the one year, soya beans were actually seen as an important commodity and there were offtakers who are buying soya, but there were very few farmers who are growing soya. I think this was in 2016. And so the price of soya beans per kg was at about 547. I can't remember the actual amount, but then the next year, because consumers asked customers or farmers, so that the price of soya was actually quite high. There was an offtaker. Everyone grew soya. And as a result of that, the market prices dropped the next year again, the opposite happened. Soya didn't pay well. Very few people grew soya. Market prices went up. So I would say that first year for me would be a market led approach, but with the right government policies to support social needs of a farming community. And then the second tier would be customer preference because that is largely driven by market signals and market demand. Debbie. Yeah, I would say that. Well, I, you know, I, I see both government and market failure, which is why we have this problem. And, you know, ideally, I think governments can be super impactful in terms of scaling and scaling impact and impacting millions at the same time. Policy reform is high risk, high, high risk and high reward. But, you know, as we all know, it's super challenging and there aren't many openings where you can, where you can, you know, with one policy reform impact millions overnight and, and that is possible, but it's also quite difficult to do. So I would say that in terms of the private sector again, there's been, you know, failure to deal with the, and the market failures. And so I do think that it is a combination of both if, if, if there's a opportunity to play and do government reform and policy reform, then by all means, we should go for it. But at the same time, I think the market failures will require, you know, some hybrid, you know, hybrid activity, like the social enterprise who can, who can spur innovation and, and show that, that markets at the bottom of the pyramid are profitable and viable. I feel like that, that was teeing up a debate that probably take a full hour and more such an interesting way of linking, I guess, actors that are all involved in this process of change. But obviously very different ways of, of, of, of, of creating leverage and, and seeing that actuate. Maybe to keep the conversation going. And I, this is a bit more of a technical question from one of our participants who mentioned that they're aware that there's a strong reluctance among the rural poor to engage in digital financial services. And that this reluctance has even increased with COVID. Not calling out any of our panelists, but any reactions from what you guys are seeing on the ground through your programs, if anyone wants to jump in. Hi, Matt. Maybe I'll take this to some degree. We're not seeing that reluctance to any significant degree. In fact, we're seeing actually a larger acceptance of digital as the way a norm to actually prevent some of the issues that are brought about, especially by exchange of cash, et cetera. So the use in, um, to accept digital channels, um, as, as the preferred way to, um, transact in terms of, um, just, um, the situation. And that, um, the, um, calls for, um, society, such as the elderly, um, will definitely still have a challenge interacting with some of these channels. Um, they're a lot harder for them to grasp and, and, and come to terms with. And I think a lot of the mobile money deployments have still a way to go in terms of making the usability and the user experience easy for multiple segments of society. Then you have, of course, some of the challenges that are pertaining in gender issues where probably the male-dominated households that actually controls and holds the access to money and hence limiting the woman in the household using mobile financial services as a way of actually then reducing the spread of the COVID virus. So some of these issues that are faced as regards digital transactions are probably not because COVID is there. I think maybe they're really being brought to the forefront largely because that is now the preferred way of transacting. When someone comes to your door and says, you can only pay by digital means and you have been excluded for a lot of time, people are quite innovative, able to actually then take the next step in terms of now I need to learn, now I need access. So if anything, this current situation that we find ourselves in lends itself to an opportunity to actually get a lot more adoption of this digital tools. Thanks. Debbie, did you want to add something? Debbie Ruffin, Yeah, I think in our experience, you know, we're still early days for mobile money. But in our experience, I think it's a matter of trust that farmers have and rural communities have. And so, you know, after if the trust has been built up over time through, you know, in-person services, then I think it can translate easily with that brand to online services. And we found that to be true with our digital agronomy services that the adoption rates are just as high as in-person services. And we have like 700,000 subscribers now. So I think, and so we would like to transfer that same trust to, you know, digital financial services when, when a few years when it's possible. And that's what we're working on right now. But I think it is an issue of is that underlying trust built and there. Excellent point. Christabel, do you want to add something as well? We have another question. Okay. You can go first on this one, then Christabel. We'd like to hear a last word from all three of you as we're coming to the end of our conversation. We'd really like to hear from each of you, if you could change one thing, we'd like to think about how we could do something differently in the development sector and how we engage with these big issues that we've been talking about and this challenge of reimagining, reorganizing food systems. What would you do? What would you change? Christabel, let's start with you. Thanks, Jamie. That's a hard question. I feel like I need to tell the right answer because this is my moment of, you know. But it would probably be tied to, um, we're in the, imagining the role of smallholder farmers in ag value chains. So moving from smallholder farmers being just the producers to actually adding value to what they produce as a way to truly capture value. So, if you look at, I don't know, uh, one food item that's, uh, grown by a smallholder farmer, by the time it gets to my table in Nairobi, the smallholder farmers probably only getting about 5 to 10% is that of the value. So, I think reimagining what role smallholder farmers play and particularly moving from them just being producers to actually value addition, I think, would be an important one. Um, and then probably the second one I would want to think about is how do we think about different business models that can actually work in order to continue driving value further down that value chain to smallholder farmers? So, the example I like to think about is how Patagonia essentially just reimagined their business model in order to one, reduce waste, be more sustainable, but also ensure that the farmers who are growing cotton for the company actually do capture more value across the value chain. So, in summary, I think one, we had a lot more holder farmers play and moving from production to value addition. And then secondly, thinking innovatively about business models that can allow that shift of power to happen. So, the smallholder farmer is not the least, the most disadvantaged person in an agricultural value chain. Excellent points. Thanks, Christabel. Debbie? Yeah, I have a very simple request. I think, I think, and we say this to all of our staff as well. It's very, very important, I think, to get out of our offices and, and this is hard to do with COVID, but to engage directly with farmers, immerse ourselves in their world and in their shoes and, you know, out of that, that knowledge and grows, you know, a lot of innovation. And so, again, seeing them as value conscious entrepreneurs and, and that we, that we should not treat them as beneficiaries or charity recipients. Excellent point. Excellent point. Sierka, your last word? Thanks, Jamie. I think everyone has said everything I'd like to say and probably just to accentuate. One of the things that said is that I think the development sector is probably the last opportunity to really see that whether small farmers actually actively participate in the future of food systems. We are, we are at a very challenging point and a pivotal point in mankind where the food that is required to sustain the population growth is greatly inadequate. And hence the easy way out is going to be to fall to large scale farming, et cetera. And sometimes some of these activities might lead to greater disadvantages for smallholder farmers. So if there is going to be someone who speaks out on the needs and the opportunity that exists with smallholder farming and in rural economies, then the development sector has to be the person, the people who speak to this call. And then the opportunity to identify how to be done towards ensuring that this is achieved. Thank you. Thanks so much, Sierka. And thanks to Christabel and Debbie for all your comments over the last 50 minutes or so. This is absolutely something that we at ISF advisors and C-GAP are thinking a lot about and writing a lot about and, and working with our partners on. But I guess in our thought process, we became really conscious that if you look at the arc of history in the development field in the 1950s, all the way through the 1990s, agricultural development was largely, largely a host country government development planning challenge. And it's only in the last 20 years that it transitioned in the early 2000s to more of an inclusive value chain development challenge. And then in the 2010s, there was this new language around agricultural transformation as the visionary context. I guess we're thinking, is this a moment where the aperture, where the lens even spreads a little wider and we have to start thinking about an even broader vision of an inclusive and resilient food system. And COVID is creating this catalyst moment. And I guess our final thought is to leave you with the challenge to think about from your own organization's perspective, how you can start thinking a bit more longer term and systemically about how we all shape small aspects of this, this very important global food system. So with that, over to Jamie to close and thank you everyone for your participation. Just a very quick word from me. Thanks to everybody who took the time to join us. Special thanks to our three panelists, to the CGAP and ISF advisors team that organized everything. If you have our contact information, reach out and get in touch with us. Again, we'll share an email with the links to the recording and the deck that we used today. Thanks again, everybody. Have a great day. Thanks Jamie. Thank you. Thank you. Love you. Bye. Bye.
