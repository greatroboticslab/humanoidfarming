 Maybe y'all saw the news out of Nebraska today. Apparently our entire state is going to go bankrupt in two quarters. Me and my husband owned a cattle ranch here and I can confirm that all of the cattle ranchers here overwhelmingly voted for Trump. We support him. We voted for him. Something like 70% of our entire workforce is undocumented immigrants and they straight up are not showing up for work anymore. They have all either fled the country, fled the state. They don't want to get raided while at work. So they have just moved on, moved on to work somewhere else and straight up. We are, we are going to go bankrupt now. We are going to go bankrupt.
