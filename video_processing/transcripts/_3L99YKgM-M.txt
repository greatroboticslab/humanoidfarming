 Music My name is Chris Wharton and I'm an associate professor in the nutrition program at Arizona State University And I'm extremely excited to have Jean-Martin Fortier here to offer this incredible workshop on profitable small-scale farming This is a collaboration that's been months in the making With a lot of organizations and I want to just call some of them out now so Kelly Young for example at U of A Cooperative Extension Helped put this on along with steadfast farms and Eric Schultz And a number of other folks are contributing to this event So I just want to make mention of one of the other organizations involved in this workshop It's called the food systems transformation initiative, and so this is a new organization at ASU It's one that I direct and it's really focused on Broadly equitable participation in the food system, and that means we really care about food security and people's ability to have access to healthy Oftentimes locally produced culturally appropriate affordable food, but it's also about ensuring that people can have livelihoods in the food system And so this event is really an important piece of that we really care about having an integrated and diverse food system And allowing people to have the opportunity to be producers and participate in the food system from that perspective as well The first thing that we did when we bought the land was to plow it, disk it, try to transform it as fast as possible We removed the rocks on the farm, the small ones, the big ones We had a backhoe come in to install drainage tiles Fill in the gaps Big a pond We did a lot of the heavy earth moving things first with the backhoe And invested quite a lot of money because what we wanted to do was this Work in a permanent raised bed system Which is really the backbone of our cropping system at the farm And there is different reasons why we wanted to take this route One of them was the land constraint And we often forget this, but the tractor Just the space that it needs to turn at the end of a row Just takes up a lot of space We're talking about 15 feet, 20 feet, 25 feet So that was space that we couldn't afford to leave out to grass The other reason was Tractors are really made for plowing That's why they were invented They're made for that They're good at that Plowing, disking, shaping soil They're good at that But if you work in a permanent bed system You'll do this once And then you don't need to be doing that again So we thought That's a great way to do it And we've been cultivating only the surface of the soil ever since The first few inches Permanent raised beds Laid them all out 180 of them on the farm Everybody cool with that? Yep I'll tell you Okay So since the beds are permanent Then you need to standardize things So you need to be thinking a lot about Okay, is it going to be 30 inch? Is it going to be 40 inch? Is it going to be whatever? So we've settled that The beds would be 30 inch And the pathways would be 18 And you'll see different cropping systems With different standardized bed width But really Why 18? If you look at this closely This is pretty tight This is the broccoli That's not even grown yet And so we knew that we wanted to have a farm That wasn't discriminating against people with big butts No Really? We wanted to have enough room To be able to operate freely Because harvesting on the farm Is half of the work That we do Okay So if you're thinking about starting an organic farm Make sure that you're happy harvesting Because that's half of the time You'll be spending on the farm Is harvesting And the beds are 30 inch Why 30 inch? Well because all of the tools That we used Are standardized to that width So bed preparation rake Seed bed rollers Flame weeders Harrows Rotor tillers If we'd use them All of them are standardized To 30 inch Why are all the beds standardized to 30 inch? All the tools Because of this guy Elliot Coleman So Elliot Coleman Wrote a book called The New Organic Grower In 89 That was the first Farming book I read And the most influential By far Up until recently It was one of the better books Out there Okay But Elliot was talking about 30 inch bed systems Using hand tools Using a walk behind tractor And he had been developing tools With the Johnny's company I've been told that Their catalog is here Developing tools with them That were appropriately scaled For small scale farming Or market gardening So he had been pushing This 30 inch bed system For quite a while And we picked up on that And now As more and more people Adopt these 30 inch It's really becoming a standard Throughout the US And even in Europe There's also A lot of good reasons Why you want to have Smaller beds More compact One of them And it seems not a lot So you can jump Easily over them Okay So in a permanent bed setup You want to avoid Compaction at all costs That's the reason For doing this So you don't want to be Stepping in your beds And so the fact That you can hop over them Makes it easy You're not losing time Going all the way To the end And coming back If you need to go And you know Pick up sandbags Per se Okay That's one example Also When you're harvesting In a crouching position You're not hyper extending To reach the middle Of the bed Okay That might not seem Like something That is big But if you're spending You know 40 years harvesting greens It's going to make a difference Even you know Five or six years This is human scale This is made For ergonomic postures To be able to work out And it makes A big big difference Okay I've been harvesting greens For a long time And you know I know that some people Start their day with yoga And they ended up with yoga I drink beer at night So I want to have Good posture While I work Makes a big difference Okay Is everybody cool with that? Yeah Again I don't want to be convincing I'm just I just want to convey That these are the things That we've done And try and explain Why they're important And why they work The other thing That we rapidly Evolved with Was the walk behind tractor Or two wheel tractor From the BCS company And before owning one I had never seen one before I had You know YouTube wasn't around Back then And that was the best move We ever made Because these machines Are tailor made To work on 30 inch bed systems I'll talk more about them Later on But really This is a machine That is versatile Rugged And it's going to last A lifetime For heavy duty service We knew we wanted To work with a harrow I'll talk about The harrow later on A flail mower These are two Two of the most important Tools in our toolbox And when we were Looking for these On a small compact tractor It was about Five or six times The price Than to buy them New For a small walk behind tractor So these are priced I should change this Because that was in 2004 Prices have gone up A little bit But not that much So there you go You have a tractor To do the soil work For a fraction of the cost Important stuff We also built The nursery Really rapidly The first spring Set up the hoop house Because we wanted To extend the season With salad mix And we wanted To grow tomatoes Inside In the summer Because you know Moisture rain Is where Is where the dew forms In the green outside And that all All of the fungi problem Come out of that So we wanted to have Shelter For the nightshades So that was all done In the first spring Really We just bought the land In the fall We spent the winter Planning For the design Of the farm And then the next spring Boom We were setting that up And going We standardized The width of the bed But also the length Of the bed Okay And this is a pretty Practical trick here Because what it does Is that all the row covers The drip irritation All of the sprinkler lines They're all standardized To 100 foot So you need less of them And you're not fooling around Looking for the row cover Of the right size That's a lot of time wasted there So you standardized And there you go All of your equipment Is more versatile You need less of them And by doing so What happened Is that the bed Became a unit of measure On the farm So instead of calculating Yields per acres Which Yields per acre On the fact that you're growing One acre And you're growing 40 different vegetables Doesn't compute at all But now we've known From now there's like 200 lettuce heads In one bed You need to have Four or five wheel barrels Of compost If you're going to have An equivalent Of 40 tons per acre So we've brought All of the Number crunching down To one bed And it really simplified A lot of the production Aspects of the farm Which I'll talk later on Okay So the question was asked Did you make the beds How did that go So the first thing that we did Was make a map Of the farm And I'm so lucky That we did this Beforehand Because a lot of good Came out of that I was reading Some permaculture books Back then You know Bill Mollison has Fat Bible number one Fat Bible number two These big book And you would open These books And you would always see The farms Laid out In a map like fashion That way And they would talk About zones So the zones That you visit More frequently Need to be closer To your house And the zone That needs to be visited Less often You know For animals The wood lot Whatever Should be further out Because the whole Design Is to limit Your foot Dispersion On the farm Your traffic patterns Need to be In the shortest Cycle possible Because that's where We lose a lot Of time On the farm Just moving around Moving around So you want to have You know The shortest Patterns possible So by doing it That way We saw what we had And we designed The farm So that All of our beds Would be grouped Together In ten field blocks Managing ten field blocks Is a lot easier Than managing 180 beds And all the field blocks Have sixteen beds All a hundred feet long And they're all Surrounding The warehouse Where the vegetables Are brought back To the farm So wherever we are In the gardens We're never far away Which has been saving us Hundreds Hundreds Of hours Every year Ever since we've had That farm design We also had A map For two compost piles Because we wanted To be close We wanted to be close We had a water line That was planned To go all around Each field blocks So everywhere It could be Watered So all of this Was laid out On paper And then when it Made a lot of sense Then we went And just digged The first beds Okay Why ten field blocks Okay One of the reasons Is that because We wanted to have A crop rotation On the farm And crop rotation Is a good practice That needs to be Revisited You know My neighbors They grow Corn fields And their rotation Is like Ten years corn One year soya And it's just like That's not good For the soil We need to come back To more complexity Into integrating Different botanical families Between themselves The reason why You want to do this Is to limit The insect pressures From one year To the other You want to have The roots Of certain crops Prospecting At different depth So you're not Mining the soil With its mineral Always at the same Depth There's a lot Of great reasons Why you would want To have a lot Of diversity But the question Is how do you Get to manage All of that Because you know It's not Easy So what we did Is we did All of our homework We looked at All of the botanical Families The numbers of years That we should have Between one another And then we wanted To have the root crops The short term Root crops Like radishes Turnips Carrots And beets In successions In the same beds Per year As with short Season lettuces So we built One botanical family For these guys And we knew We were going To be growing A lot of these So we had A set up Where you have One of these Family Every two block And then we went Out and said Okay The brassica seeds You need four years Between them So four years Like that Four years Like that And we made All of these things On a piece of paper Actually working With cards Okay Trying to figure The right sequence And in the end To get what we Wanted to achieve We needed to have Ten field blocks To make it work Ten field blocks So the rotation Is over ten years And that's why We have ten field blocks On the farm Because it mimics The rotation That we had Designed on paper And so This is one Botanical family Next year It's going to go there What's there It's going to go there And so on So it's counterclockwise And why this story Is important Is because we've Took on a challenge Of designing A crop rotation That is very complex And we've designed it In a way that is Very simple to follow And the farm Is laid out With that in mind Because when you're Farming on small acreage If you want to do this For a long time You need to take care Of the soil You don't have the luxury To just put it on fallow For a year or two And come back to it This is intensively managed And the crop rotation Needs to be taken into account From the start From the get go Lots of questions Okay Okay My suggestion Is this one You should standardize The width of your beds Okay You should group them together In field blocks Doesn't matter If they're 30 feet 50 feet 60 feet If they're 150 feet Mind you You need to be Three people To move the drip tapes Okay So that's something To think about So every time You need to move drip tapes If your beds Are like 200 feet You need to have A crew of at least Three people So that's something To think about Then You should be looking At field blocks As botanical families Because it's so much easier Than to manage Individual beds And then you should Look at the right Patterns And trying to figure out How that could work In your farming design So you don't need To mimic exactly this Because that was Kind of like That was also The space That we kind of had So it could be different On a different farm But that's something To think about And the other thing The advice I can give Is that when you're Starting out The first three years Forget crop For crop rotation All together Just plant anything Anywhere First three perhaps Well I would be the reason For so Is that When you're starting You don't know Where you'll be In three years You're evolving Your markets You're developing Your clientele Everything's moving You're figuring You'll be growing A lot of carrots But then you figure out That the chefs They want more Of that instead So you're figuring Things out And if you spent A month or two Making this Really slick design For a crop rotation And then in two years You don't follow it anymore What's the purpose of that? So you're better off To withhold And make sure That you kind of know Where you're going And then you can Implement a rotation Because you'll see Later on The way we've set Things up Makes it really easy For us to operate But there's a major Constraint With this way Of doing things For example If you look At our rotation We only have One field block Of nightshades So that means Sixteen beds That excludes The greenhouse But outside Crops So sixteen beds That's all we have If I want to cheat And I want to have eighteen I'll put them here Then I'm not respecting My rotation So it's a big constraint And we'll talk about That later on Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes That is one parameter That you want to have The other one would be The amount of time That the crops Are in the field Is it forty days Fifty days Sixty days Because that's going To make a difference Botanical families You know They're susceptible To the same insect pressures So you have all these parameters That you laid out And then it's up to you To figure out Okay What works So you can You can base your first experience On that Because that works Like what we've done On our farm But It's a valuable Project To look at all these elements And research some of that Yourself Yes No, no It's all thought about Yeah Well Because The reason is We came up with this After doing our research You guys are in a different climate Perhaps I think it's a valuable It's worthwhile thinking about But you can influence yourself By this I try to avoid people Just copying Because I think The thinking process Is also important To learn about crop rotation And you know This is what we came up with But another system Could also work out But this is good enough But again It has some serious constraint We'll see later on And a lot of growers Are like Oh JM The way you've done things Is Is too There's too many constraints I can't work In that kind of setup But most of these growers They don't have The land constraint That I have Trying to intensify production Over 20, 30 years Okay So that's something To keep in mind Yes We'll talk about cover crops Because yes There's cover crops In the rotation In another design They're once Every three years The field blocks Are in a cover crop For half of the year So they've been built in To the cropping system Yes Okay Okay So that was the question That I'm getting at Okay On our farm And when you're working In a permanent bed setup The layout of the beds Should be done To allow excess water Runoff To be channeled away From the growing area Eric was telling me That it's not unusual To have two inch of rain Fall in one shot Okay What happens If you have raised beds That are You know Let's say you have a slope And you put your beds Counter slope The water is going to pour And it's going to mount In the aisles And then it's going to Wash over the top of the bed Like that Cascading down Bringing all of your topsoil With it Okay In an intensive In a biologically intensive Cropping system Like the one that we have On our farm The fertility Is all about The first few inches That's what we're building So you want to make sure That you're not Creating a design pattern Where all of your investment Goes washed down the drain So your beds Our beds Are always sloped To allow runoff water To be channeled away Yeah Because Because the beds Are raised If we look If I come back here So the beds are raised And so all the water Will go here And then it's channeled away Okay Okay You're better to do this And At worst Recuperate the water And put it back On to the beds Than to have a design Where everything is flat And if there's two inch Of water You just lose everything So this being said I've never really I've grown in New Mexico So it's kind of the same And that's how we set it up also Okay So The take home message Is That before we dug Our first bed We had a design Laid out on a piece of paper And everything was figured out And then we built the farm Okay That's That's the most important thing My most important message For you guys That are starting Take time To plan it on paper first Even if you don't own the land Even if the dream Of having a farm Or a market garden Is a few years ahead Take the time to draw it Why not Think it through Where things go Okay Here you'll see That the tool shed Where all the tools are It's all in the middle You know The bathroom Is in the middle Everything is centralized And in others You know And that's That's That's pretty The best you could have But in a different setup Perhaps The building would be here And then you would need to think Okay The building is here Should I move it? Should I tear it down And build another one? Or Should I have Different stations? Built little You know Tool sheds Here and there? You need to be thinking about this Because once you're farming In the heat of the summer Or in the heat of your winter I'm confused with all of this You know You don't have time So you create a design And then you work in it But that designing stage Is so important Because it's going to make A difference between Working You know 70 hours Or 50 hours Because if you're losing time Circulating all over the farm You're wasting a lot of time Okay Good? Moving on So this is a picture Of The rabbit farm It's called La lapinière And you know Now it's a pretty nice home So just to say That these buildings They're out there And we can Take them back In her
