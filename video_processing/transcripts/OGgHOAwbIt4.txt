 Okay, welcome to the Miller's Farmstand. Got fresh eggs. Those are in the cooler. Return your empties up here. We've got our Egg Ploy of the Month is Ruby. And here is our price list. So if you want to pay with cash, you can just put cash in the pay box. Or you can pay with Zelle. Right there. You scan that with your phone and it'll take you to the link. And you just add up how many dozen you had. So if you had one dozen, it would be $6. Thank you. Have a good day.
