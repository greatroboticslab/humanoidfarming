Howto & Style
 Grow healthier, better cucumber plants with these three tips. Number one, prune your plants to a single main stem. By removing suckers, the plants will focus energy on the main stem and its fruits. The result is better quality cucumbers and improved airflow, which reduces disease. Number two, water regularly. Cucumbers are heavy feeding plants that require consistent water in the soil. Check the first few inches of soil to see if it's moist, and if not, give them a slow, deep watering. And number three, use mulch. When you water, the top layer of soil can easily dry out from wind and direct sun exposure. Cover the soil with a thick layer of natural mulch like this straw to improve water retention and add nutrients back to the soil. Before you know it, you'll have more cucumbers than you know what to do with off of just a few plants. For more cucumber and gardening tips, give us a follow.
