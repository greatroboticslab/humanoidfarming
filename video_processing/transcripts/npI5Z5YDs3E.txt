 We're back here on the Hunter Call of the Wild and today we're going to be doing a simplified herd management guide. We're going to step by step go through everything you need to know to do a herd managed grind for any species in the game. So let's start off with what is herd management? Herd management is managing the herds of a specific species on one map by shooting mid-levels and up leaving the low levels on the map. When you have the majority of the species that you're grinding as low levels, this will cause your respawns to be bigger causing you to spawn more diamonds, larger rares, and possibly even super rares. And if you're not sure what a super rare is, a super rare is a species that is a diamond and has a rare fur. We don't know if herd management actually causes you to spawn your great ones sooner or not, but it definitely will make the process more fun and more exciting and you definitely will get more and better trophies along the way. Now before we continue on, let me know in the comments which great one you would like to have in your lodge more than anything else. So the very first thing you want to do when doing a herd managed grind is to choose the species to grind and which map you would like to do it on. Now herd management can be used when grinding any species in the game. Herd animals are easier to manage and if you have never ever done a grind before, I would recommend starting off with fallow deer in Teowaroa. And the reason is because it has the fewest amount of drink zones for any great one in the game, making it the easiest to manage. Red deer is also a very easy grind, another good one to start with, also in Teowaroa. And in my opinion, the most difficult great one grinds right now are the fox grind and the tar grind. Step two is to find all of your drink zones and this is for non-predator species only. For species such as black bears, you do not have to find all of their drink zones because when you shoot at a predator, that zone is going to delete and it will come back. Now for species that do not drink, you want to find as many feed zones as you can, but you do not need to find all of their feed zones. That is not necessary. But I have found that the more zones you find, the better your respawns will be, like the more consistent they will be. Now why do you have to find all of your drink zones? Now the reason is because if you don't, what is going to happen is you are going to get inconsistent respawns. What can happen is respawns can end up in an undiscovered zone and that's really not going to help your herd managed grind. So it is very important to find all of your drink zones before you start your grind. Now while you are discovering your zones, you want to set up on the go. First of all, this is going to save you a pile of time. So you do want to carry tents and tripods if possible, if you can afford them while you are setting up. And if you do find a zone that you think would make a great main zone, definitely drop that tent. Now tents cost 16,000 in-game dollars, so they are very expensive. You are going to need 16 tents when you start your grind. You want to use all 16 of them. Now the tents come in the tent and ground blind DLC. You do get one of every variation of tent for free in that DLC. So if you are just purchasing it, then you will need to purchase another 11 tents. Now the best way to grind for cash in the game right now is to go to Emerald Coast, set the time to 1700, and run the beach, the east coast. What you're going to find is piles of crocs. They're always on the coast, just about always. And Bantang and Red Fox that drink from 17 to 20. Shoot absolutely everything. That is the absolute fastest way to grind for cash in the game right now. Now tripods come in the tripod and tree stand DLC. And again, you will get one of each variation for free with the DLC. Now tripods are something you can add as you do your grind. If you don't have enough cash when you start, add them as you go. Because when you're doing a grind, you are going to make cash. Anytime you constantly shoot and harvest animals, you are making bank. So as you make enough for a tripod, add them to your grind as you go. But if you are doing the grind without tripods, be very, very careful. Now let's talk about why you want to be using tripods or any hunting structure. It doesn't have to be tripods. You can use duck blinds. You can use tree stands, whatever hunting structure that you prefer. They all work the same in a grind. Now tripods or hunting blinds will protect your zones from getting deleted. You can kill 15 animals from any structure without deleting the zone. The 16th kill will then delete the zone and it will appear somewhere else on the map and then needs to be rediscovered, which is very time consuming and very frustrating. So without a tripod, or blind, you can only kill three animals and the fourth kill will delete the zone. So it is a lot easier to blow out your zones to delete them without using any hunting structure. So I do recommend tripods when doing a grind, add them as you go if you have to. Now let's talk about finding your drink zones. Now the best way to find your drink zones is to set the time for about halfway through the zone time for whatever species that it is that you are grinding. So for whitetail, whitetail drink from 8 to 12. So I would set the time to 10 o'clock. And the reason you want to do that is that gives you the greatest chance of animals actually being in their zones when you go out to discover them, because that is very helpful if they're there. So once you have the time set, what you want to do is check around all of the water sources where your species can be. What you want to do is look up a hotspot map for whatever species it is you are doing a grind for. I do have Great One Grind Guides for pretty much every great one in the game. And in those guides, there is a hotspot map. Now all of those maps are posted to my discord, and I will leave the link for that in the description below. So for example, here is a hotspot map for whitetail and Revontuli. Here is Moose and Medved. So I have all the hotspot maps that will definitely make your life easier. Now if these maps show my zones, you won't have exactly the same zones that I do, but they definitely will be very similar, and they should help you to find your drink zones. And I would just like to thank iBuyPremiums. This is definitely his strategy, and it is an amazing one. So thank you iBuy. And if you'd like to share the love and drop him a follow, I will leave the link to his Twitch in the description below. Okay, so this here is a need zone indicator. When you are running around lakes or water sources, you want to be picking up every need zone indicator that you see. These will stay on the map for two to three hours after whatever species they are for finishes drinking or finishes whatever zone they are in. That means you can find zones without them actually drinking or being in the zones. You want to spot around the entire circumference of every water source. You want to be listening for mating and warning calls. If you find tracks, follow them. They will more than likely lead you to a zone and pick up those need zone indicators. Now the other thing you can do is after whatever species it is that you are grinding for, when they finish their zone time, what you can do is grab a four-wheeler and drive around the edge of all the water sources where they can be getting off to pick up the need zone indicators. And that is another great way to find your zones. Now when you're doing a grind, you don't have to find the feed zones, the rest zones, and the drink zones. If they drink, you want to find their drink zones. If they don't drink, you want to find their feed zones. And if you are grinding a species that does not drink, you do not have to find all of the zones once again. Which zones should I set up on? Now you'll want to set up on herd zones only that have mid to high levels in them. You never want to set up on a solo zone. And first of all, what a solo zone is, is it is a zone with only one animal in it. Now anytime you shoot an animal that is in a solo zone, what's going to happen is as soon as you shoot that animal, that zone is going to delete. And that respawn is going to appear somewhere else on the map and you are going to have to rediscover it. So there is absolutely no point in setting up on a solo zone. What you want to do is set up on nice wide open zones. And this can definitely come down to personal preference. You want to be able to easily see the animals. So if there's all kinds of trees and places where they can hide, that is not what I would then select as a main zone. That would be an exterior zone. This zone, they're gone right now, but I have a zone right here. This is definitely one of my main zones. Zone I'm standing on. This is another one of my main zones. They're nice and wide open. They're absolutely beautiful. Now when you are shooting, we're not quite there yet, but when we get to that, you want to shoot two males from each zone. So you always want to set up on zones that have at least four animals in the zone. The reason you don't want to have three animals in the zone is when you shoot two, you're going to be left with one. And anytime you shoot a zone down to one animal, that zone will never get respawns ever again. Essentially that breaks the zone. That's just the way the game is designed. So you always want to leave at least two animals in the zone. So ideally you want to have a zone with at least two males and two females in it. And we will definitely cover solos later in the video. Now, how do I set up? What you want to do is place your tents about 230 meters from the zone. And you want to place your tripods approximately 175 to 200 meters away from the zone. So basically what I do when I am setting up is I put a waypoint right on the zone and then I run in the direction where I want to set up. Okay. So here we are. And as you can see, I am approximately 230 meters away from the zone. So that is absolutely perfect. Now I usually like to have my tripod a little closer, but because of the terrain here, I have to have it a little bit further away. Now, because this is whitetail, it's not a big deal. I can still call them in because the grunt collar actually carries further than 200 meters, but for most collars, they are only good for up to 200 meters. And that is why you want to have your tripod approximately 175 to 200 meters away. The other reason is because you want to be able to spawn into the tent, run over without having to slow down, jump right into the tripod without spooking your animals. So that works great. Now the spook distance for any tent is about 180 meters, but because animals can be within 50 meters of that need zone in any direction, that is why you want to drop your tents at 230 meters and not 180. So once you have found all of your zones, then you definitely want to set up. Now you're going to be doing some of your setup while you are discovering your zones, but you want to set up using all 16 tents. You're going to be setting up on 16 drink zones. Eight are going to be considered main shooting zones. These are the eight zones that you are going to use and grind for the entirety of your grind. And the other eight are going to be considered exterior zones. These zones are going to change throughout the grind. Now, once you are all set up, it is time to shoot. And that is the fun part. Next question is, what do I shoot? Well, I'm glad you asked. So animals go to either level three, level five, or level nine. For animals that go to level three, like whitetail, you want to be shooting the level twos and up. Now for whitetail, the tiny twos you can actually leave. And the way to know which twos to leave is just look at their antlers. If your level two looks just like a level one, you can leave it and treat it like it's a level one. If that's too confusing, don't worry about it. Just shoot the twos and up. For animals that go to level five, like moose, you want to be shooting the mid-level threes and up. And again, when you have tiny level threes that look like they're level twos, you can leave those. You know, when you look at a level three and you think, how is that a three? That you can treat like a level two. And for animals that go to nine legendary, you want to be shooting the level fives and up. Now, as you do this, when you do spawn diamonds, you don't want to shoot them when they spawn at main shooting zones. This is called stacking, and we are going to go through that very soon. Now, if you get to a main zone and all you have are small animals, the only time it's okay to shoot something small is when it is in a main zone. Because if you leave it, it's going to be there forever. So you need to get it out of there. But when you get to an exterior zone and you find that everything is small, that's exactly what you want. That is a good thing. Now, when you start your grind, you want to be rotating on all 16 zones at the same time. This is very important because I have noticed a lot of people get confused and either grind all of the main zones or all the exterior zones. But you want to be grinding all 16 of them all within one rotation, shooting the mid-levels and up. Now, if a diamond does spawn at an exterior zone, you can shoot it. You only want to stack them when they spawn at main shooting zones. Now, when you do get to an exterior zone when you are doing a rotation and there is nothing there but small animals, what you want to then do is pull your tent and your tripod and move to another exterior zone. So as you do your grind, you're going to continually be moving your setups from exterior zone to exterior zone as your respawns get smaller. And keep doing this while you stack diamonds at main zones until all exterior zones are small or shot down. Now, a zone is considered to be shot down when it contains only females and low-level males. And this is an example of a shot down zone. All we have here are level one, whitetail, or tiny level twos. And as I mentioned earlier, the twos that look like level ones, you don't need to shoot those. And that is a perfect example right here. And the rest are just females. There's another tiny two and there's another one. So there you go. There is the perfect example of a shot down zone. Now let's talk about stacking. You want to be stacking right from the start of your grind. Now when you start your grind, you want to leave any diamonds that spawn at main zones. Why? Because when you have many huge animals on the map with lots of trophy rating, the game then mainly spawns small respawns to try to even everything out. So stacking will help you to shoot down your exteriors much faster. So once you do get to the point in your grind where all of your exteriors have been shot down, you can pull those tents and tripods. And at this point, you want to use those tents and set them up as pickup tents at your main shooting zones. This is definitely going to speed your grind up. And it is at this point where you can then shoot the diamonds. A lot of people ask me, how many diamonds do I need to stack before I can shoot them? And it's not a numbers thing. The answer to that is however many diamonds spawn before you have shot down your exteriors. That's the number. It's going to be different for everyone. So once everything is shot down, shoot those diamonds, move those tents to be pickup tents. And from that point forward, you're only going to be rotating on the eight main shooting zones. That is when the magic is going to start. Once you shoot those diamonds, you're going to be grinding on the respawns. And once everything is shot down, that's when the herd management will really take effect. This is when you're going to see lots of diamonds spawn very quickly. You're going to see bigger respawns. All the herd management magic will start to happen. And for the remainder of the grind, you just keep grinding those eight zones. Now, here's a great question. Do I have to stack? And the answer to that is no, you do not. If you don't stack, the grind will take longer, but you definitely can still herd manage without stacking. Okay, let's talk about solo zones. Now, as I mentioned before, when you shoot a solo zone, it will respawn somewhere else on the map and will need to be rediscovered. So you don't really want to deal with your solo zones until you get to the point in your grind where you have several diamonds stacked. Once that has happened, it's time to start dealing with the solos. So to do this, what I would recommend doing is waiting at least 20 minutes real time before dealing with the solos. The reason for that is you want to give enough time for whatever species it is that you are doing a grind for, for that last kill to respawn. You want nothing in the respawn pool when dealing with solos. So then you want to shoot the solo male. You only want to manage larger mid-levels and up. So for fallow deer, I would only worry about dealing with solos that are large level threes or higher. For whitetail or anything that goes to level three, you want to be shooting the large level twos and higher. And for red deer or black bears or anything that goes to nine legendary, you want to be dealing with solos. For them, I would actually say sixes and up. I wouldn't even worry about the fives because solos, to be very honest, are a big pain in the butt. They can be very tedious and difficult to manage. So once you've shot the solo male, then what you want to do is go to your main shooting lakes and find the smallest male that you can find. Shoot that also, leave it on the ground. Once both of these animals are down, you want to leave the game, exit to the main menu, and go back in. Now at this point, again, you want to wait another 20 minutes real time to give these two animals time to respawn. There's a 50-50 chance that their respawns will swap zones. And if they don't, having the diamond stacked is going to give your solo respawn a better chance at being small. Because what you want to happen is for that solo to come back much smaller. So once you have done this process, then you have to go and refine the zone. But if you are dealing with multiple solos, I would deal with all of them and then go and find all your zones at the same time. That's just going to make the process much faster for you. Now when you see a zone that has no females in it at all, those are actually solo males sharing a drink zone. So in which case, when you deal with each of those solos, you may not have to refine the zone because there's a good chance that that solo will join another solo zone with other solos. So you may not always have to refine the zone. Now a good way to see if your solo is going to become small after you have done this process is to go to the main shooting zone where you shot the smallest animal you could find and check its respawn. If you have a big respawn, there's a good chance that you have a small solo out there. But if you have a small respawn, there's a good chance that the solo is still large and you are going to have to repeat this process. But you want to continue managing the solos until they're all mid-level or smaller. Now I want to mention a few things that are very important to your grind. It is absolutely imperative that when you are doing a great one grind, that you pick up your kills. I'm pretty sure that you cannot spawn a great one when you do not harvest your kills. If you can, it is definitely going to take way longer. So definitely, if you shoot it, pick it up. And why waste all that cash? Now another thing I want to mention, and this I use all the time, is the one minute trick. Okay, so when you are doing your rotations and you get to a zone and there's nothing there, what you can do, well, there are two things you can try to get those animals in their zone so that you can shoot them. The first thing is the one minute trick. Now the other thing that you can do if you don't have the cash to do the one minute trick is simply to exit to the main menu and come back. Oftentimes there'll be nothing in the zone when you leave, but when you come back, they will be there waiting for you. So try both of those. Now, once you get to the point where you are only grinding on eight lakes, you have pickup tents and all your diamonds have been shot. You're going to simply just rotate on those eight zones for the rest of your grind. Now, if you do get to the point in your grind where you're noticing a lot of small respawns, then what may have happened is you're getting jumpers. That means that your respawns are jumping out to exterior zones. So then what you'll want to do is go out and check your exteriors, see if you can find any big respawns. And if you do, you will have to re-manage that zone down once again in those big respawns back into your main zones. And there you have it. That is everything about herd management. If you do have questions, definitely leave them in the comments below. I will try to go through as many as I possibly can. I really want you guys to understand this because herd management is such an amazing way to spawn great ones. It just makes the grind way more exciting. You're going to get way better trophies. It's just such an amazing strategy. And I hope you did enjoy the video. If you did go ahead and spot that like button.
