 A woman inherited her dad's old barn while her brothers got the valuable estate, but she had no idea what was inside the barn. At first, Gemma felt disappointed because her brothers received something more valuable. Then she noticed a note on the back of an old photo. It told her to visit the barn. The barn had always been a place she wasn't allowed to go when she was a child, but now Gemma was curious. She searched the dusty barn for hours and found nothing. Just as she was about to give up, she spotted something hidden, a door behind some hay bales. After moving the hay, she found a set of doors leading underground. She gathered her courage and went down the stairs. At the bottom, she found a small vault. Using the combination written on the photo, she opened it. When Gemma looked inside, her face turned pale.
