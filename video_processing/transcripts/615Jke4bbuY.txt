 Shalom! Welcome to Torah Talk with Tamar. I'm Tamar, an independent Torah scholar, and on this channel I talk about an ancient text with modern relevance. Today I want to talk about a very popular topic of late, but specifically as it relates to the Torah. Today I want to talk about 10 basic principles of homesteading, and these could also be extended to farming, in the Torah. Throughout the Torah there are a number of instructions for how to run agricultural endeavors. The ancient Israelites were an agrarian society, and they found their sustenance and well-being in growing and having livestock. This is how they sustained themselves as a culture for a very long time. And there is a resurgence of homesteading becoming a way of life for people, from mini-homesteading to large estates and farms. And we can look back into the Torah for guidance from an ancient text in our modern lives. So the first one that comes to mind is not to sow two seeds in the same field. And I believe this can also be applied to gardening, which is usually done in a much smaller space. You know, you're not using acres and acres of land to grow potatoes or tomatoes or whatever you will. So if you partition an area in your garden for a particular produce, you can't mix two different seeds in that same area that you've partitioned. So you shouldn't grow your carrots alongside your cucumbers in the same box, for example. So that's the first one. Don't sow two seeds in the same field. The second one is to not mate two species of Bahama. And there is a controversy over how to interpret that word. Some people believe it means any of your animals, your chickens and roosters, your sheeps, your goats, whatever it is that you have, that you cannot mix two species. And other people believe that just means your large cattle. I side with the scholars who believe that Bahama is your large cattle. I believe it has more to do with having a pure sacrifice on the altar than it does with just saying, for example, making sure that every species is preserved intact. Reason with me for a minute. In Leviticus 18.5, it says that the purpose of the Torah is to give us life. So all commands should be interpreted in a way so as to keep life going and to keep human life going. So let's say, for example, somebody's livestock or their poultry birds were ransacked by predators, which is common for homesteading and farming. If you only had one rooster survive and one chicken survive, should you just terminate their life and prevent them from breeding? And I don't think so because the chicken and the rooster are given to create more chickens and roosters and to create more life and to sustain life. So number two, don't breed two species of Bahama, your large livestock. The third one, when you're growing in a large field, a particular crop, we are commanded in the Torah to leave the edges of those fields for the poor, for the widows and the widows' children to pick from that. So when you go to harvest, if you're hiring somebody or using machinery, the edges of the field should be left for the poor, for widows and for the widows' children. And a third group, actually, the ger. Those are the people coming home to Israel and they're newly establishing themselves into the community of Israel. This is a great way to give the poor healthy food. You know, I've heard from many people, when they go to food pantries, they're given stale food or food that's rotting. And that's really not a biblical standard. By giving the poor a way to have access to fresh food, it's a way for them also to sustain themselves. And along with saving the edges of the field is saving the edges of the field for animals. Letting the wildlife actually pick from your field because that's part of balanced nutrition for themselves. And it comes back to reward humans that do that on a large scale because we were given elk and deer and hoved animals that chew the cud for sustenance. So instead of them ransacking your garden, if a community as a whole allows them to pick the edges of large fields, that will actually help the common gardener preserve more of what's left for them. So number three is save the edges of your fields for the poor, widow and widow's children, and for the ger, and for the animals. And number four is about a cyclical pattern of harvesting and growing. So every seven years, the children of Israel are commanded to not grow anything from the soil, to give the land a Shabbat so that those inner workings, those organic compounds can renew themselves, and the bugs can do their things, and the soil can have its rest. So number four, don't work the land every seven years. Number five is return the land to the tribe and the individuals to whom it belongs every 50 years. So if there was an individual who was becoming poor and they sold their land to loan to somebody or to buy, they were given the right to redeem that land every 50 years. It had to be returned. So number five, every 50 years, the land had to be returned to the person who sold it to raise themselves out of poverty. Number six, the firstborn of the womb of all animals and livestock was given to the Almighty, to the Most High. So number six, the firstborn of the livestock and animals belonged to the Most High. Number seven was a tithe, a 10% tithe. So 10% of all the animals and the land was given to the Most High. And from that, in Deuteronomy 26, 13, it says that it is to be given to the Levites, to the Ger, who is coming home to Israel, and to the widow and the widow's children, Yathum. So those four protected populations would receive that tithe of 10%. So number seven, the 10% tithe of the land and the animals. Reserve that for the Most High and then give that to the Levites, the Ger, the widow and the widow's children, Yathum. Number eight, we find in Leviticus 27, there are instructions about consecrating a field, dedicating it to the Most High. And it doesn't expand what specifically to do with that field. But generally, the thinking is that whatever was grown in that field was given as an additional offering and sacrifice to the tabernacle to sustain the priesthood. So number eight, instructions for consecrating your field are found in Leviticus 27. Number nine, when you plant a tree, you are not allowed to eat the fruit of it until the third year. So from the time that you go and put it in the ground, you have to count three years. And then you're only allowed to eat that protus once it spawns in that after year three. And of course, that verse is also a polysemmy, has two meanings. But for the purposes of this video, since we're talking about homesteading and farming, I'm going with the literal meaning of not eating the produce of the tree until the third year. And lastly, number 10, what you can and can't eat on your homestead or farm. So in Leviticus 11, we get an outline of the animals that we're allowed to eat. So for example, it has to be split hoof and it has to chew the cud. So that means chicken and cow. Quail is another one. And turkey is another one we can eat. We can eat fish that has scales and fins. And I mentioned that because some people's farms do harvest fish. And the animals we're not supposed to be having on our farm to eat are things like pork. In addition, we're not supposed to eat any livestock that has been mauled by a predator on our homestead or farm or even if you find it anywhere. But that I think really applies to homesteading and farming because a lot of times predator attacks are an issue. So number 10, don't eat unclean animals and don't eat things that are marred by predators. Thank you for joining me today on this Torah Talk with Tamar.
