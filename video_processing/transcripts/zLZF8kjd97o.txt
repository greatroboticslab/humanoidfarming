 Agriculture has been the backbone of human civilization since the beginning of time. It has allowed us to feed ourselves and grow and sustain our communities. Today, with the help of technology, agriculture has become more efficient and productive than ever before. In this video, we'll take a look at some of the emerging technology trends in agriculture and how they are changing the way we grow and produce our food. Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture is the use of technology to optimize the management of crops and livestock. This includes the use of sensors, GPS mapping, and drones to collect data on soil conditions, weather patterns, and plant growth. By analyzing this data, farmers can make informed decisions about when to plant, fertilize, and harvest their crops. This not only increases yields but also reduces waste and minimizes the use of resources such as water and fertilizer. Vertical Farming Vertical farming is a method of growing crops in vertically stacked layers using artificial lighting and climate control. This allows for year-round production of crops without the need for traditional soil or sunlight. Vertical farms can be located in urban areas, reducing the distance between the farm and the consumer. This can lead to fresher produce and reduced transportation costs. Robotics Robotics is another emerging trend in agriculture. Robots can be used for a variety of tasks such as planting and harvesting crops, monitoring plant health, and even herding livestock. By using robots, farmers can reduce their reliance on manual labor, which can be costly and time consuming. Robots can also operate 24-7, allowing for faster and more efficient production. Blockchain Blockchain technology is being increasingly used in agriculture to track the origin and journey of food from farm to table. By using blockchain, farmers can ensure the quality and safety of their products, and consumers can have greater confidence in the food they are purchasing. Blockchain can also help to reduce fraud and ensure that farmers receive fair prices for their products. Artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence, AI, is another technology that is being used to improve agriculture. AI can be used to analyze large amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions about crop yields, weather patterns, and soil health. By using AI, farmers can make more informed decisions about when to plant, fertilize, and harvest their crops, leading to higher yields and reduced waste. Soil and water sensors. Perhaps the equipment having the most immediate effect are soil and water sensors. These sensors are durable, unobtrusive, and relatively inexpensive. Even family farms are finding it affordable to distribute them throughout their land, and they provide numerous benefits. For instance, these sensors can detect moisture and nitrogen levels, and the farm can use this information to determine when to water and fertilize rather than rely on a predetermined schedule. That results in more efficient use of resources and therefore lowered costs. But it also helps the farm be more environmentally friendly by conserving water, limiting erosion and reducing fertilizer levels in local rivers and lakes, weather tracking. Although we still make jokes about our local meteorologists, the truth is that computerized weather modeling is becoming increasingly sophisticated. There are online weather services that focus exclusively on agriculture, and farmers can access these services on dedicated onboard and handheld farm technology, but also via mobile apps that run on just about any consumer smartphone. This technology can give farmers enough advanced notice of frost, hail, and other weather that they can take precautions to protect the crops, or at least mitigate losses to a significant degree. Satellite imaging. As remote satellite imaging has become more sophisticated, it's allowed for real-time crop imagery. This isn't just bird's eye view snapshots, but images in resolutions of 5 meter pixels, and even greater. Crop imagery lets a farmer examine crops as if he or she were standing there without actually standing there. Even reviewing images on a weekly basis can save a farm a considerable amount of time and money. Additionally, this technology can be integrated with crop, soil, and water sensors, so that the farmers can receive notifications along with appropriate satellite images when danger thresholds are met. Pervasive automation. Pervasive automation is a buzz term in the agriculture technology industry, and it can refer to any technology that reduces operator workload. Examples include autonomous vehicles controlled by robotics or remotely through terminals and hyper-precision, such as RTK navigation systems that make seeding and fertilization routes as optimal as possible. Most farming equipment already adopts the ISOBUS standard, and that puts on the precipice of a farming reality where balers, combines, tractors, and other farming equipment communicate and even operate in a plug-and-play manner. Mini-chromosomal technology, perhaps one of the most exciting advents in agriculture technology, is coming in a very tiny package. A mini-chromosome is a small structure within a cell that includes very little genetic material but can, in layman's terms, hold a lot of information. Using mini-chromosomes, agricultural geneticists can add dozens and perhaps even hundreds of traits to a plant. These traits can be quite complex, such as drought tolerance and nitrogen use. However, what is most intriguing about mini-chromosomal technology is that a plant's original chromosomes are not altered in any way. That results in faster regulatory approval and wider, faster acceptance from consumers. RFID technology. The soil and water sensors mentioned earlier have set a foundation for traceability. The industry has only begun to realize this infrastructure, but it's taking shape quickly. These sensors provide information that can be associated with farming yields. It may seem like science fiction, but we're living in a world where a bag of potatoes can have a barcode that you can scan with your smartphone in order to access information about the soil that yielded them. A future where farms can market themselves and have loyal consumers track their yields for purchase is not far-fetched. Vertical farming. Vertical farming has been a science fiction topic as far back as the 1950s and perhaps further, and now it's not only scientifically viable, but will be financially viable within the decade. Vertical farm technology. Vertical farming, a component of urban agriculture, is the practice of producing food in vertically stacked layers. This offers many advantages. Perhaps the most obvious is the ability to grow within urban environments and thus have fresher foods available faster and at lower costs. However, vertical farming won't be limited to just urban environments like initially expected. Farmers in all areas can use it to make better use of available land, and to grow crops that wouldn't normally be viable in those locations. Emerging technology trends in agriculture are changing the way we grow and produce our food. Precision agriculture, vertical farming, robotics, blockchain, and artificial intelligence are just a few of the many technologies that are being used to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and ensure the safety and quality of our food. As these technologies continue to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative solutions to the challenges facing agriculture today. Thank you so much for watching.
