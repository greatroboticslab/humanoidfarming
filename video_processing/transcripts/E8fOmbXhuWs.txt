 Attention all food service pros, freshness is key. Let's keep it that way. First, always store fruits and veggies separately. They emit gases that can spoil each other. Use airtight containers for meats and dairy. It locks in freshness and prevents cross-contamination. Label everything with dates. FIFO, first in, first out, ensures nothing goes bad at the back of the fridge. Keep your fridge at the right temperature. 35 to 38 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal. For herbs, treat them like flowers. Trim the stems and store them in a glass of water. Finally, clean your storage areas regularly. A clean space means fewer germs and fresher products. Follow these tips from Food Service Equipment Depot and keep your perishables fresh. Stay tuned for more pro tips.
