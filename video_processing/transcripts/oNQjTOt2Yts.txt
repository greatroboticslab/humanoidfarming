 Did you know that farmers in rural areas of Africa do not use modern farming equipment? They plow the fields with the help of big spades, which takes a lot of hard work. When the field is ready, they plant patty plants in water, and when the patty is fully ripe, you will be surprised to know that they harvest it with their hands. After this, rice is extracted from the patty by pounding it in stone mills.
