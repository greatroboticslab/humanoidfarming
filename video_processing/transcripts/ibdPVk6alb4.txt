 Cookout season came faster than a ver- Wait, this is supposed to be family-friendly content. Uh, yeah, make this potato salad next time you have a cookout. Meet me in the kitchen, let's make it happen. Alright, first things first, we're gonna dice up our celery and shallots. If you don't have shallots, you can use onion. Next, we're gonna peel our Yukon gold potatoes. Chop those potatoes into bite-sized pieces. Add them to a pot and make sure they're nice and clean. We're gonna cook them with some chicken bouillon for added flavor. You could also just cook them in chicken broth or some salted water. Next, in the mixing bowl, we're gonna add our mayo, sweet relish, Dijon, and yellow mustard. The seasonings of your choice, followed by a pinch of sugar. And last but not least, I like to add a little Old Bay to mine. Tastes a hell of a lot better than that plain old paprika, but hey, do what you want. Next, add your celery and shallots. Give it a mix, and then we're gonna add some boiled eggs, because why the hell not? We're here for a good time, not a long time. Once the potatoes have chilled, we're gonna add that to the party as well. And brace yourself for a trademark money shot. Say it with me, guys. Looking good. Everything you need is in the captions. And that was your turn to make it happen.
