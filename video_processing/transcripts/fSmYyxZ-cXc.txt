Howto & Style
 Alnus glutinosa. This is the first time I'm growing alder. This is European alder, and alder is a river bottom tree, so the seeds don't actually sink. Even if they're viable, the seeds don't sink. They float on top, and that's kind of an adaptive mechanism of it's got these little floaty seeds. They drop into the water, they float down the river, embed themselves in the bank somewhere, and then a new tree grows. And I was told that these needed cold stratification, but I dropped some in the water like this, and several days later, now they're already growing roots, so I'm quite excited about that. So I'm going to be planting these out, and then I'll have some alder trees for sale. First time growing alder from seed.
