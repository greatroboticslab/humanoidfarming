 Alright, now I'm going to show you guys the 20 gallon tank system which supports the tilapia which are a little bit bigger in size. I don't know if you can see them there, they're darting around. There they are, really scared. Okay, so here I have a pump that's about a 60 to 80 gallons per hour pump. I don't actually remember. And then the way the system goes is it goes into this girl bed. And I've made these braces for it. So it won't move anywhere because this girl bed is actually more narrow than the tank. And then I got the one specifically with the lid. I got this girl bed, this plastic container from, oh there it is, flushing right now. I got this plastic container from Goodwill. It was about 3 bucks. The tank I also got from Goodwill for about 12 bucks. And this is actually cheaper than the NFT system because you have to buy so many tubes. But what you do have to invest in on this one is you got to make the bell siphon and then the rocks, the gravel. And a lot of people use the Hydrotun but just find it's too expensive. And I can't actually find it anywhere locally. So here what I've done is I've drilled a bunch of 2.5 inch holes in series. And it really depends on the design of the lid. This one happened to be shaped this way. We just got these little square things. So that's how I drilled it. And for this one I use just the regular cups. But I'm going to show you. You can see here, I use regular cups. But I took a hot glue gun to them and I made a bunch of holes. So you can put gravel inside the cups and your plants. You just put them right here in the holes. Boom. They fit the water. The water fills up to this line right here. And the cups do, for the most part, they should be below that line. But every once in a while when it flushes, it aerates them so they're not rotting under there. And this is just to see PVC. So you've got some plants growing here already. And these are the preferred, I actually prefer these. I'm very picky about the dimensions of the Tupperware bins. For grow beds, I like this sort of dimension where it's about 6 inches in height. It could be a little longer, but 2 feet in length is fine. 2.5 feet. And then anywhere between a foot and a half to 2 feet in width. See, here's the... Should have some dimensions on here. But somewhere between, see this is a 7 gallon. Somewhere between a 7 and a 10 gallon. I think I've got another one over there I can show you later. In the bigger systems. But this is the 20 gallon system. And this one will support the bigger fish. Getting them ready to go into the 50 gallon. This is a step before the 50 gallon. And then finally the large, I'm not sure how many gallon system. This whole system costs maybe... Well, it costs a lot. Just because of the trial and error. Learning and... Troubleshooting. But once you have it down, it'll cost about... 40 bucks. It really depends on how cheap you can get the tank. And then... I'll show you guys in another video... How I made this specific... Siphon. The bell siphon. Let me open it. See if I can get it open. Let me see. If I can get this. See there it goes. There's the bell siphon. The bigger tube is the... It's just to guard it against the rocks. So you've got river rocks and lava rocks mixed in there. I prefer lava rocks. The only problem is that you have to super clean them or you get that... This like film everywhere. This like red dust. Which I had a problem earlier with the... With the 50 gallon system. But... There you go. And basically you just... Just make your own... Planters. And then you can buy them super cheap. And you won't run out. Anyways, there you go. Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you. Lesson. . . . .
