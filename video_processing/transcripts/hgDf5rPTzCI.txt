Howto & Style
 Hi, this is Marjorie Wildcraft and in this edition of Homesteading Basics I'm going to talk about what skills do you need if you're going to be a modern homesteader and Where's the best place to get some of those skills? I'm going to talk about how to get some of those skills together and I'm going to talk about how to get some of those skills together. I'm going to talk about how to get some of those skills together. Let's see here. Dang, still not drawing. Hey, y'all, my son, I had my son using the lawn mower the other day and he runs out of gas, leaves it out in the middle of the south pasture, leaves the key turned on, the battery dies, and now he's off on some trip. I'm going to brought the battery in, fill up the tank, all those things. Which brings up a good question. What kind of skills do you need if you're going to be a modern day homesteader? And here's my quick answer is it's really good to have a little bit of basic electrical skills. You know, the black wire and the red wire and they connect kind of thing. A little bit of carpentry skills come in really handy, plumbing, and then of course, animal husbandry and gardening, which is what we talk about a lot here at the Grow Network. Now, these skills take a while to acquire if you haven't already gotten them, but one of the best places to really accelerate your skill level is to attend a Mother Earth News Fair. Seriously, they're starting to ramp them up and have them all over the United States. And there's typically 150 different workshops in a two or three day period that they offer for basic skills like this. All kinds of presentations also with people talking about different things of home medicine, distilling your own whiskey. I'm going to get to that one. And, you know, all, of course, all aspects of growing food and composting. So I'm going to be attending a lot of them in 2017, probably 2018. I hope I can catch you there. I'll definitely look for you. And yeah, let's improve our skills together. And meanwhile, we're definitely cutting out his allowance. This is Marjorie Wildcraft and catch you on the next Homesteading Basics. Thank you. .
