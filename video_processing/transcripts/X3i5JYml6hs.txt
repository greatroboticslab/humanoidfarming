 It's difficult to grow food in the city, but more and more people are trying to. We usually don't get access to the big open fields. What we get are the scraps. We get the tiny side yards. We get the little scrap of lawn between the sidewalk and the street. My job is to re-engineer those pieces of land into edible spaces that are producing food for the families that live around them. Well that's a good idea. Let's not put this guy in there then. Let's put the raspberries where the rosemary is. Most people's great grandparents and probably their grandparents have had a garden or grew up with a garden. I hear that a lot from people. They say, oh, you know, my grandmother had this huge garden. It was so beautiful. I want to recreate that for my kids. Charlie, don't throw the dirt. But there's a gap there where it seems like a whole generation of people just completely missed out on what it is to grow your own food. There is enormous value in putting the food system in the community as opposed to making it some abstract thing where tomatoes come in cellophane. Tomatoes come off a vine, and they can come off a vine in your backyard. And that is an extraordinarily empowering thing for people, in addition to being delicious. This is about as urban as it gets. It's very busy and very noisy and crowded, but this garden is sort of a secret on our roof. Coming up here and finding the new growth every day is just a huge surprise, and it just brings me so much joy. It's hard to explain. A vegetable garden has rich soil. There's flowers. There's natives. And it fosters a healthy ecosystem. If the kids are racing out the door first thing in the morning and they've, you know, not finished all of their food, I can take those leftovers out to the hens. They're getting a good breakfast. There's not a whole lot of waste. They get our leftovers. They lay eggs. We eat the eggs. We're all kind of having this nutrient circle that is pretty wonderful and pretty remarkable. You might not be able to feed your whole family growing in your backyard, but you can produce a whole lot in a small little space, and the food that comes out there is going to be more nutritious and tastier than anything you can buy in the store.
