 It's really easy to get caught up in the business world, in our day-to-day activities. I find that we don't spend enough time with ourselves, and I think Unique Paths is a great place to come and find yourself with your friends. There's loads of space, there's loads of things to do. Over here you can go trekking, there's boating, there's geese, there's animals around, as you can probably hear as well. So I mean the opportunities here are lovely, but the most important thing is you find yourself in the beautiful atmosphere of Hajji. Enjoy.
