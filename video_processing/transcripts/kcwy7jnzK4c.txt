 The second edition of the African Conference on Agricultural Technologies ACAT 2025 recognizes the transformative potential of agricultural technology in enhancing agricultural productivity and food security across Africa. However, the digital divide presents a significant challenge as many smallholder farmers, particularly in rural areas, lack access to digital technologies and the necessary skills for effective utilization. This gap hinders the ability to benefit from the innovations intended to improve their livelihoods. I work on cowpea, cotton, maize and peanuts. So I am attending this ACAT 2025 as a farmer. Some of the challenges that people brought out and that is real in how farmers can get access to the farms so they can be able to equip themselves with a model and with a mechanization. During a session called Farmers Dialogue, aimed to bring farmers voices to the forefront and to explore practical solutions to promote technology literacy, farmers talked about the experiences in the digital divide and how they wished agricultural technology literacy could be promoted. Using smart viruses. Smart viruses. Smart viruses is where they go and put different technologies in the same area and then farmers can be able to come and run there and go to increment in their farms outside of that virage. So what we have a lot of farmers, farmer to farmer training needs and programs are. We had a solution of school based because if the young people in Africa are in school, how do we create that ecosystem to be a starting point from them in schools? So we have demo demo sites in schools. In most of our countries here, we have agricultural shows only once a year. So that's the only touch point that the young people are getting into. So the biggest thing is first of all, seeing is believing and we need to get farmers needs first but co-coordinate and cooperating and co-developing of that. I think farmers should go for good information, seek for good information. Because today farmers need to be more organized. And if you are not organized, it will be very difficult for you to get access to the farm. Because today you cannot farm and get a grant for an annual year. It's very difficult. But if you are organized like cooperative, like a union, it will be very easy for you to get access to the farms. The four-day ACAT conference being held at the Kigali Convention Center in Rwanda from June 9 to 12, 2025, with a theme of Next-End Agritech Solutions for African Farmers, communicates the focus on utilizing the latest advancements in agricultural technology to empower African farmers. To truly liberate this potential, it is crucial to adapt a farmer-centric design approach in developing science, technology and innovation solutions. The second edition of ACAT conference is being hosted by the Government of Rwanda and the African Agricultural Technology Foundation, AATF.
