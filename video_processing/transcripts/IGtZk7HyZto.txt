 Well hey welcome to the AgExplorer Roadshow coming to you from Eastern Kansas where I'm with Matt Tariq and I'm with Jenna Stonehawker from AgExplorer. So first of all Matt tell me a little bit about where we are and a little bit about the history of the farm that we're on. Okay yeah so we're in the northeast corner Kansas we're about 35 miles north of Topeka. We're about 20 miles from the Missouri River and 40-ish miles from the Nebraska border. Okay. So we're kind of we're up in the northeast corner. Definitely tell me a little bit about the history. So the history well this is a this is we started this farm from scratch in 2013. My wife and I and uh started with about 160 acres and uh we finally got it up to about 3,000 now. Awesome. Something we just don't hear a lot about right? A first generation farmer. Most people don't uh yeah they say wow that's a pretty good feed you know it doesn't happen very often yeah you don't hear that very often. Definitely we're going to come back to that because I think it plays a big role in what we're seeing here and how you manage. Okay. Jenna you're our AgExplorer rep for eastern Kansas and I'll be honest with you a lot of us when we think Kansas we think wheat and yet we're standing in beautiful corn. Tell me a little bit about what the rest of your territory looks like. Yeah so like you said I cover eastern Kansas uh everywhere from the Nebraska border down to the Oklahoma border uh from about Salina and Wichita to the east. So um we've got everything from hard red winter wheat to soft white wheat uh to some soft red wheat uh corn soybeans, sorghum, cotton, uh sunflowers, you name it we've probably got it. A lot of people I think think about western Kansas where it's super dry and um we've we've had a couple really bad years of drought in my southern part of the territory but uh we've kind of flip-flopped a little bit at the beginning of this year. Northeast Kansas has been we started off wet got a little dry here the last few months and uh my southern to central part of the state started off really really dry and they've been getting inundated with flooding and rain and so we've done a little bit of a weather flip-flop here but yeah eastern Kansas is quite a bit different than western Kansas what people imagine in wheat and dry country. It is in a really diverse state right when we think about these crops which makes it fun but also can can make it a challenge. So Matt as we kind of think about where we're standing we've spent the morning walking crops we've been in some corn v9 v10 right you got a lot of soybeans are just ready to set some of their first bloom on there. Talk to me a little bit about what does the spring look like and what challenges have you faced? Yeah so spring you know started off everybody was saying it was going to be a drought so everybody was concerned with drought um planting you know we plant date for corn here is April 1st so we started flying April 1st um got going got after it and uh it was dry kind of getting nervous for the drought and then it started raining we got into you know the end of April 1st of May and things it wouldn't stop raining for a while there's a lot of guys so we got a big gap we got the first 20 days April we got a lot of things planted and then we don't have anything planted until the 20th of May. Yep. And uh so there's going to be a big gap between the two what was there is you know up and going like this and other stuff is you know short downed by your boot top. Definitely. Um you know populations around here we're from 24 to 32,000 depending on soil types and yep and uh bottom ground or hill ground um same for beans you know plant date for beans around here is first to May but a lot of guys are planting back in April we visited earlier walking the field and said actually some guy started the end of March. Yep. Um so things look you know those beans the early beans look really good. Awesome. So you kind of brought up a couple things that I found as I've traveled can really create a lot of challenges we'll put it that way but you talk soil so in general right what does nutrient management look like with the soil types that you're running and kind of that we're running just in this part of the state? Yeah so I would say nutrient management so we're we're fairly high clay content around here. CEC is running in the uh mid upper teens the mid 20s. Oh so you got some heavy soil. So we got some pretty heavy soil which is good and bad. We both know that um but so uh you know we majority of the nitrogen goes down early a lot of guys around here still running anhydrous. Okay. So we do a lot of knifing in anhydrous a lot of it happens in the fall but some happens in the spring too so but a lot of guys are planting anhydrous up front and then we'll come back you know v6 and top dress with normally you know 30 to 40 units of in. Awesome so let's talk about that nitrogen management. I love talking about how we manage nutrients across the United States. So you said a lot of guys you guys are still far enough north we can knife some anhydrous in right in the fall. What kind of units of nitrogen are we putting down though and what forms are you really seeing? So majority of it's all anhydrous ammonia in the fall and we're putting down anywhere from 140 units to 180 units. Okay. You know our ideal go around here ranges from I mean 160 to 230. Yep. Kind of depends on you know the soil types and terrain but sure but I would say that's kind of where we are so and then you know they'll come back later and we top dress in 90 percent of everything we do there is nitrate. We still get nitrate in this area so we do a lot of nitrate around here. There is some urea around but majority of everything is nitrate. So that makes it a little bit easier to manage right when we think about MBPT, urease inhibitors whether we've got to get water on it or not. Yes. That's kind of a key area because a lot of spots even where I am we can't get a hold of that nitrate anymore right. We're really kind of a UAN or urea right and it's great it's nitrogen but there are some challenges. There are some challenges and and you know it's probably similar to your area but in northeast Kansas we can go through big dry spells. Oh yeah. We're kind of getting into one of those right now and you've got urea on the ground you'd be really nervous about it sitting there without a rain. We were supposed to get two inches last night and we got two tents. I think Jenna got all of it is what it sounded like today. Yeah southern Kansas got hammered pretty good. So Jenna down in your area what does it look like for nitrogen? What are sources timings? Yeah so kind of similar to up here in northeast Kansas where a lot of anhydrous in the fall still. We get into a little bit of spring anhydrous in kind of the southern part of the state but still a lot of anhydrous out there. And then unlike up here we really don't get into nitrate a whole lot so if we've got guys that aren't running anhydrous there's a lot of urea and UAN going out. Awesome. So I'm going to jump us forward a little bit right. We were talking about fall and then we're coming back early V stage right. We're getting some more nitrogen on but one thing we were talking about at lunch and by the way if you want to talk about hospitality come on over here. They serve you lunch when you show up at this farm and I appreciate that. But we got talking tar spot foliar disease. What kind of history have you had with tar spot on your farm in your area and how are you working to manage that? Yeah so you know I moved here in 2013 from eastern Colorado so it was a big jump here. We planted corn out there but it was very very low populations and yields were low though so tar spot was not even a thing in eastern Colorado. So it came here in 2013 believe it or not tar spot really wasn't even known in 2013 when I moved here. I would say really tar spots shown up in the last four years maybe. And it's here to stay now and it's coming and it keeps moving south every year. So I mean we got tar spot in the very far northeast corner of Kansas right now in what they call Donovan County which is a very highly productive heavy corn county. And there's tar spot there already. Yep. You know we had some tar spot in this county which is Jefferson County last year. I didn't have any that was actually found on my farm but I had a lot around. So I'm sure it probably was I just didn't see it. Sure. But yeah tar spot's a big thing here now and it's something new we had never dealt with before so it's a whole new challenge for us out here. Definitely. So let's talk about how do we deal with it here. You go across different areas. One pass program, two pass program, freights early, generics early, name brand late. What have you found works for you? So down here where we haven't had super high heavy pressures I would say one passes have been sufficient. Now you get up north and they're doing two passes and they're doing full rates of high top named fresh name products. Yep. Multiple modes action. Yes. Three modes action products is what we're running all the time anywhere. Yeah. Pretty much all the time around here now. Right. Trying to keep the plant healthy right. Not the curative side but just keep the leaves healthy. Capture that sunlight just like this beautiful plant right here. Drive that yield to all the way to the end. So Matt one thing I do want to hit on is and we we touched on this a little bit ago. I visit with very few farmers who are first-gen farmers. I just do. It's not an industry I think if we're being honest that really gives itself to saying hey I've never been in this area. I don't have family that farm here but I'm going to step in I'm going to make it work. Yeah. So I'm really impressed but I'm impressed by multiple things but one thing that has me impressed is how many irons you have in the fire. And we were laughing about this earlier but we have a drone flying and that was not staged. No, no it was not. I was like I want this field. But we've got a drone. You have a drone company. Yep. And you do a poly pipe company. Yep. And you do custom farming. Yep. And you do custom application. And you have a family. Yep. And I'm sure you're you sell seed. Yep. And you sell chemicals. Yeah. I may have missed three or four things but that's most of them. Pretty much most of them. Yeah. So let's let's be honest. What does it look like to mesh all of that together? And what's your passion with it? Well the passion comes back to ag right. I mean that's where that's where it all begins and farming is what what I was in my blood. That's what I want to do. So so all that all that works due to the farming and the passion for the ag. You know I wouldn't be able to do the custom operation or custom spraying or custom spreading without the ability to use it on my own acres and that's what makes it beneficial. Definitely. You know the passion is I don't know the passion is I love I love doing it. I love farming and I love being part of it and I love helping people. So I love being part of it and when people say that I do not know because of the parks that I do. So I just get started movingом atRemama because of the organize doing all the paid options and the people going to have to have ella them and then go to Refrán Gaming i'm a member of finance in the government. If people then uh holy- Pues some So my passion would be just helping people. I enjoy being involved with farmers and you know that's not the farmers stigma or something. Most farmers like to keep everything pretty tight to their chest. I'm kind of the opposite. I feel like we're all in this together. We all have to figure out how to make this work as a group. And so I'm always there to help and see if I can help people get better at what they do. Man, I love that. Right? And that's the story of agriculture. You think back to when our great-great-grandparents homesteaded. They relied on one another. We think about where we are now and you have amazing equipment. We can cover thousands of acres a day, but it still comes back to helping one another. It's a relationship business, right? If we can help each other out and learn from someone else, it makes it a lot easier on everyone to continue moving the industry forward. Most definitely. I love that. Lean in, help people out, and move on. Well Jenna, I appreciate your time. Matt, it's great to meet you. Thank you.
