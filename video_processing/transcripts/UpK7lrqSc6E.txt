 Look, in Chinese farms, after bathing their animals very well, they give them a massage in this way. By doing this, their cows and goats become so happy that they give more milk. This milk is so much that after selling it in the market, their calves and baby goats are also fed. And some goats even feed their remaining milk to these cows themselves.
