 Good morning everyone. I'm here at Nagraj's farm. It's called Farmer's Nest. It's in the Gunjur area which is very close to Bartur. It's in Bangalore. So I'll be talking to Nagraj today and find out more about his farm, what he does, how well, how did we start this whole thing. So looking forward to very exciting conversation with him. Hi Nagraj, how are you? Hi ma'am. Fine, thank you. My name is Nagraj. I'm going to live in the Gunjur area. So we're intercroped in Goa archers. Nagraj, this is so good to grow here. I'm seeing iceberg lettuce, arugula. Usually, without crop we are not controlling weeds. So that is the reason we are going to plant to cultivate and planning to enter crop here. So we're going to plant here. What will we do here? We will have interest in the crop. We will plant weeds. That's why we will plant weeds. We will plant weeds. We will plant weeds. We will plant weeds. We will plant weeds. So usually, we will plant weeds in the crop. We will plant weeds. We will plant weeds. We will plant weeds. We will plant weeds. So there are two or three advantages. So one is one of the kind of green mulching. It is green and something is growing. So you will plant weeds. So you will plant weeds. And one thing is because you are doing it in the orchard, So it is also coming to shade. Because it is shade. It is shade. It is shade. So for example, when you are planting weeds in the orchards, it will be a dancing shade. Then it will be good. So we are planting weeds. And diversity, And whether it is planting weeds or fruit on truck with just three years, There will be pests. The pests will be protracted. That's why we are planting zehn? This is multi-croping. Which then by the way does? What is there ya spread? For instance, it is heavy. There is�� огis and mustard. There we need to be still, and amongst those pris é yourself in time. On earth, this will be on our own giveaway. We turn these seeds first, so when these seeds are coming, we have enough wh altri seedcción. Is it because when this year dallace Sagittarius, of course Jurupur Anandes gives emному once begins so while we draw him remains first this trend is LOTE bungee programming of leather. In the past, we add inter crops and multi crops. Okay, so you have put it here. Normally, if you think of lettuce and mustard, then if you think of this crop today, do you have to add seed or saplings? We have to add some seed. We have to add argola-arb seeds. We have to add some seed from Kuddi developed. We give some saplings in the nursery. After bringing it, we treat it from here. Gio-amruta, Gokrupa-amruta, and seaweed. We add seed treatment as well. And the quality is good with seed treatment. We also treat seed treatment as well. And also, seeds. After that, you grow. So, if you think of it, how many days do you grow iceberg lettuce? Iceberg lettuce is a cycle of part-5 days. In 22-23 days, it comes to harvest. In 22-23 days, it comes to harvest. We will harvest it for 15 days. Okay. So, in a month, the crop will be finished? From start to end. In 60 days, it will be finished. Then, you will add something else to remove it. Yeah, you will add something else to the land. Either we prepare land or we will add another. Low tilling. We don't do much tilling. Because in organic lands, it will be more tilling. Correct. So, till tilling tilling, the nutrients are imbalanced. Correct. And the ecosystem will also impact on the ecosystem. We use little tilling. Low tilling, we use instruments. Power wader. Low tilling, we use crops. Okay. In this area, the crops are stored in our record. So, what do we do with records? In another type, we don't use the same or similar crops. For example, if we have used icebergs, then, for 1-1-1.5 years, we don't use the crops. This crop and lettuce will also be used. And we don't use those crops in the family. The crops will be used as a new plant. Los Angeles,una 75, we don't use this night espera. But unless you need a crop семь��은, we don't want the same type of nutrients. For the same time, after that crop�rist, put the two crops apart from the new plant Looks like support if we keep nutrients. Because it has already been cut to the raw plant. The turtles will get these rains in the soil. Therefore, for example, we'll be między that crops and bring them in the oregano. We add another crop seed. Don't forget to remake that seeds in the last place. We are going to get into this land and then for one year, the sediment remains in the ground. Sediments means that it is a built. The sediment will come very quickly. The sediment remains in the ground. One year, one and a half year, it will damage the crop and die back. That is why we have that crop in the ground. So, you have to record that this crop is put in this place? Yes, absolutely. We have to think that one year, you have put in this ground, that will be the record. So, you need to do this farmer? Yes, farmer should do this. Because it will become a good plan for the poor nutrition. So, in the poor nutrition, the pest will be controlled? Correct. Correct. So, these are built like things? Yes, the regular farmer will always put in this place in the ground. It will be different from the nutrition of the crop. So, the nutrition of the crop will be taken. Okay. For example, the ratio of the NPK, the amount of the crop will be taken. Then, when the crop will increase in the time, the input will increase. So, that's why we need to rotate the crop in the ground. So, we need to change the crop in the ground. We need to change the crop in the ground. We need to understand both the organic farmers. So, this is the organic crop and the inorganic farmers. We need to understand the crop plan. So, this is organic or inorganic? Yes, it is organic. Again, it is organic. So, it is different for crop rotation. You have to do too. I need to do too. Yes, yes. Ok, ok, very nice, include. So, this is what you've done. Your wild inferring is you bro, and you areEL7 balancing this plant by using the harvest for the next part. After this store, running this supplétient? You are standing our decision now. Yes, the plane cannot be applied to this ground. So, the material must go down to this ground, so, in the cycle of green power, orieveammentym. One month or two months at a distance. Sometimes when it is常 where regenerates pis allaplatzes are in theособ Court. Sometimes we will do more rain when the lands are empty. For a party, 5 days, 50 days, the lands are empty. Then we will add green manure. Green manure will be more fertile soil. Green manure like sun ham, Danachia, like horse gram, cow piece. And nitrogen fixing. Nitrogen fixation, crops will be added. And then we will add the crops. Okay. So you will leave a little time between harvest. Like how many crops do you do this? In a year, we have to do it. And in a year, we have to give the card. I always give it two times. Every six months. Six months. So I will go back to farm manure. Once in a year, two times, I am recommended to use cow manure. Okay. So usually, if you don't have to produce organic farmers, then it will not come to production. It's out. There'll be... How many more of you can go to farm manure? And it's sore. I don't have to take care. So as of the nutrition in a year, I feel soượbig. Take care, man. We're called herbicide. Okay. And I miss the coach. I'm going to become a bear kepionist. If you're not. You're not around the world. You're notopa. I'm gonna option 4 before. If you want a bind sat May. For a third time. You're not super
