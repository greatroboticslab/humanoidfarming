 Hey guys, today we are here in iBuy Premium's Great One Lodge, well, one of them. How many great ones do you have to date, iBuy? I am at 110 currently. Holy! 110 great ones. Yeah. That's insane. And how long has it taken you to spawn 110 great ones? Yeah, we're about two years. And you have your own herd management strategy for making this happen, don't you? I do. Awesome. So guys, in today's video, we're going to go through step-by-step exactly how to set up a great one grind using herd management. And we're going to go through all the steps so that you can duplicate these results. Maybe not 110 of them. That does take some serious time. But we'll start with one great one. How about that? Sound good? Yeah, let's do it to it. All right. Now guys, let me know in the comments what your best trophy is so far in the game. And if you do have any great ones, how many do you have? And I am also going to encourage you to stick around right to the end of the video. Because if you do miss any of this information, the grind will just not work properly for you. And I am going to drop a keyword at the end of the video. Drop that in the comments for your chance to win a one-month membership to the channel. And let's do it. So, do you have a favorite great one? Honestly, I've been really, really liking the whitetail lately. You want to take us into your whitetail lodge? Yeah, let's jump over to it. There's some really cool wonky ones in there. The most recent super rare right here. A little wonky pie ball. Beautiful. How many super rares have you spawned? Up to five super rares. And I've spawned four super trolls so far. Look at that. That is a max score small rack right there. Look at the great one whitetail, guys. Can you imagine? Holy. This is like my favorite room, actually. It's crazy. Oh my gosh. So, as you can see, he has a pretty insane lodge. So, what would the very first thing that you would recommend someone does when they want to start a great one grind using herd management? So, as long as you have the tents and things like that in order to do the grind, number one is find your zones, right? Drink zones. Your drink zones. Yeah. And the main thing that you're looking for there, for whitetail, for example, you really want to get out there and find your max weight bucks. Those are priority, both for main zones and exterior zones. You want to find and set up on as many of those as you can at the start. Even if you're using all 16 tents, as long as you have those max weight bucks targeted. So, basically, they want to take 16 tents. They want to find all their drink zones. And as they're doing that, they want to drop a tent down on the zones that have the biggest bucks. Right. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that'll give you an amazing start at actually getting the managing process moving faster early. Okay. And depending on what species, the number of zones they need to find is going to differ based on species, right? And the map. Yeah, the map mainly. Yeah. So, the map's the big one. You have, like, for whitetail, you have, you know, Rancho has the fewest amount of zones where Leighton and Reventuli are very, very close to each other as far as, like, the amount of zones where, you know, New England has more zones. It has a lot more than normal. But, I mean, I feel like it's like that with most of the species on that map, actually. Okay. So, once they have found all of their drink zones, they set up 16 tents on the very biggest deer that they can find. And then what? So, with that, you're going to want to decide which zones you want to actually be your main zone. So, out of the 16 tents, I would say about eight of them should be dedicated to main shooting zones. And those are going to be zones that are nice, wide open, easy to shoot, and, you know, a zone that you can see that you want to carry over to your actual main final Great One grind, right? And so, with the other tents, the other tents should be considered your exterior zones. And with those, basically, you're going to rotate your main zones and exterior zones at the same time. So, you'll be hitting all 16 tents, shooting all 16 of these drink zones. And as your exterior zones get shot down, you're going to want to try and stack diamonds into your main zones. As you do this, you'll see the shooting down process for your exteriors start to move quicker the more diamonds you get stacked into your main zones. As the zone gets shot down for exterior, you'll actually pick that tent up and you'll just move it to another drink zone that you haven't shot yet. So, this is where people, I think, get confused. They think that they should grind all interior zones at once or exterior zones at once, but you want to be grinding all 16 zones, exterior and main shooting zones at the same time. That's really important. Yeah, absolutely. To point out. Yeah, I've seen a lot of people say that, that they've just been grinding their main zones and they haven't touched their exterior. But the whole point of it, you got to look at it like a game of musical chairs. You're literally trying to get big respawns in your main zones and small respawns into your exterior zones, essentially at the same time. So, if you're not grinding main and exterior at the same time, you're not going to be able to do that. No, it's absolutely imperative. Now, people get really confused with what is the difference between a main shooting zone and an exterior zone. Can you help us with that? I can, absolutely. Yeah. So, your main zone is literally a zone that you pick. Like, it's entirely up to you. It just comes down to a zone that you like that has a good, stable herd in it. So, you want at least two females and at least two males. That's the minimum for whitetail, for example. Mm-hmm. And similar for other species as well. But exterior zones are just zones that maybe are like overgrown and stuff like that. Maybe there's, you know, a lot of trees in the area. And, you know, when you go there, the bucks may be behind trees and stuff like that. Just be more of an issue, right? Like, those I tend to turn into an exterior zone and I just choose to shoot it down so I don't have to deal with it later. I want like a nice, smooth, easy grind. And what do you mean by shooting it down? Because people aren't quite sure what that means. Right. Yeah. Okay. So, for whitetail, shooting it down is, you know, obviously stacking diamonds in the main zones, but shooting your exterior down to level ones and small twos. By small twos, they're basically a one, but it just has the level two on it. They're really small stick racks. This buck up on the right, like my actual, like, favorite whitetail now, I think. This one? Yeah. Look how wonky that is. Do you see how far that left side droops down? Very cool. Well, it's our right side, but yeah. Very cool. That's his favorite great one. Out of 110? Yeah. Out of all of them, that's the best. That's insane. All right. So, they're straight across the water over here. So, this right here is actually a really good example of a main zone to me. Now, there is a couple of small trees here, right, that aren't that big of a deal. I mean, you can easily actually shoot through these trees, but there's three does here and two max weight bucks, right? So, that right there, absolutely something that you want to set up on early. For me, this is actually a main zone, and I enjoy shooting it, so I kept it this way. So, this is an example of a good main shooting zone. So, you want to show us an example of an exterior zone? Yeah. So, actually, directly across as well. So, over to the left over there, there's a zone here. There's two level one males in there and four females, but they oftentimes get back into those bushes pretty thick. And so, that's actually one that I decided to shoot down. I do have some more examples up this way, though. So, basically, guys, what you're going to be doing is you're going to go to each zone at your 16 tenths, and you're going to be shooting the two biggest bucks. You're going to shoot two from each zone, right? Right. And you're going to do that until you get to an exterior zone, and you find that it looks like this. Right, yeah. A really prime example is right over here. Actually, I have two exteriors side by side here. This is ideally what you look for. It also has the low level twos that I leave as basically looking at like a one. So, directly out over this way. So, that right there is an exterior. There's two does and actually four bucks over there. They're all level ones, though. And then, yeah, and then that zone right there. So, the level one, you can see the 99 to 140 estimate on that little level one to the right there. And then, to the left, it's literally a lower estimate, 92 to 133 on a level two. I mean, that thing is a level one all day. It just says level two. Yeah, so basically, when they get to a zone and it looks like this, then they want to pull their tent and tripod and move it to another zone. And they want to keep doing that until all of their exterior zones look like this. Absolutely, yeah. Yeah, once you get to that point right there, you know, I've seen people try and try and try to shoot that two down to a one. That two is already a one. You can just forget it, you know? Yeah. The twos that look like ones, if they look like ones, treat them like they're ones. Absolutely. Okay. So, then, once all of your exterior zones, so meaning every whitetail zone on the map, except for your eight main shooting lakes, once they are all shot down, then they can pull their tents and set them up as pickup tents, right? Right. Absolutely, yeah. So, as soon as you get down to, say, like, the last eight exterior zones that you have to shoot down, as those shoot down. So, say you shoot down, you know, one of the eight. You pick that tent and you literally go place it at your main zone in the zone that you're shooting into as a pickup tent. And recently, with this update, actually, the animal's collision, when you shoot an animal down, if they hit your tent, it actually will have a beaver fell that tent. So, set them just a little bit back off your pickup tent or off your shooting zone. Set it back just a little bit so you don't have that collision issue, right? Which is super annoying. But by moving your tent to be your pickup tent, you're going to go through your grind so much faster. Yeah, so once you actually get a full grind set up with shooting and collection tents, it's way faster. And you make money literally so much faster in your grind. So, basically, they find their zones. They set up on the best zones with the biggest deer. They pick eight zones to be main shooting lakes and eight to be exterior zones. And then they start shooting two deer from every zone. You rotate on all of them. Once you shoot down your exterior zone, pick up your tent and tripod and move it to another exterior zone until all your exterior zones have been shot down. And just keep rotating and keep doing that until everything is shot down on the map except for your eight main shooting lakes. How am I doing? Right, yeah. I think the one thing we're just missing is the stacking diamonds in the main zones, right? Yep. Yep. So, that's the main thing. You want to stack the diamonds in your main zones and just continue to shoot down. Yeah, so by the end of it, you should have quite a few diamonds in your main zones. And the exterior should just all look like those little guys that we showed. And stacking just means when you spawn a diamond, you leave it. You don't shoot it right away. Right, yeah. And even a guaranteed troll, like if it's right within a few points, right? Like, so there's quite a few guaranteed trolls that are like 254 for Whitetail, for example. That still is better than just a regular, you know, 200 scoring max weight buck or whatever. So, when they spawn a diamond at an exterior lake, they can just shoot it? Absolutely, yeah. Shoot it, tax it, put it in the lodge because you definitely want to shoot those zones down. If you start stacking in the exterior zones, you'll just set yourself back in the process of shooting down the map. Okay, so when diamonds spawn on main lakes, you leave them. When they spawn on exterior lakes, you shoot them. And this is the greatest way to get the most amount of trophies, to get bigger rares, more diamonds, and definitely you have a greater chance of super rares. Is that correct? Yeah, well, I mean, the chance on super rares is so low as is. But when you're, once you get into spawning so many diamonds, I mean, the chance is just increased for you, right? So, it's by far the best way you can do it if you're really into hunting for big trophies. And I think we should explain what stacking does, just so they know why they're doing it. Right, so stacking is something that I came up with in order to essentially accelerate the process of shooting my map down, right? So, stacking into main zones, it allows you to basically hold a place in the main zone for a large animal to be. So, you can get those large respawns later. But with that trophy rating that that animal holds, it literally just forces the other exterior zones to get shot down faster. I mean, that's really, it comes down to efficiency as well as holding the place of potential future large trophies in my main zones. And so, you want to be shooting the mid-levels depending on what species that you are grinding. So, for something like red deer that go to nine legendary, what would you shoot? Yeah, so for legendary class animals, so we have two currently. We have the red deer and we have the black bear. The difference between the two is that I've never seen a level one red deer male ever. They go to level two. And so, for them, I shoot level five and up. Now, for black bear, they actually go down to level one. And so, for them, I adjusted my shooting level one lower as well. So, I shoot level four and up for my black bear. So, for whitetail, they're basically shooting the twos, but not the tiny twos. We went over black bear and red deer. Then we have fallow and moose, which go to level five. So, for them, you want to shoot the threes and fours and you can leave the tiny threes, right? Right, yeah. So, every species, when it comes down to it, they're very, very similar in the way that one level down can be really, really similar to the level below it, right? So, moose, they have level threes that are basically a two. Fallow are the same way. For them, primarily, like in your exterior zones especially, you're just going to be shooting level three and up, period. That's exactly what you're going to focus on. And you're going to be stacking your fives into your main zones. I-Buy and I actually have a video specifically done for every Great One species. I will leave the links to those videos in the pinned comment below. And a very special thanks to I-Buy for sharing his awesome wisdom with us. Definitely go and show him some love. I will leave the link to his channel on the screen here and in the description below. And the keyword for today's video is, I love Great Ones. Thank you guys so much for watching.
