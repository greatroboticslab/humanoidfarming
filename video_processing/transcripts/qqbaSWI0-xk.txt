 Howdy, Ags! I'm Chloe Blankenship. And I'm Sophia Fonseca, and our group is Agriculture Runoff and Marine Pollution, and this is our pitch to help create a prototype to help contribute to the change of this issue of agriculture runoff here on Texas A&M campus. So what is agricultural runoff? Agricultural runoff can be defined as water from farm fields that can be absorbed into the ground or enter bodies of water and contaminate these sources of water. This runoff can contain pesticides, sediment, and nutrients like phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium from fertilizers. This can occur due to improper management of animal feeding operations, plowing excessively mistreated application of pesticides, and irrigation water and fertilizer. This can all lead to bodies of water and contribute to marine pollution. Problems that agriculture runoff harms is that it is harmful to our waterways as it pollutes our waterways. Whenever this polluted water flows into water ecosystems, it contaminates the water with toxins, which are shown to prove that it blocks the plant's abilities to properly perform photosynthesis, cause spikes in algae growth, and kills the organisms living in the water. This water continues to flow into other waterways that also causes harm to their ecosystems, which then creates the same damage as done before, which then finally reaches the ocean. Once it reaches the ocean, it has been shown to contribute to creating dead zones in the ocean by contributing high amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus into the water. Our goal is to reduce the agriculture runoff here on Texas A&M University by creating a prototype that refines the runoff water created here on campus. This prototype will be implemented in the gardens that filters the water flow chemicals and contaminants so that it is safe to then flow into local waterways and eventually the ocean. By combining these two prototypes that we have designed, we plan on reducing our environmental footprint and step closer to fixing this global issue. To approach this problem, we have come up with two methods to launch a small scale runoff prevention system on the Texas A&M University campus. One being a variation of a river screening rotating water filter and the second being a bioswale. The first would be a modified version of a rotating water cleaner. While the original design of a rotating water cleaner is to filter debris and chemicals out of the water to then be used for landowners and their crops. Our modified version would filter the runoff water on campus of pollutants to then be returned back into the local streams and waterways. Coming from one direction, the runoff water full of fertilizers and contaminants would pass through a screening system that picks up these chemicals that can be neutralized, dissolved, or remain in the filter barriers while allowing clean water to pass through the filter. Ideally, the device would be set up at the nearest water source, like a river or stream close to plots of plants or drainage points on campus. The device itself would need layers in the filter part that would target different pollutants. The first layer would be a general seed that collects dirt and large particles. Then there would be a few layers, including activated carbon rich layer to filter chlorine based contaminants and pesticides, an ion exchange specific filter to target excess nitrogen, and possibly a reverse osmosis step. All these steps would be set within the screening system and then release water back into the source in the opposite direction. The next prototype would be a bioswale. A bioswale is a vegetated low or hollow area that is designed to help minimize the amount of contaminated runoff in an area, while also slowing the flow rate of the water that is being directed towards the swale. The Natural Resources Conservation Service even goes as far as to state that the bioswales are the most effective way to decrease the speed of runoff in filter polluted water and are especially efficient regarding non-point source pollution. This includes contaminants like excess fertilizers from agricultural lands, oil and grease from motor vehicles, sediment due to erosion in bacteria and nutrients attributed to animal waste. A bioswale would be able to collect the polluted water that is coming from parking lots and fields, and the vegetation in the swale would be able to help filter out these harmful pollutants to prevent their introduction into White Creek. Our design would require the land around the swale to be graded in such a way that the excess water drains towards this area, which means that the swale will be at a lower elevation than the surrounding area. Next, a large section of native plants that are highly absorbent must be planted in the swale and then finally a barrier of stones at the end of the rows of plants, a drainage point, would also need to be installed. This barrier is necessary to prevent erosion from the soil under the plants. As water slowly moves through the plants, pollutants like motor oil, fertilizers, and eroded soil are trapped in the bioswale and absorbed into the plants, which prevents these harmful substances from entering the marine ecosystems. This system is able to filter and clean storm rain and runoff water by using plants and channels to produce cleaner water that is free of pollution. With the introduction of a proper system that reduces the agriculture runoff produced by us here on the Texas A&M campus, we can positively impact our contributions to water pollution and environmental health right here in College Station. As a university, we should strive to improve our carbon footprint and influence others to enact change that will positively impact our future to be more sustainable and better for the next generations, starting right here at Texas A&M University. Thanks and Gig'em!
