Each time that thumb turns blue it helps YouTube to know to show this video with more people. From industry favorites to upcoming heavyweights here are the 10 agricultural technology startups to watch out for in 2022. Number 10, Connectira. Founded in 2015, Connectira is an Amsterdam based technology company that helps to run the most efficient dairy farm by working with farmers to identify issues, recommend solutions and streamline operations. Their mission is to train artificial intelligence to learn how to farm so they can empower farmers of all sizes to increase productivity of their own farms while reducing the impact of traditional farming on the planet. Connectira has integrated a machine learning platform into the dairy assistant farm management software that connects farmers and the value chain to identify issues on farm, recommend solutions and support farmers to make the transition to sustainable farming and agriculture. Number nine, Carbon Robotics. Carbon Robotics is pioneering the next revolution in agriculture through the deployment of innovative technology and hardware. Their first product, the Autonomous Laser Weeder, is purpose-built to tackle one of the industry's biggest problems, weed control. By leveraging artificial intelligence and laser technology, Carbon Robotics' revolutionary high precision approach improves crop yield, provides safer working conditions for farmers, reduces overall costs associated with modern farms and creates sustainable alternative paths to regenerative and organic produce without the need to use harmful chemicals. The company was founded in 2018 and is based in Seattle. Number eight, EarthSense. EarthSense is an agritech company that develops ultra-compact and autonomous robots for food crop breeders, scientists and farm growers. Their technology led them to develop and create their own autonomous robot TerraSentia. The smart robot features an entire lineup of sensors that collect data and insights from plants and crops, allowing farmers and scientists to determine data-driven decisions that will directly affect their crops' health, physiology and stress response. Number seven, Smallhold. Smallhold is the first organic mushroom farm in NYC that allows restaurants, grocery stores and other food-related businesses to grow their own mushrooms and greens on site. Founded in 2018, the startup has so far been featured in several mainstream publications such as the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and Bon Appetit. Smallhold's technology cuts out the middleman of the food value chain and in doing so dramatically cuts down potential food loss, giving both domestic and hospitality kitchens their very own source of protein and iron-rich mushrooms and greens. Number six, Agri-Lution. Inspired by vertical farms and with the vision that in the future you could harvest leafy greens, herbs and vegetables fresh whenever you wanted them in your very own kitchen. Growing without pesticides, packed full of nutrients and produced sustainably. The startup was founded in 2013 and is based in Munich. The PlantCube technology, along with resources like seed bars, allow for domestic kitchens to harvest fresh all year round. Fully automated and app controlled, 100% natural, no pesticides or genetic engineering, with up to 30 times more nutrients, the PlantCube can protect the soil, save water and reduce waste. Number five, The Yield. The Yield is an Australian ag tech company on a mission to transform food and farming practices by building secure, scalable digital technologies. The Yield works closely with growers and suppliers to design products as a commitment to solving real crop quality challenges at the farm level and throughout the food chain. No one knows the land better than growers. We want to help them make faster, more informed decisions that impact yield and reduce the risks. The Yield technology combines hardware, data analytics and user friendly apps. Their ag tech solutions can be applied across the food chain to help increase yield, reduce waste, mitigate the risk and costs associated with bad weather and aid in sustainable environmental practices. The Yield sensing GPS technology can provide insights to producers as well as precision agriculture with the use of the Growing Conditions platform for continual updates on crops. Number four, 1.1. While most startups on this list have been more focused on traditional farming, 1.1 is a global network of automated vertical farms, growing the food, developing medicines and discovering the genetics to nourish and heal humanity. 1.1 is revolutionizing vertical farming by building the most technologically advanced cultivation platform on the planet through innovations in automation, AI and plant science. The industry leading proprietary indoor farm technology is designed to maximize plant output while providing growth insights and minimizing environmental impact. Number three, Agribot. Experts in mechatronics and pioneers in the field of agricultural robotics. Their visionary team is strongly committed to creating cost effective solutions for farmers suffering from labor shortages. Their most notable technology to help improve industry practices is the E-Series, which is a robot harvester for gently harvesting strawberries. Coming in at number two, Appeal. Appeal is a food tech startup that is focused on food waste instead of food loss. Inspired by nature's own methods of preservation, Appeal was founded on a mission to build a barrier that could be applied to fruits and vegetables using edible materials that could slow down the rate of spoilage and maintain freshness in food products. Founded in 2012 with a grant from Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Appeal works with partners ranging from small family owned farmers and local organic growers to the world's largest food brands. Appeal is on a mission to make better quality, more sustainable and longer lasting products a reality, creating value throughout the supply chain and more abundant future food suppliers. And coming in at number one, our very own Post Harvest. Post Harvest has created a micro sensor system that measures produce health and ripen stages within storage facilities. This allows operators to have accurate insights and real time data 24-7. This data helps users with shipment forecasts, ensuring that shipments reach their final destination at the most optimal time. Post Harvest's revolutionary technology has already been proven to reduce food loss by up to 33% within the supply chain. To further help industry workers and consumers optimize fresh produce suppliers, Post Harvest has created the world's first free online course platform for both parties to ensure the best practices and solutions are being implemented when interacting with fruits and vegetables. Post Harvest is looking to change the future for fresh produce. These 10 companies are revolutionising how the world thinks of, produces and consumes food. Each startup and the innovations they offer as solutions to the food industry are having a significant impact across the food chain.
