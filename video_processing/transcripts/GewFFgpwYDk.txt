 Farmers are crushing tomatoes, not because they want to, but because they can't sell them. And there's no one to harvest them. Why? Immigrants, the backbone of farm labor, are in hiding, thanks to Trump's crackdown. Then came the tariffs. Exports crashed, crops rotted, prices tanked. MAGA said, kick out the immigrants, but aren't lining up to pick tomatoes. They wanted a trade war, but forgot. There are no winners in a trade war. This is what happens when you elect a businessman with six bankruptcies as president, and he finds out running a country ain't like running a business. The farmers say they're in trouble. Crops are rotting on the vine, and they're blaming the ongoing trade wars and immigration changes. Perfectly good tomatoes are being plowed over instead of picked. It's a sad scene happening in South Florida. You can't even afford to pick them right now between the cost of the labor and the inputs that go in. It's more cost effective for the farmers to just plow them right now. FAFO, the literal definition.
