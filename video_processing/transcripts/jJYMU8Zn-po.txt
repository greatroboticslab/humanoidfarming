 Putting my garden on passive irrigation has been the number one way that I've been able to keep my plants alive during Texas drought and by collecting rainwater to use on my plants, I've been able to make the water we do get stretched that much further in my vegetable garden. But I've been struggling to efficiently get my rainwater from my rain barrels to my potted plants in a way that's not wasteful and is hands-off. So I'm installing this rainpoint solar irrigation system which can be charged through the sun or a USB and dropping the filtered intake into the barrel and then you just connect the emitters which are a capillary style emitter that don't require very much water pressure. The coolest thing about this setup is that you can control it all entirely from your phone because it's wi-fi connected. It even has the ability for me to change the drip rate of how much water goes to each individual plant making this completely customizable and completely hands-off. So now I can use the rainwater that I've collected and the power of the sun and the rainpoint solar irrigation system to passively irrigate all of my potted plants with the touch of a button.
