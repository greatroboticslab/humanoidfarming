 When you're starting a farm, there's a lot of questions, including how much money does a farmer make? But that's the wrong question. The right question is how much does she need to make? Because how much you need is going to determine your product mix, what types of products you're selling, and the scale at which you're operating at, how many of those products you need to sell in order to accomplish your financial goals. Now, how much do you need to live? Well, that comes from rent, food, fun, kids, taxes, fees, subscriptions, retirement. All these make up your holistic financial picture. Say you can do all of this on $40,000 a year. That's $769 a week and $19 an hour. You need to figure out what is the product mix for your farm, what scale you need to operate to be able to hit this number so that you can live and survive. Say we translate that into chickens. If you net on average $10 per whole chicken, that's 4,000 chickens you need to get across the finish line in order to achieve your financial goals. Now, if you can't grow that many chickens, you're going to have to supplement with something else. And if you go for more chickens, congratulations, you're going to make more money.
