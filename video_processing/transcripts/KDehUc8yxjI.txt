 hey guys thank you for tuning back in with me for my spotlight on success i have an amazing interview to show you guys today i am so excited about this one it was a great long conversation amazing points amazing questions and i ended up having to split it up into two parts just to make it a little easier for you guys we ended up speaking for over an hour and a half so a lot of editing went into this i really hope you guys enjoy it are inspired by this story and i'm gonna just let y'all get into it okay all right hey guys thank you for coming to my spotlight today i have devon wilson with me okay farmer bond and i'm gonna be interviewing him and asking him some questions about sunlight gardens and pharmacy are they like one or two separate it's separate so sunlight gardens we're a two-acre urban organic farm and we are mission is to increase access to local food and inspire the next generation of farmers you know we do a lot of different things here but the main thing is growing food and feeding the community essentially we want to have a very large impact which is why we do a lot some of the other things we do if you can get into later like we do some education stuff we do a lot of events parties and things like that but really at the core of what we do is increasing access to local food inspiring the next generation of farmers and then with pharmacy specifically where food is medicine you know pharmacy where food is medicine and realizing like eating food is something that we have to do three times a day every day you know and no matter what you look like where you come from rich poor you know whatever everybody has to do and to me since it's such a necessary thing it shouldn't be something that is harming our bodies and we know uh that you can look at the statistics and just the facts of it in low income areas people are getting diet related illnesses meaning the food that they're forced to eat every day is making them sick killing them slowly in a way and it's one of those things where it's like you know you eat unhealthy and it's not making you sick right away so we you know we tend to just all right walk you know i don't have much money so i'm just get the cheaper option go through the drive-through this and that but it's really harmful to our longevity to our even our mental health and a lot of other things that's tied into it and so you know so like running and pharmacy the idea is like breaking that cycle with the store you know we we talk about convenience stores and you like if you live in an area like this in a more low income area in the hood a lot of you eat from the liquor store you eat from the convenience store but to me it's not convenient if you're eating the product and it's making you sick right like it's not really convenient it's just um it's quick and easy and that's where it is it's like okay can we redefine what convenience means and so like in the store like you got to look wrong a little bit you see like you have a lot of you know chips and snacks and like convenient products but they just have real ingredients in them like our candies have real sugar we don't have artificial dyes artificial sweetener things like that so you know you can eat something and enjoy it it's convenient and it's also charging you up and not giving you diabetes and then cancer essentially like that's how we nourish our bodies so me personally i think it's one of the most important things when it comes to your lifestyle is what you put in your body because whatever you put into your body it shows you know for sure your skin health your overall digestive health a lot of people i advise or have like autoimmune disorders and yeah and it's um it does have a big issue without food that we eat so is is this something that like upon your youth you were really inspired to do it is yeah i think i was um a really curious kid being young like i always you know one of those annoying kids like why wow you know why it is why that and um you know like we're by a similar age so we kind of came up in that time you know we didn't maybe like we didn't grow up with social media and all that but like once we were like teenagers and you know for me like 12 years old i started using internet more right the internet was really um you know what i'm saying becoming a part of our daily life so to speak and so just being on the internet and seeing different things i kind of being curious got to see like okay the way that we're eating and the way that our system is set up is almost designed to make us sick keep us sick in a way and the option to be healthy i mean it's out there but it's hard to access for like for for my me and my family and my community like we didn't have like even even to this day like we don't have like a whole foods we don't have like a lot of these healthier options so i think that's really what inspired me and then also like i love food just just you know like as a as a connoisseur of flavor and i really enjoy um eating food to be real with you i kind of felt a sense of betrayal when i started to understand using internet things like this more about okay what we're eating is is making us sick like as a young kid you know chubby kid i'm eating hot cheetos honey buns this and that and then i also i'm seeing my grandmother dealing with diabetes my auntie having cancer and then i'm so i find out like the stuff that i'm eating that i love that tastes good to me it set me up for failure and so i felt like a sense of betrayal almost and so i'm like wow okay you know i want to i want to provide food for myself my family my community that we can be proud to eat that tastes good and it's healing healing us like you said food is fuel is fueling us up and uh setting us up for a life of longevity well inspiration that's kind of what made me passionate into it like i i just love i love life you know i love life but i want to live a good life and like going back to what i said earlier like we gotta eat so for me i mean i love art i love a lot of different things but i got so passionate into the farming and the food just to kind of set that foundation so to speak yeah a lot too like like food wise and you mentioned the internet you think that a lot of people with access to the internet too would like look into the foods that they're eating and see that they're not good for us especially since that's like you know something super simple we can just go through but i really think it's the the way that our society is pushing on those unhealthy you know when you don't see ads for farms on tv you see fast food ads and medicine ads you know and uh that's great forbid that we try to heal ourselves with food right um do you think that mermaid farming is something that should be taught in our education system most definitely yeah yeah if you think about animals in general like even a deer knows where to go get his food and water you can't really say the same about humans right besides a store you know a lot a lot of a lot of us we we get our stuff in the store you know and i was the same way when i was younger yeah like what happens if that store isn't closed like we got a taste of that during covid right the stores used to be open 24 7 all night this and that now you know they close at midnight you know what i mean not to go like a conspiracy route right but it's like you never know what can happen yeah you know that's kind of person i am right like you never know what can happen so to your point like i do i think the basic survival skills should be taught in school we should know how to catch water filter basic water we should know how to work the land and grow food from the land you know what i'm saying even even like hunting and fishing and like all like really i think we should be learning all that like nature school yeah um but you know we know we're getting taught how to be an employee rather than how to be a boss or how to you know be self-sustainable um so so yeah i definitely think they should teach those basic it's basic survival school i don't even think they barely teach how to cook in school like that anymore you know i think i learned how to make like pizza bagels or something with all this cool like you know what i mean like yeah which is cool like whatever but teach me how to make a stir fry teach me how to can and jar and preserve food yeah like soup like actual my students yeah i definitely think that um all the things that were taught in school that they could definitely make time to teach people and what's good for their body um so you had mentioned something about you do classes yeah so we do a lot of different like classes teaching people how to grow food teaching people how to cook cook i'm i'm not like a chef or anything like that so i don't really teach people how to cook but we'll partner with chefs carl who you saw he's actually a vegan chef oh okay so yeah so like he'll do classes out here and so yeah we have events on the farm i also go i'll go into school sometimes show kids how to plant a raised bed you know build a raised bed plant it and grow simple lettuce radish you know a simple stuff and then one thing that's coming up i'm really excited about is we're going to be doing a workforce development program here on the farm and so basically you know on this journey i realized like we need more practitioners i'm kind of exactly what we're talking about like they don't teach this stuff at school so kids don't know what's possible or they don't first of all they don't see themselves being a farmer because it's like i mean you said you don't see advertisements of this is agriculture this is like you think of a farmer you think of a you know old person or a tractor you know whatever it's lame it's boring like it's not attractive at all and that's just one part of our food system we're talking about farming we're in a store this is another part there's research that has to happen like i'm like i'm a soil nerd i'm the type of person i'm looking at soil through microscopes and study the composition of soil and how to really build great soil so so that's a whole career path in itself right like people have phds to study this type of stuff so the workforce development program is built to get young kids exposed to different careers in our food system with the goal of just having a more strong um robust food system and like i kind of joke about it but you know in my mind like you should be able to go to taco bell order a taco and it's like you're eating local food you know what i mean um and now we know you go to taco bell you're eating um kind of low quality food it's fast food you know it's and nothing to kiss it right everybody but you got those 2 a.m night whenever you gotta stop and you know i'm not judging i don't judge nobody but it's just the fact that you know being aware and working towards a system where like i like taco bell you know what i'm saying like that they make good they make good tasting food it's not good for our bodies but it tastes good yeah so why can't we match the flavor with the health benefits yeah and all it would take is a more robust food system we have um local farmers that are growing corn to make tortillas locally we have you know somebody growing cows for beef locally at a scale where we can supply a fast food chain like that and i'm telling you it would elevate the flavor even more we know when you eat locally and organically the flavor is way better it's much better right we have strawberries in the store today sold on because people come in they they see the michigan strawberries you can smell it you can see it they're brighter they smell way better um probably don't need as much conservatives and all that stuff that they come to the foods a hundred percent it didn't sit on the back of the truck all the way from california driving up here you know what i mean the vision is like you should be able to just go anywhere not even have to think too much about it and you're eating local food we know local food is much better for you it's better tasting it's better for the environment and our our soil and it's better for our bodies and our health so saying all that to say that's the hopeful outcome of this program is that we're building more practitioners of the food system to be able to have a higher capacity to supply these different restaurants right yeah so if you're not getting taught about food and how to farm farmer bonds got you sure enough yeah yeah sign up opening up soon when you initiated these plans or like your idea of pharmacy sunlight gardens how long would you say it was before you started seeing your dreams that come that's a great uh great question so i think when i really felt like i was making a lot of progress i mean it was a lot of milestones along the way how i initially got into farming i was probably 15 or 16 years old having those realizations we talk about and i just went to volunteer on a local farm so it was called a sprout people might have heard of sprout before they kind of transitioned and evolved into like a food hub now but at the time they were doing like community gardens and so long story short i started there then i started my own farm it was a combination of basically farming anywhere i could so i leased some land in the beginning and then i went i was farming on like my friend had a he had bought a house and he had a side lot so i turned that lot into a small garden and it was farming there and then i had a partnership with a flower farmer and was far so i was like farming all these little spots bringing my stuff together and going to the uh farmer's market and so so i saw progress then and then this land became available to purchase um at the end of 2020. so i bought this land at the end of 2020 and that's when i really started seeing a lot of progress because i had more space i wasn't so spread out and since then i really also saw a lot of progress when carl and jerry started helping me out so carl's a store manager jerry's a farm manager and uh they both started as volunteers so they just started helping me out in exchange i was teaching them how to grow and they would help me farm and help me help me do the work that helped me build up to a level where i could pay and pay myself more and then that's when i quit my job i used to do bartending and serving and stuff like that so i quit my job started working full-time here started getting more into teaching and i really enjoyed teaching i kind of you know grew a passion for teaching people and spreading the knowledge and then yeah we just kept making more and more progress okay that's awesome you love teaching so did you take well to like working with the community like was it something that came easy to you then do you think that's it i would say yeah yeah it is and like when we opened the store up the the feedback that we got from the community was it was inspiring and it was reassuring to say okay people do want this you know it's not just me trying to do whatever like people are like oh this is whatever it was reassuring that yeah people were happy to have another option you know a lot of the products that you go to and these are the same products at every store and they're all owned by the same corporations a lot of times you know coca-cola pepsi homes all these different ship companies all these stacked up you know what i mean yeah so i think people are just happy to have another option and yeah it's urban farming you know specifically you really do have to work with your community and you got to be willing to teach people you got to be willing to open up the farm called for volunteer business and i think that's one of the great functions of a urban farm is you get to show people high promotion you know in the city like yeah you you people are you know there's houses all around us right now you know people open their door and they see us working they get kind of curious or they might even just like for a kid right like when i was a kid i did not know food grew in the dirt like and i mean that sounds crazy to me now because of what i do but like i mean seriously i didn't know food grew in the dirt you know i mean like i would just my mom we would go to the store together get get things off the shelves how was i supposed to know so i think a lot of kids have that same experience it's like you don't know what you don't know yeah it's actually a crazy way to look at it it's like we've become bio phobic so like we have like a bio phobia meaning like people are scared of nature for real you know what i mean a lot of people they don't want to get dirty they're scared of bugs i was grounding when i was outside i'm chilling on the ground that's what i did i can get out there like this is nice i'm touching the grass right so yeah that's real that's real and so yeah i mean i've got i'll actually have people say like oh i don't want to eat that because i came out of there i mean you know what i mean so just shows how disconnected we have become from the earth and from nature so yeah it's a great it's a great reality to be able to offer that knowledge and connect reconnection to people and to be real with me i think a lot of the problems we have in our society is because of how disconnected we have it came from nature honestly i would agree i would say yeah i think so and maybe that's not fair for me to answer that you know what i mean but i would say yes and the reason is because what i was saying earlier people are happy that we're here to have another option you know i feel like we're making the we're making the more beautiful space so why would you feel like you wouldn't be able to answer that because i'm a bias right well i don't think that we have to deem people as bias there's a difference like you care about what you do so and you care a lot about again the movement kind of bit like it's more of an inspiration so i feel like even if you do feel like it went off well or being biased i guess it's your perspective you know you want what you're doing to be doing well you want what you're doing to like kick off and be successful and even if you have to have a little bit of delusion at the beginning that's how dreams come true so i mean you're making it happen you're here yeah yeah no i like that you're good you just told me you started off with little little barns everywhere now you know it's all come together you have a two-acre barn absolutely beautiful um you have a store so i would say that i think you're doing well if you want to unbiased opinion um okay so when you opened up pharmacy because you were just the sunlight garden developers right yeah um when you opened up pharmacy pharmacy was it a little bit of a challenge in the beginning because there was more responsibility it definitely was yeah and you know that's been an interesting part of this because like i i really just wanted to farm and grow food and that's kind of what i fell in love with in the beginning was yeah growing putting seeds in the dirt growing things and now i mean i really am in this role of being a ceo because i have different enterprises we do we have the farm going on we have events we have educational workforce development programs um going on we have the store and even the online as you know the online like the media we have we do youtube and things like that i was watching your youtube i've watched your youtube yeah when you're talking about the volunteers and i immediately thought of your one with the 100 volunteers versus one farmer yeah yeah yeah i went i did my research okay she does everything but um yeah so so yeah so you know all of these things like i was not i can tell you this i was not thinking about all that at the beginning right i think about let me grow some microgreens let me let me try to grow a collard green and this and that moving forward i've really just had to develop a lot of skills you know that i did not know i was going to need in the beginning so to answer your question like yeah this was a big learning curve and i'm still i'm still learning i'm still learning a lot you know being the shop people owning the store marketing people owning a store, marketing, you know, ordering, pricing things out, even just managing teams and people and things like that. It was a lot of it. I had to learn those skills. I think my passion and dedication is the fuel to just kind of make me fearless and willing to learn whatever skills I have to. Because sometimes I'm like, yo, this is too, this is over my head, right? Like, even I remember there was a point in time, like, I wasn't comfortable with being a leader. You know, I never necessarily looked at myself like that. I was just grown, you know, I'm Farber Vaughn, I'm Grostell, whatever. But as you said, it is a movement. And to get a movement in motion, you have to take all that leadership role. And you have to end, like, when we talk about the store, we talk about the enterprises that are within Sunlight Gardens. But the ability to connect with people and manage teams, I think is one of the most important skills, honestly. I think it's one of the most important skills because, I mean, first of all, if you can manage a good team, you can really do a lot of different types of projects. But there's an old, like, African proverb, it's like, if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. And I really believe that. I mean, there was times when I first bought the property before my volunteers came, or, well, employees now, I was like, I had that realization. I'm like, okay, I think I've got as far as I can by myself. And that was when I started to develop those skills of being a leader, forming teams, and, yeah, to push the movement forward. So I know that was a long way to answer that question. No, it's good, because that kind of goes into my next question. How does it feel, and is there pressure coming with being a community leader? That's a great question. I mean, I have a great question. You really do. You really do. I can tell. You can tell. I'm sorry. I like to know stuff. Yeah, this is dope. I think, and I'll be lying if I said there wasn't any pressure, but it's like, for me, it's a healthy pressure. It's a healthy pressure. Pressure makes nothing. Right? And so it's like, I think if I didn't have that pressure, I'll just be playing around and saying, I have the pressure of being the best that I can be to push the movement forward. But to be real with you, I still don't necessarily look at myself as like this community leader, and this and that. Like, I'm just doing what I feel called to do. And to be real with you, I'm having fun with everything I'm doing. Yeah. And that's at the core of it for me. Keeping things fun and flavorful. And that's the sustainability in it for me. Because I believe if you are, that's how you burn out. Right? And you're doing things for other people all the time. Yeah. And, you know, so it's a both end. Like, I do, I welcome the community leader aspect of what I do. But then at the same time, it's like, I'm doing this because I want it. Yeah. You know what I mean? And I don't let the pressure take me off of my course. That's good to be, yeah, definitely good to be under pressure sometimes. Some of us, that's when we perform the best. I know when I'm under pressure, I used to have the bad having school of, I don't want to say I procrastinated, but I knew that I would have better outcome work if I didn't, if I just sat and waited for before my time period, if that makes sense. For sure. So, like, when I knew, like, that time crunch was there, I don't know if I, like, if it was something innate with, like, oh, you know, you've got to get this stuff done. Like, I'm trying to think of a word. Essentially, like, adrenaline. Almost like adrenaline. It sometimes gets us to perform. I bet. For sure. So, a little bit of pressure is definitely good. So, farming definitely isn't easy. When you first started the farms, were there challenges that you had to face? Definitely, yeah. A lot of different challenges. I would say some of the bigger ones were actually animal and pest pressure. Being in an urban environment, like, if I were pretty here, like, we're urban, but we have a lot of, like, rural pockets. So, there tends to be a lot of fear, groundhog, rabbits, you know, and then not to mention, like, the worms and the bugs that can attack your crops, too. So, being a regenerative and organic grower, meaning, like, I don't use any pesticides, urban solids, things like that. I had to learn a lot of methods to get a good product. So, that was amazing. And it's kind of like, it's like a niche one, but there might be somebody that wants to grow or be a farmer and watch it. Like, that is something you really have to figure out because it's so discouraging if you grow a bunch of food, you know, you put all this time in the work in the earth, planting everything out. Next thing you know, everything gets wiped out overnight because a deer got in your fence, you know what I'm saying? Or a brown log, dug a tunnel, and ate all your stuff, right? So, yeah, that's a major one. Not being a farmer, like, learning everything. Learning how close to plant everything together. What grows well together. The seasonality of things. So, luckily, I had, like, I went to school. I went to Michigan State. They have an organic farmer training program. So, I got to go through that and learn a lot. And then there's also some really good books, like, Elliot Coleman. He wrote a book called The Organic Grower. The New Organic Grower. And that has a lot of really good, like, charts and references to teach you, like, okay, how far do you space things apart? What time of year do you bud this and that? And then, yeah, even, like, urban farming, like, some of the ordinances that you have to go through? Because you're in the city, you have to work with the city, right? So, I've had to, like, build relationships with the, it's not the city planning, but, like, basically, like, the zoning and the variances and everything. I had to build relationships with these people, and, you know, tell them what I'm trying to do until you're able to do all this kind of stuff. So, yeah, it was, it's a lot of different, unexpected challenges that you face, but it's just that it always seems impossible until it's done. Yeah. You know, you keep pushing at it, you'll figure a way out, but, yeah, it was a lot. So, is there any, like, specific examples of, like, the farming impacted where you kind of had to, like, get back on your feet? I mean, the animals is a big one. The animals is a big one. Like, I used to not know how to trap groundhogs and things like that. So, I mean, we would plant out, like, I remember the one where I had, like, a breaking point, a breakthrough was, like, we had planted an entire spring crop of collard greens, kale, and lettuce in the hoop house. And I remember planting everything. You know, it was a long day. Got all the plants in the ground. I was trying, like, a thousand-plus plants. Came back the next day. They had to eat everything. And destroy our whole crop. That we were planning on, you know, selling throughout the season. And before that, like, we said, like, I love nature, right? I don't want to kill stuff. I don't want to, you know what I mean? So, I would actually trap, I would live trap the groundhogs, which is much harder. Yeah. I really don't, now at this point, I don't recommend it. But I would live trap them and then, like, drive to whatever, Bellevue, like, forest, swamp area and let them out. When that happened, it got to a point where I was like, all right, I'm about to be, like, saving this wildlife and doing all this, or I'm going to grow food and have a business. Like, it was, like, one or the other because it just, it wasn't working. So, yeah, that was a big one. I remember something I'm still kind of going through is the deer. So, like, we need to build a deer fence around the whole property, which is an eight-foot fence behind. So, you build, like, a four-foot fence and then you build an eight-foot fence behind it. Oh, dang. That's technically illegal in the city. You're not supposed to have a fence that's higher than six feet. I had to go to a bunch of meetings, city council meetings, and basically get them to approve of barriers for this fence. And then figure out how to get the money for this is, like, a $15,000 fence to build. And so, I just remember, like, thankfully, I'm on the other side of that. Now I'm just, you know, kind of saving up funds to build it. But in the process of it, it was a lot of hooks I had to jump through for them to even accept it. And I remember it was, like, basically, I was at the mercy of the city commissioners to either vote to say, yeah, you can do this, or no, you cannot. Thankfully, we purchased this property from a nonprofit. So, they had some variances in place for us to even be able to do an agriculture year. So, that helped out a lot. But, yeah, going through that variance process is, like, it's a lot. It's a lot. It's a lot. That definitely seems complicated. And I haven't, like, had to do too much with the city, but I have said in on city council meetings before, for all of that. And I definitely see what people have to go through in certain meetings. So, yeah. And I bet that it's complicated because you're trying to do something for the community. And it's like, I've got to jump through all these schools to try to feed my community. Right. Like, come on. Like, be for real. Be some for real. You know what I mean? It's like, are you serious? So. If you've made it this far in this video, I would just like to give a big thank you. I am so excited and so very proud of how far my spotlight has come. So, don't forget to tune in to part two because this was a really long and inspirational and educational video.
