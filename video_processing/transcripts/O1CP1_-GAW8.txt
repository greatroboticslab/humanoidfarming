 What are the factors affecting the productivity of pastures? Persistence, which is the ability to survive and spread by vegetative means. Aggressiveness is the ability to compete aggressively with other weeds. This is another important factor affecting the productivity of pasture. Pasture must be able to resist trampling. Seed viability or profuseness or ease of propagation is another factor affecting productivity. The more viable the seed, the higher the spread and productivity. Resistence to drought and absence of pests and diseases are other important factors affecting the productivity of pasture. Good management and adequate stocking are important factors affecting the productivity of pasture. Hope you enjoyed this lesson. See you in the next one.ー
