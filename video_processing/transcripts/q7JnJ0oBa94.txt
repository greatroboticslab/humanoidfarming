 570 million farms around the world are facing the threat of climate change head-on. And yet we're demanding more from agriculture than ever before. More food for our growing population. Better incomes for those working across the food chain. And the careful management of our planet's soils and water resources. This is no easy task. How can our agriculture sector step up to this challenge? The answer? Climate Smart Agriculture. Climate Smart Agriculture aims to help find new ways to adapt and thrive under climate change. It's based on three interlinked goals. Increasing agricultural productivity and incomes sustainably and equitably. Helping food systems and farming livelihoods be more resilient. And minimizing agriculture's greenhouse gas emissions. Farms of every type and every size can become climate smarter. For example, by identifying and promoting sustainable farming practices and tools. Using inputs more efficiently and effectively to grow more from less. And building markets where farmers can access what they need and sell any surplus of what they produce. Climate change is a challenge to our food system. But it's also an opportunity for us to innovate and adapt. Easy to say, but harder to do. We must work together to become climate smarter. And to support the necessary technical policy and investment solutions that our farmers need. Climate change is actually affecting farmers in my region. In times you actually have rains when we are not expecting. We have droughts when we are not expecting. The pests, the new weeds, invasive species. We have observed the winters, that they are much longer than usual. Everyone says climate change affects their daily life, affect their crops, affect their production, affect their activities in agriculture especially. When you begin to suffer, you are seeing things going from bad to worse. You are bound to adapt. Producing, according to the climate change, is extremely important. And it's very important to have many records of what has happened in my field for the last 100 years. Farmers are finding ways of responding to climate change. Inter-cropping and multiple-cropping, companion planting, crop rotation. Swedish farmers, they try to do, try to use the best practices for everything. For animal husbandry, for manure system, for other things that you can do when it comes to climate change. This is what climate smart agriculture aims to achieve. 99,890 At 44,zedel.
