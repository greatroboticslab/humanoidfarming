 Have you ever wondered why when you buy a just a regular salad in a restaurant It tastes so much better than when we make it at home. Come with me. I'll show you what to do Use whatever you want in your salad and go ahead and toss it restaurants season their salad So you need to season yours. I'm using applewood smoked salt You can use Himalayan salt sea salt, but you just need a pinch and use your favorite seasonings. I'm using onion powder garlic powder Then give it a toss again This is before you put any dressing on it or anything You want to put just a tad bit of salt on it because salt brings out flavor Feel free to add black pepper if that's what you like as well then dress your salad however you would and enjoy Delicious and there you have it
