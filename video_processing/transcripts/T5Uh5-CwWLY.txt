Corn:  Row and Plant Spacing for Better Yield

 My name is Joe Lauer and I'm with the University of Wisconsin in the agronomy department. Today what I wanted to do is talk a little bit about the influence of row spacing and plant population on corn yield. Behind me I have a demo area looking at 15 and 30 inch row spacings at 30,000 to 45,000 plants per acre. One of the things that you'll see about this kind of a stand is that at 30,000 plants per acre, the row spacing or the plant spacing within a row is about 7 inches between the plants. The size ears that you see are typically right here. These are what I would call pretty good ears. Usually you want to have about a half inch to three quarters of an inch nose back on it and these ears are certainly fitting that bill for this particular year. But you can see that there's a lot of light that gets still down into the canopy. We used to grow corn a lot wider than this and as equipment changes and technology changes we've steadily started to decrease the row spacing. Probably as narrow as we can go at 30,000 plants to the acre is a row spacing that looks like this at 15 inches. Instead of plant spacings at 7 inches within the row, here we have plant spacings at 14 inches within the row. And with a row spacing of 15 inches, these plants are basically growing on a square grid pattern so that they have very little interplant competition that goes on. The competition is each plant has got basically equal access to the resources that are out there. In general what we see with these narrow row spacings is an increase in silage yield and usually an increase in grain yield. The increase is about 3.5% for grain and about 7% or so for silage. And it's very consistent on the silage side. The grain side is not quite so consistent. The year really affects how much grain yield you can get on 15 inch row spacing. But here's an example again of some of these ears. One ear is kind of small there but again very good nice size ears and again just good development. But one of the troubles with this is that you need often times specialized equipment to be able to get your equipment, especially tires, to get your equipment through the field. I'm not so sure 15 inches is the way to go. I think I would prefer 20 inches. But the idea is to get this equidistant spacing between the plants within the field. One of the changes that's been going on with corn production has been the tolerance of many of our modern hybrids to higher and higher plant populations. In Wisconsin we see the plant population that maximizes yield across many locations at about 38,000 plants per acre. If you want to look at the economic optimum though, that number is usually lower than the plant population that produces maximum yield. And that number comes in at about 34,000 to 35,000 plants per acre. But the point is that the optimum plant population has been increasing over time. And here is a field or here is a plot that has 30,000, 30 inch row spacing and 45,000 plants per acre. And you can see how small these ears are as well as how much nose back or tip dieback has occurred on those ears. They are a lot smaller than the ears we just previously saw. But there's a lot more of them. So the yield is probably going to be very similar between 45,000 and 30,000 plants to the acre. But in general over time we steadily increase the number of plants that are out there per acre. One of the real troubles though with this is that when we had 30,000 plants at 30 inches and 7 inches between the plants, now we've got the plants so closely packed that we're now at about somewhere between 4 and 5 inches between the plants. And as this plant spacing becomes tighter and tighter, the stalks change and they become narrower and you have increased lodging potential that can occur. So at some point at 30 inch row spacing we're going to reach an upper limit if you will of how close we can really put these plants as we try to increase plant population and take advantage of some of the better performance. One of the ways to do this is to go to 15 inch or narrower row spacing at these high plant populations. Here's a plot at 15 inch row spacing and 45,000 plants to the acre. The ears are again very similar in size and I would expect very similar yield. But being at such narrower row spacing, again each plant has got a little more equal access to resources and you don't nearly have the variability in ear size and shape that you would when plants are competing when they're spaced real tightly together. So I guess the point I wanted to make with this video is that these are just some examples of changing technology and how that management interacts with genetics to basically allow the yield march to continue with corn. Certainly we have better hybrids and more tolerant hybrids today than we did 20 years ago. But what goes hand in hand with this is also the narrower row spacing, the equipment changes that go on to allow us to be able to keep moving forward the corn yield levels that we enjoy. Alright. Alright. Thank you. Bye.
