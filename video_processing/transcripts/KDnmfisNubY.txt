 Ego 2100 PSI pressure washer. Oh, and this is just my favorite little tool on the planet. Let's go. Let's see what's in here. Here's everything. On the tool bench. Bench warmers. I'm not a pro. I just push it to the test. Underfoot holes. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Nice push. Hose plugs right in the side. Battery loads in the front. Let's go. 25-foot holes that comes with the unit. It's got some side lads. I got mud everywhere. Gotta clean it up. Got a little pick to it. Attachment. Turbo speed. Bench warmers. Not a pro. I'm gonna go. Bye. Bye. Bye.
