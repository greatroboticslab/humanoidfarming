 We are thrilled to have you back on our channel today as we continue our deep dive into the complex and interesting world of cherry farming. We will cover everything from planting to harvesting and processing this iconic fruit, which is loved for its vibrant colours, delicious flavours and exceptional nutritional value. Cherries are considered a valuable fruit. Come and explore the fascinating world of cherry cultivation with us as we delve into the science, technology and care that goes into this remarkable fruit. Cherries thrive in areas with mild climates and rich soil. And the United States happens to be one of the top countries in the world for producing cherries. States like Washington and Michigan are prime examples of this. Soil preparation is an important first step in growing cherries. In areas like Oregon and California, where winters are cold and summers are warm, the soil is rich with nutrients and should be loose and well-drained. Before planting, farmers will often add organic fertilisers or decomposed manure to make the soil more fertile, laying a good foundation for the trees. If the soil pH is too low, they will add a line to bring it up to an ideal level, creating ideal conditions for tree growth. When the weather is mild and the soil holds enough moisture, cherry trees are usually planted in the spring or fall and needs meticulous preparation. Roots may spread out easily and leaves and branches can absorb more sunshine with less effort when plants are spaced four to six metres apart, depending on the species. The modern cherry planting procedure now incorporates specialised machinery. By using cutting-edge GPS technology, cherry planting machines can pinpoint exactly where to plant trees and then distribute them evenly around the orchard, resulting in perfectly spaced trees. Using this technology not only improves agricultural quality and productivity, but it also creates ideal circumstances for tree development. Pruning is a crucial and well-organised part of cherry tree care. It's best done in the late winter or early spring, when the tree is dormant, but before it starts budding. By removing unhealthy overlapping branches, you can make sure the tree gets enough light and air, and you can also boost the fruit quality, protect it from diseases, and make it more resistant to bad weather. Not only are cherry blossoms beautiful to look at, they usually bloom around March or April, depending on the kind and locale, but they also mark an important step in pollination, which is necessary for fruit growth. After pollination, young cherries undergo a remarkable transformation over the next 40 to 90 days, starting off small and green. Bees perform a crucial role in transferring pollen between blooms, enabling their growth. As time goes on, the fruit's colour changes from yellow to pink to a dazzling red. The cherries will be ready for harvest when their colour changes. To get the highest quality fruit, you need to be very careful and precise when harvesting. Cherry picking is an intricate fusion of art and science that demands precision and care at every step. Each cherry is handpicked to keep the stem intact, which increases its commercial value and extends its shelf life. Pickers must be careful not to bruise or otherwise harm the ripe, plump cherry they harvest. The precise care that is inherent in modern agricultural operations in huge orchards is reflected in this process, which not only guarantees the finest quality, but also reflects it. Utilising GPS technology and sophisticated sensors, modern machinery optimises the cherry harvesting process by determining when the fruit is ripe. This ensures that only cherries that satisfy the standards are harvested. And picked at a rate of up to 20 tonnes hour, using a delicate shaking mechanism to remove the fruit from the trees at great speed. Conveyor systems efficiently gather cherries while being cautious to minimise damage. Some machines are even integrated with preliminary filtering systems that remove leaves and small branches during the harvesting process. The fully automated process enhances productivity and ensures the cherries meet the highest quality standards before reaching the market. After harvesting, cherries are quickly transported to processing facilities to maintain their freshness and optimal quality. The first step involves washing the fruit with an automated system using clean water combined with a mild cleaning agent to remove dirt, bacteria and impurities without damaging the delicate skin. Next, the cherries are dried to remove surface moisture, preventing mould and keeping the fruit in the best condition during storage and transportation. Afterward, cherries are sorted using modern machinery equipped with sensor technology and 3D scanning enabling precise evaluation of each cherry based on size, colour, sheen and even the smallest imperfections. This process ensures that only cherries, meeting the highest standards of quality and aesthetics, proceed to the next step stage. At the same time, the system automates the sorting process, enhancing efficiency and minimising errors during handling standard grade. Cherries are packaged in temperature controlled environments to preserve their freshness. Cherries are packaged in temperature, and the most important things to use. Cherries are packaged in temperature, and the most important things to use. Cherries are prepared for shipment to faraway markets, thanks to specialist packaging that prevents physical damage and increases the fruit's shelf life during transit. Moreover, cherries go into making a wide array of delicious items such as canned cherries. Cherries are packaged in temperature, and the most important things to use. Cherry bearers are a nutrient-rich superfood that is both a tasty treat and a nutrient-rich commodity in the food and international trade industries. They are packed with antioxidants, vitamin C, potassium and vitamin A. And they are also used as an ingredient in desserts and premium beverages. These products help preserve the unique flavour of cherries and make them last longer, appealing to consumers' diverse tastes. Cherries have several positive effects on health, such as lowering inflammation, enhancing sleep quality and bolstering cardiovascular health. In 2023, the cherry industry reached new heights, with the US cultivating around 37,000 hectares and producing 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes of cherries per year.
