 Some plants do better when you seed them directly in ground. First week of April is usually the time when we start growing outdoors again. And vegetables like carrots, turnip, radish, and spinach prefer the cooler weather so these can be started early. And this is how we grow these vegetables from seed. If the soil is no longer frozen it's a good sign that you can start growing. To start we apply one to two inch layer of compost. This part isn't necessary but I like to do it anyways because it makes planting easier. By compacting the soil and using a stick I'm able to create the right distance per row. And this also gives me the perfect depth to plant the seeds. And we space each seed about one to two inch apart. Tapping on the soil actually lightly covers the seeds. We ended up collecting melted snow so we're using that to give the seeds a good watering. It's still a little bit cold outside so we do need to protect our garden bed. And we're using a simple hoop and plastic cover. So a combination of cool crop and cover will help extend your season.
