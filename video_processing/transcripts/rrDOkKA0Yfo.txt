 Welcome to the Sustainable Living Podcast, tips, tools, and tactics for living a heart-centered life that honors Mother Earth and her inhabitants. The information shared on the Sustainable Living Podcast reflects the opinions of host Marian West, Janice Fryant, and their guests. Please use your own discretion and research before applying any information to your individual situation. Now, here are your hosts, Marian and Janice. Welcome to the podcast, everyone. I'm Janice Fryant, and today I'm excited to have as my guest Rob Herring, who is going to be talking about a very interesting film that he has been working on. Rob is an activist, filmmaker, musician, and the co-founder of Earth Conscious Films. He directed and produced the award-winning indie comedy Nothing in Los Angeles and worked on GMO-OMG, which won the Environmental Media Award for Best Documentary. As a musician, his protest songs for health and eco-activism have been featured by popular groups like Organic Consumers Association, the Food Revolution Network, and Mercola.com. Along with Ryan Weirich, he is the co-director of the upcoming documentary, The Need to Grow. Welcome, Rob. Thank you so much for having me, Janice. It's a pleasure to be here. Well, I'm so glad that you could. Just to let everybody know, I learned about Rob's project from my teacher and his son from the Permaculture Academy, Larry Santoyo and Elijah Santoyo, who I have great respect for. And they sent me a little trailer of your film, Rob, and I was blown away. How great. Yeah, so much great information and so well put together from the trailer. Thank you. Yeah, Larry and Elijah have become friends over the course of this production. So anybody who knows them knows the incredible work that they're doing, and we're happy to have them as part of this film. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you know, when they back something, I think a lot of people pay attention. So to start off with, could you share your story? What brought you to where you are now? Yeah, so when I – the way that I got into what I'm doing today, I think – well, I can backtrack to initially I had no awareness of the food system or what I was eating or what I was eating or I wasn't really an environmentally conscious kid. I didn't have a lot of that passion at a young age. It was in college that I started looking into the nutrition and health system and kind of went down the rabbit hole of maybe some corruption within those models. And it kind of opened my eyes to a lot of the overlap between human health and environmental health. And they really do go hand in hand, and I believe that even more today than I ever have. And I was going to school for acting at NYU, and I did that for a few years after school. And I also got more and more involved in nutrition, and so I went – attended the Institute for Integrative Nutrition and tried to just educate myself on as many different dietary theories and never really believed in a black-and-white approach to it and loved the philosophy at that school, which was about bio-individuality. And over time, as I was working in film or TV or theater in Los Angeles, I just kind of – I kept feeling the call to help raise awareness about these issues. And I wrote a song because I was a musician as well in New York, and I hadn't written music in a while. And I wrote a song about genetically modified foods, which at the time no one really knew what they were. It was very early in America's, I think, awakening to paying attention to that topic. And some people that were already passionate in the movement loved the work that I was doing, and we started kind of helping to get that message out there as much as we could in California in a big way. And eventually we got it on the ballot to try to label genetically modified foods. We were unfortunately unsuccessful here. But as of now, I think 30 states have similarly introduced legislation to try to label genetically modified foods because we believe people have the right to know what's in their food. And a few states have passed it. And yeah, it all kind of started here in California, and we're proud to have worked on that. And we've had a lot more success in the market recently. And as big companies have decided to remove genetically modified foods from their products. Anyway, as I was involved in that community, I met up with a filmmaker named Jeremy Seifert who made a film called Gmo OMG, which I was proud to be a little part of. And that film was available now on Netflix and elsewhere. I highly recommend you check it out. And I ended up directing another film with a friend. And that kind of gave me the confidence to do what I'm doing now, which is working on a film mostly about solutions. And because of the other movie that I directed called Nothing in Los Angeles, one of my – what is my now co-director, Ryan Weirich, happened to see that movie and approached me about working on a film together. And it all kind of went from there. What was Nothing in Los Angeles about? So yeah, that had nothing to do with environmental issues whatsoever. That was purely a romantic comedy inspired by Woody Allen type of humor, Larry David Seinfeld-ish. And it did well in the indie film festival circuit. But yeah, it's very different than what I'm working on today. That's for sure. And so Ryan found you through that film? Yeah, I think we were both located in Southern California and had heard of each other. Because when we were both involved, I don't think there were a lot of young people really into it yet. And I know he had come across some of my work from some of the videos and songs that I put out there. And I had actually heard his name as this filmmaker that I needed to meet. And we never – that never led to anything. We never met each other at that point. Just by coincidence, we became Facebook friends because I think we had common friends from people that were involved in that movement. And when I was releasing the other film, I just promoted the heck out of it on Facebook. And this guy saw it and said, hey, I want to go up and see what this guy's working on. And yeah, our entire – it's crazy because to this – now he's certainly my best friend. We've been working tirelessly on this project for about three years. And it is entirely – our relationship has entirely been about creating this film. Wow. So when you guys got together, could you maybe walk me a little bit through the kinds of conversations that you had that led you to this particular film? Yeah, definitely. So I think we – what clicked with us so strongly was our – we were maybe seeing the frustration that was in the communities that we were involved in with health and environmental activism, which a lot of people were angry, rightfully so, frustrated, and maybe feeling overwhelmed. It's kind of a David and Goliath situation with a lot of these big interests, big money interests. And we had seen a lot of these documentaries that people loved, people shared. It's informative. They have done an incredible job raising awareness of the issues. But we felt that people would be depressed at the end of watching them. And maybe in the last five minutes of those films, they would say, oh, here's what you can do. And a lot of it had to do with call your congressman or sign a petition, which are big parts of what you can do. We need that as well. But we wanted to look at what was missing from the landscape of documentary that we were seeing, which we thought was a focus on solutions. And we – instead of a 95% problem-driven film with maybe 5% at the end talking about what you can do, we posed ourselves the question, can we flip that? And would that work as a film? We didn't really even know if that was a good idea or not because there's something compelling about fear. And it gets people in the seats and it gets people talking. But it also gets them overwhelmed a lot of times. Exactly. Yeah, and that's what we felt. And we had a lot of friends who had worked on legislation and going through the proper channels to try to get bills passed. And some people were working on things for 5, 10 years and were unsuccessful. And they would just be burnt out. And that work still needs to be done because a lot of times it can take a really long time and eventually we see the progress. But we wanted to look at maybe skipping the middleman in a way. And what can be done right now in your community and on the local level is that where we need to focus more of our energy. And I think in the wake of recent political twists and turns, even more so than ever, we need to look at what we can be doing on the state level and on the community level. What solutions can you be a part of? What powers do we have at our fingertips to make a change that might seem small but can ripple out? Maybe beyond our awareness of how powerful it can ripple out. But we wanted to focus on that and kind of look for the inspiring examples of it. And so we decided, you know, what elements haven't we really seen in a film? And can we search the country for those stories? And we ultimately wanted it to be story-driven and not just purely expert interviews. So that's a lot of unknowns when you start a project like that because you have to kind of follow instincts a lot and see what's out there and not really know what your film is going to be. Wow. Yeah, that's taking a risk, isn't it? Exactly. Yeah, certainly. Yeah, you can – and we probably wouldn't do it exactly how we did this time on the next project because maybe there were too many unknowns for us when we began. But as a lot of documentary filmmakers would advise us, you know, is that you have to be open-minded to the film writing itself as you go. That may be more specific to films that are not environmentally driven. I think a lot of, you know, pieces that just have to do with character studies or about other social issues, maybe you can historically allow for those things to unfold for you and follow these characters around. In the environmental film world, we hadn't really seen that done a lot. And so it was a big risk to see, is there going to be a story here? You know, I mean, we can find people that are doing great things, but is that really going to unfold into something that we can follow for a year or two or what ended up becoming three years for us? You know what, I just want to interject because to me what you're describing, I studied journalism years ago, and that sounds like journalism to me. Yeah, exactly. When you come in without any preconceived notions, really, you just want to, you know, kind of interview people and let them inform you and let them tell their story. Yeah. Without, you know, you didn't have, it sounds like you didn't have the ending in mind when you first started. Am I right? Yeah, exactly. You know, with a film and a budget and traveling and all those things, you have to have a balance of, you know, having targets and trying to aim as best you can and allowing for change along the way, for sure. But, yeah, we just wanted to see what was out there in the country. And, you know, it started in just Southern California, and we were lucky to get a little bit of money to travel. And, you know, we just, we said, what's out there? What's going on in urban agriculture? And that's kind of where it started was urban agriculture and seeing different new technologies to grow food with fewer resources. So we wanted to hit as many major cities in the country as we could. And from there, it just, you know, one thing led to another. We would meet people that would say, oh, you got to see what this guy's doing. You got to check out this woman's project down here. You got to go connect with that organization. And so you can't do everything. And you have to kind of, like I said, use instinct and feel it out. But I think what we ended up settling on is a really well-rounded set of stories that is a holistic look at the food system. Certainly unlike any film that I've seen. And it doesn't cover everything. You know, we knew that that's impossible. So we were trying to just cover things that we hadn't seen exactly done before. Well, and that brings us to the fact that you mentioned at the very beginning, which is mostly when we get information about environmental issues, it is all negative stuff. And which is, you know, it's understandable. We're surrounded. This is what the reality of our world is. However, you know, I know I've always been very nature and environmentally conscious. But, you know, I tell you, I will lots of times skip those documentaries because it just makes you feel really icky. And there's no, you know, there aren't a lot of solutions. They don't show you the solutions. And the more that I talk to people and really the big reason why we started to do this podcast was because we wanted to share the solutions that are happening. Yeah, there's a lot of bad stuff, but there is a lot of good stuff that's happening out there. And most people are not aware. We just only know about the bad stuff. Yep. Yeah, I'll say that, you know, I've certainly got friends who are very intelligent and do pay attention to what's going on. And even a few films that have come out recently, they've said, you know, I just don't need to, I don't really want to spend a night doing that, watching a film like that. And, yeah, the tricky part is how do you make a film as compelling, like we said, and not just purely an educational film. We hope that our film can play in classrooms, but it's not designed to specifically be, you know, like a textbook film only. We want there to be an actual story. And what was really interesting was to see how much great work was going on. Of course, we would assume that to some degree, but actually getting out there and traveling. And it was just so many organizations and so many people working on the solutions. Yeah. That was really inspiring. Right. And the thing is, it's interesting. I mean, like you were already kind of on that circuit, aware of these environmental issues, and obviously working on the GMO labeling campaign here in California. And even someone such as yourself, who's right in the middle of it, is not seeing these solutions because they're not being shared and presented where lots of people can see them. You know, from my perspective, it's like it's really hard to get to that wonderful future if you cannot envision it. Yes, exactly. And I think a lot of people are having a problem envisioning it. So I really commend you for making a film that shows these solutions. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah, I think some people might, you know, hear about things that are solution focused. But I think it's more of a big picture of just how much energy we put into raising awareness about the issues. And we always looked at it like there's all these people marching against this or that or this company or whatever it may be. And we just kind of thought, you know, look at all that energy. I mean, what if we took those hundreds or thousands of people that were just in that one city on that march and, you know, we did a project? What, you know, what would that do? We don't want to lose protests. I mean, of course we need that. But it was just an interesting question we were posing of, you know, if we took 50 of these people and, you know, tried to build a school garden, you know, how long would that take and what effects would that have? Or, you know, if we were educating people on – if we were marching for what everyone could do in their own kitchen with their food waste, you know, and we had more media attention on something like that. We certainly can't get solutions without everybody talking about them. So there's only good that can be done by having conversations about these things. So, you know, we hope to inspire people. Well, could you share a little bit about some of the solutions and also the stories and the people that you came across along the way? Definitely. So when we started, you know, we – there's so many elements to this, which in the beginning it's awareness at a young age we thought was really important. You know, getting people to pay attention when they're young to the food system might create – even if it's a nostalgia later in life of being in a garden when they were a kid, they're going to have a different appreciation for that. Seeing natural systems, being aware of how ecosystems actually work and a lot of kids don't realize that their food – that food doesn't just come from a store, for instance, you know, that it actually does grow in the ground. You know, simple things like that that we might take for granted. You know, how much are we really exposing our youth to that? And – but actually getting them involved, getting their hands dirty because when kids grow their own food, they appreciate it. And foods that they might not try otherwise, they – they're so willing because they had a part in it. And there's ownership and there's pride with that. So, school gardens and school programs are really important. Of course, that doesn't solve everything. So, how do we increase or incentivize or enable urban agriculture? Getting food more locally because that was a big issue, which was, you know, our food, the average bite of food is coming from 1,500 miles away. And so, what does that actually mean for the food? We can throw out that number, but what does that mean? That means that the food is picked ahead of time before it's ripe because it's tried – you know, they're assuming that it'll ripen on the way. It'll sit in grocery store shelves for another few days. So, this food isn't fresh and what does that actually mean for the nutrition? So, we have this awareness of organic and the organic food movement, which is incredible, you know, pesticide-free, toxin-free. But is – I think what we're missing is this awareness of freshness and the importance of that and nutrition in the food. So, just being free of pesticides doesn't mean that you have necessarily an incredibly fresh, nutritious product. You know, what is the mineral density and the antioxidant load in this food? So, the closer that you eat food to freshness, the more antioxidant properties you're going to get. That's just the way the nature intended. You know, eat it right out of the ground, eat it right off the tree. And so, how do we decrease that time between picking the food and getting it to you? So, there's a bunch of ways to do that on many different scales and really the ultimate way is to grow your own food. Now, not everybody is going to grow all of their own food. In fact, that's very hard to do, to grow all of your own food. But – so, it's a – what we found is that's a nice idea. But, you know, we look at it as, you know, solutions that are in steps and we have to start at the simpler ones and work our way out. But having that – having something that you grow at home is going to make you appreciate that. And it's going to, in some way, offset, you know, all the negative impacts of food that we've grown otherwise. It's because we have, you know, the carbon footprint of the transportation. We might have the waste and water usage depending on how the food is grown. And then, again, the lack of nutrition. So, bringing food closer to people is definitely a big part of it. So, local – you know, that local food mentality. It's never – like I said, it's never going to be all or nothing. It has to be how do we get more and more in that direction. And then as we looked at that, you know, we looked at systems that grow food with a lot fewer resources. So, whether it's hydroponics or aquaponics, which are systems that grow food without soil, where there's nutrients in the water. Aquaponics is a version of hydroponics, which includes fish in the system, which the fish waste creates a full ecosystem along with bacteria, beneficial bacteria, to convert fish waste into plant food. And the plants, in turn, clean the water for the fish. So, those systems can save up to 95 or more percent water. Some systems, as much as 98, 99 percent water is being saved compared to conventionally grown food. In California, that's a big deal. It's a very big deal here. So, and in a lot of places around the world, that's a huge deal as well. So, that can localize food. Indoor farming, you know, a lot of these things can have pros and cons. And it depends. It's not, you know, every hydroponic system or every aquaponic system is great or that every one of them is terrible. They all have to, there's factors, you know, and you have to look at the needs assessment of an area versus, you know, what resources are available and kind of weigh the benefits to having local food. Well, and now you interviewed quite a few people that are doing these kinds of things. Can you share a little bit about them and their stories? Yeah. So, first we looked at a, actually, Larry Santoyo is a permaculture designer. He was one of the first people that Ryan connected with early on. He runs the Permaculture Academy of Los Angeles. And for those that don't know what permaculture is, it's basically a system of design principles based off of the observation of nature and natural systems and ecosystems and how we can observe the energy flow and the resource use and the closed loop, the cycling of resources in nature and how can we apply that back to all things. Right. It's a system of design. And it's something that can be applied to anything, not just agriculture. It's a beautiful system. Exactly. And I'm really grateful that I got to learn about it from Larry Santoyo. Yeah, it's very cool. And I think it's on the rise. People are starting to hear about it more and more. And it is often associated with gardening and growing food. But like you said, it's much bigger than that. And Larry does a great job of explaining how it can apply to other models and from everything to relationships to business and so forth. So in the beginning, we were looking at things locally. We connected with a young girl named Alicia Serratos, who is a young GMO activist. And we had heard about her before we started making the film because we were involved in that. We didn't want to make a film only about genetically modified foods. We wanted to kind of look beyond that and prove solutions that just kind of make genetically modified foods obsolete. You know, we were kind of tired of the division of are you pro this or anti that? And we weren't really seeing people budge a lot on their opinions. So we wanted to kind of introduce solutions where even pro GMO supporters would realize that maybe that we just don't actually need it. Whether or not you might think that it does this or that, we may not actually just need that right now because there are other things that do it better and more productively. So she was really interesting to us because she was so young and she actually started a petition to get genetically modified foods out of Girl Scout cookies. She's a Girl Scout herself. Her mom is a Girl Scout troop leader. And really on her own volition, she wanted to start this petition. And they started getting tens of thousands of signatures. And her journey to try to work on that issue is very interesting. And as a young person, incredibly inspiring. How old is she? She might be nine or ten now when she started. I think she was six. Wow. So, yeah, it's very cool. And it's really – she really authentically wants to help people. And it shines through with everything that she does, not just about the food movement. So she ultimately, along with her mom and a few teachers at her school, her elementary school, who her teachers actually had taken a permaculture design course as well. So it's getting back to, like, the interconnectivity of a lot of these things. They did start a school garden at their school. And we witnessed that process and documented that and how – it's a great example of what can be done. And beyond that, she works on seed libraries. And the seed and – seed extinction that's been going on is an issue that maybe not a lot of people know about. There's a great film that just came out, Seed, the Untold Story, is another documentary that really shines a light on the number of seed varieties that we've lost in the last century. And I highly recommend you see that because the biodiversity of our food system is so important to its resilience and true food security. Yeah, and that is something related to GMOs, if I understand the issue correctly. Because some of these companies just don't want to have heirloom seeds available. They want to have all control over all the seeds, and that's part of the agenda with GMOs. Am I right? That very well looks like it would help their business model. So I think that's safe to assume. Yeah. So some places have made it harder than others to save seeds even. But as a simple act that's been done for tens of thousands of years, we – or maybe longer, but I believe roughly tens of thousands of years. We can do that in our hometown, and we can help create varieties of these foods that are adapted to different growing regions. So as we continue to localize food even more, the plants will actually – they will adapt, and they will grow better. And there's a lot of people doing great work on how we can identify the ones that are doing really well and grow more of those and select seeds and try out new foods. And you can try varieties of things you didn't even know exist. I think a lot of people are very limited in their scope of what foods there actually are because we only see one version of this or that. Right. We see the kinds of foods that are really easier to produce and sell in a supermarket. And there's so much beyond that that could really add to our nutrition in our daily meals. So yeah, that's a big deal. So Alicia is another – she's a critical story. Now, the really cool thing is how our film sort of – certain characters sort of led to one another or they overlapped or there were connections that we didn't even envision would happen. And we loved that as a metaphor because we believe that a big part of the success of this movement is the interconnectivity and relying on connections that we have with other organizations and kind of coming together instead of sort of siloing all of our – Yeah. Could you give a few examples of that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Alicia, she was going on – she was going on farm tours. Alicia's mom, Monica, who was the Girl Scout troop leader, has been doing some incredible stuff with her troop by exposing them to farms and different ways to grow food. And so she ended up checking out a farm called Allegria Fresh, which is run by a guy named Eric Cutter. And it amazed us what was going on at this farm. It grows way more food than you would ever grow on that size land using a few alternative techniques. I think 70% less water and 50% fewer fertilizer resources. And he's growing incredibly nutrient-dense food in such a small space and providing this food really fresh to people in the area in Orange County of California. Yeah. And when we tried some of that food – and since then, we've visited so many farms around the country. And I still think that his food is some of the best I've ever had in my life because you eat that stuff right out of the ground and you feel it. Wow. You really do feel the difference and taste the difference. I mean when you bite into celery right out of the ground that was grown with real mineral profile and nutrient density in great soil, you can really tell the difference because that's not where we're getting most of our food from. It's not optimized. So that was a connection. Eric ended up leading us to another huge part of our film, which was in Montana, believe it or not. So Eric was using a fertilizer on his – an organic liquid fertilizer on some of his plants and seeing incredible results. And he tried everything out there. And he was just astounded by the results and he wanted to go and see where this was coming from. And we looked it up and we saw that it was in Montana. And Eric wanted to go out there and see what it was for himself because it's produced in a very unique system in a building that looks like a pyramid spaceship actually in the middle of Montana. Really? It's in a pyramid? Yeah. We were all very intrigued by what the heck this was. Wow. When Eric decided to go to Montana, that was one of those filmmaker moments of, wow, well, I think something's telling us that we are supposed to go there. And so we – within an hour, I think, of finding out that Eric was flying there, we bought our tickets and followed. And I can't believe what the film would be if we hadn't pulled the trigger on that decision because it ended up becoming possibly the largest story of our film. And it's a really cool – something called the Green Powerhouse. And basically it turns waste into waste products that would otherwise go into landfill and create carbon dioxide and methane and emit greenhouse gases. We can divert waste into systems like these and we can create soil amendments as well as energy. And so they were creating organic fertilizers and something called biochar, which is incredible potential for helping to restore soil structure and return life to the soil and microbial ecosystems back to the soil. You can make a whole movie about biochar actually. It's really cool. I recommend people check that out if they haven't heard about it. So at the same time, this system, yeah, you rolled up to it and it's a pyramid. It looks – it literally looks like a spaceship. And we were like, what's going on here? And the more that we found out about it, we saw that it was this entire closed-loop system. A lot of people are doing certain elements that are part of it, which include biodigestion, paralysis to create biochar and there's an algae component. And a lot of people are doing elements of that. But this man, Michael Smith, had integrated them together in a way that I don't think exists anywhere in the world. And he's doing it – is it like a – is it like a – this pyramid, like a greenhouse that he grows all the stuff? Wow. There's a lot to it. I just have to ask. I mean, I'm really fascinated by the fact that somebody is finally using a pyramid structure to grow. I never heard about this, but I am somewhat familiar with, you know, pyramid technology and the – you know, just from watching David Wilcock and some of these other people on TV that really kind of research the physics that are involved whenever you make a pyramid. Really? Did he share a little bit about that in his own? Yeah, very much. Yeah, so I want to give you a little bit of background about this guy, Michael Smith, because it's very interesting. He started in computer science and physics and some of his early inventions involved were used by the animation industry. Some of the earliest 3D animation technologies ever. And they were since adapted and evolved into, I think, a lot of things that we see used today. And he spent a lot of time working in audio signal processing and, you know, companies they worked for were digitizing the Beatles for the first time ever and Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. And he then – he ended up working in computer science and AI development for video games. And so he was kind of creating the ways in which these random characters in video games would interact with one another to either help you or prevent you from doing something as the video game player. And he was looking at these systems that he was creating and thinking, you know, is there a better application for this than, you know, teaching kids, you know, how to steal a car in a video game or shoot each other. So where can we apply this elsewhere? And what he looked at was how do I make elements in an ecosystem as video game players and try to optimize them and have them communicate with each other. This is not the kind of AI that you would think of like a robot talking to you or like Terminator technology. This is merely a way to read based off of different indicators and feedback loops and then have that mathematically optimized. And maybe somebody is processing nitrogen in this part of the system or carbon over here. And who would most benefit from that at that moment? And then they can kind of talk to each other in a way and really optimize for incredible efficiency. So within the pyramid, it was never about, you know, his love of sacred geometry. It was about literally optimizing the airflow and the flow of nutrients and energy. And so inside of this pyramid, it's really weird. There was a movie called Biodome. It's also kind of when he opens up the doors to that pyramid, it's like and he even says, welcome to Jurassic Park. It really feels like you're entering Willy Wonka world or something because it's in the middle of Montana. It'll get up to negative 20 degrees outside in the winter. And inside it'll maintain a perfect tropical environment of 78 degrees with perfect humidity to the point where they can literally grow bananas and pineapples. Wow. Which I don't know of anything like that. So this inside of pyramid could be used as a vertical growing space. It's really about growing algae and how that's useful for an organic fertilizer and how the algae actually works as a carbon sink to sequester some of the carbon from the biochar. So it's a totally off-grid system. It produces enough electricity to not only power itself but up to 100 homes, maybe more. So when we heard that, it was like, wow, this could really go anywhere, virtually anywhere in the world in very extreme areas. And with just what would otherwise be going to landfill, it could run itself and create soil amendments, organic fertilizers, electricity to power a community, and space to grow food optimized. So it's really a cool solution and we hope it gets out there in a big way. We're honored to kind of help share that story. Oh, yeah. I can't wait to see that. That sounds fascinating. Yeah. Cool. And then there's other stuff in Boston and in New York that we filmed with and some other really cool solutions there. I don't know if you want to get into all of them. I could talk for hours about each and every one of them. There's a lot to discuss. Oh, wow. Well, yeah. I mean we are getting up there in time, so I don't want to take your whole day. But, wow, it sounds like a very powerful film and definitely of interest to the people who listen to this podcast. So just quickly, what are some things besides what you've already said, if there's anything that sticks out that you learned that you didn't know before? Yeah. I think when we started the film in the beginning, we weren't really paying attention to the importance of soil. So very early into our process, we came across some statistics about the UN having estimated that we have only 60 years left of farmable topsoil on the planet. So what does that mean? That means that we're destroying soil and we're not replenishing it fast enough. So there are ways geologically that soil is created that can take thousands of years, but in farming and using organic matter and replacing nutrients, you can regenerate soil fairly quickly. But you have to be paying attention to the ecology of the soil. And so our film really evolved into looking at soil and seeing the multitude of solutions that come out of it. So we didn't realize that by increasing the organic matter of soil by only 1%, you're going to hold 25,000 gallons of water in an acre. So if you look at California, for instance, where most of our drought issues are because of farming, if we were able to increase the organic matter just by a little bit, the amount of water that would be stored in the soil is astronomical. And therefore, you're not having to add more water and it's more efficient. It's incredible. And it's such a simple solution. Yeah, it really is. You know, it's generally not something that a lot of people make money off of. And I think that may be part of the reason why it hasn't taken off. But that's one thing I came away with from Larry's class was, you know, people that are really good at growing stuff are not really in the business of growing stuff. They're in the business of managing the soil. Right, exactly. And we have to look at it in that way and that food is a byproduct of managing soil well. And, you know, it's really the lack of awareness of the biology of soil. And we realize that, you know, dirt is dirt. It sounds dirty. It's not interesting to people. It's certainly not sexy or inviting. Soil is very different than dirt. You know, dirt is lifeless. And soil has up to six billion microbes in a tablespoon. So we're talking about, like, the same number of people, roughly, that are on the planet in a little tablespoon. So what's going on there? Yeah, it's really small. But that doesn't mean that, you know, it's any less significant. In fact, I think the entire life system of the planet revolves around our soil systems. Oh, completely. And protect them. Yeah. And from a personal level, you can see something very similar in your own, you know, biotic. Microbiome. Microbiome. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So it's a total, yeah, there's a total reflection there with the Earth's, you know, microbiology and our own gut bacteria, which is another, you know, thing that people don't realize, that there's so many little living creatures, hopefully most of them beneficial if you're eating correctly. You know, we're outnumbered in our own body, 10 to 1, by the bacteria that's in our gut. That's kind of a hard thing for people to wrap their mind around. The number of human cells is one-tenth of the number of these other creatures that are, you know, helping us to digest our food or move nutrients through our body but protect our immune system particularly. Right. We're mostly bacteria. Yeah. You know, we have to honor that and realize it's really about balancing the beneficial with the non-beneficial. Yeah. You know, instead of just wiping out, you know, all those terrible, you know, microbes and germs, oh, we can't have those. Well, if we get rid of those, we don't have life. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, I think in a weird way, I've always looked at, you know, if we are really these walking vessels of all of these, trillions of microbes, you know, maybe it's a way for us to realize that the earth itself is one organism. You know, we think of ourselves as one organism. That's easy for us to identify, even though there's so much going on with all these other creatures inside of us. But maybe that can help us to realize that the earth, even with, you know, almost 7 billion people, or maybe we've passed that by now, it is one thing, you know, it is one organism. There is, when you look at it from space, you know, you can see it breathing. You can see it alive. And we need to, I think, you know, look at, obviously, the impact that we're having. And I want there to be more attention to the food system. There's a lot of people that see energy, and we talk about sustainable energy, energy, and we forget the fact that food is energy. And food is, is it even our most, the highest necessity of energy that there is? You know, that's the one that we need more than any of the others if we want to survive, right? So how do we clean up that energy system? How do we start to see that as, as just as important or even more important, and create sustainable systems around that energy? Because it is, the agriculture system is the most destructive system on the planet, and it is, currently, it's just unaware or, or ignorant to the life in soils. And that's, that's a big part of it. Like, we could argue about different ways to grow food all day, but I don't think that there's any argument in that the philosophy of conventional chemical agriculture is detrimental to the biology in our soils. Yeah, and so, That can be proven. Yeah, and you've hit the nail on the head of exactly why, a message like what you're trying to bring out in your film, which, by the way, again, to remind everybody, it's called, A Need to Grow. The Need to Grow, yeah. Yeah, you can check it out at theneedtogrow.com, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, all of those are at the need to grow, Instagram, at the need to grow. And then we're, this, just for a few more weeks, we're, we're finishing a Kickstarter, to try to get to a goal to finish our post-production. So if this is something that interests you, I really hope that anybody can go and actually watch the footage. I've heard enough of me rambling on and on about it, but really, let's see what, what's actually there. So I hope that you can go and check out a little taste of the stories and what we're working on. Yeah, we will do that, definitely. And we'll, we'll share the link to the Kickstarter and whatever we can on the website when we post this podcast. Great, thank you. Yeah, no, no problem. We, I certainly would like to support it and I cannot wait to see it. But so what's, what's the status right now? How much are you trying to raise and where you at? So, yeah, we filmed for three years and we were lucky to raise our budget to get to where we are today and, and get those three years of production under our belt. We're done with production, so we're not filming anymore. And we're in post-production, which means editing and a whole, whole bunch of other things. And, and yes, we, we set our Kickstarter goal at 40,000. And that's kind of a bare minimum that we would need to, to finish up. We were hoping to, to surpass that. We'll see if we're, if we're so lucky. At this, at the time of this recording, we're about 37 or 38% of the way there. So we've got a ways to go to hit that goal. So it's an all or nothing campaign. If we don't hit 40,000, we would receive nothing. Okay. Well, so everybody out there, if you're looking for ways to support the education of the public on an extremely important topic that if, if more and more people were educated on this topic, it could really drastically change things for the better for humans and the planet. But go check out that, that Kickstarter and, and support it. Yeah. I'm excited. I'm always excited when we can have an opportunity to help support efforts like what, what you're doing, Rob. I appreciate that. Yeah. So, so quickly when, one last thing, um, we've talked a lot about a lot of stuff on this, uh, in our chat today. Um, a lot of things that positive things that people are doing. Um, but, but we've touched on some things that I'm sure some of the people on, uh, who are listening really aren't, aren't, have no education, no background, don't know about. How can people learn more about what they can do, um, as far as promoting these, uh, really beneficial agricultural solutions? Yeah. So, um, on a large scale, um, we need to look at regenerative agriculture, um, which is a model that builds more soil at the end of the year, um, instead of having less soil. So there's great organizations working on that. Uh, one is called regener, regeneration international, uh, another group that we've worked with called the carbon underground, um, and, uh, another amazing group here in Southern California called kiss the ground. So those are all about how we can, you know, build soil, but, and, and really the effects that that has on climate change on, on storing, um, carbon in the soil, which is another thing that isn't really talked about in the climate movement of how just reducing emissions actually doesn't do anything to get the, that pollution out of the atmosphere. Um, it's very odd that that isn't brought up very much yet, but I think that will change soon. Soil is the only way to pull that, um, out of the air and put it back underground where it came from. So those are some great organizations to look at. Um, you can definitely go to the needs grow.com and join our mailing list, um, which we'll be providing lots of tips and solutions and, and, uh, content on, on how you can get involved in things that you can use on all scales, whether you have a backyard or not, or you live in an apartment even. Um, so those are, those are a few, uh, resources. Um, you know, composting is, is, uh, a great, easy, uh, solution that anyone can do anywhere. Um, thinking of our food waste as, as not even waste at all, but how that could be turned back into a valuable resource. Um, so yeah, finding organizations, you know, there's so many of them. Um, we could, I could list a hundred, um, but, uh, Well, you've given us a good start here and, and I will certainly include those links in the post when I post it. And, um, again, best of luck to you, Rob. Thank you again for coming on the podcast and sharing all this wonderful, positive, uplifting information. It was a real pleasure to be here and, uh, I look forward to sharing the film with you guys. Thanks for joining us on the Sustainable Living Podcast.
