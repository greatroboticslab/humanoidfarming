 This Iowa Minute is brought to you by the Iowa Farm Bureau. Ah, nostalgia. Fun place to visit, hate to live there. Just like innovation has improved things like our phones, it's also improved agriculture. Did you know livestock farming today is more sustainable and better for the environment? Animals are healthier, consume less water, and did you know that cattle can eat a whole list of things we can't? Corn stock residue, the byproducts from the ethanol industry, soy hulls, oat byproducts. If it weren't for cattle, those co-products would either be used as fertilizer or they would end up in landfills somewhere. That's a process that people call upcycling and so that's really what they're doing, taking resources that would be a waste and turning them into a valuable, high quality protein that everyone likes to consume. And some people enjoy consuming this. Did you know cattle also eat the byproducts from brewing beer? Ah, the sustainability of Iowa agriculture. With your Iowa Minute, I'm Laurie Johns.
