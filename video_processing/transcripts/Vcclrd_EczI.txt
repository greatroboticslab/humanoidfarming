Howto & Style
 Today, I snuck up to the Epic Assistant, Natalie, on our team. This is her place. I see some beds here. I see some birdies beds right here. Let's go on back and take you on a tour of Natalie's house. And I'll tell you what, guys, I'm already seeing a little treat that I like right here. We've got some loquats. These are one of the best underrated fruits you're ever going to have. Absolutely delicious. I'm going to take one more for good measure here. Let's go find her. And I see her right here. What's up? Hey. So Natalie is our executive assistant here on the Epic Gardening team, and she has an incredible, primarily container garden. That's correct. Over a hundred containers. A hundred containers indoors and outdoors. And she has an incredible cat that's hanging out trying to escape right now. So Natalie's going to show you every little nook and cranny of her container garden. And I think you guys are going to absolutely love it. Okay. So as you can see, I have these awesome containers. Yeah. These were on sale. They're just like regular like Rubbermaid containers. So you can find a home Depot or loads. Sure. Like 10 or 15 bucks. Yeah. I was actually on sale for $4 a pop. There you go. And then I have these grow bags here that I got like two or three years ago. They're really great to use because I can coat both these and the baskets all around the garden. Yeah. So are you moving these at all because of sun and you're just kind of shifting? So I just reshuffled everything. So I'd be ready for you guys to come, but it was completely different before. Mm-hmm. Um, these are all like shadier areas over here because it gets blocked by that wall and by this shade. Yeah. Where's north, south, east, west in here? Um, so that's west. Okay. East, north, south. Got it. Yeah. So you're, you're getting a little blocked on your Southern exposure. Exactly. Yeah. Um, one tip that I want to show you is what I do with my Brussels sprouts to make sure I can keep growing them when it gets hot. Yes. So that's a huge problem here in San Diego. You guys are always complaining about your bugs with your Brussels sprouts and I don't have the same problem. So I think you should try my turn. I think we should. Um, if you look here, you'll see that the Brussels sprouts are covered in white powder. That is diatomaceous earth. And what that does is basically dry out. It's tiny little particles that get in the skin of the bugs and it dries them out. Mm-hmm. So what I do- Kind of slices them open. Yeah. Yeah. And so what I do is I just coat that. Um, it doesn't rain here enough. I probably do it like once a week. And then I don't have any problems with aphids, um, any caterpillars or anything like that because they just don't want to be on there. Yeah. We've tried, I mean, we tried it before. I think we may have done it during some rainy seasons or something. We got a little discouraged, but yeah, we'll, we'll try it again because the aphids are a nasty pest on these brassicas guys. It's, it's gnarly. Yeah. The other thing I do to, um, help with pests is I co-plant. So you can see I have three different kinds of guard, uh, Yeah. You've got Dusty Miller here, right? Yeah. Dusty Miller. And then you got, it looks like chard or beets. These are beets. And then this is the Brussels sprouts. And then you've got- And there's actually carrots in here too. And you can see that these have actually been eaten by like a caterpillar or something. And that's fine with me because I have carrots somewhere else. Yeah. Yeah. So predicting the good stuff, eating the stuff I don't really care about. So we've got more totes around here. It looks like we've got some fava beans, some onions, some red kale, and then peppers. Peppers. Yeah. Peppers, onions. Um, these are going to be squashes. And then back here we have fennel. Oh, nice. Yeah. Yeah. Rosemary. Um, over here. So are you ever planting one thing in one tote? Pretty much no. No. Okay. I always put more than one thing in a tote. Okay. Usually a flower, a vegetable and a fruit. Okay. So you're doing like a classic interplanting technique. Yeah. Is that something you learned? Cause you said you grew up gardening. You guys know I didn't grow up gardening. I probably picked it up in my early twenties. You have a bit of a crazy story, Natalie. Yes, I do. Yeah. So growing up, I learned how to garden by my family. Yeah. Um, I would consider it a culty environment. And so I got to spend a lot of time outside with my grandpa learning how to grow beans. Let me show you my beans. Let's go to the beans. They're just like the ones that I had when I was younger. Yeah. Okay. Container alley here. Yeah. So these are my beans. They're green beans. Always reminded me of my grandpa. He used to have huge rows of them that he would throw over these large chalices. Yeah. And I remember walking down there as a kid, picking the beans. One of my favorite times. Where'd you grow up? In Seattle, Washington. Okay. Okay. Cool. In a... Cult. In a cult. In a cult. In a cult. In a cult. That's where Natalie grew up. And so you have an interesting perspective on gardening because obviously I don't know much about it, but it sounds like preservation, canning, prepping, survivalist elements are in that. Absolutely. So you've got that sort of in your DNA. Yeah, I do. And you know, I've taken all the best parts of what I learned since I've left the cult and turned it into this beautiful garden you see now. Yeah. So talk to me about the system here because it's grow bags almost exclusively, but you kind of did this little trellising or terracing action. Yeah. So when I moved in, this was just a completely dirt lot and there was a big erosion problem. That's where my dryer is and I would wake up every time it rained to a mud puddle at my dryer. So I decided to use these garden beds to actually like terraform the hillside so that it doesn't have an erosion problem anymore. Yeah. Yeah. So I actually started at the top and I would dig out a little circle for every single garden bag so that it's even down there. Oh, okay. So you'd flatten that one spot. Flatten the one spot and then I place it and then I move down and then I flatten that spot and then I plant it. So I moved down the hill one by one that way. Honestly, it probably took me like 12 hours to do this set. Yeah. Because I mean, anytime you're doing something like this, it takes time to make sure that you're not messing with the erosion or... Yeah. And it's clay under here, hard clay. So I was like, ugh. A friend of mine had something in a situation like this in his front yard. He did all wildflowers, same slope. And it just... Do you have a really eclectic collection of things in grow bags? And you guys know, we actually wrote a book on grow bags called Grow Bag Gardening. So there's a lot of different things that we can show off here that I think are really cool. Like pomegranate right here. Pomegranate. Yeah. So this actually has two fruits, pomegranate and down here, strawberries. That's a great inner plant. I love that. Let me show you. A little, little quick taste. Nice ripe strawberry. Here's one for you. Okay. Thank you. Cheers. Mmm. Sun ripened strawberry. Oh, that's good. Strawberries. You've got another Dusty Miller here. You've got... This is a rose. Yeah. These are really fragrant roses and they actually turn red. They go yellow to red. So you can see right here, this is a new one. It's yellow. It goes to this orange color. Natalie, these smell... These smell so good. Doesn't smell so good. Guess where I got them? Walter Anderson. Food for less. Food for less? Food for less. Okay. So talk to me about the budgeting of a garden like this. Yeah. There's different scales. Of course, at my house, we go a little hard and a little crazy. And I can imagine this probably didn't cost you that much. It didn't. A big part of prepping is making sure that you are living within your means. So what I do is take a lot of cuttings. Yeah. Um, this grew from a cutting. That grew from a cutting. Mm-hmm. Uh, this grew from a cutting. A lot of my roses came from cuttings. As you know, these two came from food for less. They were on sale for a dollar each. They're bare root roses. Wow. And I saved them. Look how gorgeous they are. They were sold as bare root or they were just so dead that they were... No, they were sold as bare root. Okay. But they were also kind of dead. Yeah. What I love about yours is, first of all, the visual, the look of it is really nice. Yeah. But just the eclectic planting that you've got going on. And then under the slumber and verbena, you have a strawberry, you have a beet. Mm-hmm. So in that, you have, uh, you know, lots of food. Are you looking at 15? These are all 15s, right? Yep. Yeah. 15 gallon grow bags. 15 gallon grow bags. 15 gallon, guys, is pretty much the size. You can do the most with it. You can get a little pomegranate tree in there and you can get strawberries and a tomato or something. And it's attainable for pretty much any able-bodied person. Yeah. I am small. I'm five foot two on a good day. Yeah. And, um, I can pick this up. Like- No problem. There you go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a good workout though. So after a day of moving this- Sure. Feeling buff. Sure. All right, let's check out this other side. And let me show you my cool color garden. Okay, cool. So you'll find more Dusty Miller. I like to play this at entrances to create an entryway experience. I learned that landscape architecture. Okay. What-so what is your love? I love this plant, but what is, what is the reason that it shows up so much in your garden? Um, it's super easy to grow. Yeah. These are all from cuttings of one plant. Wow. Um, over here, I have a lot of different kinds of salvias, which are native to this area. Gorgeous. And you're saying this is your cool color area. Cool color area. Over there was my hot color area, my warm colors. This is my cool colors. Um, so over here I have, uh, beets interplanted. I have, that is a watermelon right there. No way. Yep. A little watermelon. I started to do my sixth though. You're just gonna let it sprawl. Mm-hmm. Okay. Let it sprawl over. Yep. These are more beets. Um, this is a rosemary. And these are some of those fava beans that you saw over there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and then under here is a little pepper that I started from seed. Look at that. So it's going, it's, you know, it's gonna be a banana pepper. What's cool, Ellie, about your approach is one bag, three purposes, and then many bags. And how much square footage do you think you're working with in the backyard? Ooh. Not, not much. I mean, it's like 300 and something square feet of plannable space. Yeah. Yeah. And a lot of it's on a hill. Yeah. So I've reclaimed some of that space too, by planting on the slope. And then even look at this, like what you guys notice is you notice how Natalie's kind of scaping this rosemary. I mean, this is a very well pruned and managed one. You can see as she's sort of chopping the tops off here. So you have like this one beautiful plant that's really gonna last you like as long as you need it to. Yeah. And in container gardening, it's really important to have correct pruning because that root structure needs to support the plant the best it can. Yeah. So with this rosemary, I cut it back about four weeks ago and then another four weeks, I expect it to be popping off new shoots. Perfect. Okay. I see something I like over here. Something actually that's new for us that I've been using for a few years now. The air pot. I love this air pot. I want more of them. They're so much better than the Vivosun bags. We'll hit you up. You're on the team. We're, you're going to get hooked up. Um, so this tree actually came from Jacques. Yes. Garden Jacques. Um, he gave me this fig. He had propagated it from a tree that they chopped down on his friend's property. Yep. Yep. And as you can see down here, I have it interplanted with strawberries and this is going to be another watermelon. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to let the watermelon grow down this slope. And so there'll be a little melon path and that'll be nice. So the thing we like, by the way, guys, on these air pots is effectively, it's like a different version of a grow bag where you can see the sides have all these little holes cut out of them. And basically it just air prunes. Correct. Which is really, really, really good for container trees because you're not going to get that root girl at the bottom where it circles around. It's an OG old school way. We love them so much. We actually put them on the store pretty recently, I would say. Yeah. I would love to see more of these in my garden because they're really aesthetic. Like they look cool. They look modern. They look neat. Yeah. And they're actually hook in really well to like, if you had five in a row, pop irrigation on each of them. It works really well. The other thing I really like is eventually I'm going to need to pop this up. It's really easy to do. You just basically unwrap it. Yep. So right here, you see there's this hole right here, this little screw right here. You just unscrew it, unwrap it and then put it in another pot. That makes it so much easier. When I found this, I think I found it like maybe three years ago, three, four years ago when I was growing indoors in my old place. Yeah. And the thing I loved is that when you get it, it's literally just a flat sheet that you roll into the container and then it comes with a container bottom. Cool product. Totally. Anyways, so you've got a little bit more stuff going on back here. Let me tell you about this sunflower. Random sunflower. I had sunflowers in my yard last year. I noticed that one of them was gone and a gopher had actually pulled it down a hole. Mm. This year, this popped up where the sunflower was after the gopher pulled it down the hole. So he did you a favor, I guess. Yeah. So he did a little. He just made it perennial for you. That's all he did. Direct sow from a gopher. Yeah. So I let it grow and then I will grab the seeds from it once it's ready and grow more seeds next year. Mm-hmm. Okay. So how come we've got some bags over here? Yeah. Are these quarantines or? No, these are actually shade. So you see that this fence right here. Yeah. Blocks the sun for the most of the day. These are my celery, my mint, other things that don't like the sun very much. My beets, you can see that this has bolted and I was trying to protect that from the sun. Sure. Okay. We'll see that. And then actually I have loquat starts. You were talking about how loquat is such a undeserved fruit. Yeah. These are straight from the tree. So I just potted these. These are about a year old. You just put the soil, you put the seed right on the soil on the top, just like right there. It's a huge seed in the loquat. Yeah. It's a huge seed. I can actually show you some seeds. Sure. And then this is one year old and I plan on planting a few every year so that I can give them out to my friends. There you go. Yeah. Loquats, I mean, we talk about them a lot here in San Diego. They grow really well. It's like one of the most interesting flavors. It's sort of like a tropical peach, but yeah, the plants themselves are kind of expensive. Yeah. They are. To get a start. They are. And then each fruit has like at least two or three seeds in it. If I harvested off of the tree at my house, you know that one, that thing would have thousands of seeds. Thousands of seeds. So if I really wanted to start a loquat nursery, I probably could. You know, Kevin, I just might. All right, Kev. So here I want to show you my seed starting table. Okay. It looks like we have a new guest here. Sandy. Sandy. So Sandy likes to sit here behind the window and I do too every morning. Watch my seeds. So here you can see I have the four cells and the six cells. I'm actually using the six cells to propagate. I was going to say, you've got a unique little setup here. Let me show you what I'm doing here. So these are salvias. Like I said, so I told you I grew those from propagation. Yeah. These are salvias being propagated in Epic six cell. Yeah. So you've made good use of the bottom dome and top dome that we have. We created these little individuals either way. It's like, if you have one of the Epic six cell trays, you can put on an individual humidity dome and bottom tray. If you're a smaller space gardener like you, Natalie, this can be really good because this plant might just need humidity and nothing else does. So it's great to do that in the tray. Anyways, you've got this going on and you've also got some. Yeah. I like to recycle. Cheap and free. So you can see sometimes I do buy six cells. I keep them and then I use them to pot up stuff. That's really small. Yep. You got a strawberry tin. This is a strawberry tin that I'm also using to propagate. I have some roses in here, tomatoes, a Cuban oregano and a salvia. Honestly, strawberry things are perfectly designed for propagation because you've got the ventilation holes and then you've got the humidity. That's perfect. And it's great because you can't actually usually recycle clam shells. And so this is a way to reuse it and reduce that impact. Actually, really almost all plastic, like 90% of all plastic is thrown away. I know. Even if you throw it into the recycling bin. It's crazy. It has to be like clean. It has to be number five. There's all these different rules. Yeah. So it looks like we've got a couple other things. Is there a reason why some of these totes are in this particular area? Yeah. So if you look closely in here, I'm actually starting a bunch of different plants. Okay. And so it's kind of in the shade. You pull this nasturtium back. I have geraniums that I cut and are propagating right here. So it's like a prop station. Yep. And it gets the same south facing. So it gets the shade for most of the day. Mm-hmm. And I'm propagating all in these guys. Okay. There's all different kinds of starts in here. Amazing. And then it looks like we've got a couple house plants going down here. Yeah. I have some house plants. Hydrangeas are my favorite. Those are gorgeous. Those are gorgeous. Look at this. Yeah. I mean, who doesn't love that? How do you mean that? That looks nice. Who doesn't love that? It's just so... It's my favorite color, periwinkle. Yeah. They're so pretty. And of course, I have vegetables mixed in here. So I have some squash, some tomatoes, some herbs. These are actually carrots that I'm going to be pulling for the stew later. And over here, more fava beans. Yeah. So as we kind of get back to this cool zone and see the rest of the garden, how long do you think this took you to set up and how much do you think you probably spent, like just roughly? So I probably have spent like about $800 on my garden in the past year and a half. It's not bad. Most of that was actually on soil because I was able to get really good deals on the bags and the bins and all of that. If you add in the price for plants, maybe I've spent like two or $300 on the plants themselves. So total thousand bucks. Prop the rest. Yeah. Prop the rest. Yeah. Very similar to how Jacques approached his garden back in the day. Absolutely. A lot of time, not a lot of budget, which is a perfectly valid way to do it. So something a little special, Natalie told me a couple of weeks ago, she said, Hey Kev, I'm not going to be available this, this afternoon, which is totally fine because I'm going out to learn how to harvest rabbits. That's correct. And I did not know that that was something that she was into, but she went out, she took the afternoon off and went out and dispatched some rabbits because you wanted to see if you could handle it. Yeah, I can. And I learned I'm actually very good at making it a soothing experience for the rabbit. And that's the very most humane way to do it. Right. And so this kind of ties to, I guess your upbringing, right? Yeah. And your desire to be self-sufficient. And so what we're going to do right now is harvest a few things and bring it inside and kind of wrap it up there with a little bit of a rabbit stew preparation. Rabbit stew. Yeah, let's do it. We're going to harvest some carrots for the stew. All right. Uh, you know how to pull a carrot. Just go ahead and pull them up. You know, the secret is, oh, look at these little guys. These carrots are always a little surprise, aren't they? Yeah, I love it. Did you thin that at all or no? I did. That's it. These have been- You should pull this one because that one looks huge. These have been thinned like four or five times, actually. Okay. I make a stew out of them. This is the last and the smallest. That's why we have a little bit of a smaller harvest here. Yeah. Not bad though. Not bad at all. Perfect. Here, I'll grab those from you. Okay. These onions are actually really cool. They're from a friend of mine and her grandma actually brought them over when she emigrated here to Ellis Island. No way. So these are- So these are- OG onions. These are OG onions. Okay, cool. They're really cool. Let's do it. You're getting all of them? I'm actually going to because I'm going to make some onion powder too later. Okay, cool. So I'm just going to- She's just on that level, guys. She's just absolutely on that level. Shake those boys out. All right. There we go. What's next? Look at these. These are nice. Yeah. Like small little bulbs at the bottom, but perfect for dicing up. And the greens are really good too. Yeah. So we're going to take some of this fennel. I'm actually just going to pull this whole guy. Baby bulb. There you go. And we're going to get some of these fava beans. This is my first fava harvest of the year. If you look down at the bottom of the stock, you'll see the ones that are nice and plumpy. Oh yeah. Look at these guys. Fava guys is really nice. Just as a soil improver as well. That has two pods in it. Yep. Two little beans. This one probably has three. Looks like three or four. Yeah. All right. Let's go inside. Okay. Let's go. Let's see this rabbit. We have brought all of our goods inside. There's one extra good here, Natalie, that I remember you, you dispatch this yourself, which I actually highly respect if you're going to consume meat. So let me show you guys this rabbit. We're going to put it in the stew. And this kind of ties Natalie to like what you've told me before. Like you have a five year plan. Yes, I do. Right? You want what? I want a homestead. I want a homestead. I want to be like, you know, a bachelorette pad where I grow all my food, all my vegetables, all my meat, self-sustaining apocalypse surviving. There you go. And thriving. So you guys know we did this on the channel actually 2019 and we might do it pretty soon, this summer. So stay tuned for that. Natalie, it's been awesome seeing your garden. There's a lot of cool houseplants in here, which we'll probably take a look at while you're prepping this stew for another video sometime. Sounds good. But until next time guys, good luck in the garden and keep on growing.
