 Do you struggle with uneven watering? Are you looking to track soil health or manage pests more effectively? Pinpointing your challenges will help you choose the right solutions. For example, if water usage is a concern, soil moisture sensors and automated irrigation might be the answer. If weather unpredictability impacts your yields, you'll benefit from IoT weather stations providing hyper-local forecasts. Start small, focus on one or two key challenges, and scale up as you see results.
