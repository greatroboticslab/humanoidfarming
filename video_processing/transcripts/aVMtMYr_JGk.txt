Education
 When tomato plants reach a height of 25 cm, they are trained horizontally, northward in summer and southward in winter. The purpose of this process is to control excessive plant growth and to encourage flowering and fruit production. After the appearance of 10 leaves, the plant should be supported with stakes or trellises. Side branches are removed after the first cluster of flowers blooms. Following the 6th or 7th flower cluster, the growing tip is pruned to enhance fruit quality in the final harvest.
