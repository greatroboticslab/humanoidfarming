 So this course will introduce you to the principles of grazing management. We're going to start with an outline of why grasslands are so important, how degraded they are and why grazing animals are the most important tool that you have available to regenerate these environments. So along the way we'll look at some technical aspects such as grass physiology and how grasses respond to defoliation, we'll look at characteristics of soil and soil processes and elements of soil health. We'll look at the range of approaches to grazing management and the pros and cons of each and how important it is to plan and monitor and some simple guidelines to manage the complexity that is the grazing ecosystem. The practicalities of grazing management will be highlighted and highlight the need for changes potentially to property infrastructure and we'll finish with a brief introduction into the holistic management framework which has been so influential on my journey. So I look forward to you joining me on this journey as we work through this program, the grazing management principles course. channel the and how flow tills has worked with the dynamic mega-f titan, the
