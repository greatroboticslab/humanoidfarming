Education
 Agronomists are the guardians of our crops, advising on the best practices to keep plants thriving and ecosystems balanced. Start with a degree in agricultural science, such as a diploma level or bachelor's qualification in agriculture, focusing on plant and soil health, forestry, or a related field. Get your hands dirty with volunteer work, internships, or projects like a community garden initiative to apply what you've learned. Agronomy is ever evolving, so accumulating work experience on a farm or agricultural business is a great way to find out if agronomy is a passion you want to follow. Build your professional network by connecting with experts at seminars and agricultural expos, find out what their day-to-day life is like, and build meaningful connections for your future. Jumpstart your rewarding career as an agronomist and make a real impact on global agriculture. Contact your nearest AUG office to advise further.
