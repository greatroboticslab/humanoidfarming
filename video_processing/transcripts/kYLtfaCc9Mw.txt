Howto & Style
 Greetings from the garden and welcome back to Let's Grow Stuff. My name is Ben and today we're at Ulbricht Botanical Gardens in Madison, Wisconsin to learn about gravel gardens. Let's dig in. Well today we are at Ulbricht Botanical Gardens in Madison, Wisconsin and we're joined by Director of Horticulture Jeff Epping who is a gravel garden expert. Jeff, welcome and thanks for being with us. Thanks for coming. Well tell us about gravel gardens in general. What is their defining characteristic? Well it's kind of a system of growing plants in 4 to 5 inches of gravel and what the gravel really is about is creating a weed barrier for us. So that 4 to 5 inches has to go right to the edge of the garden. You can't just let it kind of taper off. So in an open area you can use like boulders or such like we got around here but you might have the foundation of your house or a sidewalk and then you don't have to do anything with those other than get the gravel down about 6 inches above that. Perfect. Now are there any drawbacks to gravel gardens or sort of cautionary tales that we should be aware of? 99% of the time when I plant a gravel garden it's in full sun. And you can do a little bit of shade. The one thing that is the enemy of the entire system is sediment or organic matter that builds up in the gravel. So if we have any water flowing into an area like a rain garden would be a bad spot for a gravel garden because with water comes all the sediment, goes in between the gravel and then we have this perfect place for weeds to get going. So higher ground, good drainage, never at a low spot essentially? Pretty much. So talk us through managing a gravel garden long term. So obviously there's probably quite a bit of work to get it established and get the gravel hauled in but then once it's in how do we move forward from there? Yeah that's a good point. All the work is up front in getting the gravel. Planting is a lot of fun because you're just digging like a dog, putting the plant in and you're good to go. So the most important thing is the spring cleanup. Why that is is we don't want any of that organic matter to build up in the soil. So a very thorough spring cleanup and then you're good to go the rest of the season. Awesome. Well Jeff, thank you so much for being with us today, sharing your time and expertise. We appreciate it. You bet. Well don't forget there is so much more yet to learn online at pbswisconsin.org slash letsgrowstuff. There we have more videos, tips, tricks and a blog to help you grow a better garden.
