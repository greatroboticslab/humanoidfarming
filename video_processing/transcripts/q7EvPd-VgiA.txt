 All right, other news tonight. A $1 billion proposal for a new business in a small farming community. And tonight, some people who live there are pushing back to stop the project. Augusta Township over in southeast Washtenaw County is where a New York-based real estate investment firm called Thor Equities wants to build a data center. Now, specifically, more than 800 acres bordered by Arcona, Hitchingham, Mylan, Oakville, and Sanford Roads. Jay Scott Smith spent the day out there, joins us now live. Jay, you've been speaking to folks with some really strong opinions on this. Yes, indeed. These are some very strong opinions, some opinions that we cannot actually repeat on the air here. And you rarely see this. Every person we have spoken to has been against turning all of this wonderful land into a data center. I do not want this at all. Larry Schultz has lived out here along Mylan Oakville Road for 35 years, and he made it very clear he is not in favor of the president. The proposed data center, which is the latest in a line of development on this stretch of land along the border of Washtenaw and Monroe counties. We had a nice farmland on the other side of our corner road. Now you go look at it, it's all them store panels all the way down the road. The data center, which is owned by a New York-based private equity firm called Thor Equities, would sit on 522 acres of an 810-acre plot of land. And this has sparked everything from concern to straight-up anger from longtime residents like Larry. No, I do not want it. Everybody down this road on both sides don't want it. You don't talk to any of them. And that's what we did. The FBI opened the shooting range, which has been quite a noise pollution problem. And then a mile down the road, they've put in a, or they're putting in a solar farm. Judy Harris has lived with her husband at their home across the street from Larry since 1984. And while they have dealt with the change of the previous projects, the data center feels like a bridge too far. It's quite a lot because that's all happened within the last couple of years. And now they're talking about putting in a data center, which is going to really change our way of life, I believe. Now the planning commission voted 5-1 to recommend denial of the project to the township board of trustees, who will have the final say on rezoning. Thor Equities said in a statement earlier today that, quote, we recognize that new developments often raise important questions from the community, and we are committed to addressing them. This project is in the early and exploratory phase and would use approximately 20% of an 800-acre site. And our priority is to engage openly with the community, listen to concerns, and provide clear information at every step. For people like Judy, she feels that proposals like this can often feel like a bait and switch. A lot of things that are promised on when these things go in, don't happen, and they change after they get what they want. Now, Ann Arbor Spark, who does support the rezoning, has also chimed in. They said in a statement that while the planning commission recommended denial, we encourage the township board to keep the door open to allow the project to move forward to the site review phase. That's where the full proposal, including potential community benefits and infrastructure improvements, can be really assessed. Plus, denying the rezoning would now cut the process short before the community has a chance to fully understand what's on the table. Now, the township board is set to meet again on June 24th to decide whether or not to move forward with the rezoning. But if it's anything like what we've seen out here, it sounds like it could be a solid no. But we'll have to wait and see until the end of the month. We're live in Milan. I'm Jay Scott Smith for Local 4. Let's go back to the studio. Yeah, change is hard for many people who have lived in that community for a long time. It'll be interesting to see how it all turns out. Thanks, Jay. Thank you.
