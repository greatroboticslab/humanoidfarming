 Hey y'all, today I'm sharing my favorite gardening books. This is part of a Roots and Refuge collab, so that worked out perfect. My favorite book is from Dick Raymond. It's called The Joy of Gardening, and he actually had a PBS series, and those videos are on YouTube. I'll leave a link to those in the description, and they are really fun to watch. But another good thing about these books is they're old. I think they're from the 80s, and you can find these on LinkedIn.
