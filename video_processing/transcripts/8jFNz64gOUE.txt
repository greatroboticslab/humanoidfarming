 What do you do when you're trapped in the final boss sanctuary right at the start of the game? Don't worry, ye ye handily. While others are fighting over maps in the Navi's village, I'm repeatedly dying to the sleeping level 200 final boss, farming massive amounts of experience, attribute points, and I got teared I.T. The moment he finally wear down the boss after dying 10,000 times, my name will shake the entire world. What the hell is this? Aba? In a dimly lit temple, he ochentered at the towering figures sitting on the divine throne, lost in silence. He had used to enter the virtual reality game Primal Origin. He was supposed to spawn in an Navi's village, but bizarrely, he found himself in the sanctuary of the level 200 final boss, the ultimate de mongo. You've got to be kidding me. How am I supposed to play this damn game? He ochentered in frustration. There were no maps, no NPCs in the temple. He couldn't tell the bell up, nor call the leaf. He was trapped facing the sleeping final boss, feeling utter despair. Forget it, ye ye used the once. He ochentered helplessly. In Primal Origin, the penalty for the ad was a bit of weakness with all stats ha. It was a pamphlet price to pay right at the start, but he had no other choice. According to the game mechanics, players can commit suicide. Yg level basis have a basic damage reflection skill. If he's as a disguy, he's all viable to respawn in a Navi's village, right? With this in mind, Hiao Chen, holding his Navi's dagger, walk towards the sleeping demon god. Yg es ain't the first player to ever attack the final boss. That's something to be proud of. He can't hurt himself. Facing the demon gods ten meter tall from a look pesetically smart. Here goes nothing. He yelled leaping up and slashing at the demon gods' victory. Then, system prompt. You have the ultimate damage to the ultimate demon god. You have received damage from the ultimate demon gods' passive skill zones. You have the 390 HP. You have the I. Just as G-80, the West finally free. A series of unexpected system notifications path. Then, your fearless carry just been recognized by the gods. You have the gun 100,000 expand 23 attribute points. You have reached the LV-10 experience K. Please choose a class. You have been resurrected in the ultimate demon god sanctuary. What the hell? He get experience and attribute points for being killed by the maje reflection? He oching was done for a moment. Then, became ecstatic. He was still in the sanctuary. But this was the above. It was a massive bone. He suddenly had a body dea. He looked at the ultimate demon god. Ras his dagger again. Uncharted for back. Then, you have died. Then, you have the gun 100,000 expand. 20 free attribute points. Then, for striking the ultimate demon god the second team with your feeble body. You have been awarded an additional 10 reputation points in all major cities. You have been resurrected in the ultimate demon god sanctuary. It works. And there are extra rewards. He oching was real. At this rate, a good son become the strongest level 10 player in history. He opened his personal panel, distributed his newly gun attribute points. And planned at first into an endless cycle of rise a dagger. He revive at points rise a dagger again. Time passing a monotonous look. He oching became almost nam following the instinct to the over and over again. After an un amount of time, a different notification sound caught his attention. Then, you have struck the ultimate demon god 10,000 times. Your indomitable spirit of fighting despite repeated defeats as chak de gas. You have done the title. The one who never fails. Title effect. When passing an enemy 5 level, siger than you forever. Every additional level de enemas, a your attribute sin crease by 2%, up to a maximum of 200%. I got it tight. How chance I slid up. Equipped it without his attention. With the 200% attribute boost from the title, swung his dagger at the demon god the game. System prompt. You have done the 2 damage to the ultimate demon god. The damage was no longer a man the tower 1. And then, an even more exciting prompt appear. System prompt. Your damage to the ultimate demon god has exceeded the minimum 3 goal. You have done the ultimate demon god's combat information. Ultimate demon god. Level, LV200 musical boss. HP, 489,998,100,000. Status, unconscious, on the brink of the ad. On the brink of the ad. And, it seems like it can regenerate HP. Here, you can kill this party. The crucial information. After dying one more time and confirming that the boss HP had been decreased by another 2 points. It was utterly surreal. That's right. The ultimate demon god can regenerate it. It can slowly wear it down to the ad with my own life. They talked of single-handedly killing the game's strongest boss and ripping endless treacherous made his heart race. He had no choice before it. But now, Ali won't always kill this boss. With this conviction, Xiaochen threw himself back into the joyful yet tedious task of dying. Nearly 2 months had passed since the game's launch. The average player level was between 20 and 30. And leveling was extremely difficult. Meanwhile, Xiaochen had been grinding in the sanctuary for who knows how long. When he opened his personal panel again. His stats were terrifyingly. He had been fighting for three days and nights. And at this moment, the ultimate demon god's HP was used over 20,000. I'm finally going to wear it down. Xiaochen saw the light of victory and was full of motivation. At the same time, in the outside world. In the human mind city, Swambu City. One of China's top 10 guilds. Aosi Kunxion, proudly looking down on heroes. Was struggling to clear the level 30 hard mode. Dungeon, Spider Cave. They deleted them advanced. They were stuck on the first mini boss for three whole days. If he level up my defense skill one more time tomorrow. We sold viable topasi. The team's mind tank, Aosi Laujuan, said weirdly after respawning. Just as the guild members were celebrating the impending progress. Suddenly, three crisp system announcements occurred throughout the entire game world. Server wide announcement. China region player, name hidden, has achieved the first kill of the LV200 musical boss. The ultimate de Mongo. The leaderboards and the primal stele are now open. All players who have a significant impact on the games progress will be recorded on the primal stele. Server wide announcement. Server wide announcement. The world fell silent for a moment. At the entrance of the Spider Cave. All the elite players of Aosi Kunxion stood as if frozen. Their mouse agape in shock. Their ice glass over. After a long while. The guild leader, Aosi D1, spoke with a dry voice in the team channel. Tonic's leveling is cancelled. Everyone, use all your resources and connections. You want to know who first killed the ultimate de Mongo. Find him, recruit him. If not, then. Hunt him down until it's back to level 0. The same scene played out in every major city and guild across the globe. Everyone was stunned by this mysterious player who had appeared out of nowhere. Countless people opened the newly available primal stele. On it was a record of the anonymous player's grand achievement. And next to his name was the evaluation given by the game system. Legendary. My god, it's a legendary rating. That man said it was his own strengths. Not a bad. The server has only been open for two months. How cold any player be this terrifying? In the crowd, a beautiful girl with the idea, fanking who stared at the announcement and suddenly talked of a friend she had contacted when the game first launched. Is it you, a yuan? Meanwhile, the source of all this emotion, Xiao Chen, was staring at the dazzling array of equipment and skill books that had dropped from the ultimate de Mongo. His eyes shining, almost trolling. Holy cow, so much good stuff. Din, system prompt. You have a kill the LV200 musical boss. De final demon, you have. Gained 1 billion experience points. 1,000 free attribute points. 5,000 reputation. And 10 points of content and legend. Din, you have achieved the first kill of the LV200. Musical boss. Earning the title. The one who surpasses. Al din, you have been cursed by the final. Demon, the hatred of dark creatures towards you changes. Hatred, damage plus 100% din. You. Aved, tan de epic. Equipment. Sword of the menation. Legendary equipment. Demon God's shield. Aether Staff. Special equipment. Green of Chausdin. You have received a skill book. A series of system. Prompts ran in South Chainsiers. Incredibly pleasant to hear. So many rewards. South. Chen looked at the system prompt record. Nearly drawing. Two months of monotonous. Cycles of dying. Not only boosted his personal attributes but now even at equipment and skills. A cold integua. To check them one by one. The first prompt. About killing the boss. Esquim. Over. The second prompt. The 1 billion experience points and 1,000 attribute points. A didn't take her match. About. After all. As a man who's tour 300 trillion experience and adober 500,000. In total attributes. This was just a drop in the back. However. The increase of 5. 0,00 reputation made his reputation in the major human cities become a worse. And the 10. Points of legend were the strongest reward in this system from. Legend points can actually. Enhanced racial talents. Awesome. South. And looked at the vital information in the legend. Point section of his personal panel. Feeling that the surprise came to us. Suddenly. Legend points. 10 points. Can view set to enhance racial talents. The player can use human. Default un point of legend. Reduce skill experience requirements by 1%. And can also view set for other hidden. Functions. To be explored. Note. Only players who have made significant contributions to world history. Can it tend this. In the primordial. Players can choose from several racial classifications. Humans. Elves. Orcs. Demons. Celestial beings. And others. Each race assets. Unique talent skills. The human race's talent skill reduces the experience required for players to. Level up their skills by 10%. As long as South. Chun uses the legend points to enhance racial talents. His skill levels will increase even faster. But for now. You haven't tapped and done skills. And you have a lot of experience told. So you won't consider it for the team being. The temptation to. Enhanced racial talents. His legend points was great. But so Chun talked about it. And internationally used them. Next. A look at the third system prompt. Title. The one who surpasses. All. When equip. All four dimensional attributes increase by 50%. And you can use the skill. Serpass. Serpass. A. Active skill. Coldons are reduced by 50%. Lasting 40 seconds. Coldon time. Uno mini. Wow. Suestro. Sao Chen swallowed hard. His eyes shining. It is well known that in games. Most skills have the cooldowns. The stronger the attack power and the larger the range of the skill. The longer the. Coldon. For example. The. Warriors level 30 basic skill. Execute. Execute. When the targets remaining at this below 30%. Unleash a powerful strike. Skill attack power. 500%. Call down time 30 seconds. As the strongest output skill for the. Warrior class at this stage. Just imagine how much the DPS would increase after equipping the title. With a 50% increase in 4 dimensional attributes plus double the use of frequency. It's. Incredibly powerful. The only downside is that players in the primordial can only equip. One title at a time. This means that Sao King can only wear either the title of. The fearless one. Or. The. One who surpasses all. Say. This is the dilemma of wanting both Fizz and Bear's bow. It can only use them alternately based on the situation. Sao King shook his head and let out a slide. Say. Say. This damn. Sweet trouble. It looked at the fourth line. Hint. You have been cursed by the final demon god. The hatred of dark creatures towards you changers. Hatred. Damage. Plus 100% dark creatures. Eh. Whatever. It actually keeps it over it and finally so.

A classic line from a certain film suddenly popped into Sao Chen's mind. Damn. Is this the red epic? The strongest. Equipment. In the game. To. To. To strong. Super egg fixed physical. And magical dual attack plus additional percentage bonuses. Incredible 3 skills. Even in it. Shield state. With only 20% of all attributes. It still exceeded Sao Chen's. Imagine action. After a long while. If I finally came back to his senses. With a passive. Skill that lowers the juicy level. It can equip it now under requirement of 280.000 strengths. Luckily. He's at the tribute points from the last 10 hours. Sao Chen was immensely grateful. For his foresight. After grinding the final demon. God boss for the last 4. 261 hits. He gained 85.220 tribute points. Which temporarily left and attacked for back up. Plus the 1.000 points from the boss killing world. Currently. The 1.

Bite board. Brands. Silver. Gold. Dark gold. Legendary. And epic. In addition to some special equipment that is not. Counted in the quality. Sao Chen learned this from the player forum. Currently. Most mainstream. Players are a mix of bite board and brands. With only a very small number of elite speciesing. Silver equipment. As for gold and the bar. Sorry. Not a single piece in the entire server. However. Epses is one epic. Two legendary. And one special equipment. If. Terrifying event to myself now. Sao Chen clicked his tan. Marvelling.

Saochen truly relax. The opportunities in life are truly wonderful. Who would have talked to called A. Suchan. Opportunity. It was finally Timetolive. And Saochen looked at the dim temple. Feeling deeply. Emotional. In a brand new game. After two months of continuous effort. He attacked down the strongest. Bossing the game with his weak Lv10 body. In the past. Evolving the ability to even. Think about it. I'm living. Saochen withdrew his gas and activated the teleportation skill of. The ring of chaos. As his visions shifted. A bustling crowd suddenly appeared before him. System prompt. Dear player Chen Ye. Welcome to Navis Villar number 7777. Navis Villar number 7777. Saochen looked around curiously at the other. Plus. At that moment. As a den urgent prompt sounded in his ear. Your equipment soul. Of the menace is about to be registered on the equipment. Leaderboard would you like to hide your hide.

Realize that the major leaderboards had already opened. With his current strengths. A code confidently said that. No other players could defeat him. So hiding. His idea was the for any low profile. Or was it out of fear of being the first bird to get you? Just kidding if Edoente could down others. That's already considered keen. With this attribute. How could they possibly be targeted by players? So there is only one reason. Is afraid of trouble. Once his name appears on the leaderboard. Teres.

The world's a third nearly drove the four of the MMA. The. I mean. You are real trash. Looking for the. You bastard. The four members of the villain guild immediately rastered weapons and surrounded him. The unlookers were stunned by Sao Chen's bold words. In their eyes. Sao Chen was used a level. This rookie. How cold the dare to say that things in this situation? Was a. Perhaps. Foolish. However. Sao Chen applied no gun was not going to waste any more time. Facing the force attack. And neither that nor I body. Directly passing his sword for a normal attack. Suiz. Suiz. Suiz. Suiz. The blooded trastanar. And in an instant.

Gather the brothers and kill. Him. On the. Oter side. After sauchan instant killed. The 4 transplans. Ereman and fast. Even saiyan. Ig gets discounts as leading the world of harm. After saiyan. Da. E followed his original. Plan and walk towards the hop change hall. In notime. A building covering about 10 acres appear. In his side. It was indeed the hop change hall. In the original. Hop changes require. Completing hop change tasks. With difficulty randomly ranging from the lowest effect to the highest. Tese. Depending on the task difficulty. The tribute grout and skill selection pull after the hop change. Bari. Many people in pursuit of the tribute grout that had first into the highest difficulty. S-level. Tasks. This let toki. A number of players getting stuck on the first hop change task for a long time. In the end. They even ato. Hebe upon S-level. Endure the punishment for task failure. And then. Choose a lower difficulty. Currently. There were quite a few players in the hop hall. Sauchan glanced around and. Estimated there were about 200 people. Among them. Only a very small portion chose tasks. Most players were actually squatting here to fine team mats to do tasks together. Sauchan retracted his. Gasan walked towards the NPS warrior junior mentor. In front of the mentor. There was. A notice board that seemed to have something written on him. About 7 or 8 people were lined up in front of the. Mentor. Seeing him walk straight ahead. They immediately whispered reprimands. Hey. But strong whiz. You. Go to the back of the line. What are you doing? Cutting in line? Do you have. No manners? What do you mean? Aren't you afraid of getting scolded by the warrior mentor? Bro. You've got guts. He like warriors like you. Emits the scolding voices. Sauchan walk. After the warrior mentor. Gazing at the notice board and silently nodding. It turned out that it listed the hoe. Change rules. If he's. Penalties for falling tasks. And so on. If you don't want to die. Go. Back and line up. At that moment. A rough voice rang in his ear. Sauchan turned out to see the junior. Warrior mentor NPC. Aide. Juan Teben lifted his head. Look. This guy is. This place a day. Now we rain for a show. We said bad temper. This guy is probably going to get. Thrown out. The players watching this scene whispered among themselves. Ready to enjoy a good show. At this time. They also realized that the player was. The idea. Can you. Bustin trying to cut in line. A way. Use. Dare to check the information on the notice board. They were all tired of the information on the board. Where did this newbie come from? Everyone chuckled thinking they were. About to witness the grand. Spectacle of the bold newbie getting beaten by the furious mentor. A cut a girl in the line kindly. Reminded Sauchan in a low voice. The mentor gets. Really scary when he's angry. You sold list and an. Step back. Thank you for your kindness. Sauchan replied calmly. At this moment. He also noticed. That the players had been. Whispering. And even talk. They had misunderstood him earlier. They didn't. Dare to. Scold him loudly. It was evident that the warrior mentor held a significant deterrent power in the. Minds. However. Sauchan had no intention of hitting the cut the hills warning. He wanted to see. How the NPC would treat him now that he had reached the worship reputation level. It was said that. The NPCs in the original had a very level of intelligence. Almost indistinguishable from real. Players. It was quite curious. What an annoying guy. The junior warrior mentor I'd. Realized that the player in front of him had no intention of backing down and they immediately from it preparing to give. A stern reprimand. He warned you. Do not disrupt the hope change hole. Feb what rock his sentence. A this expression suddenly chan. Just as the players in the hall noticed this scene. Expecting him to angrily. So Sauchan out. The next moment left him. Why he died in shock questioning their lives. Honorable Kian. G. Please forgive my previous rudeness. Ades to the pebratly. Ten immediately bow. A. A 90 degree angle to apologize. His rugged face turned red for some reason and even his bushy. Bear cold and teja id. It's alright. I didn't te mine. Sauchan said. Thank you for your generosity. My the gods of the characteria can't and always protect you. Ades trat en da. His attitude series. The surrounding players. Their mindset crumble. Why do we get scolded and beat them for just a little. Tim. Why is this guy not listening to you. Yet you reacting like a humble dog. Do you enjoy. Rebelling against. Your players. You old rascal. How wicked. At that moment. Many smart. Players had an epiphany. But unfortunately. For the next period. They suffered terribly for various. Prevocations. Against the professional mentors. On the other side. Sauchan. Having. Tested the effects of reputation. Naded in satisfaction. No wonder it's worship. You just look at this. Attitude. It's so. Proper. You want to accept a hot change task. Please give me an S level one. Sauchan got straight to the point. All I. I did talk a hard card from the table in front of him. Ready to. Tirita. But suddenly. G7. Dear Lord Yanja. Look. Got to the Yulan Goryan. Kill 30 ordinary LV-12 Grey Wolves. Is this task suitable? As soon as the words fell. Before Sauchan. Cold say anything. The surrounding players. I wrapped. What the hell. My friend. As the same task. But it's the lowest. Fegrade. You really are something. I. The. Actually picking the. Right. This. There must be some. Dirty. The all going on here. He refused to accept this. You. Shameless old man. I. The. Asikopan deserves no good. The crowd was indignant. Teirai's turning. Red with jealousy. Seeing the reactions around him. Sauchan immediately understood the trick. Asketan happily. Are you doubting my strengths. By giving me such an easy task. I'm sorry. I. The. Wipe the cold sweat from his forehead. Sincerely admitting his mistake. This team. I understood. The players didn't know that they're NPCs at their own information channels and naturally understood so. Chains past achievements of defeating the final demon god. If a cold kill the final demon god. How cold a simple first turn task pose any difficulty for him? I pulled out a card again. Dear lord. Senia. He was confused. Yous. Now. This is actually an S-grade hop change task. Joachun. Looked at the card. Which read. S-grade hop change task. Kill the LV-15 cat demon leader in the dark. Forest. Silver boss. Can form a two person team. The level. Suppression in the original is quite obvious. When a player is three level seager. The lower level player strength is reduced by about 30%. When five level seager. Which is the maximum suppression. They attributes are only at 50%. Of their usual stay. Anormally developed level 10 player would find it very difficult to take on a. Level 15 ordinary monster. Let alone a silver boss that is two level seager than an ordinary monster. A level 15 silver boss is something that basically no level 10 player can defeat. This task does seem like an S-grade. Fine. And accept it. Sao Chen nadie. And the next moment. A hair. The system prompt. Hop change task. Accept it. You stand. The cute girl who had kindly. Reminded him earlier suddenly master the character to step forward. U-me. Brother Yanja. Yal Soabe. This hop change task. Can you take me alone? You won't let you help for free. Yeeye pay you. In the original. The appearance of player characters corresponds to the real world. The cute girl. Day de. Little fairy about her head. She looked about 14 or 15 years old and was a FEMA. Warrior. Seeing that Sao Chen didn't respond immediately. Little fairy nervously beg on to explain. Yerisip dice segrade task away cargo. But ya been taken pretty. Y was planning to come and push the task today. And coincidentally run into you. Brother Yanja. Also taking distance. Distance can be done in a two person. Can you take me alone? Brother Yanja. After saying that. She carefully observed Yanja. As if a Friday girl. Refuse her. On the other side. Sao. Chen was also considering. Although this girl seemed quite a cute. At most she was just a stranger. Sao Chen didn't intend to help a stranger for no reason. But considering that the cute girl at previously. Reminded him not to anger the guy died. Although it didn't have a match effect. Except that her good way. Moreover. The main point was that with his current attributes. A cold basically instant kill the level 15 silver. Boss. So helping her out bold and teje. It would be a good deed for the day. So Sao Chen nodded. Okay. Thank you. Brother Yanja. Little fairy immediately sawed him a sweet smile. For. Sao Chen. Little fairy was a stranger. But for little fairy. Was it also a stranger? Challenging little fairy's decision to abandon the task. Was fundamentally due to a this unusual attitude. Which made. Her shamelessly cling to him. The player that had a fast with respect. Was definitely a big expert. She talked. She was so clever. No need to tag me. It was just a casual thing. Sao Chen wiped his hand. Dismissibly. In the cutting. It didn't take. Let's go now. Finish the quest quickly. And then have a some funny. The main city. Player leader. Firey request. To form a team with you. Do you agree? How Ching clicked agree. And to form that team. Let's go. Every nav is village in the human realm. As NPCs and maps. That are roughly the same. The server had been open for two months. And the information. About the level 15 silver boss. The cat demon leader. Was no longer a secret. How Ching. Found the information on the forum. In just a few minutes. The dark forest. Was located outside the. 7777 nav is village. And it would take a normal player. About alpha no or to. Walk there. As a boss. The level 15 cat demon leader. Spawned at random locations. In the dark forest. Not fixed. And refreshed once a day. For Sao Chen. The most teaming consuming part of this. Quest was finding the boss. If lag was on his side. A code finished in alpha day. If not. A code in TSA for sure. After all. The premise of instantly killing a boss. Was being able to find it. Right. It was worth mentioning. That on the way out of the village. Sao Chen noticed. A few sneaky players following him. Sure no. Used a Sao Chen. And little fairy. Reach the village entrance. From. The right direction. And where about. To get to the dark forest. A large group of red namet. Players suddenly jumped out. From the roadside. Leading them. Was the four players. From the bad guy family. That had just killed. Kid you killed or four. Brothers and you still want to hang around. In the 7777 nav is village. Player bad guy. Boss glared at Xiao Chen fiercely looking like a one to toy team whom we have 200. People here let's see how you escape a little fairy. Didn't know about Xiao Chen killing the four players. Earlier in the pan hearing the treat. She couldn't help but panica. It's to se vastars from the. Bad guy family. Brother Yanja. What sold we do? Sold we run? As the dark force of the. 7777 nav is village. The bad guy family is notorious reputation. Lon. Madden you be trembling fear. And little fairy was scared. Glancing at Xiao Chen. Noni. Xiao. Chun smiled nonchalantly. Turning to face the bad guy. Boss. You trash. You have some guts to steal. Appearing front of me. Ah. Boss. Is insulting us. Bad good. Tres turn to ask the. Boss and surprise. We have a full 200 players. Most of whom are a bad level 20. How can I know? Wasn't the. Even chained hopes be so arrogant? Jeje. Some people you don't know when they're going to die. Who knows? What's going on in that head of his. The bad good boss expression was sinister as is written. So. Chun again. No one dare is to mess with our bad good family in the. 7777 nav is village. However. Is it you have a unique bone? Structure. You're a promising player. Ye ye he be you a chance. Obediently. Take off all your equipment. And he be it to me. They let me kill you once more. And ye ye grit to let you join our guild. How about that? Be cause it have been killed instantly. Before. The bad guy. Boss felt the cold and test it. Rocks out. So he didn't plan to attack immediately. But instead resort it to threats and temptations. I believe that as long. As the other party was. The full. There was an 80% chance. They would agree to his proposal. After all. They had 200 people on their side. Of course. If he really wanted for. So. Obediently. Hanover. His equipment. And then. Once. Falling into a weekend. State. The bad guy. Boss. Will. Definitely go back on his word. And directly eliminate him. I wanted the other players in the. 7777. Nabis. Villar. To know the terrifying consequences. Of angering the bad. Guy family. But the bad guy. Boss. Beautiful dream. Was destined to be disappointed. Be cause. Sao Chen. West. All lastie to waste worse. And directly pulled out. The sword of the men thếchen preparing to take action. Oomp. Ungrateful. The villain boss fed in. statistic. West all lastie to play anymore schemes. Brothers of the willie names. Go first. Turn him into a red name. And then. We agreed to take him down together. The equipment on Sao Chen. Was extraordinary at first glance. And the villain boss. Was empty. Most of. The members of the villain family. Were red names. While the witty. Name plays. Were only in single digits. But they talked that was enough. As long as the other side acted first. They good also turn red. 10. When they died, their equipment would definitely draw. If the other side didn't act first, they would provoke them. Just as a was about to give the order to attack a dozen assassins hidden around South. Chen rushed at him together. If you don't resist, you will be killed. But if you fight back, you will inevitably encounter the with the name players among the assassins. At that time, haha, the villain boss. Talked was very clever. But the next moment, it couldn't help but question his life. In the game original, the human race is mainly divided into six professions, warrior, magic, priest, assassin, archer, and a very small number of hidden professions. Each profession can change. Hobbes at level 10, gunning four advanced classes. Stealth is a universal skill for assassins. And the four advanced classes represent four different development directions. But regardless of the development direction, they are all considered output professions with extremely ignores the magic and the natural talent for ambushes. The dozen or so level 20 and the babes as in players from the villain. Gilder originally talked that attacking down a level 10 newbie together would be an easy task. It was just a boss who was making a fast. We satis down fell soats, the next second, alte. Attacks landed on South. Chen. Swiss, Swiss, Swiss, Swiss. At this moment, we tell I. Flashed. The expressions of the assassin players turned to so as they. Disappealed one by one. How is this possible? Standing still and, and the counter killed us? The remaining hundred. Or so players from the villain guild why didn't they rise in disbelief. They completely didn't understand what had happened. When did getting hit also me and dealing damage? The little fairy beside. Cao Chunhua initially shown a tense expression as if facing a great enemy, her palms sweating. Was also dumbfounded at this moment. This is the true combat power of Rotary and Je? It was. So powerful that it was incomprensible. Only Cao Chen in the entire scene understood. What had happened? These people were all killed by the counter damage skill that came with the legendary. Equipment demon got chill. Skill. During passive skill. When attacked, reflect 20.% of your own at a damage. Lasting 30 seconds. With a cooldown of 60 seconds. Cao Chen's current at the tribute was close at a 100,000 points and with a 20% counter damage. That was 20,000 points of damage. A normal level 20 player at about 1500. HP, which meant the damage overflowed by more than 10 times. Haha. Tones counter damage. Hitting me is like hitting yourself. Cao Chen was delighted. Standing still and letting you hit me? Dammit. The villain boss shouted angrily. Emustabe so me precious equipment on him. Brothers, let's all go and kill him. That's right. It must be the effect of the equipment. God, it would be great if he drops. The remaining players of the villain family who had initially been intimidated by Cao Chen were now stirred by the villain basis. Words igniting third grid. The level 10 warrior at not learn the counter damage skill. Standing still and counter killing at a scenic level players at level 20. They called the team of any other reason besides the special effect of the equipment. And equipment effects. Generally have the cooldowns. Also the cooldown is over. Bolden Tate be easy to take him down. At this moment, they only felt regret that the with a name player among the assassins adaptability to causing the games peca system to determine that they had entered peca mode and dying bolden and the other. Name. As for what equipment the with a name player would drop a pande a it was a laptop la. Al talk they. Talk this way into the arts. They dim the for Hector and my entire own people. Everyone be careful. What until his equipment reflect the magical dawn is over then we each attack together. The little fairy talked of. The same thing as the bad we his family. She decisively ran in front of Cao. Senan said without. Looking back, Brother Qianji, you run quickly, and you hold them off. In her view, dying on sea and entering. A weekend stayed was uncomfortable, but it was much better than Qianji's equipment being destroyed. After all, Cao Chen was the key to whether her mission would be completed successfully. You little girl. Cao Chen was somewhat amused and also a bit touched. It had only been less than half an hour since they met and the little fairy had already decided to sacrifice herself to cover his retreat. A greatly appreciated a player who valued the safety of their team so much. Fine. You gave you a quicken. Cao Chen stepped forward, rushing his longsword towards the players of the Ba. We his family to protect the little fairy from being instantly killed. By you now now attacks. During the fight, he kindly activated his chill skill, Great Vortex Row. The chill, absorbing 30. percent of his health made the little fairy as safe as if she had learned the indestructible skills of a divine monk. Ten, amidst the little fire he surprised a a emobet his feet, instantly transforming. Into lightning, charging into the enemy crowd. He's extremely eager to give him an attack.

After used hugging. As I. Was it the cause of the difference in gender? The little fairy felt as. It's worth. Mentioning that a funer by enemy players attacking the opportunity to launch skill.

The little fairy. Ander sao chen speedless gas. Beganto pick up the pile of beat of our equipment that had fallen around her. In the player game forum. In the human. Race. Section. A post that shocked everyone suddenly appeared. Sockking. The original as a. Cheat. A level 10 warrior single-handedly wipes out 200 people in 3 seconds. Like a headline. From a certain browser sock department. It piqued the curiosity of players idly browsing the forum. Upon clicking into the post. The first thing that caught the eye was the original posters blow out and tears can plan. Hello everyone I'm an avi's player and the was fortunate to make a group of brothers. So from the moment we. Prepare to go out to level up to day game team and on at 10 o'clock I'm at a level 10 warrior. On the road with three good brothers with the intention of making friends we approached the top. Unexpectedly the other party directly attacked without a warfare attack power is really. Daming in the afternoon after resurrecting we urgently needed to farm for equipment so we gathered. About 200 brothers and prepared to go out to fight a boss however as we were leaving the. Village. We encountered that level 10 warrior who saw us and immediately charging without sign a war. We. Were 200 players above level 20. Yet in use 3 seconds we were wiped out by Iano. Damn. Who would believe it if we told them? Seeing this all the viewers from a. A. LV10 player in 3 seconds wiped out 200 LV20 players. It sounds like. Nonsense. Doente. It's. This guy can be a novelist. Canne? It looks pretty good. Quite interesting. The audience remained curious and continued watching. Although we brothers are a callet de ba. Guy family. We re actually used a bit playably. Still good players who love peace. Here. He. Strongly condemn the player with the idechania and reporting for cheating. Next is the video it is. My life to record. What? There is a video? Why didn't they you say so earlier? The audience. Eagerly opened it and 10 day were stand. The video was only a sort of 2 segments. The first style. Of the. Video. About 5 seconds long. So with a warrior holding an ancient long sword in his left. Hanan has shielding his right. Sweetly killing 4 players with a single strike. This warrior was. No neuter than south chen. What the hell? What kind of attack power is this? So fast. Called it. This some mysterious skill? This is terrifying. The audience was in so. If it. A band some flash skill. They make not a beben so surprise. But the player was the ideania in the video. Simply use the plan sword strike to slide 4. Strong enemies. The speed was used too fast. Like a hurricane. Fortunately. The video had a slow motion feature and everyone adjusted it too slow. down by 10 times. Next. They were. Stanished to see that the trajectory of the sword swing. Wes clearly used a normal attack. Called it be a powerful buff skill that increases attack speed. Someone. Speculated. I think you're right. This speed is terrifying. Normally. Who knows how much agility. It would take to achieve that. I wish you had that buff though. By the way. Didn't equal. Notice that. The 4 players who were killed were al red names. One of them must be the original poster. A red name still. Clams to be a friendly player. House Chambles. The first segment of the video was a king. But the many. You didn't forget the title and continued to watch the second video. The second segment was also. Only 5 seconds long. In the video. It was still the player named Senja. This. Time was a bustling crowd. The audience recalled the original poster signed there were 200 people. Here. At first glance. They were almost blinded by the dense red names on the screen. The audience. Wes momentarily stand. Is this it? The original poster adeudacity to. Both that to se who were cut down were al peace lab in place. What a blatant lie. The next moment. They saw the player and the green pripe. Instantly charging into the crowd. With his long soul. El forbar. His extremely weak movement speed seemed to live an afterimage in the air. And as a past. Ele. Bane flashes of purple lightning. Any player who accidentally touched it instantly turned it into streaks of witte. Lie. Used by it. Ashing back and forth in the crowd. Not a single red name player wesler. What the hell? What is this? A super soon? I'm dumb from the. This is boring. Turn off. The chi. Don't turn it off. It's kitty. Interesting. After watching the video. He looked at the. Warrior brother next to me and kicked him away. I'm used curious. Why is my team mat so bad when we re. Both warriors. This post caused a sensation on the game forum. And it was until on before it was pinned by. The administrator. Allowing more players to see. Countless players rushed in. What the total of 10. Seconds of video. Until. Instantly erupted. South chance this plat personal combat. Power in the game exceed the Berione's imagination. A bad that double speed while also enhancing stats. What was that lightning flash that cold killed the equipment the war at its effects turn it off. But it was clearly not ordinary. What level of equipment was that cold they couldn't understand why a. Level 10 newbie called be so ridiculously strong especially for players of the warrior. Classic was even more heartbreaking. The gap between them and the opponent felt like that between a baby. And a grown up hook as for the original poster claiming that this player chenya was cheating. Because the origin is monitored by the top tier intelligence system which absolutely eliminates. Any possibility of cheating. Not even the major developers of the game called the exceptions. Compared to the. intelligence system. The major officials seemed more like powerless agents. So no one. Believe it. The audience was both astonished by Sao Chen's combat power in trying to rush in the leaks plan the. Recent. Some aboutly speculated that perhaps Sao Chen was the mysterious player who had shocked the. Entire server by achieving the first kill of the level 200 musical boss. The final demon. Others guessed the was used one of the lucky players among those billion. A reply. From a certain time. Floor received the most likes. Everyone. Don't make a fuss. Think about players like madman.

But that to admit her voice at this age was quite pleasant. Saochun's mouth twit. Feeling like an evil uncle. It's okay. You already deserved it. So ye ye used call. You master from now on. The little fairy said with a cute expression. Whatever you want. After a. Bit of idle chatter. It was telling before the to arrived at the dark forest. However, they didn't expect that. As soon as they stepped into the map. A dozen players suddenly jumped up. The proud. And mighty gill. Is on business. Alba Eastenders get lost. The pride of the heroes guild is one of the top 10 guilds. In the original as a considerable number of players in over a thousand nabies villages in the smine. Cities within the human faction. It was perfectly normal for them to appear in nabies village. Number 7777. Saochun didn't expect that while doing a quest a good coincidentally. Encounter players from the pride of the heroes. Guilt clearing the area. Altaug had no grievances. With this guild the tone of the leader was quite a displacement to him. Master. It's the pride of the heroes people. Let's retreat. The little fairy swarled heart. Feeling intimidated. Before Saochun cold respond. The leading player chuckled smugly. That's more likely to say who know the times are wise. 10. Shifting his gas. A. Looked at Saochun with a greedy glint in his eyes. Unstreatened. Meeting his fa. Why don't you take off your mind. And secondary weapons and hibed them to me. Who knows. If we're happy. We meet even recruit you into the pride of the. The. Heroes. A initially talk the two. Were somewhat sensible and was about to tell them to scram. But the pan. Seeing Saochun's equipment. A suddenly felt a surge of grief. As children Alonso. Alto. The special effects were turned off. Judging by the surface patterns. They sold into the ordinary items. Such good equipment on a level. This newbie would be a waste. This is a opportunity. What do you say. You should know. We are the strongest shield among the humans. Siao. Chen merely scoff. A. The fengming guild bolden te agree with da. Seeking da. The ladders expression chand used to level. The snows. Brothers. Let's take action. In the game world. Killing and looting were common. If there was a disagreement. They would just start fighting. The leader considered himself not a good person and talked da. Facing a little newbie. A cold kill without worrying about negative impacts on the guild. Saochun at long. Felt displaced and seeing the situation. A chart for bark without a second toe. In an instant. Blades. Flashed. Son. More than a dozen players from the pride of the heroes. Guild fell one after. An other. The ground was littered with equipment. Master. This is going to be trouble. The little fairy. Fretty. Saochun had already adapted to defeating opponents of eager levels and was no longer shocked into. A stupor. Like before. She was only worried about retaliation. It's all been noted that the. Pride of the heroes. Guild was not the same as a villianos guild. The two were not on the same level at all. Ordinary. Players were hardly worth mentioning in front of a powerful force like the pride of the heroes. Guild. The more she talked about it. The more anxious she became. Murmuring worriedly. When we return to the village. Will. There be thousands of players ganging up on us. Saochun shot her a glance. What are you afraid of? If they dare to come. Yeye just kill them. The little fairy. All right. She had to believe in her. Master strengths. The pride of the heroes. Guild won't declare the area without reason. And the most. Valle belting in the dark forest was the level 15 silver boss. With this in mind. Saochun. Continued walking deeper into the dark forest. The little fairy. Heri tokepa. Before. Long. They heard a kemouschen ahead. What came into view was a group of about 150 players. Serounding three individuals. In the center of the crowd. The cat demon leader was strolling. Li Cherli. Master. In autoce tree. They are a good people. The little fairy recognize some familiar faces. And urgently pleaded. Master. Let's save them. Saochun glanced over and saw the ideas above the tree. Eternal big gile. The brother. And daco. The first to wear male priests. And the third wesa. Female archer. Struggling under the sea of over a hundred members of the pride of the heroes. Guild. Friensa. Front. The pride of the heroes. Guild is conducting business. To see who know what's good for them. So live quickly. Or we won't be polite. A warrior player. Seemingly the commander. Sterling warned us. Spotted Saochun. And the little fairy approaching. What if he don't? Saochun's expression. Remand and chan. The words of this person. Iretat idim. What do is it me and to know what's good? The members of the Aussie guild. Are it oh arrogant? Hey. It sends. You ready liberically looking for trouble? It didn't they want to. Make a move. But you brought this on yourself. Brothers charge. After the previous dozen or so. Peripheral players were killed. They had already informed the commander of Saochun's presence. Initially thinking they could quickly take down a dozen level 20 players. Which would be tricky. The commander. Why? Preparing to the all with the boss. Was not planning to let things go and intend it to italy. After returning to the village. However. Since the guild's reputation didn't take time to the other side. Eccouldn't. The. Be better to waste more words and directly collect some people over to start the fight. Eccouldn't believe. Data level 10 player called be so formidable. Kill. Saochun was not polite and rush his. Sword to attack. Thunderstead. The minion power. Unmatched dance. Amon alto se. Present. Saochun was already invincible and with this skills activated his killing speed. Sell dramatically. In the blink of an eye. He had sent the other side into chaos. Kian Ji. He remembered you. What for the Aussie guilds. Rebend the commander said fiercely Hiao. Chen's coughed and sent him back to the city for free. Thus not a single member of the Aussie guild was. Left standing meanwhile Hiao Chen's name was glowing red with blood. Thank you brother. The three people in the scene originally surrounded by over a hundred big level players. Talked they were. Dune today but unexpectedly the situation took a turn out of nowhere. A fierce player appeared. And easily achieved a hundred player kill brother young un. He asked my master to save you. You saw tack me too. The little fairy bounce over. Oh it's you. Girl. Young hon slowly. Rebilled a smile and was not pretentious. Then thank you. No need to tack me. He helped to say. Need. The little fairy pat her chest. Looking proud. Young hon. The abroter. And aseo. Exchange glances and then burst into laughter. At the same time they felt completely. Relaxed. Saochun had been so fierce earlier that they were afraid to make take them out too. Now that the familiar little fairy was here. They were not as wary. Alright. I'm going to fight the boss now. Sao. Chen walked towards the cat demon leader. Seeing this. The little fairy happily followed. Master. Yeeje helped you. Sao Chen walked his hand without looking back. No need. Use the stand aside and watch. The little fairy. Feeling ejected by the side. Her face turned red and she pretended to be. Nonchalant as she looked at the other tree. So. Brother Young hon. How did you end up here? Are you. Also planning to fight the cat demon leader? The trickle didn't help but chuckle. And John gul. Swylda CC. Yeeah. Didn't expect the plan to change. The little fairy has kept curiously. Eh? You guys. Are only level 15. And you dare to take on a silver boss. We choose 3 people. Asa level 15 silver boss. The cat demon leader had big attack power. Fast speed. And the Oe group. Attack skills. Makin. It quite travel. Seem. Normally. At least 30 players have a level. 15 gold. Vine to take it down. And the little fairy didn't understand why. John gul. And the others dare to come and fight the boss. Because we have her skills. The trick's chance glances. And the seeded to be anis. A few days ago. We completed a hidden quest and it done an excellent silver level skill which is very powerful. I'm a holy priest and the skill. I got his resurrection. The brother got a group. Damaged redaction skill. And a kao got a buff to increase a critical hit. Chances we can see there did and are confident. We can take down this boss precious skills. Are a secret for every player and are rarely mentioned. John gul. One and the others actually am to form a fix. The man seeing how fierce hea o chung was wanted to invite him alonso de use their skills to increase the bargaining power. The holy priest in simple terms is the healing the team with decent healing abilities and the source of their resurrection skills is one among a thousand holy priests having even one is key to the this germant actually belongs to the tank role in the team possessing skills that mantans table agro and provide the skills for dentire party along with a rare damage reduction skill which greatly benefits the team. As for the archer a keos kille agliay it's a precious bar. The increases the critical hit rate for dentire the am significantly enhancing the output of damage dealing. Classies. Critical hits and critical damage are hidden attributes in the original? No. Display directly. This make very lati to the degree of freedom in the game. Both players and monsters. A be weaknesses. A skill player even with used a 10% chance. Critical hit chance can land critical hit several team. An abyss player even with a 99% chance. Want a viable to make much use of it. However, a qse agliay buff can raise the critical hit chance of place. Indeteando 100% for the duration of the buff. Thus, even if they hit a monster's toy, it would still be a critical hit. The increase for damage dealing classes is terrifying. Therefore, the three members of the eternal great heal are a very confident in their decision to invite Sao Chen to play together. On the other side, Sao Chen slowly walk towards the Cat Demon leader. Cat Demon. Leader level, LV15, Silver Boss, EAL, 10,000-10,000. Attack. 1,000 Dual Defense, 500 kills. Expandable, LV1 triple claw, LV1 poison. Cloud, LV1 fury, LV1 deadly movement status, good. DLV15 Silver Boss as. Only 10,000 EAL points, and its defense is not impressive. So how you can't be bothered to study the key points of its skills. A walk to bear and deliver the directs last to its head. His boss. Minus 10,000. A clean and swift strike with his milieu. Damage output easily. One shot. Damuman adventure, it will return. After delivering a line, the Cat Demon leader collapsed simultaneously. Dropping three pieces of equipment and a skill scroll. Ho Chen picked them up and found a branch staff and two pieces of beat the board. Armor, or worthless items. Which it tossed into his backpack. The skill scroll was for a secondary profession, and learning it will. Grand. The secondary profession, basic alchemy. Sao Chen talked for a moment and also toast. It into his backpack. The secondary profession sin the original are alestrange and buried it. And this scroll can only unlock the alchemist's secondary profession. What kind of potions can be? Made depends on other blueprints. Overall, it's a profession that requires a lot of money and effort. And Sao Chen had no interest in it. While Sao Chen was examining the loot, the four members of Obnervai were. Alsthan. One sore, one shot. Damage over 10,000. Holy crap. They. Murmured in so. The little fairy was slightly better. She had long estimated that Sao Chen's combat. Power had already surpassed the limits. Althogs she had never talked about once shotting a silver boss. Before. Considering who was doing the attacking, she wasnted to a surprise. The little fairy felt that if her. Master told her a cold fly now, she would believe it. The emotional fluctuations of the. Other three were much greater. Previously, when Sao Chen was playing the 100-man slaughter, Althogs it was a. Complete demenation, they had only estimated his combat power to be a BT, with reasons like. Attaining some powerful hidden skills being accepted. After all, a LV-15 player has. Around 1,500 alt points, and with low defense, it's understandable if a strong output common. Siota grew. This was also the fundamental listen they had self-destruct skills and were preparing. To invite Sao Chen to te ama. They used never expected that a cold also on Siota 10, 000 e alt silver. Boss. When they saw the minus 10,000 number pop a pebab de cat demon ladders g. They called hardly believeteer eyes. A questionerous in the minds of the three, do we even qualify to be his. Team mats? Great god, can you add me as a friend? As on as a ocean approach, the archer girl. A co immediately escaped nervously. If they called nte be come team mats, they called at least cling to the big xio. Like the little fairy. They called nte doi. Every day, but you stonce at a critical moment would be. And now, all right, you, sao Chen nadid in agreement. Earlier, two boy travel. Ea. Close the friend request channel and called only adoders proactively. Ea dalso overherty. Conversation with the little fairy. Keeping a friend's lot open for such a promising player bold nte be a. Mista. The request was sent out and quickly pro. After pandering for a moment, ha chintze. Is it you real solo players? When we get to the main city, e plan to create a guild. Are you? In? In the world of original, some especial dung geon sabe entry requirements based on the number of participants. If there are nte no players, entry is denied. So a guild need to find some team matsuneror. Later. So chun talk that rater dan joining a guild and following someone else's orders, it would be better to create his own. Ea dalredi talked out the future development path for the guild. If they were to go, they would go the elite route. Not many members, but they had one of the big shot. So even to pay. Atención to potential talents encounter. The three from eternal milk at good potential. Of course we all join. A guild created by the great god. Ea eternal milk will definitely join. The three happily agreed, believe that they could connect with the great god. What about me? Master, save a spot for me. The little fairy looked at sao chun with anticipation. We all talk about it later, no ruse. When they returned to turn in the s level hop change quest. The little fairy would likely receive a rare skill as a reward, so she was also a potential talent. But if her. Potential baste no, they would use to beto wa. Ding dong. Player little fairy can great elations. On completing the s level hop change quest. The quest reward, golden level, skill book. Ea tof the warrior, has been issued to your backpah. Please check it yourself. Used after turning. In her hop change quest, the little fairy heard the system notification and immediately smiled with joy. Master, he got a golden level. Skill book. Swambu City. President, that guy is. To despicable. Killing over a hundred of our brothers for no reason. He can't stand the. The squad leader. Who had used been wiped out by. Sao Chen initiated a voice communication with the president of the proud. And mighty guild, emperor. As a leader from an abyss village. Losing over a hundred guild members men. At least a month of weakness severely impacting player leveling and monster hunting. Ea to. Report the details of this incident of his appearance. So, in the initial voice communication. A briefly summarize the events. You resign a LV. This player instantly wiped out your time. Of over a hundred LV. 20 players. Was there it a change? Emperor suddenly recalled the. A pro on the forum. His eyes flashing. Yes, that's the guy. The squad leader greeted his. This. Emperor pandered for a moment and said. He understand. You all proceed as planned and done. Worry about him for now. After giving his orders. Ea unabdecal. We such a. Kemo uschen on the forum. It was only natural that someone had reported the matter to him. Initially. Emperor. Schered the same sentiment as most viewers. Thinking that the player was the. Ida chandu was used an. Insignificant lucky player who would return to be in an. O. Bonse de unabdecal. Va. Now it seems that the and all the spectators have a guest wrong. After defeating that group of scum from the Ea board. Guild. A considerable amount of team has passed before heading into the dark forest. Can a. Va. Flast this long? It seems unlikely. The emperor pandered feeling that the opponent might be more. Than used a lucky player. However. Regardless. The opponent had killed a large number of. Players from his guild and they must be prepared to face their retaliation from the largest human guild. As the. Guild leader. Whether for the question of the guild or his own position. It would never show leniency. However. This matter is tricky and requires careful planning. In the Nabys Villar number. 7777. The little fairy looked at the newly. Appeared skill in the skill is done. Excitedly set to Sao Chen. Gold level skill. Warrior CR. Aura type. Lv1 effect. Adds affixed. Buff of plus 300. To all attributes for all teammates. Within a range of 1000 yards. Lasting 30 seconds. Cede 120 seconds. Master. This skill is to overpower. Sao Chen's failed lightly and nadid in agreement. As expected of a gold level. Skill. It has. Such a powerful effect at Lv1. Affixed attribute of 300. Tackin a Lv30. Player as an example. Not considering equipment bonuses. The 4 dimensional attributes would be. 30x5 free attribute points from leveling gap. Plus 30x10 fixed attribute growth from leveling. Up equals 450 points. This still considers the maximum benefit of a leptan free attribute points added to a single attribute. In fact. To where some equipment and skills the. Big way are certain attributes. No player good are to alecate altere attributes to one. At this moment. The power of the little fire is gold level skill buff is 7. It effectively doubles the panel. Stats. With such a powerful buff at Lv1. Just look at how much it is at Lv2. Sao. Chun. Press on the little fire is shoulder and as kept in a low voice. Okay. Let me see. The little fairy look carefully and immediately trembled with excitement. Upgrading to Lv2 increases. Al attributes by 1200 points. 4x the ground. Sao Chun nadie. Secretly. Marvelling at the little fire is good luck. With this skill. The little fairy would be sought after by Yanni. Guild Shijoin. Master. You sold complete your quest. Oh. The little fairy looked at Sao. Chen eagerly. Wanting to see what his quest reward was. Oh. Like. Sao Chun smiled in. Agreement. Turned. Unspoken with side. Submitting the quest. Din. You have completed the level. First hop transfer quest. Din. Your power has been detected to exit 100.000. Points. Quest reward chan to. Destroyer hop transfer voucher x1. The system chimet wise. Immediately. A crimson scroll appeared in Sao Chun's backpack. Destroyer. That name is. Powerful. Is it a hidden class? Sao Chun was curious and quickly took out the hop transfer. Voucher to examine it closely. Master. What is this? The little fairy looked over. Curiously. It's a hop transfer voucher for a hidden class. Sao Chun said lightly. What? A hidden class? The little fairy was excited. Currently. Among the 100.000 players in the original. There might not even be one hidden class. They had sareto small. And the power of hidden classes is well recognized among players. The little fairy never expected. That her master would also become a hidden class. But after thinking about it. She suddenly felt a bit and balance incide. Why is it that both of them completed quests and she only received a gold level. Skill? Book while her master got a hidden class transfer voucher? Is it because she is handsome? The little fairy felt them just happy and a bit indignant for herself. On the other side. Sao. Chun had already began to observe the detail description of the destroyer's hidden class. Item. Class change voucher. Destroyer. Destroyer class introduction. The childhood profession of. The legendary war god alien from Karatria. Which can be upgraded to the menete of the continent at the. Second transfer and to war god at the tiered transfer. Defensive type. With many skills. The. Grat invulnerability. A vast attack range. And I grow potential for skill attack bonuses. It inherently possesses hat attributes. Automatic richanges class pan use. The. Description on the skill transfer voucher can dance only a few lines. The profession of war god alien. Sao Chun's got his head somewhat puzzle. And I know nothing about the legends of the gods in the. Karatria continent. Fortunately. There was a respectful NPC nearby. So a turn of his. Mentor. E. E. Do you know about war god alien? Basta his childhood profession. Caillette destroyer? Upon hearing this. It immediately became excited. Gesturing and immediately. As a warrior. Class. How could I not know about the war god alien among the gods? War god alien. One of the. Legendary gods of Karatria. P. C. C. Combat power that surpasses a lot of the. It is known. As the strongest man on land. 3.000 years ago. A gun fame by single-handedly. Facing three. A visual demons during the invasion of the abyss. It immediately began to recount the legends of war. God alien in Karatria. This could be considered the game's background story. It's important to know. That without the information obtained from the game background of the original. Everyone was completely. In the dark. So not only Sao Chun and the little fairy. But the other players in the class change hall also. Gathered curiously around. Thus. From its narration. The scene of the war among the gods gradually. Unfolded before everiones eyes. Legendas it that 3.000 years ago. There were only three factions. On the Karatria continent. Humans. Elves. And Celestials. Although there were frictions among them. The. World was relatively peaceful. With very few large scale wars occurring. However. Everything chanted when. The two major factions of demons and orcs suddenly emerged from the void. As to extremely warlike rasis. They planned the karate a continent into a state of endless warfare. And eventually. Many gods from the five. Many gods from the five. Major races descend to participate in the war. They were lasted for 10 years. Leaving the. Continent in ruins and countless lives lost. Thus. The gods agreed to a final battle among the. Gods to end the devastation to the continent. This battle was of fears that it darkened the skies. And split the karate a continent into. With countless gods falling and entering a long slumber. Among them. The human war got a alien. Due to a series of extraordinary performances. Even many to counter it. And severely injured five. A visual lords from the demon race. Earning the title of the strongest on land. Unfortunately. War got a alien's brilliant performance. Echode the attention of the demon factions leader. The final demon god. Who personally intervinto in his life. At the same time. It also. Incited the anger of the strongest figures among the humans. Elves. And Celestials. The top few from. The two factions engaged in a chaotic battle. But in the end. They are went missing and never repiare. It was quite eloquent. Telling the story vividly. The surrounding players unconsciously opened their mouths. Staring away the eye. My goodness. So the background story in the original is this powerful? Woman. War got. Elven queen. Celestial lore. Wow. Echode the world. I really want to meet these ultimate figures. If only Echode learn even one of their moves. The players were discussing animatedly. This was their fears. Timmy hearing about the background story of the original. They were all trembling with excitement. Resources in the real world that long been exhausted. And as the game the original housed the OP for the continuation of human life. It was estimated that future players. Four generations to come a good life here. Rather than being a virtual game. It was more like a second world for humanity. The more. One understood the original. The smoother their life would become a making it easier to see opportunities. So they were unable to get into excitement. On the other side. Adik included his remarks. Regarding Sao Chen's. Question. In legend. The god of war. Alan. At the profession of. Destroyer in his use. It is said that only one destroyer can exist in the same era and one can't and the. Inheritance of the god of war. Alan. Through trials. So. The destroyer is the strongest profession. Among first-tier warriors. Sao Chen's. Samerais. I'll talk the stories of the gods of Karatria. Where captive at the thing. The most important thing was still the hope change. Yes. Esteemed Lord Sinju. I.e. the. Nadie deferment to bleed and hesitated for a moment before a coach she's asking. My yes. Lord Sinju. Are you planning to change to the profession of destroyer? A. Master's hidden profession. Is destroyer? The little fairy came to her senses, staring blankly at Sao Chen. The. Atencion of the surrounding players also inevitably turn it towards them. They adduced her the legends of the. Gods and knew about the profession of Alan, who was known as the strongest on land in his use. They were filled with. Interest regarding the destroyer who called ultimately advanced to become the god of war. Moreover, I idea. Also mentioned the inheritance of the god of war. To the players, the so-called inheritance referred to the. Most precious items in the game, such as equipment and skills. However, I idea. Also mentioned that. Only one destroyer could emerge in a single era. All opportunities were likewise limited to use. One. Upon hearing Sao Chen's words. Many players immediately. Pert up. They are tracing. We's anxiety. Were they about to be outpast? They hadn't forgotten that it was this player. Senja. Who first brought up the destroyer profession and the god of war. Alan. To mentor aide. Under. Everiones watch felice. Facing guides. Excited. In Wairi. Sao Chen calmly. Nudid and readily. Admitted. That's right. In the. It possesses a scroll for the profession change to destroyer. Silence. The atmosphere in the profession change hall instantly fell into. A dead silence. Many. Players stare blankly. As if they had lost their souls. After a long while. We sides. Congratulations. Lord Senja. The place erupted. Damn. My heart hurt so much. Only one destroyer can. Exist in the same era. He strongly refused to accept this. Why is take me. We was. Seeking comfort. Seeking to cling to a strong leg. At this moment. A group of about a dozen people. Approach from the periphery of the players. Led by the squad leaders of the Aussie. Guild. Who had been away. Out by Sao Chen in the dark forest. Senja. That scroll for the profession change to destroyer in you. Han. Our Aussie guild wants it. Name your prize. As long as you say the scroll to our guild we. Can overlook the fact that you killed us before him. Moreover the guild will always recognize you as. A friend if you refuse to say then you will be your enemy as soon as the squad leader. Appeared spoke. Eregently the surrounding players couldn't help but slowly retreat a few. Steps the Aussie guild is was one of the two most powerful guilds in the human faction and they. Were not to be trifled with everyone wanted to see if Senja would choose to compromise in the face of such a. Behemoth surely a good right after all. Becoming an enemy of the Aussie guild was no. Small matter. Ordinary players would basically be unable to play anymore. Emits the recent fell. Gases of the crowd. Sao Chen disdan fell at the squad leader. Who do you think you are? Dare. To set in me? Damn. Big shot. You actually dare to insult someone from the Aussie guild. Osev. The ordinary players on the periphery immediately beg and touch. Decene of alone. Hero standing against. A large guild excited the mall. The squad leaders express in darken. Instantly. Warning the surrounding ordinary players with a glance. Once they quieted down. E turn it back to Sao. Chun. Setning glissain. Senja. Y admit you are strong. But our enemies in the Aussie guild have been never. Had a good ending. Have you talked distro? 10. As if feeling the stacks bear and taken over. Continued. By the way. This is the original statement from our president. Yope you understand the. Importance of making choices. Our president also said that as long as you sell the hub transfer boccierto. Im. The Aussie guild's right team will have a place for you. The surrounding ordinary players immediately became. Excited. The Aussie guild's right team? That could be considered the top team in the game. Dominating gliss level dungeons and outdoor bases. Which are basically within the grasp of these elite teams. 4. Casual players entering such a team would be a kind to reaching the heavens in one step. Though. Everyone exchanging a hub transfer voucher for this qualification seemed like a good deal. However. Unfortunately. The protagonist of this matter was not them. Everyone couldn't help but look at Sao Chun. How would they choose? Timeriguan's 10 minutes. Just a Sao Chan and the little fairy. Return to the 7777. Navis Vila. The team leader of the AOC guild received the news. Had instructed several as employers to follow the two. Al talk the guild president. Emperé. Explicitly stated not to come from the other party for now. Necessary balance actions. Still a B. Take. First. To grasp the movements of the other party and prepare for future retaliation. Second. To see if the other party was genuinely strong or just a face. Third. To assess the other parties opportunities and see if they could assist them. So. When the warrior mentor AID was speaking at length. The information was related to the team leader by the monitoring assassin. Upon hearing it was about. The background story and the original. The team leader immediately reported the information to empere. Thus. When he learned about the power of the destroyer class and data player name it. Chenji. P. C. Stahaw. Transfer voucher. Emperor order. The team leader to wire the voucher at all costs. If necessary. They called certain the other party in the name of the guild. In the 7777 Navis Villages. Professional hall. Many players were closely watching Sao Chun. Waiting for him to make a choice. First we saw Rao Seguil's. This guy sold compromise. Right. The team leader talked smugly. However. A cold voice shattered his fantasy. It refused. Under everiones gas. Sao Chun said. Decisably. The team leader's expression darkened suddenly. Gritting his teeth as a chenji. Don't. Push your la. The strength of Rao Seguil is not something a casual player like you can contend with. You have a anicense. Hanover the hub transfer voucher. Otherwise. At that moment. A clear FIMA. Voice interrupted the team leader. Otherwise. What will you do? An other group of about 10 players slowly woke. In from outside. Everyone looked. Over and saw that this group of players was a female. The one speaking was a poised female mage. Clearly the leader. The AOC guild really a someneur. Settling casual players in public. Aren't you afraid of your guild's reputation? Becoming. Notorious? The other female players being here were immediately filled with raiches indignation. Yes. AOC. You really have a no sham. Settling ordinary players. Is that something a person? Kando? The AOC guild has always been. This shameless or fungming guild will never. Agree. Exactly. You guys are disgusting. This small group that adused their aived was in the place. From the fungming guild. Damn. It's actually players from the fungming guild. Now Teresa. Good show to watch. The surrounding casual players became excited. As the two most powerful. Guilds recognized by the human race fast off. No one expected it to be so laively. A. Doe so. AOC guild need you to teach us how to do things? The team leader said this damnfully. The female mage. Turned to Saochen and smiled. Sine. Don't be afraid. They reused a bunch of paper tigers. If they want to bully. Casual players. They need to see for fungming guild degrees. Saochen. To be honest. A wess. A bit surprised. The people from the AOC guild were threatening him so arrogantly. And they was. They prepared. To let it slide. If it weren't for the group of female players from fungming guild era even used in. Time. A gul dabe already taken action. For now. A decided to watch and see how things unfolded. On the. Other side. The captain of the AOC guild was. Shouted in exasperation. Hune reyn. Do you want to. Start a war with our AOC guild? Hune reyn. The female mage. Scof this damnfully. Start a war. You little loser. Have the right to say that? You better call your guild leader. The emperor. Over. You. The captain of the AOC guild trembled with anger. His mouth opening and closing. But the. Colden theater award.

Sc ground. them right the atmosphere on the scene exploded with players enviously looking at saw chaining the center of the crowd this guy must have a charge for the legendary b right did they have privileges this was too much we also want to charge for at this talk the casual players couldn't help but shed tears of bitterness w what's going on with you can't you see a kill or boss why aren't you talking about teaching a lesson an angry player from the proud guild pointy data ide originally they were furious about their boss de a batte pan realizing that the other party dare to kill in front of an npc de alpani originally they plant a watuntil eda it to loot the draft equipment but what happened the npc no only remand in different battles oscou did their leader for seeking de a the players of the oustchi gil instantly lost their campoucher they dared not bend their anger at saw chen feeling that they would not be satisfied with used killing their leader and would come after them next they all knew they had already died once dying again would not only extend their weakness period by a nother month but also produce the current levels experience by 20% which they could not afford so they turn their targets to aid herling insults at him are you brain dead what's going on is it your father why aren't you making a move you son of a turtle chao and i ma god is there some kind of study the all going on he refused to accept this amidst the barry of insults its expression saw it no change a simply exerted force with his feet instantly sending the players who adused insulted him fly as tse player soared into the air they transformed into streaks of with a light disappearing into the sky clearly heading to the resurrection point insulting the mentor judy said to die either iman calm as if adused don is something trivial the surrounding players were immediately in an approach to them sao chen was killing people a ide was indifferent and the players of the australian were cursing a ide only to be killed by him this was simply double standards it even seemed like a was somewhat helping sao chen was singe i'm convinced this loser used once to ask does the boss still take disciples may ask how can he reach your level the casual players looked at sao chen eagerly this was a true boss a cold kill whoever wanted completely disregarding the situation killing in front of npcs and the npcs even helped him so impressive this island female players of the fengming guild also shining eyes staring intently at sao chen without blinking they talked sao chen was used to handsome the leader of the small team from the fengming guild lu just ran also sparkling eyes you bunch of trash go back and tell the emperor sao chen and at the remaining players of the australian guild unspoken attracting everiones attention if you have any skills bring it on if you frown consider it my loss was this a declaration of a a player declaring war on one of the top 10 guilds the scene was so surreal de casual players felt like they were in a dream it was like a general cladding armor shouting come fight at the enemy thousands of troops before charging forward so so king wow b news bosky and g is amazing amazing a solo player reaching the height of bosky and g this life is not in ban no doubt from now on bosky and g is my idea he wonder if the boss plans to create a guild in the future if edo is yeye definitely find a way to join the players wherein a frenzy discussing excitedly meanwhile the remaining few fees of the australian guild fled in disgrace seeing this lu just ran step forward looking at sao chen with a complex expression originally xiao wu said you were threatened by the australian guild asking us to come help you but it seems we were overly sentimental xiao wu that must be feng cheng wu write sao chen nadi you appreciate the goodwill but too much bullying in swanbu city the headquarters of the australian guild the president the emperor slam his palm on the table in anger the team leader responsible for the 7777 newbie village used to inform them of the situation a casual player actually dare to look down on us like this this matter is far from over the reading the envelope is filled with righteous indignation president this can't be so arrogant so we gather a large number of members and retaliate that's right a solo player dare to read on our heads if we don't do anything what face will our guild have left if this gets out who will still think we are one of the top 10 guilds this matter is definitely not over we must let everyone know the consequences of provoking or guilt the emperor toca the breath his expression dar let's issue a bounty first for now don't act rashly the bounty is merely a reward issued by large guilds and those notable official effects npc factions will directly ignore it as long as the bounty is even though there will always be countless greedy players dreaming of the alt who will go after the targets on the bounty list these tactics been tried and tested by large guilds again solo players but to say in the right time still felt it but they know is this it is they to lie it think our guilds all take action ourselves shut up the emperor impassently explained this pleasure is not simple at level 10 echo this elite kilo version level 20 players have you ever seen someone so abnormal now is about to change to a hidden class like destroyer which will definitely be even more troublesome even though whether the players looking for him for the bounty will be useful but if they can at least slow down his progress that would be good what we need to do now is to level up quickly random geons and enhance the guilds again strengths we can take any risks after the speech everyone looked at the achotering confusion the members of the right time did not expect the emperor to take the other party so seriously this made them somewhat unconvinced when it came to individual strengths they were confident they were not inferior to anyone and did not understand why the leader made such a decision however they always followed orders which left them all silent let him jump around for now after the second hope change we will take action ourselves the emperor said coldly used then a member of the right time suddenly started shouting for some reason dumb you guys look a the level leaderboard but strong the others were somewhat annoyed by his sudden outburst but instinctively opened the leaderboard a pan seeing it they were instantly done because on the level leaderboard for the human region the person at the top was completely dominated by one individual human level leaderboard first place cn lv50 destroyer world level leaderboard first place cn lv50 destroyer boom a stone stirred up a thousand waps then tira right time in the conference room why didn't take a scene disbelief then you have a successfully chunked to a first hope destroyer then you have a time to destroyer skill book charge area bomb hand bomb iron claw flying impact then you have a automatically leveled up leveling create a set of lv11 then you have a automatically leveled up leveling create a set of lv12 then you have automatically leveled up leveling create a set of lv50 then you have a reach lv50 you can continue to level up after the second hope change then side quest activity please find the second hope change quest mentor added in the jun minmas then you have a tap the level leaderboard would you like to hide your idea sao chun himself did not expect this after using the hope scroll and successfully changing hopes his level instantly jumped from lv10 to lv50 but thinking about it it made sense there is anewest act at lv10 before aewest date and the change hopes the game settings were there experience would not stop being unused because it and the change hopes instead it became a store experience after two months of the server being open the final demon god at level 200 had allowed his experience to reach 32 8 billion so when the hope change was successful and the broke through to lv11 it was only natural that a good jump straight to lv50 in one go considering that a cold and the height of grade in front of everyone it chose not to hide his idea on the system prompt for topping the leaderboard however a cold understand why a cold level up to 50 but the other players in the professional hall simply cold and the camp behind the big shot is this an upgrade when the first player began to look at sao chen we send me next everyone was done in the crowd sao chen was completely enveloped in the systems prompt sounds wave after wave of with the light descended from the sky endlessly as if a eaten some chewing gum never stopping this was the upgrade effect the game had been live for two months so the players present were naturally familiar with it but was this a bug why was it continuous when the with the light finally stopped a curious player instinctively cast an identification spell on sao chen id level lv50 profession destroyer physical attack magical attack physical defense magical defense strength agility dueto the outrageous attributes sao chen had long set his panel display to show everything as a question mark except for the level but that was no wow lv50 directly dominating the level leaderboard the player was unfounded completely stand what leaderboard the surrounding players were taken aback quickly reacting and opening the own systems leaderboard the next second the holy rapti wow wow wow big shot just leveled up to 50 this is too ridiculous you can trap my head around the damn yes pentamont used overly rich lv20 and the big shot instantly leveled up to 50 ah i'm going crazy big shot i'm begging you for guidance how did you doy this n was simply unbelievable the players deeply understood the difficulty of leveling up in the game original 1 ordinary player working hard to grind monsters and complete quests would need at least 2 weeks to reach level 20 and at least a month or reach level 30 even if they plat 24 hours a day even for large deals with abandoned resources leveling from lv10 to lv30 would take at least a month but that's how it went from lv10 to lv50 in 10 seconds or was it 20 seconds it didn't matter the two major level leaderboards for the world region and human faction had already confirmed everything everyone present was completely ecstatic they called the figure out how sao chen had done a incredible at the same time the news of sao chen jumping directly to lv50 sparta new wave of storms on the player forum explosive lv10 directly to lv50 a player actually did it in used 20 seconds players expected or finding the first bug in original going from lv10 to lv50 in 20 seconds is it a dream or reality instantly dominating the servers level leaderboard leaving the second place being by four levels a shocking event attract and tire server and original on the player forum countless posts about hooch and leveling from lv10 to lv50 in 20 seconds appeared like snowflakes flooding the screen basically every post aside from the brief initial description included a video making countless viewers believe it to be true the refreshed leaderboard in the game also proved the authenticity of many posts beyond that this xd all players understanding of the world of original then tire forum adapted like a fish panda that had been blown up and players were instantly in an uproar what the hell this player chenya must be cheating right 20 seconds to jump from level 40 can't trap my head around it is this even possible in the original it's unbelievable live work might as of for two months used to reach lv30 and dischenya whizz what right jumps to lv50 right after changing hops avenues and fair countless players lamented the infernities of the game they had been grinding tirelessly wishing they could play 24 hours a day without a break only to find that after two months someone called instantly reach lv50 this revelation was a huge shock to them envy jealousy and outrello where the games and fairness were rampant of course it was well known that there were no bugs or cheats in the original so everyone understood that xanjas leap of 50 levels in used 20 seconds must can play with the game rules and there are to be a reasonable explanation they used couldn't figure out how it did it so me also noticed that xanjas id is infamilia is that is the guy who was exposed on the forum as the human race killing god that's right to remember him is the one who instantaneously killed 200 lv20 players at lv10 damn it not only is his combat power insane but his leveling is also ridiculous how are we ordinary players supposed to compete this world is unfair why do you have to see such a terrifying guy what he want to cling to his leg just as one way to settle and other rose the incident of genia instantaneously killing 200 members of the villain family was still fresh in termine sun now suddenly a west of ping the level leaderboard it left countless ordinary players feeling utterly envy some kept posting angrily cursing the games and fairness demanding that the original intelligent system banned this we is character others except reality curious about genius background excitedly discussing how he accomplished all this and whether it was possible for them to replicate it allowing them to also jump to lv50 and enjoy the thrill of cheating there were also to see who posted the trade declaring that yanje was the boss in the arts and that they would definitely cling to his leg if given the chance in sort no matter how players viewed this situation a rational players shared one common talk the intelligence system would absolutely not play any tricks with bands this meant that player yanje would look down a pan dentire server with his lv50 status meanwhile some players with ulterior motives and something and you should they suddenly recall that not lonago there was also someone who's chucked and tire server and anemesly swambuciti the player who had used been identified as an enemy instantly tapped the level leaderboard which delta uge blot to the proud world guild in the conference room all members of the right team talk a full alpha or to finally calm down a bee who exactly is this yanje called it be a gm coming to experience the game can't end or joan the chief heavy armored warrior of the proud world guild spoke infrastructure so we still continue with the bounty as originally planned for this special player of course a everyone opened their mouse but suddenly fell silent they had intended to say of course because the proud world guild had always separated this way anyone daring to stand against the guild would face the consequences of anger in them moreover the other party had openly killed guild members and even arrogantly left messages challenging them if they let this slide what would ordinary players team what kind of top 10 guild is this use this use this in that case how can the proud guild continue to expand its influence and compete for dominance in the world of primordial though the current members of the guild still feel a sense of baloney this is a fatal blow to the guild's reputation especially given the approach surrounding the situation generally speaking when dealing with ordinary lone players top guilds in the game would simply issue a bounty and bold and the better to take action naturally there are many ordinary casual players who would desperately fight for the bounty but when the target is the top lone player in the game it requires a more cautious approach let's hold off on issuing a bounty for now and try to reach out to him see if we can recruit him into our guild in the silence the guild leader emperor slowly spoke a instead of a bit inappropriate a bowman from a slap to a guild in the face and we're going to shamelessly invite him to join us the others not in agreement feeling it was in the inappropriately if they lower their stance just because they were a top player it would be quite detrimental to the development of the proud guild it's very likely that in the future eagle level players would start to slaughter ordinary members to rise at their own value waiting for an invitation from the guilds eager ups perhaps we get strong from the start and make not be an ordinary eagle level player emperor's eyes flicked as a look that the confused members below one analyzed when you saw his characters original image image didn't it feel somewhat familiar i'm not talking about his characters appearance but his equipment the long sword in his right hand the shielding his left and the black ring on his finger don't they match the top three items on the equipment leaderboard and the skill seuset to kill players don't they align perfectly with to see on the skill leaderboard the crowd was momentarily stand instinctively following emperor's words to observe carefully the sharp broads board the rectangular shield the purebla ring atop the other party a turn out of the special effects making it impossible to distinguish the level of tc three pieces of equipment by color even so one called the long sword and shield were exceptional coupled with the rarest jewel in the game and the way left tiny sparks of lightning on the ground while moving it really match up a member of the exploration team tremble as a set called it be that this is the mysterious player who is the first kill of the lv200 musical boss the final demon player chania is in the mysterious player who is the first kill of the lv200 musical boss the final demon 11 this conclusion was reached the exploration time of the proud guild was completely stand you think about it chania's launch for this of epic quality the shield is legendary the ring is a special accessory and the asseveral max level powerful skills a lv9 no one there to shamelessly issue about the against player and the for the sake of so kaiet guild reputation nor did anyone voice this and the against emperor's decision to recruit him with such terrifying equipment and skills they had to lower their stance and offer a hefty sum to recruit him moreover it wasntayus the proud guild that reached this conclusion they oternine major guilds and various top guilds also confirmed this matter siaobu did they grito join our guild in red mon city a group of young female players around it one of the mages in the team asking expectantly they were the exploration the aim of the phoenix cry guild and after guessing about sao chen's background they wanted to invite him to join their guild who wouldn't they want such a powerhouse however since sao chen a turn out of his friend requests no one called successfully send him a friend request so the task of recruiting sao chen felt to fengking who moreover they knew that fengking who and they were old friends fassing the eager gases of the crowd fengking who shook her head with a hint of disappointment edin te grito join our guild but the promise to come to our red mon city a couple of days and right despite their cave with us the crowd exchange glances feeling a mix of happiness and disappointment the happiness came from the fact that they agreed to write the dungeon with the tale while the disappointments stem from not being able to recruit this strong player right away in the newbie village number 7777 the independent players in the hub change how were overly enthusiastic how chen finally managed to escape with the little fairy and at the chance to examine the new skills that appeared on the skill page after changing to the destroyer class class mastery passive skill damage attack and is permanently reduced by 10% when

book and lack by completing hidden quests or can they all be activated after obtaining the skill book so chan for robert his brows and fought but after a while he had no clue for him and one step at a time master are you going to redmond city the little fairy beside him has a 30 to ask a sao chan come back to his senses he had taken anything from her during his voice call with fengking wu that's right sao chan nadi the newbie village is just a beginning it's too boring he want to go play in the main city the little fairy lowered her head and said softly he really want to go to the main city with you master but i'm only level 11 seeing her anxious expression sao chan understood her thoughts this girl used wanted him to have her level a deep test she sao chan smiled slightly no ruse let's take today's to have you rich level 30 before we go together really the little fairy looked up in surprise cleaning to his arm and acting cute master you're reason is how can there be such a good master in the world sao chan tapped her forward smiling without sign award the golden skills she obtained after completing the quest a powerful buff effect a plant to create a guild in the main city so a natural in the to find or call the beta group of elite core members a felt the little fairy had great potential and wanted to nurture her after all leveling up was a tough task for others but for him it was just a matter of mobbing his hands there is and why ordinary players struggle to level up manly boils down to three factors first the round damage output is insufficient it takes at least 10 minutes to defeat a normal monster of the same level second suitable leveling spots are often crowded with players and have a few monsters leading to a lot of waste team searching for pra tier they haven't found a super strong ally the little fairy managed to achieve the third point and leveling up suddenly became as fast as reading a rocket sao chan took her to a remote wilderness area far from the navi's village here most of the monsters were above level 30 and sao chan called this elite wipeout large groups in an instant in a team the little fairy gained a lot of experience in used three days she leveled up from lv-11 to lv-30 if she told others it will probably may the new beast drawer with envy into c3 days sao chan also acquired some silver equipment and items and adapted to new

special jewelry shadow cloak silver shadow armor silver shadow pants silver shadow shoes silver red mon city as the first dungeon in the game the entrance to the spider cave dungeon westbustling with players among them a team composed entirely of female players with over 20 women was eagerly watching at the entrance to the dungeon sister siao wu why ask the the great kyanji arrived yet a petite female warrior quietly aske thanking wu and the team this question had already been asked several times by teammates and she helped she comforted them don't worry they've already arrived at redmond city they sold be here shortly day the female warrior keenly noticed something unusual but that only the great kyanji was coming are there others thanking unadi yes except to be a new disciple of his a lv-30 heavy armor warrior all right then we have to give up to spots the female warrior pouted yoppe when it comes to drawing lots my luck is dead at ba the spider cave dungeon can't come to the maximum of 30 players at the same team and their fungming guilds exploration team including the guild leader swangai oswe at exactly 30 members this team a sister siao wu simbetashen the great kyanji brought a disciple alone which meant they would have to give up to spots whenever there are too many players the excess is determined by drawing lots based on the distribution of classes within the team both the great kyanji and his disciple are warriors overlapping with the profession of this female warrior therefore their exploration team needed to give up to warrior spots thus this female warrior sincerely hope that when it came team to draw lots she bolden the video and chosen the warrior players present silently proud that they were not one of the two unfortunate souls oh they re used le chingo for guilds the am and bringing alona dead way they really don't take us seriously at that moment a female priest player said irritably dark rose if you don't speak no one will think you remute the female warriors not hianji is a tv 50 hidden class and a seven achieve the first kill of a lv 200 music boss it's our honor that is here to help us with the dungeon but strong with bringing a disciple but strong with that eh yet meet kyanji is quite impressive but did he say anything wrong why are you so worked up dark rose scoff lv 30 heavy armored warrior under the boss level suppression what you say is that is that used that way you the female warriors face flashed with anger but she couldn't find the worst to return because dark rose at a point the three bases in the spider cave at the first one at lv 33 while the levels of the second hand third bases were unhaun since a day and tb and defeated yet bad they would only be eager a lv 30 player facing the first boss would have a tail four dimensional attribute suppressed by it 30 essentially making them a character used their total gallon at that moment feng chingu looked over cianji was invited by him who brings his his own business it has nothing to do with anyone else dark rose if you're not satisfied used to the psaid dark roses expression stiffened and she awkwardly laugh ee he was just joking funking who shook her head and didn't continue speaking she was a true veteran player of the phone mean guild having fought alongside the guild and several large virtual mmorpgs and that's in too many characters dark rose only joined the right time after the launch of the original it was only after they had known each other for a while that they gradually realized how terrible her nature was she had to insert herself into every conversation if she wasn't talking when she did it was infuriating she was a concerto the team's atmosphere and with her inflated self-esteem after acquiring a golden level team buff skill she looked down on everyone if it weren't for the heavy dead penalty in the game which left the right team desperately sort on players the fungming guild bolden the abe taken someone like her at all i think the team is about right let's draw lots to decide who lives the team said the guild leader aosuangzue ason as she finished speaking the warrior players in the team immediately baile heavenly spirits and earthly spirits all gods and buddhs please bless me after a noisy round of prayers two unfortunate souls were selected one of whom was the petite female warrior good to sao chen nadie seo guas told me about you for a long time you really are a talented person the exploration team as a spot reserved for you would you like to join or gil so i guess we asked directly and straightforwardly although in other games the members of the fengming guild were all female players the original is different from other games is humanity's second world to strengthen the guild's power so ankae osu had decided from the very beginning to recruit some strong male players they had already recruited a few bad weathering level or strengths they were far below the person in front of her so even talk the other party declined fenging bus invitation a few days ago she still wanted to to he be a try he be already said this i'm not considering joining any guild for now sao chen still refuse calmly all right everyone has their own aspirations you understand swan gae osu felt a bit disappointed the teammates around her also saw the expressions of disappointment only the dark roses nor ted is done fairly not revealing what she was thinking after all as the guild leader swan gae osu was not this carry by default recruitment after a moment once sao chen and the little fairy join the team swan ae osu had turned to talk to the npc for the dungeon level handing over the materials and preparing to enter the dungeon however when sao chen so her choose the hard difficulty level if you're not what are we going to challenge the beast level a beast swan gae osu was looking back at sao chen in surprise the spider cave as four difficulty modes easy normal hard and the beast the difficulty of clearing the dungeon the equipment dropped and the experience penalty after away all differ based on the difficulty level currently they're exploration they am just clear the normal difficulty under hard difficulty they couldn't even defeat the first boss as far as one gae osu enu the top human guild ae osu rcuncion had also only progressed to the first boss the surrounding team members also saw what surprise expressions xianji we used to hit the first boss on hard level be this is they too early exactly do we have what it tacked to challenge this then chenglu from the team walked over and quietly tacked that sao chen's clothes are you and don't get overconfident it's fine yeah be sao chen was about to say it was confident but was interrupted by a female voice ee someone really don't know they're on limits the speaker was dark rose what kind of expert are you you used to ride in the main city and have been even entered the dungeon 11 yet you shamelessly want to challenge the beast difficulty you probably don't know the penalty for falling a challenge at the beast difficulty do you that's a 20% reduction in current experience i think you're reused from another guild try to drag us down as soon as this was said the atmosphere around them fell silent sao chen vasnt angry asked with a strange expression who do you think you are you dar rose cho for a moment they laughed this damn felix i'm just an unknown rookie with dozens of dungeon experiences fully aware of the horrors of dungeon's at heart difficulty dark roses meaning was clear she makes sao chen's understanding of the the spider cave which was far inferior to her own meanwhile sao chen had no experience at all and wanted to go straight for a beast which was likely to be a hidden agenda rose shata so an guy also is expression turned on and apologize dar rose looked at her in disbelief president you want me to apologize to this guy are you crazy you don't want to say it as a contime so an guy also said seriously impossible dark roses face turned on and ugly she didn't expect her guild leader to be so feel he didn't say anything wrong why should he apologize is that enough to be disrespectful to a valued guest frosty snow spoke coldly he'll count to three if you don't apologize you will leave the time one he absolutely won't dark roses said in his aspiration she couldn't bring herself to apologize to a stranger in front of her teammates two are you serious president three i'm sorry almost as frosty snow counted to three dark roses reluctantly spat out to say three words please think a bit more before you speak next time frosty snow won't hurt then turn it to sauchen and said sorry dark rose don't even any harm says just a bit sa tank we didn't take question your intentions it's fine sauchen was somewhat surprised i didn't take care about dark roses is done after all she was just a preserve by but as the president of the fenix cry guild frosty snob sat it mad in field quite comforted being able to discern right from wrong is a good threat in a leader master are we still going to to tackle the this difficulty the little fairy quietly as kept saochoon it was her first team entering the main city and she was clueless about the dungeon feeling uncertain and confused she and even process dark roses earlier this time for her master when she realized it was over she opened his mouth just about to speak when frosty snow interjected yes we all go for the abuse as soon as she finished speaking she passed the npc the entry for the dungeon and chunk the selected hard difficulty to abuse when everyone blinked and found themselves in cd de dunge on de gustin so ah president we really are going to tackle the abuse my goodness can we even handle this wa idon want to lose experience president you re to impulsive we saw the start from hard and take it step by step everyone felt they were don't this team a panic spreading among them quiet frosty snow scolded loudly we are the best am of the human race don't tell me we like the carry to challenge the it is it's not about carry it's clearly someone in the crowd matter quietly but was immediately silence by frosty snob's a easy glare all right since we rehear let's take it slow frosty snob reassured them the group exchange glances and they called only a wow did you hear that the team that used went in is going for the abuse difficulty what abuse damn aren't they afraid of dying nonsense that's the phoenix cry guilt right there they bold and ted are challenged the abuse without confidence damn those strong women from the phoenix cry guilt impressive he heard there is also a mysterious male player i wonder who is so lucky but there to be curious about used go watch the battle at the dunge on entrance a large group of players heard frosty snob's words and immediately got excited the game as a regional expect a team feature and during their free team the casual players of redmond city love to watch this powerful teams to learn their strategies and which casual player hanging around here don't know that the phoenix cry guilt right team is the strongest in all of redmond city they often learn a lot used by watching them tackle hard level dungeons now they're going for the bees they definitely couldn't miss the thus word spread quickly and countless idle players open the spectating page to work the live stream of the phoenix cry right then a chilling wind blew and sharp sounds echoed around them the dim like making it hard to see the female players of the phoenix cry gilded numbers popping up back to the heads minus 5 minus 8 minus 10 hp clearly decreasing continuously in the bees difficulty spider cave will our real kept decreasing every second frosty snow furrowbed here browse and murmured this is not good news let's have the guild's logistics team find a way to create an antidote there is some frosty snow agreed to enter the bees level dungeon was primarily to gather information and secondly to observe sao chance abilities as soon as she entered she received an important piece of information in the bees difficulty dungeon players would fall into a poison state losing guilt every second the foaming gilded a group of players specializing in secondary professions and frosty snow felt it was time for them to play their part starting with obtaining the blueprint for the antidote at this stage an ordinary lv 33 player at around 2000 hp while the members of foaming guilds ride them at slightly better gear averaging around 3000 each person lost between 5 to 10 hp per second which they couldn't ignore so the holy priest in the the amato quickly cast seals and provide slow healing for everyone frosty snow decisively said this is too mana intensive the healing pressure on the holy priest is too great we need to hurry the others didn't take set and quickly had it together moving into the dim spider cave a catmely a holy priest would throw a holy light or to illuminate their surroundings on the group encountered the first wave of small monsters in the dungeon what came into view were terrifying hideous long-legged spiders about 18 pulgadas totale actes is of an adult the horrifying appearance was exactly the type that female players had the most bad the women present at long since they got it used to it they were used surprised by the sternum bear and worried about whether they could defeat them might god there are actually 18 lv 33 elite spiders the first wave of small monsters in the difficult mode only at 6 this this is this difficulty has tripled it directly how do we fight this is it still like before but or heavy armored warriors and judgment priests can't withstand it what sold widow president sister we can't win the many female players in the right the am will stand not expecting the difficulty of the first wave of small monsters in the abyss difficulty to be so i we stay current line up they would have to exert all their strengths used to eliminate this wave and after that the output and healing classes in the team would probably have a few left but the heavy armored warriors and judgment priests responsible for tanking would all be the it's important to note that this was used the first wave of small monsters essentially the weakest batch in the entire dungeon the audience watching this scene in the game spectator interface was also taken about for the fongming yields right there even a small monster they could fight desperately against would require a 30 person there to do this phase 4 at 11 which would be considered a equal level there are these small monsters really the strong the little fairy seeing the surrounding people chattering curiously as what immediately a panic female archeric's plant to her of course they're rest on lv 33 elite monsters a be a whopping 45 000 hp until attack power can be all over 800 damage to heavy armored warriors the healing pressure is immense and our output needs at least two minutes to focus fear and take one down if we could pull them on by one it may be manageable but they rest so densely back that we can pull them on at a team as she spoke the female archer's eyes began to well up with tears if they were so hard to save a little experience it would be top and felt to lose a little fairy reply i hope this makes you feel a bit better as soon as she finished speaking a amerscha taikan sadly appeared the bad her head and all the surrounding players immediately felt something was different is this a group buff wow this little sister is amazing let me see how much is the buff increase is it all looking at the newly appeared buff on their respective attribute panels warriors it had and decided in creation of 300 points in the four-dimensional attributes the group of players was instantly stand at 300 points all the tribute boost wow that's strong they're not the attributes were only between 330 and 450 and this buff from the little fairy nearly double the very own stats even the members of the right team who provided themselves on the extensive experience where taken eva so how about it my golden level group buff is pretty effective right the little fairy it has her head proudly unfortunately before anyone called complement her another female players screen shift the deberiones attention look am is seeing things is a basic panel with a 30% increase buff in the status ba the minion power attack plus 30% oh my god this is strong whose buff is this the minion power what a powerful name for a buff as everyone marvel they alternate the gases towards sao chen the players present were al familiar with a shutter xe for the little fairy and sao chen who were strangers this buff definitely wasn't from the little fairy otherwise she would have announced it like she did with warriors air so it must be from the great master chenji the minion power the minion shuan go shua murmur her gas towards sao chun shimmering with excitement this match perfectly with the name of the epic long sword on the equipment leaderboard the minion such a powerful term code only belong to an extraordinarily strong being the kick-thinking members of the team also made the same connection used a few days ago they were still hesitant whether the great master chenji was really the muscular man dominating multiple leaderboards now it was confirmed everyone exchanged glances understanding without needing to name names since the master was hiding they would pretend not to know as long as the master was happy that was no unfortunately the viewers in the spectator channel called and tessy the detail information of the buff otherwise many would surely guess that the mysterious man dominating the equipment reputation and skill leaderboards without chen this also saved him a lot of trouble when we were tackling the hard difficulty before we are six heavy armored warriors and a German priest to achieve the small monster while the damage the others focused further on by you want to take down the first wave of elite monsters but now in a big difficulty the classes in the time can't hold up and the damage and healing can't keep up either so this message definitely won't the work we have to think of otherwise great master kyanji do you want to say a few words after explaining the original strategy shuan gaoxo turn it to ask it sao chen for his opinion after all it was the one who suggested entering a big difficulty in the first place so emustabe great confidence it's not that complicated yeyee used to start the um you guys can adjust your output as ne de sao chen se cam lia se walk to the front of the team under the bewildered expressions of everyone eras his long sword with swan hanan struck it fiercely gains the ground looking incredibly cool area bomb boom the powerful attack sim to shake then tire spider cave the next moment terrifying numbers pat up the bab the heads of the nearby group of lv 33 elite spider monsters minus 45,000 minus 45,000 minus 45,000 the elite spider monsters liman alone with a ground covered in unnaw equipment shimmering with silver light sao chen immediately step forward to deliver a finishing blow flying impact minus 45,000 minus 45,000 with that after using two skills all the elite small monsters were instantly killed the female players in the team the onlooking audience bro we're not playing the same game are we today's update as 4 chapters please leave comments in the review section 5 star ratings are very important for a new book and the delito 30 we work hard to write aiming for a stable 4 chapters every day minus 45,000 amazing things what kind of output is this is there any justice left is there any law is there any order why can you only deal 3 digit damage at most i'm losing my mind is this what it feels like to cling to a big shot ill of it ill of it from now on xenia is the only true god in my ear this output is used ridiculous right whether it was the members of the exploration team or the ordinary players watching the battle everyone was way died in so a massive us kill instant damage of 45 000 instantly killing a level 33 elite monster all of this mad at this this is the only way to be able to do it in the beginning of the original at this stage any player whose instant damage exceeds 1.000 qualifies to big a yet a big shot so what does an instant damage of 45 000 even man one person is equivalent to 45 big shots outputting at the same time this is simply absurd they deeply suspected that in this a big difficulty spider cave so chain cold solo it alone while the other 29 cold just relax and lie down inside the spider cave everyone was still in a state of shock dreaming in disbelief it was their fears team is seeing a pleasure with such explosive output their mind struggling to comprehend the only the little fairy who had been carried for three days was most familiar with this mode and immediately began to shout excitedly wow master is amazing i'm so lucky to have such a powerful master frosty is now being the leader of the best mental fortitude and quickly reacted sincerely sign please reconsider joining our phoenix guild we are willing to offer you the position of vice president at first first first is no guess that the other party be in a hidden class and the strongest act jeffi the top four rankings would have a super strong output due to their gorgeous equipment and skills that intimidate ordinary players she had already tried to estimate the other party's overall combat ability to have a rig level in her mind however she never imagined that one person's output could be this excessive as far as she knew even among the top output players in the two-man guilds at this stage a man should from the overlord guild instant damage would definitely not exceed 3000 this was under the premise that teammates had provided strong buffs and that the player had used a long cooldown skill in the past frosty snow had envied that guild for having such a powerful archer but now looking back she couldn't help but laugh instant damage of 3000? cland to be the number one output player in the human camp? use this? put not even where the tokere chin just choose thinking of this she directly extended the highest sincerity she had previously discussed inviting the big shot to join the guild again the other members of the exploration team around them also looked at sao chen with great anticipation waiting for his response yeye said again you won't consider joining any guild for now sao chen said all right it was being unrealistic frosty snow revealed a bitter expression then let's continue with the dungeon sure sao chen readily agreed the group continued deeper into the spider cave but as they passed by the group of elite monsters that sao chen had used killed frosty snow picked up the equipment that had dropped on the ground there were a total of 8 pieces of equipment 3 of which were silver and 5 were brands the brands equipment didn't attract much attention everiones gas was fixed on the silver gear throughout the time system channel everyone saw the attributes of the three pieces of silver equipment upon seeing them their eyes widened in disbelief web shield equipment level silver equipment requirement lv 30-yard man priest inteligence 450 magic attack 110 inteligence 30 physical defense 200 magic defense 200 block passive skill increases block chance by 10% when receiving physical attacks venomous dagger equipment level silver equipment requirement lv 30 assassin 450 agility physical attack 140 agility 35 attack speed 4% venomous staff equipment level silver equipment requirement lv 30 magia 450 inteligence magic attack 140 inteligence 35 skill casting speed 4% bot de venomous dagger and the venomous staff were used ordinary lv 30 silver equipment but within the time aside from the assassins and magis everyone else's eyes were glued to the web oh my god a 10% increase in block chance a small round shield with a beating skill decent attack and dual defenses this is top tier silver if you had this equipment my tankiness would reach a whole new level with this shield i'm completely confident you can withstand 3 lv 33 elite spiders on my out the diamond priests in the time were trembling with excitement drawing envious and jealous glances from the surrounding heavy armored warriors as fellow tank classes heavy armored warriors who set clunky heavy rectangular shields while the judgment priests wielded small round shields al talk the former at significant leaguer defense they also lack the agility when fassing monster attacks now suddenly seeing a small round shield with defense comparable to a rectangular shield of the same level and with a skill that increased block chance how cold the heavy armored warriors not feel jealous frosty snow talk a dead breath and look at sao chun we want that top tier a small round shield how many gold coins in the past the equipment there te ameptan from dungeons was always distributed by rolling this according to the corresponding class without needing anyone else to speak but now the situation was different these pieces of equipment were entirely so chance for and she felt embarrassed to take them for herself moreover to mantana good relationship with kyan ji in the future she bolden teak foolishly based on market prices let's decide after we finish the dungeon sao chun casually nodded in agreement by the way this silver staff sold goto xiao wu he had noticed that his old friend fenging wu was still using a branch staff so he offered a little help first yes no adnoy actions even without sao chun sign so she would have given the staff to fenging wu after all sao chun was helping tell the amount of consideration for her fenging wu looked at sao chun with a touch of gratitude in her eyes moments later as the three pieces of silver equipment found their respective owners or their players in the team began to express their feelings truly the best difficulty the first wave of small monsters dropped a total of eight pieces of equipment this drap rate is insane yeah when we used to tackle hard mode with the be lucky to get this match after struggling to reach the final boss who says otherwise we have to thank the great kyan ji the feeling of clinging to a big leg is used to exhilarating on the player forum first output indentire server can fern damage per second 45 000 the terrifying destroyer the demon king kyan ji has descended the pan the primordial ultimate guide to a big level dungeons learn to hook the side of the great kyan ji the lack of the forming guild the first kill of the big difficulty dungeon is about to be born countless posts flooded the player forum once again some people frowned as on as they saw the topic instinctively thinking why is it this yanja again but after reading the content of various posts everyone west and 45 000 damage per second so you know in ganevis level dungeon are you sure this is the idea what it's real others are still running dungeons my god is this yanja the legendary embodiment of the gm here to play a dimensional striking origin how can it be this terrifying looking at their own small frames then at the video of yanja achieving 18 kills in a second players mental status completely collapsed why why are we so unlucky that we can't hug us i i'm willing to sacrifice 10 years of my rom matt's life to pray to become an accessory on the body of the gray demon king yanja this comment from a player instantly receive countless likes in the dungeon after the first wave of elite monsters west is elite taken down by isauchen the fong min exploration team shook off their previous gloom and become spirited as the sign goes it's better to have a good team than to play well hiding the super strong big shot made everyone deeply feel the joy of coasting truck dungeons facing the second wave of elite monsters everyone mantan done incredibly amassed gas clapping insoziastically while once again enjoying this crashing performance the skills of the great yanja are so cool and the attack range is uge a female warrior exclaimed her eyes sparkling yeah and he noticed the cooldown is really short is this the terror of the destroyer class so strong as a fellow female warrior if you feel deeply inferior don't be afraid you're not alone let's i'll crawl under the feet of the great xenia together a three pieces of silver equipment draped again this draped rat is to ogie can hardly believe it till of this feeling of hugging as i i'm so envious of the little fairy this wave of small monsters was even more than the last but undoubtedly under the continuous bombardment of yao chan's lv9 flying impact and area bam's day i'll fell without having timet or react at the same time three pieces of silver equipment and seven pieces of branch equipment trao ching handed one of the exquisite silver long swords to the little fairy in his view coming to this dungeon was manly to help his old team at fengking wo and to mentor his apprentice silver equipment of little value rather than earning a few dozen gold coins it was better to emuse his apprentice at least equipment of golden quality was work considering this let to many female players in the team looking at the little fairy with even more envy lowly sabes hachan advantage shuan aoswe also cast an envy's glanza the little fairy in turn to saw chen and introduced apg this the first boss of the spider kabe the level and rank are one under a beast difficulty but under the hard mode we've been waip many times and samerai some experience never mind you probably want any of the ff watro shuan aoswe couldn't help but say since the level of the first boss in hard mode exceeded the players in the team all of the opponent's skills so with as question marks when using the identification technique the fengming exploration team had explored for a whole week before a gradually mastering the skill of stealing the boss at 50% eal just as she was about to say it without chun she suddenly realized that the probably didn't need it at all this person had been once shouting all the monsters encountered along the way completely regarding no strategy moreover since the totale out of the small monsters was limited his damage per second was definitely more than 45.000 perhaps even eager when the output crashes everything it's like the legendary power of ancient martial arts that can overcome this opponents with a a single strike big wiring no excessive before shuan jaswe took a de brez if we successfully defeat boss number uno this team and achieve the first kill our fengming guild will owe you a uge favor in the future if you have any request as long as they don't go against our principles we will absolutely not oppose the first kill of a boss at a big difficulty would be an onset server way which would greatly benefit the development of their fengming guild the numerous pieces of equipment they are a time before a padding comparison to the advantages of a first killing shuan also size for this reason she represented the fengming guild and proactively promised to the other party a favor all i saw chen nadi indicating accepted the favor the world background of the original is vast and the major races and factions are not friendly they simply lack the result to start award with total similar power levels but it only takes a single spark to break the delicate balance between factions from a player's perspective this is a chaotic world war in the future after sao chen establishes a guild even if it becomes incredibly strong it cannot single-handedly defeat billions of players and npcs from other factions it will always need to find a few allies the fengming guild with its decent strength and reputation deserves a position as an ally it gets discounts as taking one step while considering this sao chen matter to himself at that moment swangas was voice came true we bear a ive that boss number one slr saochem focused his gas and in front of him appeared a massive cave home to about 50 spider monsters with ordinary elite spiders scattered around the perimeter in the center of the square a giant spider about 5 meters tall lie on the ground surrounded by four smaller bases that were slightly shorter saochun mantan a calm expression but the members of the surrounding them were somewhat funny my goodness is that is boss number one way to be in the original monsters is a soft and proportional to strength call this spider be a golden boss no way no way are we really daring to fight a golden boss idiot have you forgotten we have the great yanja we sue se we don't need to worry at all all right he suddenly feels anxious just looking forward to the great one descending from the heavens the team members gasses shifted between the boss and saochem unable to help but whisper among themselves they were eager to see if great yanja's ultimate skill instant kill technique code continue to scene saochem activated his epistle skill explosive spider golden level level lv 40 al 2000 000 at this level defense was hardly a concern just seeing the ad was enough a cold and heavy battered to look at the rest of the information after all it was just a matter of instant kill no need to waste team studying it hand bomb the initiation was similar to that of her an bomb skill but with a slight difference when saochem released the hand bomb it was just a simple thrust of his sword into the ground a jumped up force fell before inserting it boom a tremendous roar echo and the entire spider cave cinto tremble minus 45 000 minus 45 000 minus 100 000 minus 200 000 a large array of brick red numbers erupted from the heads of the nearby spider swarm and not a single spider cold survive the explosion saochem had anticipated this outcome after all the giant bomb was the highest damage group skill of the destroyer class and after upgrading it to lv9 its attack range expanded significantly in auto cover 200 square meters nearly half of the square in front of him was within the attack range his own panel was already over a million plus the skill bonuses even considering the boss defense it was an auto instant kill but while saochem was calm and collected the others were completely unable to remain composed 2 200 000 damage per second amazing things no that's right it's 200 000 the first boss was instant kill my god this is unbelievable my output is the highest in the team yet it les dan 1% of lord senia's stop dreaming lord senia candeal 200 000 damage per second becaused this golden boss only as 200 000 ea how can you compare now even if lord sandia publicly announced the cold fly eagle believe wow so much silver equipment the boss dropped a piece of golden equipment holy crap whether it was the players in the team or the countless spectators in the viewing interface everyone was now flashed and breathing heavily without realizing it no one called have predicted such an attack range and intensity even the boldest players talked that sandia called instant kill a lv 33 elite monster which was already pushing the limits they couldn't imagine anything more but the reality was a full 200 000 and even more once killed instant killing at lv 35 golden boss along with a large number of lv 33 elite monsters and minor basis no one called remain calm under such terrifying output the forum was once again star up in a new storm some well meaning person that saw chan the title of the monkey which was widely accepted by everyone inside the spider cave fast with the ground full of

spectator interface countless viewers what as the team divided the loot they are sucking to the point of almost suffocating damn so much equipment i'm so jealous gugu why did my mom make me a girl he also want to join the fengmingu clinging to the side of the great demon king senja the fengmingu hit the jackpa jealousy has distorted my face separating quality from substance stop whining they re about to fight the second boss you'll pay attention this kind of heartache and there are still two more times that there are a three bases in the spider cave and sao chen naturally couldn't stop after taking down the first one so eled everyone to rust o the second boss without a break the monsters encountered along the way where all unlevel eager we sell points 3000 more than the lv 33 spiders but they still met taren in an instant before sao chen before alone they encountered the second boss of the dunggion today i'm delivering another 4 updates continuing to ask for 5 star reviews and requesting comments in the review section still the same line if the rating breaks 1888 the outset will change to a female avatar for writing the difficulty of the dunggion increases incrementally the further they go the harder it becomes to push down the monsters and bases they encounter under the abuse difficulty the second boss is a lv 41 gold black widow spider before today the members of the fengming exploration team called and even imagine being able to face the second boss at this stage looking at the terrifying disease of the opponent they knew how difficult it would be to provoke it however as a chen once again used the hand bomb and the value of minus 220.000 appear the bab the black widow boss head they knew they were fortunate to witness another instant kill sure no with another announcement of a first kill in the human area it was declared that the fengming exploration team led by player yangye at set a new e-gone the spider cave dunggion leader ball the second boss dropped two pieces of gold level equipment and two professional skill books while the surrounding monsters dropped a total of 11 pieces of top quality silver equipment with skills attached he can have no need for any of this equipment or skill books so they were still absorbed internally by the fengming exploration team it is worth mentioning that the second boss dropped a crafting scroll for an antidote which was also bought by iso and gauxwe in the beast difficulty spider cave players lost a at every second and only after obtaining the antidote can ordinary players made the prerequisites for the challenge currently there is no antidote potion available in the player market it can be anticipated that once a certain secondary profession player from the fenix guild learns this scroll they will gain a continuous stream of gold coins therefore frosty snow did not simply buy it outright but promised to give us a 50% of the potion sales revenue every day in the future this is undoubtedly a long-term financial product next the group began to result on the third boss instant kill all instant kills initial speculation on the terrifying stats of the great demon king singe who

skills dark god level aura al surrounding spider minions a better attack speed increased by 20% status good a dark gold level boss with a whopping 400 000 a sao chan was lightly surprised but didn't pay match attention in the original output is calculated base on one skill attack damage x the percentage after the targets defense reduction plus final output this means that if the initial output is 10 000 and the opponent's defense reduces the damage taken by about 10% the final output would only be 9 000 so chan stats and doubted lexated 1 000 000 and we saw percentage increase from skills using a giant bomb cold all around 9 000 000 in explosive output the boss dual defense of less than 10 000 west basically in negligible in front of him after all it would used be a one hit kill so under the expectant gases of the team and countless players in the observation interface sao chan to ok a step for bar to show respect for being the first to face a dark gold level boss he decided not

xianja you can distribute this equipment and items great kindness needs no thanks there was no need for excessive gratitude for the help the great xianja given to their fengming guild swang aux was secretly made a decision that from now on as long as instructed the fengming guild wouldn't conditionally agree even if it meant going to war with the aussie guild she had long known that there was a conflict between the great xianja and the aussie guild and thus she felt quite pleased at this moment offending the great yanja in her view was the most or only is decision made by the president of the aussie guild perhaps it won't be long before the boss is rich about the next power development and the decision of who is the number one guild of the human race will be made all right then he has a the equipment so chen nadi lightly step forward and bear and to pick up items a golden to be better to look at the silver equipment dropped by the small monsters the dark gold boss the venomous

brand item called make most ordinary players happy for an entire day a silver item would have hundreds of players fighting goberi a gold item was hard to find the venom among millions of players and dark gold items were truly one of a kind in this game owning a dark gold item code the bow can be from all men and jealousy from women my god 2000 hp 500 strength and stamina and 1000 pulgadas bow defenses a female warrior in the team exclammed excitedly whoever possesses this dark gold item can instantly become the top warrior of the entire human days of course excluding the dk and g that's right with this equipment my hp meet exceed 5000 and other female warrior said equally excited at this stage a heavy armor warrior with 5000 hp even if their skills are terrible is still a talent that all major guilds would fight to recruit that's terrifying if he wore this armor he would be confident to withstand the first wave of 18 small monsters in the beast level spider cave alba y missile that terrifying attributes plus damage reduction and hp increase skills is this what dark gold equipment is and it's a set at this stage aside from the top three items on the equipment leaderboard the epic sword of the menacean the legendary demon god shield and the special quality jewelry ring of chaos the quarto place is a golden dagger from the celestial race the dark gold equipment has always been a ga and now the first dark gold armor in the game as emergent everyone felt incredibly fortunate to witness this moment in gaming history he won't this equipment so chanced lightly as on as the words fell the warrior players in the team revealed pand expressions don't get it wrong they weren't a feeling this and fair including the guild leader frost auxwe and everyone else they all understood that rather than saying they were together to clear the dungion it was more accurate to say that kyanji had carried them through it so anything dra in the dungion it felly belong to kyanji this dark gold armor was no exception the reason they felt pand was simply that as warriors it was hard to accept missing out on top tier equipment a subconscious reluctance of course frosty snow quickly said everything in the dungion is yours we will only buy what you don't need mmm sao chen looked at frosty snow was approval she was the team leader possessing the right to allocate equipment within the team yet she saw with no greed to riman composed in front of dark gold equipment the president of the phoenix cry guild was quite perceptive seeing her understanding sao chen was willing to spend a bit more time to help he will also find time in the next couple of days to run the spider cave if he get any more dark gold armor he is a little to you the spider cave as a limit on the number of entries for difficulty levels below hard you can enter three times a day for a beast difficulty you can only enter 11 a day dark gold armor provides bonus is to add and damage reduction percentage so watching decide to run the beast a few more times to see if a cold gather a full set effect frosty snow was immediately delighted and nodded repeatedly okay thank you master chenye the equipment and items dropped from the beast dungion would significantly enhance the phoenix crea's clearing time so the more debater as for the gold for purchasing equipment with the strengths of a top guild in juasia frosty snow was not certain money so chung glanced at the remaining equipment and items filling no interest and prepared to live ye ye come find you again at this team the team metemaro frosty snow nodded all i see you master this team since it done the dark gold equipment in front of everyone when the system prompted whether to hide his ide so chung click no so chen also ada a bit of browsing player forums when board so quickly learned that all the details of his team from phoenix cry clearing the beast level spider cave had spread widely oxide abtc players already guessed that i am the one who killed the final de mongo so chen was a bit surprised but some felt relief you just think about his overwhelming performance in the beast level dungion a single-handedly pushed through the monsters in the dungion evenable to winston kill dlv 45 dark gold boss in the eyes of players who else called it bbcx the mysterious player who recently achieved the first kill of the lv 200 final demon god and the top three spots on the equipment leader board with epic legendary and special quality items so chen suddenly talked of a sign and unconsciously matter he also won't talk about the profile but my strengths won't allow it initially eh i'd he's decided simply to avoid trouble but since i had been recognized he decided not to hold back anymore in a game you should play freely doing whatever you want so chen smile lightly the hidden name is on the leader board called b chang datanitime hou chin tapped his finger and it refreshed immediately in the next moment the information on almajor leaderboards refreshed world region level leaderboard first place chenye lv 50 praise human class destroyer world region eppie tashen leaderboard first place chenye 109810 worship race human

five leaderboards albaimyself 6666 if you like i'm not playing the same game as master chenye without a doubt primordial is a stage solely for master chenye ordinary players like us can only look up for a lifetime lord chenye is truly the one everyone has been waiting for it would go bankrupt for a bounty of 10 000 gold coins just to know how to become as terrifying as lord chenye the one upstairs is dead rammingy gold also be willing to go bankrupt to gather 10 000 gold coins just to earn a friend position from the great xiangye from now on it will life in redmond city and never leave players from various factions humans orcs demons celestial beings looked at the ide xiangye on the numerous world region leaderboards and collectively offer ternice reaching such a the title of the world's number one undoubtedly philipan sao chen as the relationship between xiangye and the phoenix cry guild deteriorated in swambo city the president of the proud world guild emperor was on a calwisa female player on the other end the voice of dark rose came through i'm sorry president i've let you down dark rose said feeling frustrated she was an undercover agent from the proud world guild embedded in the phoenix cry guild and she had finally managed to infiltrate a right team her first task was to find a way to make chenya develop a dislike for the phoenix cry guild although she didn't understand why at first she swore she had worked hard to accomplish she before entering the dungeon she even discussed being ostracized by all the right team members by openly expressing her disdance for yanji but unexpectedly before yanji called seyan it in president swanghaogs were firmly expressed her support for him this left dark rose feeling frustrated thinking her undercover skills were lacking fortunately when one plan failed and other emerge she prepared to find an opportunity to eliminate him in the wisdom geon but the reality was that at the right time members including her were lying down there was simply no chance to complete the task of saying to her by her superiors useless what would you see to have you as an undercover agent emperor gritted his teeth and scolding ever since he had completely fallen out with yanji his desire for revenge had multiplied many times over in front of a top tier guild like proud world the disadvantages of alone a pleasure were to agree even though yanji was incredibly powerful a stila conference however before planning any actions and he did to ensure that yanji had no helpers so specifically instructed the undercover agent hidden in the phoenix cry guild dark rose to fine a way to sabotage and his relationship with the phoenix cry guild but never expected that rose to be so useless emperor took a the present order you temporarily stay undercover in the phoenix right time don't reveal your identity and then inform me of yanji's whereabouts yes dark rose in the sky hesitated for a moment and then agree at that moment as sense of forever then suddenly erosing her air proud world guild bold and they be planning to the all with the demon king yanji personally good day no way no way the spectator interface after all does not display a lot of information only by seeing all the details with her own eyes cold she understand just how terrifying the demon king sin you truly was it was a kind of ultimate combat power where a cold single-handedly battle against thousands dark roses suddenly began to doubt whether it was the right choice to be an undercover agent for the proud world guild the newly opened tower in kingdom is a level 40 dungeon with requirements for the number of entrance and air levels such and cold didn't enter alone so i had no plans for it at the moment he also kept his promise leading the phoenix right they am trog to dungeons in the past two days successfully clearing the abyss by their cabotways they looted two pieces of dark gold equipment nearly 10 pieces of gold equipment and several skill books it was used a pity that one of the dark gold pieces was a secondary weapon for assassins and the other was a ring that enhanced archer skills which conflicted with his chowin so i left them for the phoenix cry in exchange swanghaox regarded a total of 100 000 gold coins and handed them over to him the 100 000 gold coins avenirly dran dentire liquid assets of the phoenix cry guild and the moment's auction accepted the gold coins at the beat leaderboard world region beat leaderboard first place cng 110 000 gold coins the extra 10 000 west up absence coming out of the demon god temple does all five major leaderboards in the game along with the primordial stone table and the dungeon leaderboard are dominated by isao chen this naturally caused a small step among players across the server we saw me been calling xiao kian the king who ran seppelin king tc players are so cringy after finishing the tier the beast dungeon xiao kian strolled down the street and shook his head speedlessly at a post on the forum forget it let's open the chest first in primordial grinding dungeons not only yields equipment from within the dungeons but also grants a chest that can rapidly latitone's profession after clearing the dungeon the beast difficulty dungeons reward golden chests and the first two times xiao kian opened them got nothing but worthless trash this was his still attempt to pay get something useful and be been crashing dungeons for the past couple of days it's team to bring up the plant to complete the second hope change quest xiao kian matter softly and then opened the golden chest without hesitation system notification you have a time to destroyer skill book water monday in dance a skill from my profession xiao kian was delighted and quickly learned the skill book lv1 water monday dance active skill jump in place and release 10 watts of sword energy that can attack from a distance dealing a total of 300% of the skills damage panel cooldown 16 seconds it's actually a run skill miss xiao kian size lit up and immediately began to observe the sword video on the skills detail interface observing skills is a small feature in primordial design to help players master the release message and anglers of the skill more quickly and effectively boss xiao kian focused his gas and in the sword video saw himself exerting force a whisper feet leaping into the air the dominant sword in his hand was el horizontally drawing beautiful acts in the air in the next second ten milky with a sword energies appear sweetly cutting through about a hundred meters before a finally disappearing this water monday by in dance is really cool sao kian size were filled with joy it's the city from now on water monday by in dance will be my main output skill at this stage and encounter any monsters that called withstand any of his skills so sao chen had no demands for the skills damage for now and the coolest of water monday by in dance was very much to his liking moreover after leveling it up to lv9 the skills attack power would be quite impressive you stand a voice rang in his ear xianji great go i'm the president of the auzer guild empire do you have a team to cha sao chen turn it to si amale warrior with the idea auzer emperor displayed above his head followed by about 10 well equipped players confirmed this was no joke these were people from the auzer guild sao chen from it slightly but they're to talk about used say it directly he had a significant gripe with the auzer guild but it wasn't at the point of meeting to fight so he decided to hold his ground and see what they wanted at the same time he had no intention of wasting time with them straightforward emperor laughed heartily given the aura was displaying a soul be quite popular sao chen talked to himself emperor smirked and said let's talk about how to settle our grievances and also discuss what conditions will successfully invite you to join or deal little cnc usually writes during the day and updates steadily at midnight thank you all for your support the discipline the text is just a minor character and will basically have no role later on today i'm still delivering 4 updates and the continue to six 5 star reviews since the incident at the number 7777 navis villages profession hall the conflict between both sides as being let's bear as for the combat power that senia has displayed so far the emperor does not truly believe that the other party is invincible a player's basic attributes are noting the most important factor affecting combat power is equipment the emperor secretly speculates that there is in the other party can cross the abuse difficulty spider care must be due to the terrifying bonuses from the equipment once the other party loses their equality gear they would use to be an ordinary level 50 player not worth worrying about in front of a top guild like theirs the emperor originally planned to gather 10 000 people ambusing the shadows and then find an opportunity to strike down send you together after all the other party is still a big red name if they die they will definitely drop equipment however as a white the fongming yields leveling them whose overall strengths was going to be a kidding day by day wish they're hell is suddenly a new idea the original planet risks so it was better to all or for now and only take action if absolutely necessary why not try inviting the other party to join they're gill that way everyone would be happy with this talked in mind he found himself in chiyue city talking to yanja in the entire human guilds our house guild claims to be second and no and are still say they are first the emperor said with a smile his words full of pride join our guild no matter what conditions you have as long as our house guild can provide it used say the word in his view money equipment beautiful women status etc called all views said as bargaining chips the foundation of the house guild supports him in doing this however the next moment saw chance words made his expression stiffen then he want to be the president of the house guild can you agree to that are you joking xianje the emperor barely suppressed the anger in his heart and said in a deaf voice we are very sincere please consider it seriously no need to consider he refuse so tune this is easily shook his head are you kidding you're house guild has such a bad reputation do you think he really want to join moreover you haven't agreed to join the fongming guild with also beautiful female players what could you possibly offer that good and tse me really not giving any face at all the emperor's face turned up cold anyone who lowers their head to ask someone to play together and this is damn fairly rejected would definitely feel displaced as the top guild leader in the game the emperor code not tolerate such humiliation do you need to give a you face so tune glance at him this damn fairly aren't you afraid of completely becoming enemies with the house guild a cold glint flashed in the emperor's eyes are we not already enemies so tune retorted we saw snare then suddenly looked enlightened by the way speaking of enemies he really want to chop you down right here the emperor so arrogant the emperor's face turned a bit pale we sang but considering the other party's reputation of over a hundred thousand it turned a bit dark as well we saw reputation of a hundred thousand chopping someone in the main city probably wouldn't be a big deal after all the other party had done exact things before he was genuinely afraid that the other party would take action leaving him momentarily speechless from the frustration but while the emperor was aile and his subordinates being dim cold not all but senia or boss personally invited you be cause things highly of you and wants to protect you a barely man with a dark face said in a deaf voice don't be ungrateful when ora ose guilt takes action you won't even know how you die that's right daring to be enemies with ora ose guilt you are a very too arrogant a barely man lars his long sword and spoke the others glared at sao chen with fierce expressions as if they would attack him if he didn't say something nice so on he was just making a little joke earlier sao chen said with a strange expression teasingly is this the attitude of the aoc guilt when inviting others threatening someone over a disagreement even learn something today a joke the emperor's eyes were filled with doubt the others vain dim also so with puzzle expressions can a joke be this realistic be serious we are very sincere the emperor decided to try again speaking earnestly as long as you speak up you can meet any condition you have except for the position of president a you guys are really funny you can say anything and you will be liby sao chen laughed heartily you the emperor was furious his face turning the color of pig liver pointing at sao chen ready to curse but only money to utter one word before sao chen coldly interrupted him reconciliation is impossible and don't even think about me joining your bunch of trash while i mean a good mood and don't want to kill anyone you better scrap having a ton the super cool skill water monday vaindance sao chen wesin the edina good mood so even talk the other party where enemies eva stay prepared to accuse yet considering ad already plada trick on them however sao chen didn't want to make a move but some people were oblivious to their situation oh stop boasting this is the mind city i don't believe you dare to attack us the earlier dark fast man said this damn fairly that's right easy you're just bluffing in my opinion the president sold the abe bader to come here used to be anger by some trash jeje some people don't know when to stop and they have a team to cry the people being the emperor were cursing threatening and mocking sarcastic remarks which gradually wore down sao chen's good mood ee since you want to die and they help you as on as a finished speaking before the others had a chance to react sao chen drew the sword of domination and struck instantly the first target was the fall mouth dark fast man you really dare with the dark fast man's incredulous roar the next second turn into with the light can disappear sao chen lightly blew on the blade and said with a calm expression it really had trash that don't know they're on limits you actually dare to kill our guild member the emperor's face darkened completely are you stupid it's not the first team sao chen scoffed i'm quite familiar with this kind of thing mmm this matter is the over i hope you have the ability to stay this arrogant the emperor greeted his tis and said then turn it to his equally furious subordinates and what let's go a real man can bend and stretch and who that all his people can buy in we're not a match for the other side so i prepared to retreat first jeje after threatening me you think you can live so easily sao chen spoke with a canton then what do you want to before the emperor called finish his sentence i was sent back to the fountain by the long sword embedded in his chest the emperor of the iosur killed kill in an instant damn it there in to kill our president we the iosur guild will not let this go used what for our ribbon the remaining eight players brought by the emperor immediately began to curse however since sao chen had already made his move how could stop used because of their mere verbal threats not done with me perfect when if i in the team and he go a besomme fan in swambu city sao chen is not as for now you are can go the elite players of the osur guild were mostly in swambu city sao chen cd would go play but even a full new west definitely going to cause a travel for the osur guild thinking of the opponents combat power and tearer again tattooed of casually attacking people in the main city the remaining eight players turn it pale before they call se janity inferther sao chen start to a again boss boss sao chen unleash the watermonde vain dance for the first time the sword energy slashed throw one after an ote in the next moment blood red numbers appeal the bab the heads of the ocho players 3105 minus 2810 minus 2990 none of them called withstand even a single sword energy from the watermonde vain dance instantly the crowd in front of imbanished turning into streaks of wheat light system notification do you have a killer player in a peccary strictly area deducting 10 reputation points and increasing your symbol by 10 points system notification do you have a killed a player in a peccary strictly area deducting 10 reputation points and increasing your symbol by 10 points sao chen blanket the information on the system notification interface killing a pleye in the main city only deducted 10 reputation points which he didn't care about under 10 points points would only extend the duration of his red name slightly so what if he have a red name no matter how many players there are at this stage they can't kill me the only ones capable of killing me are a level npcs but with my reputation at the worship level you don't have to worry about that happening so much matter the few words and smiled nonchalantly then amidst the stand expressions of the surrounding players a turner and left it baste until his figure completely disappeared that the players finally reacted holy crap killing people in the main city who the hell is this badass no kidding who else in situation besides the great demon king sin you would dare to do this holy crap did you use the chance to hook sin you that is i by the way that group of players who got killed by the great demon king chaniel oxkite familiar does anyone recognize them he also has a sense of familiarity you remember now one of them is the president of the aussie guild emperer dam do is the aussie guild are to come to chile city they deserve to be killed a single stone stirred up a thousand waps the president of the aussie guild emperer personally came to chile city to recruit chania by his group was mercilessly slaughtered by the great demon king chania this incident spread through word of mouse among the players on side and garnered way it spread attention on the forums in the human region on one side was the universal and recognized number one player in the game and on the other was a top tier force with the title of one of the top ten guilds in the game the confrontation between tse to cides was undoubtedly a fierce battle now that the great demon king seni attack and the leading killing the opposing president and his group the irreconcilable conflict was known to add next it would depend on how the aussie guild would handle this matter would they swallow their pride or find away to italia from a certain perspective this was a contest between a top tier lone wolf in the game and a large guild the players in the human camp were very curious about the outcome however total disappointment the aussie guild did not take immediate follow-up action swambo city aussie guild headquarters ban the resurrected emperor had a dark expression as a violently smashed a cape against the world his face twisted with sri senja this is simply too much emperor greeted his teasing hatred the many ranking guild members below were equally indignant their faces flashed with anger they never expected their own president emperor to personally goto chile city to recruit the other party only four things to escalate to violence after a few words this was simply too dismissive of their housey guild this was no longer a provocation it was a blatant contempt for them it was akin to trampling their dignity under thought and anyone with a bit of blood in them called not swarrow this humiliation president this matter cannot just be left us is we must make senja unable to continue playing in this game our ser lao juan said with a serious face that's right if we don't crush him into dust our our ser guild will have a no face left another member equal their words garnered agreement from everyone present this is simply like him defecating on our ser guild we must let him know who he can't prove no matter how strong his individual combat power is he don't believe that gathering 10 000 players won't be able to take him down if 10 000 is the no then 20 000 30 000 or even 100 000 if you just believe we can't deal with him send he has a big red name once dice he will definitely drop equipment if we camp at the resurrection point we can surely loot all his gear let's see how arrogant he is 10 president make up your mind all the players outside are watching us we can be like turtles hiding in their shells the crowd erupted into a frenzy clamoring for revenge the atmosphere filled with ra after bending their anger they finally turned their gas to the president emperor no matter how fiercely they argued it ultimately depended on emperor's decision emperor looked at the determined eyes below and said solemnly all right let's take revenge today's events were simply too frustrating as a top boss in the gaming world emperor had never suffered such humiliation about the cross the opponent's early i'll talk today outside the world's maximum damage exceeded 400 000 and at this stage no player code match even 1% of that terrifying output it was practically synonymous with invincibility however emperor did not think so becausing the previous a wisdom geon the opponent had never given the small monsters a chance to hit this seemed to be a signal representing cianjas fatal weakness emperor speculated that perhaps the opponent's defense was far lower than trade output this undoubtedly provided an opportunity for a strategy of overwhelming numbers even if the speculation was long and the opponent's defense was strong to the point where an ordinary player code only did a la minimal amount of damage emperor still did not belire that the opponents hp limit code exceed 10 000 points after all there must be a limit of strengths this men that as long as they gathered 10 000 people a single round of output would surely kill kyanji thinking of this a sinister smile crept on emperor's lips mm dare to offend me it will make sure you can survive in the original kyanji where are the ioswagid members epan receiving the news swang ioswagidli brought people over looking puzzle that sao chen a basntate said that emperor personally let the team talking from kyanji where are they eb already taken care of them sao chen said swang ioswag was taken ever as expected of kyanji too impulsive previously she had received news from the guild members that emperor had come to she used to recruit kyanji and she was shocked and anxious feeling that both cities would negotiate so she carried on her way not receiving any follow-up information thinking they were still in talks she didn't expect it to end like this however the result of kyanji tearing his face with emperor mother her very happy this confirmed that kyanji and the aoswagid had completely taken a posing cides which was fantastic news for the fengming guild so are we going to do a dungeo now since they were already here swang ioswag was also ready to cling to the big side again no kyanji decisively refused then talked about how pleasant the cooperation had been over the past two days earning quite a bit of gold and explain i'm no longer interested in dungeons and don't plan to waste any more time all i swang ioswag was a speechless expression the draprate in the beast dungeo was so terrifying that they had become addicted to clinging to big side is this past two days yet no one called abe imagine that kyanji had already grown bored one must say the great god truly deserves the title their vision is so it that ordinary players can hardly imagine however considering his terrifying output swang aoswag felt relief so great god yanja where do you plan to go next swang aoswag aske the game her gas revealing anticipation she wanted to see if she could have an other chance to cling to his leg next he planned to quickly advance to the second class by the way do you know about the june meng mars sao chen aske the best equipment draped from the beast by their cave dungeon was only the dark gold set and sao chen fed the benefits were too small not work continuing to waste him a grinding a plant to quickly advance to a second class profession and then challenge eager difficulty maps however the second class for the destroyer was not something that could be completed at the second class npc mentors in the major cities instead a first need to determine the location of the june meng mars and find the leader sao chen had spent a lot of time browsing the forum tc past two days but not from any information about the june meng mars remaining completely in the dark about the second class quest as swang aoswag was the president of a top guild with countless members a catcher asked her not really expecting much sure no a pan hitting sao chen's question swang aoswag sawed a confused expression you meant mars sorry you haven't heard of that place it's fine tenieye take my life sao chen said would get to swang aoswag preparing to ask some big figures in the npc factions to see if a code got any insights among the npcs in chiyue city the one with the highest status was undoubtedly the city lord limusi players level up drug to mine methods fighting monsters or completing quests many npcs in chiyue city like to issue daily quest swiss quite generous rewards as the highest ranking npc in chiyue city limusi also occasionally release some daily quests currently players in chiyue city unanimously agree that the rewards for the tasks given by the city lord are the most generous so many players linger at the entrance of the lord's mansion waiting for new tasks to be released therefore when sao chenera if that the lord's mansion if found a large crowd of players gathered at the entrance numbering around the hundred if it weren't for the tenic level npc guards at the door the players meet aberrash ten ordinary players really go allowed to level up so chemblance that them without stopping and walked straight to the lord's entrance the players waiting for tasks were momentarily stand by this scene who is this guy looks like he wants to buy you is really fearless uh probably a newbie no need to look it's dumb the guards at the lord's mansion are a notice this newbie is definitely in for travel the lord's mansion is not a place anyone can use them there and the npc guard them at the entrance is not known for their good temper players emboldened by their fearlessness have attempted to break into the lord's mansion before but the cerecles players were quickly coldly killed by the guard them such behavior gradually led to the guards developing a meliches at the towards players evolving into warnings for nor is it followed by killings if they did not retreat the surrounding players were well aware of the guards terror so they looked at saocheng with glare their eyes filled with sympathy but no unkindly reminded him they were all waiting to see the show they were destined to be disappointed as saocheng approached the captain of the npc guard them saluted first respected lord yanja may ask what brings you here saocheng kindly replied i'm looking for the city lord limousie all right please follow me the guard captain said without his attention leading the way this nlft many players who were ready to watch the show completely stand holy crap the newbie used well in like that what do you mean a newbie are you an idiot didn't you hear the guard captain that's the great demon king xenia wow the great demon king xenia as come to the lord's mansion as expected of my that xenia even npcs are well connected brothers the chance to cling to a big leg as come the players were instantly excited this was a living the it either was a sign circling in the the original whoever is fortunate and auto cling to the side of the great demon king xenia would directly become one of the top players in the game don't believe a used look at the feng min expedition team after being led by the great demon king xenia for a few days the entire team's equipment and skills were completely transformed leaping to become a top tier team in the gaming circle when that xenia comes out he must find a way to get on his friends list a player shouted excitedly the other players around sharing similar thoughts looked toward the entrance of the lord's mansion with anticipation on the other side under the guidance of the captain of the guard sao chen quickly met the lord of chiyue city limusi as one of the 20 rulers of the human races main cities limusi appeared to be in his años 50 or años 60 with a lean physical death set eyes clearly not someone to be trifled with sao chen secretly marveled this was level was probably over 100 however it didn't use the scouting technique to check the others information npcs were very sensitive to scouting techniques and using it on a global npcs without reason was getting pelay easily leading to a bad impression sao chen bolden they make such a foolish mistake haha even on her that our human race has produced a legendary figure today seeing you in person you truly are extraordinary limusi la heartily his face full of walls you're retoking sao chen humbly reply 40 level npcs in the original it was best to treat them as real people sure no seeing sao chen's respectful demeanor limusi saw with a gratified smile young man what do you wish to discuss with me speak up you want to hi danity nino seeing this sao chen directly said you want to ask the lord about the location of the human mars what do you want to go there for limusi was lightly taken back and before sao chen cold continue and explained you don't know where you meant mars is but that place no longer belongs to human territory and is extremely dangerous dnp serilinu sao chen was delighted and have important matters that he must detento oh in that case he won't stop you limusi directly informed sao chen about the human mars it turned out that human mars belong to the demon clan's territory located at the edge of the human race is influenced and it was filled with sick level demons with the lowest level monsters being at least level 80 makini buried dangerous he understand thank you for the information lord sao chen nadid ingratitude and prepared to live used then li musy sadly ras his hand to stop him are you planning to go to june mend mars that's right do is the lord have any instructions sao chen was instantly delighted called it be that was about to issue a quest to be honest ya be an important matter and would like to ask lord sin you for help limusi said wish a bitter expression din lord of chile city limusi has issued you the quest find li linger quest description li linger is limusi's granddaughter who when missing a jarago why training in june meant mars here whereabouts are you now and lord limusi is taida please mandan matters and cannot live thus requesting your helping finding li linger's whereabouts quest deadline 30 days quest progress stage 1 2 quest faller penalty none completion reward for stage 1 dark gold chest x1 completion reward for stage 2 legendary chest x1 village establishment order x1 do you accept the quest legendary chest village establishment order the city lord truly lives a tourist item the rewards for this quest are incredibly generous used for the first stage there is a dark gold treasure chest i'll talk sao chen logs down on dark gold equipment somewhere a chest of this quality like click and dance not used equipment but also precious skill books or special items skill books and rare special items shieldic returns the rewards for the second stage are even more enticing featuring a legendary treasure chest and a village construction order the legendary treasure chest specs for it's air even with a very agile act and telling legendary equipment will delight sao chen but the village construction order is the real jackpot currently all guilds in the original can only be established with the permission of npc factions not only do the llave to pay a hefty tax every month but there are also strict limits on the number of members capping at a maximum of 10 000 plus for some large guilds this limitation is fatal posing a significant obstacle to all guilds aspiring to become a top tier in the original world for instance the foaming guild or the usher can shang guild can only create various branches after establishing a main guild for any extra members this not only increases costs but also makes communication among guild members quite sluggish one code say that player guilds feel quite stifled in front of npc factions however having this village construction order changes everything as the name suggests the village construction order allows the user to claim a piece of land to govern without paying taxes and without restrictions on the number of members if sao chen obtains this village construction order and sells it it would fetch an astronomical price causing our guilds to scramble for it and if it uses it to create a guild himself in the future it would have a tremendous advantage this would definitely be the first guild in the entire server to have a player controlled territory rest assured city lord it will head to the jument mars in the next couple of days and will definitely keep an eye out for your granddaughter sao chen promised patting his chest with such generous rewards only a full gold refuse lee mushi nadhi his eyes filled with joy thank you lord xiangie as soon as a finished speaking he pulled out a gray cloak from somewhere and handed it to sao chun he see that lord xenia comes from the same place as to the immortals oxide this might be of some small help to you immortals is the term npcs use to refer to players players can resurrect after the ad which is quite literally immortal is they very fitting sao chen happily accepted the equipment glancing at it and feeling as if a pia fallen from the sky saddock low quality special costume equipment requirement non-e hp milstamene 300 special effect can change players appearance profession idea special costume in the original player sabe different equipment slats for armor helmet upper garment lower garment gloves and shoes attack equipment slats include main weapon secondary weapon rings necklaces and earrings additionally there are corresponding costumes that's for each equipment slats at this stage at this stage all customs among players are attribute less and merely serve to change appearance however this glow in front of sao chen not only as attribute bonuses but more importantly can completely alter his appearance he can transform into another person entirely if he wishes this not only helps him avoid harassment from ordinary players but also allow him to pretend to be a preserve by a cool or high to ambos enemies among other things since he got this glow and have been the chance to use he up a lord xianya like see limusie see likey of course he likey thank you city lord sao chen quickly accepted it in an instant his gastors limusie chan this old man not only gives out quests but also equipment is truly a rare gem daddy yanje is out can he have you as a friend daddy yanje ah that's not daddy yanje good turns out it's just an npc what a waste of insucesa speaking of which i've been waiting at the lord's gate for solon and this is the first time i've seen this npc and the doente even hibe out quests but the point of remembering him by the way why has that the yanje come out yet the flowers i'm waiting for are about to wither at the entrance of the lord's mansion a group of players there intently at the gate and when they saw a strange npc guard come out they immediately beg on to brumble in disappointment little did they know that the yanje they long to cling to west this and family npc this adult cloak is really useful sao chun what temporarily decided to this guy himself as an npc murmured softly continuing to deliver updates spinning and rolling for 5 star reviews din player frosty snow has initiated a voice can you make a share with you do you accept just after sao chen left the lord's mansion a system prompt suddenly rang in his ears he already said he don't want to do dungeons anymore what does frosty snow want with me sao chen mattered curiously he had already added frosty snow as a friend and this was the first time they were using boys came you make a share a click text great god chenya are you inside the chile city frosty snob school boys came to the cat but sao chen called sense a hint of urgency yes but sao chen ask a puzzle great god chenya please don't leave the city for now frosty snow heard it lycée and received news that the president of the overlord guild emperor has taken over 10 000 elite players and left swambo city trogaporta we don't know where they went for now but is expect they might be heading to chile city are you sure sao chen west taken back over 10 000 people teleporting teleporting across my city's costs 1 gold coin per person over 10 000 people that's over 10 000 gold coins what a b spend yes the source of the information is reliable is expected target is you frosty snow speculating okay you understand thank you for the warning you handle it myself so chenly played camley the overlord guild spending a fortune together over 10 000 elite players surely but they used to take down a boss that would be too much of a loss also since the players need to grow the team is the right so they wouldn't engage in a war with the fenix cry guild to compete for the title of the number one human guild at this stage everyone knows about the conflict between him and the overlord guild used an orago attacking down emperor and his crew with their pride it would be strange if they could swallow the humiliation therefore frosty snob speculation at i probability of being true do they think gathering 10 000 people can take me down how nice but it's just right if they've been looking for them and they've become a knocking on my door sao chan rebuild the plafel smile with the dark gold armor he's at a bridge a terrifying number of 270 000 and coupled with the terrifying alt regeneration from his tamen attribute even if it's too still and let them hit him for three days and nights they still bolden the viable to kill him not to mention the tons counter damage effect which reflects 20 percent of the alt damage back that's no joke insert with his attributes and skills no matter how many players there are at this stage it bolden the matter thinking of this sao chenig early anticipated seeing the despairing gas of overlord emperor sun that would definitely be interesting meanwhile at the headquarters of the phoenix cry gil frosty snow had used to nap the car when a group of players surrounded her president sister are we going to help daddy yanje the female warrior siaoki has kept nervously her words causing frosty snob's expression to darken for a moment silently screaming inside this little bra calls me sister but calls great god yanje daddy not holding back at all essentially helping me acknowledge your father for no reason i'm the president don't you have any pride taking a the breath shangas was shook of the chaotic thoughts in her mind and focused on analyzing the situation and know the emperor is narrow-minded and vengeful after being publicly killed by the great god yanje once they must have felt humiliated and will find a way to italia this time we received news that over 10 000 players have disappeared through the portal they must be preparing to take action and since the great god yanje has helped us so much we cannot ignore this we must find a way to sword the house gils conspiracy as soon as she finished speaking the impassioned siaoki quickly ask what sold we do sold we order the players to assemble that's not urgent for now shangas we talked for a moment and said chiyue city is our territory dealing with us 10 000 players do enteric way a large-scale assembly the priorities to spread the news and find out where the house and gild members are relying in what understood the group quickly agreed shangas was guess was correct at that moment outside the chiyue city the emperor was leading a full 10 000 players lying in ambos on a hillside around the hillside dozens of players were driving away casual players not allowing anyone to approach so there were about soft ese 10 000 people had not been exposed for the timeree however according to scouts xianya rarely left the city and had been lying in what which was not a long-term plan all joan has scored players hidden inside the chiyue city where sianya is the emperor said without turning his head to the person being dim moments later all joan's voice came from being president or people saw him enter the lord's mansion and haven't come out since the dummy the emperor cursed under his breast he had received news that sianya was no longer running dungeons so why wasn't he coming out to play he had been waiting here for a full 20 minutes only to find that the other side was still in the lord's mansion making them look like fools for a moment a began to doubt whether it was wise to expend so much manpower and resources lying in what without fully understanding the other see this movements wondering if he had let his anger clothe his jagment at this moment or joan spoke again president according to our undercover in the fengming guild shuan gao so as order alplias outside the city to search for us soul we retreat damn it there are a people from the other side in swanbu city the dumb woman is to kick toria the emperor greeted his teeth and said taking revenge on the enemy's territory was in the edriskie we used to bear 10 000 players they could hardly make a ripple in front of the fengming guild fortunately a monto sejú came along there were no undercover agents from the other side otherwise shuan auxwe bolden the ave ordered a search but would have directly let people to kill them however even so the current situation was very unfavorable for them the target of the event was hiding in the lord's mansion while the posing guild was staring restlessly president soul will retreat all joan couldn't help but ask again so they retreat the emperor was also pondering this question if they didn't retreat they would eventually be discovered by the fengming guild and surrounding if they retreated it would be unsatisfactory so anyaswa didn't know that the house a guild that sent over 15 000 people among them 10 000 were lying in ambos outside the city and 5 000 were guarding the resurrection point even the wealthy emperor felt the sting of this transportation cause moreover retreating like this would make him seem incompetent which was something the emperor called not taller let's what a little longer the emperor reluctantly said time passed slowly and the emperor's patience quickly worsened we retreat at this stage the cost of the at west oi they simply called not afford it hey kept asking for ratings you online you online you online so on the other will be in women's clothing typing ho additionally the top 10 comments on today's latest chapter which is chapter 41 will receive small hit rewards thank you all for your support for 10 000 people it's quite a simple to live savvy the total number of players in the human race is about 500 million and at least 80 million have the upgraded to lv 30 to enter the main city with the number of players allocated to each main city being around 4 million 10 000 people are not conspicuous in front of 4 million by keeping a low profile they can easily blend into chill your city and then teleport away this revenge operation was poorly considered on my part after returning each player who came over will receive a compensation of 200 guild contribution points the emperor said in the guild channel as the guild leader it provides an explanation for consuming every one's team and money guild contribution points can be exchange for equipment in the guild warehouse and 200 points are in out to exchange for a piece of ordinary branch equipment which made everyone quite satisfied thus everyone prepared to live at that moment an npc approached from not far away on the other side sao chen after learning about the plans of the house guild did not hit swang out suicide by his and disguised himself as an npc starting to explore outside the city alone the npc disguised as was quite distinctive randomly chose the name of a historical figure calling himself by key and replaced his epic long sword and legendary shield with a fierce and big clear bear and a small round shield activating the weapon effects while also displaying the title effect of the one who surpasses all about his name from the oxide appeared to be a mysterious npc dawn in splendid gear and the funny player us a detection skill on him the displayed information was equally mysterious the one who surpasses all like chi class god of killing attack power defense power health skills remarks a powerful being from the human royal city seemingly searching for a certain treasure a series of question marks incredibly mysterious the title about his head made impossible for others not to let their imagination from whale especially the remarks let players who saw into thing they make receive a some kind of quest this goes sao chen to be followed by a group of feral players after he left chi yu city but unfortunately they speed west to slow sao chen intentionally slowed his passe a bit to keep them at a manageable distance behind them on swang out suicide they are probably already starting to look for the traces of the auswegeal the emperor not wanting to be wiped out can only sleep away however after spending a huge amount of money for nothing they will inevitably feel unwilling at this time if they can receive a hidden quest out of the psychology of not wanting to have a wasted a trip they will probably be unable to resist wanting to take it sao chen's eyes flickered secretly pressing his own cleverness chi yu city can accommodate millions of players and npcs and the city covers a vast area no matter how strong he is alone it's impossible to circle the city in a sort time a solo player has a significant disadvantage when searching for enemies and before the information from the fungming guild arrives he can only rely on luck and now a mountain disappearance to exploit the players greedy souls enticing the people from the auser guild where are the people from the auser guild come out quickly sao chen observed his surroundings listening intently for any things of the other party suddenly no far in front of him five players emerged from a hill sao chen's gas sharpened and they instinctively slowed his steps to ensure the players called kepa this hill as barren land not even small monsters are willing to approach and suddenly five players appear called they be from the auser guild as a got closer it turned out to be used as sao chen predicted among the five four of them at the ds prefisered with the worst auser and vain the five countless heads emerge from the undulating hills jeje it's hard to find a place to tread on irons shoes al red names use the right reason to take action without waiting for the others to approach for a conversation sao chen suddenly accelerated simply slashing with his knife instantly taking down five players the five players mantanda does expression right up until there this evil do is deserto die sao chen mimicked the tone of an npc sign it with a flare his voice was too loud but it was an oak for the members of the overlord guild hidden in the age stay here clearly they also beret in response damn this npc is so dominating attacking without a word do se actively kill when is his red names what bad luck this is the type of npc that had zibor brothers we probably can't take this quest anymore don't be greedy of course we sober 10 000 of us hardly anyone is a witten name most are red names who dare esto provoking brothers let's get out of here seeing how chen silently attacking and declaring they desert to die the group immediately vegan tori tree the overlord guild had always acted aggressively bullying ordinary players in swambo city and most of the guild members have killed three players while leveling up so having red names was normal they talked if they were to be killed by this furious mysterious npc not only would they fall into a weakened state but they would also drop equipment and then a pinjal which would be a huge loss this npc looked after the always likely a tight level with overwhelming attack and defense stats so they decided to flee quickly however sao chen's intention was to wipe them aloud how cold let them escape so easily strode towards them shouting here so many scenes are hiding prepared to die without further ado he jumped into the crowd and began to say widely his exception elige giletima de his attack movement speed explosive and with the 500% double speed boost from the lv9 legendary skill and match danse sao chen instantly transformed into a true killing god in the original normal attacks are also area attacks any target within the trajectory of his sword swing will take damage to the range smaller camper to have skills and in the plan to use skills for a simple reason and in the one that overlord guild members don't know it was the one killing them only in this way after they all die done resurrected back in swambo city good day let their guard down giving him another chance to strike it's only politet or return the favor once they take down dispatch from the overlord guild and he had to swambo city for some fan sao chen's eye sparkle and already devised the plan the emperor led 10 000 people to attack him although he called his early crush the mall such an attitude that to be responded to other ways not only would the feel unsatisfied but outsiders would also think he was a bit so those who seek revenge are not used to emperor and sao chen can endure anything but he cannot tolerate anger sao chen's speed was too fast and his attack power was he in used 10 seconds a clearing was mad around him as the overlord guild players were wiped out at least 100 players were killed by him at this moment the emperor finally received news from his subordinates looking over with uncertainty what's going on where did this furious npc come from what's happening over there seeing this furious npc attacking the emperor immediately had a bad feeling and quickly escaped in the guild channel more than a hundred dead players immediately spoke up in the guild channel president this npc came from chile city we talked we meet have received some hidden quest but we didn't expect this npc to attack without a war yeah we were killed before we even got close this guy attacks us on as his red names my silver staff drop it hurt so much damn president be careful this guy has the title the one who surpasses all clearly i clever l npc not someone tomeswiss that's right the guild channel was in chaos and the token per eragual to understand the reason at first five people encountered the mysterious npc and seeing his extraordinary presence they wanted to approach and see if they could receive a hidden quest but before a day called the events peak they were killed moreover from the words spoken by this npc and amad by chi it was clear that there was someone who would attack players with red names watching the ones i did slaughter as if a wolf had entered a flock of lambs emperor felt a chill run down his spine in just a sort time spent sorting out the situation over a hundred members had already died the ground was littered with shining equipment however at the moment emperor kill he noticed something and you chewed you guys were killed by an npc why aren't you in jail in the original when red namet players are killed by other players aside from dropping one piece of equipment and being weakened upon the selection there are no other consequences bad being killed by an npc means you have to serve team in jail and the duration is determined by your simbolo most of the players who had used been killed were red namet yet they were in danger weakly intime since emperor was passed we don't know either the system prompted say we were killed by this guy namet by ichi ya mine eto let me paste the exact where system prompt you have been killed by ig level npc by ichi you have resurrected at the resurrection point 23 pulgadas on busitir right mine 6 the same no yaltime how strange is by chivili a justice tai npc code be a wild npc not officially recognized by the original the discussion among the deceased members relieved emperor abit fortunately it and they reached the worst case scenario the equipment lost the panda had called be found the game and the weekend stayed called be remedied by visiting the temple in the main city and paying some gold to reduce the team not having to serve the yale team meant the losses were still manageable all right since it's an npc that attacks red names everyone quickly scattered and escape emperor issued the command in the guild channel and noticed some members resisting but they attacks on the npc only resulted in a pathetic minus one damage and they immediately understood that even with 10 000 of them they had no power to resist so decisively ordered the guild members to split up and flee they couldn't fight back so they could only run every life's up meant less loss upon hearing these the members immediately stopped holding on and scattered like frightened birds and beasts in an instant day until they broke apart with members fleeing in all directions so chen was stuck in a back a are they really running away eto the proud members of the guild would have some backbone but they were escaping so decisively say solo players really have a tough so chen felt a bit disgruntled no matter how fast the cold kill with the opponents focused on fleeing a bold and the viable to take down many it was inevitable this was one of the disadvantages of being a solo player even if so chen's attributes were invincible at this stage capable of killing millions of enemies alone the opponents avoidance of battle was quite frustrating unless a skill with an extremely large area of effect like some of the mages forbidden spells there are two few of these super large area skills when he got to human mars to find a second transfer mentor he sold also handsome i global monsters to see if he can get one as for now he sold use focus on what he can kill after he create the guild it won't be so frustrating so chen matter a few words to himself and his killing speed increase he decided that after returning from june man mars will create the guild it's not that he don't want to create a guild right now but establishing a guild isn't something that can be casually said and easily accomplished his reputation is indeed sufficient to attract many players however a straight tossing it can passively take the guild members into dungeons every day can it by the team returns from the cloud dream mars it will have a cumulative quite a bit of equipment skills and other good things at that team as the guilds reserve stage these items will surely attract many global players moreover after completing the lord's quest and obtaining the village construction order development will become even easier while thinking this so chen quickly slashed at his enemies and the members of the outer guild who were being attacked fell silent turning into streaks of with a light leaving the entire equipment unknowingly two more minutes past underground the past was littered with countless pieces of equipment and items this and excited the scattered players who have been chasing sao chen damn it was almost scared to that by the furious npc by chi but suddenly realized this actually a good guy bullseed a used slashes without saying anything how is that a good npc are you blind most of those who got good down are red names these are the same exact exactly he also noticed that the ones getting cut out all trash from the outside guild this npc is helping us scatter players bent or frustrations you guys are so relaxed still have a team to chat and reflect are nttc pieces of equipment on the ground tempting crap he forgot to pick up the equipment hey he saw that silver staff first sao chen wes crassily slashing ahead while the scatter players bending excitedly scrambled for the equipment on the ground al feeling that event talk they and they're taking on a quest they had a big profit the players summoned by the emperor to the alway sao chen were all elites from the outside guild most of them had one or two pieces of silver equipment on them after dying they dropped kitabhi as well sao chen had not even talked about the scatter players secretly picking up the spoils bending it was solely focused on slashing even if they were picking up the equipment evolved into mine come on as the top player in the gaming world would even look at silver equipment that would be too insulting it was like grabbing the rich to help the poor giving benefits to the scatter players from the wilderness to the city then they're just lasted about 20 minutes although the ao shared guild members tried their best to escape separately they still lost nearly half of their members in the face of sao chan's explosive attack speed and movement speed most importantly just before the emperor and his group were about to enter the teleportation array to escape sao chan swiftly send them back to swan bu city with a single slash he'll sub you a teleportation fee you so'll be very happy right sao chan secretly talked to himself that he was truly a good person to emphasize an important point again the latest chapter which is the first 10 comments of chapter 41 will receive small hit rewards thank you all for you support comments will be based on the team of publication system prompt you have been killed by the eagle level npc by current level experience reduced by 20% you have responded at the resurrection 20 in swan bu city swan bu city resurrection 20 the emperor who responded at a terrifyingly dark expression and said nothing he had died twice in a sword period losing two pieces of silver equipment the weekend stayed cold be resolved by spending money at the temple priest costing 100 gold coins to shorten the duration by amount which equal effort however he had just calculated that the total number of guild members who had died was a staggering 7 000 we saw many players a cold and the passably spend money to help them a limited weekend stay that would be 700 000 gold coins even as the president of a top guild a cold and the come up with that amount therefore this month the guild members will have to endure the weekend the buff and what it out while as the president would have to be profusely for alone team in exchange moreover and also need to find a way to compensate for the equipment that was drap gathering 10 000 people to go to chile city in a moment of impulse and not only fall to achieve the original goal but also cause such severe losses overall the blot though the aussie guild was too significant the subsequent developments had already fallen far been the fong min guild president the members are causing a ruckus what's all we do at this moment all john walked over looking anxious as a whisper for all the fallen members let's temporarily compensated them with 500 guild contribution points emperor said weekly with his eyes close another to produce a gold or equipment they could only settle with guild contributions however issuing so many a tonse code likely lead to a situation where members had no contribution points but no equipment to exchange for this would be another serious blot to the aussie guild or like fine all joan i played draili as the right-hand man of the president he understood that this trip to chile city was a significant loss the npc impersonated by isaocena could his way from outside the chile city to the teleportation array leaving a pile of equipment being such a question had already stirred up the players in chile city when they realized that the ones being cut down were players from the aussie guild it immediately sparked a huge storm on the forums countless unlockers were stunned doubting tearyon eyes what the hell how cold so many people from the aussie guild appeared in chile city that's the territory of the foaming guild what else a cold did be e guess it's 9 out of 10 that they're preparing to take revenge on the great demon kings and what the hell do the aussie people lily dare to take revenge warriors you sold know that the great demon kings and just normal attacks can instant kill them right if they can't take revenge they they use ten up suffering or npcs and chile city are a use that fears by the way this npc by is the it is really dominating surpassing all others awesome it must be a equal level npc even ever seen it before probably came from the royal city the players in chile city are a solucion not only do they have the protection of a physically overwhelming npc but they can also pick up silver equipment on the way i'm in views the people from the aussie guild are all good people welcome to come again the reputation of the aussie guild had never been good and players felt scared and fraude about this incident at the same time they were curious about the mysterious origins of the npc by chi there was no other reason it was used to fears one person chasing after 10 000 every strike instant killing the process was filled with blood and cruelty with the title of surpassing all others it sparked the imagination some players even believe that this was a equal level npc from the human advanced map the royal city in the original the human race was ruled by a royal family and besides the 20 mile cities there was also the central royal city but unfortunately the entry conditions were unknown players speculated that only after the second class change would they have a chance to enter npcs coming from the royal city were naturally the best of the best with this too many players suddenly understood at the same time they felt and views of the changes face even before a máquina move there was a equal level npc providing protection eliminating enemy forces in advance was it a coincidence or was there a direct reason no one could guess it was until until after when saochem belenterely rebuild his identity that the players were identified and raised in surprise on the other side used before saochem stepped into the teleportation portal to swan busiti ericida call from swan gawkswe great god yange do you know emperer has really hit a stroke of bad luck this time e a clear black laughter came from the other end of the line this time emperer was killed by a mysterious npc let's see how i can be arrogant now um swan gawkswe set smugly with a cold snore saochem last dan i ibrowans by hildas spo arenta you curious where this npc came from ah of course i'm curious great god sin you do you know frost oxwe exclammed in surprise umi chee that's me saochem did take them guessing and revealed directly lord sin you no that is in you you're re-joking with me right frost also was momentarily stand murmuring you're a player how cold you possibly become an npc that don't make sense rather than explaining this to saochem it felt more like frost also was trying to explain it to herself after all a player turning into an npc for no reason was far beyond reason 4 now let's not speak of this siangy said cheerfully what for metogoto swan busiti and take out the people from the aussie guild first ah frost also was truly shocked this time if saochem said such a thing did that indirectly prove that everything is said was true how owners was this possible frost oxwe was curious feeling a tickling hair but at that moment saochem had already unabbed the communication next it's my turn to take action we sakal smile saochem this guy is as the npc by stepped into the teleportation array boss bad news that npc actually just was to swan busiti a voice cametro and the ranking members of the aussie guild who were in a meeting immediately saw terrified expressions what did you say emperor was drenched in cold sweat stopping the guild member who had used enter how called the abechast to ese where is now has a killed any of our guild members a series of questions bombarded the guild member a talk a couple of dead breath before speaking with a horrified expression a is right at the gate of swan busiti and has already started slaughtering our guild members several with one strike it's terrifying and somehow not only our main guild members are being killed but even to see from the branch guilds are in the spirit yet it's the only players even if they have red names it was totally fine the npc guards at the city got it in the direct to speak this guild member was almost scared silly emperor doubted his ears what what kind of npc targets only the aussie guild suddenly avolt out the merged in emperor's mind called it be that this npc named by isa jair the campus of janja as one of the top 20 main cities o the human race on busiti had never experienced such a major event since the game launched at the gate a flamboyantly equipped furious npc bearing the title the one who surpasses all west rapidly slaughtering the players of the aussie guild the soldiers on either side of the gate who were sepous to mantan order were somehow used watching this scene unmov the surrounding solo players why died in shock whispered among themselves is this the furious npc from the forums the one from the imperial city damn that's overbearing chasing all the way from chile city to or swamboo city look altos is killing are players from the aussie guild how did the aussie guild provoke this killing go this is so thrilling is this the first team we've seen the combat power of five level npc in the game it's terrifying the aussie guild is really having a bad day how tragic is there still team to discuss this is the the equipment more appealing hairy and gravity the npc at the city got the west non-neutral down hiao chun while the solo players were struck by his terrifying combat power they didn't forget to snag the numerous pieces of equipment that dropped on the ground after the aussie guild players died usually solo players wanted are to do this because they feared retaliation from the aussie guild after things settled down but now we saw many people around it didn't mate dead down they suddenly felt a bit of sympathy for the aussie guild's play many even looked forward to this mysterious npc coming again so they could get rich with a single strike a kill to players who couldn't escape and saw them began to slowly advance into the city killing at the city got a like this us that asserted a lot of the reputation of the aussie guild but it's not an own so chunto to himself accept the aussie guild was large and prosperous with an estimate the total membership exceeding 500 000 although that previously killed most of the elites brought by the emperor it wasn't enough to cause a significant damage in utmost alpha month they would recover this was not the outcome desire since they had decided to stand against the aussie guild so chunad only one goal destroyed the aussie guild unfortunately despite his formidable combat power which made him invincible among players his efficiency in killing was limited due to being alone both wiping out 500 000 players would take an eternity moreover the other side but the foolish knowing they couldn't win they would definitely choose to avoid confrontation and look for opportunities to recuperate therefore i didn't plan to wipe out the aussie guild in one go as that was unrealistic this was a long-term plan intended to start from the city gate and kill his way to the headquarters of the aussie guild and find a way to destroy the cornerstone of their main hall the cornerstone was the foundation of a guild and once destroyed the guild would disband a wanted the aussie guild to become the first guild inventire server tobian ylate such a fiat guild and doubted linalde aussie guild to the pillar of sham in the future when recruiting casual players they will inevitably think of this in short even if a cold and completely destroy the aussie guild the coldest deal deliver a heavy blow to its vital points severely injuring its morale use thinking about the pandy expression on the emperor's face after today made the saochem feel immensely satisfied emperor if you want to blame someone blame your narrow-mindedness this is the price you pay for angering me after firmly deciding saochem and towards the direction of the aussie guild's hall and pushed forward soon after saochem's battle information interfaces suddenly display the prominent system notification being you have a can securely kill 10 000 evil individuals redname players completing the hidden achievement nemesis of evil reward legendary chest x1 appropriate to your level 0 an achievement saochem's isolated surprise the freedom in original west oi akin to the real world where many system mechanics have to be explored by the players themselves unlike typical virtual online games there were currently no main quest in original it wasn't clear whether they were not yet unlocked or what only side quests existed and these achievements and somewhat inexplicable previously when saochem killed 100 or 1 000 people there were no achievement notifications now after killing 10 000 it suddenly appeared it felt as if it crossed countless distances the threshold for the achievement system was very bad the reward was equally generous a legendary chest this was the first time saochem at simone and the cold and the water studied hoping to discover some patterns and complete more hidden achievements the completion condition is consecutively killed 10 000 redname players consecutively saochem slowly severed the words the term consecutively was quite significant at this stage aside from saochem the backplinger no one else called the chi it after pandering for a moment saochem shook his head we used one line of text a cold and define a pattern for heti let's consider it a rare opportunity now let's open the legendary chest and see saochem deverted a bit of his attention and instructed the system to open the tan chest let me see what would stuff come as a legendary chest world yield equipment skills and special can sumables among other things regardless of what it produced it will greatly enhance him used looking at the attributes of the legendary equipment the demon god's shield was a note to know that however the items of tan from this legendary treasure chest are limited to on a sound level it can be anticipated that the enhancement effect will be much less than that of a lv 180 shield but it is still a powerful item the treasure chest opens in you have opened a legendary treasure chest and then a skill book oblivion slash x1 would you like to clammy club saochem this is easily click and in the next moment a skill book radiating purple light appeared before aim lv1 oblivion slash active skill after charging for one second you can unleash a massive sword energy that covers a range of 2000 by 2000 meters in front of you with 600% of the base panel attack power call down team 24 hours what the hell such a large range so chen was instantly done to be honest the attack power of oblivion that is far lower than that of the legendary skill tuners and even lower than the legendary mag skill meteorfall that exists in his backpack the call down team is also longer only use the 11 a day but this range is simply unbelievable a 2.000 square meter area is equivalent to 4 or 5 football fields if the team is right it's possible to wipe out 3.000 players with one slash this range is terrifying it's practically made for group battles a decisively click to learn it then upgraded it to lv9 now the proud gil is going to be completely desperate a smile appeared on sao chen's lips after mastering the new skill it would be much easier to destroy the main guild of the proud gil alfan or later under sao chen's terrifying output emade his way smoothly to the entrance of the proud guild's headquarters before aim stood the resurrected emperor his face dark whizz anger bained him were countless players the emperor pandered for a long time but still couldn't understand how he had provoked this npc if it were the king that used kills redna met players on site then after salon of slaughter in bloodmont city it sold a bnd but the reality was that this npc na met by chis in intent on carrying out a massacre teleporting to swamboo city to kill again at this stage player simply called not stop his advance and the npc forces they are he go past four were as good as bling now that they had reached the proud guild headquarters they called only rely on themselves to resist however before attacking action the emperor was very reluctant and wanted to clarify things no other reason today's losses were too great a bold and the diablo sleep soundly without understanding the cause excuse me this strong one there are so many red name players on the street why do you specifically target or proud guild the emperor slowly ask that sao chen didn't know how to respond at first so he simply fell silent after a moment seeing that sao chen had no intention of speaking the emperor called the hell but ask that are you being instructed by someone like someone named kyan ji at this moment still had some doubts that it was kyan ji's doing although this suspicion had no evidence asking bold and the head after all words in this game very much to actually guess that i'm involved this emperor guy has kicked a sap intuition sao chen has quintet his eyes so trusting in his mind and npc inexplicably targeting a guild and no one could understand the reason yet the emperor killed is since it was related to him this intuition was indeed somewhat frightening as expected it was the president of a a major guild with exceptional qualities but the more this was the case the stronger might result to eliminate you all sao chen did not plan to reveal his identity used yet instead and intended to do so at the last moment before the foundation of the opposing guild was about to be destroyed ensuring that the proud guild members will have the most profound impression with this in mind sao chen decided not to waste any more time and like a clumsy fool charged strut into the crowd seeing this the emperor greeted his t-san matter hmph and don't care who you are we have 30 000 players here and he refused to believe we can't kill you the murderous intent from the opponent's search forcing the emperor to prepare for the worst during the teammate talk force a ochent to travel from the city gate to the guild headquarters the emperor had already devised a plan to ensure the guild would not be disbanded they absolutely could not retreat any further at the headquarters entrance therefore urgently summon 30 000 players to confront this irritable npc moreover being located in a major stronghold like swambu city the guild members called quickly replenish shiny casualties brothers let's all attack together we will be the first guild to kill an npc in the game the emperor's shouty in the next moment countless dazzling attack sword from bendim fireballs and small meteors from mages runoff heroes and tracking heroes from archers judgment hammers and holy light orbs from priests countless kills sailed into the air creating a brilliant display of light in the next moment innumerable attacks fell like stars striking the spot where south chance to minus one minus one minus one countless minus one numbers popped up above south chance g seeing this the emperor laughed maniacally yes that's it ran classes g dealing damage we all wear him down strictly speaking this was the first teammate in the game original da such a large scale simultaneous attack care countless skills panty the entire sky in vibrant colors completely drowning out south chance figure on the ground nearby the scatter plays what then following south chance to pick up scraps were momentarily standing to silence by the scene my god is this one of the strengths of a major guild 30 000 players it's terrifying he's even if they can only force a one drop of a that's over 30 000 damage per second right it's over it's over the major guild is showing its power this npc is dumb having so many people is impressive the scatter players were bought out by the grand scene and secretly regretted that this npc who had left them countless pieces of equipment would likely fall to the sea of players from the proud guild even talks out and at this plado overwhelming combat power along the way no one was optimistic about him because the numbers were simply too overwhelming at this call even the level 45 the gold exploding spider the boss of the abyss level difficulty spider kb boldnt we stand a single round all the players present believe that's a ochre and good eventually fall here however the players with sharper is a suddenly notice that this npc coating countless attacks can lead us his small round shield slightly charging his stance a blacklight sim to flash across the small round shield in the next moment the countless guild members vain the emperor who were releasing their skills suddenly at brick red numbers pop up about their heads minus 1998 minus 2,450 minus 2,630 the red numbers sim to turn into an ocean immediately after the players with numbers of up their heads transformed into beams of with the light vanishing one after an otterina russ to see an aware of the situation me have it talked it was a large scale magic trick the scatter players who witnessed this entire process where let speak listen so ah what's going on the emperor noticed that the output numbers are suddenly dropped to les dan 1% an a terrifying guess emerged in his mind slowly turned at his head and was horrified to discover that the 30,000 players who had been crowded being them at now disappeared by him more than two sets the countless pieces of equipment appearing on the ground sim to tell him that it was all not an illusion this this the emperor's pupils constricted horrified and about to say something but in the next second sao chung charged forward and sent him back to the revival point with a single strike the proud president of the proud guild for the third team fell under his sword boom everyone witnessing this nwa identitarizing terror doubting whether they were seeing things what the hell instantaneously killing 20,000 people is this the terrifying combat power of high level npc the sea tactics of the proud guild seemed like a joke meanwhile on the gaming players forum countless explosive posts suddenly flooded in like a screen refresh so king alplac so furious npc suspected counter damage skill instantaneously kills 20,000 players sea tactics a bebeen proven ineffective in front of it level npc s in the original terrifying counter damage discussing the dark day of the proud guild slashing from redmond city to swamboo city the mysterious npc by his pass of extermination so terrifying you have no idea how horrified you was being on site countless exposed swiss nearly identical titles drew the attention of all players wandering the forum a this moment he ochent's massacre of the proud guild in swamboo city was the focus of the entire server after using the zone counter damage skill from the demon god's shield to instantly kill at leas 20.000 players saocheng was delighted this guy the emperor really gave me a b hit the effect of the zones was when attack it reflects 20% of the damage back to the attacker lasting 30 seconds with a cooldown of 60 seconds his alt value already exceeded 100 000 points so 20% is 20 000 which player at this stage besides him cold reach 5 000 ea 20 000 damage me answer time de a saocheng aderigen eliplan to cut down the guild's cornerstone disband a main proud guild and severely weakened dead but now is suddenly a double idea why not take out a few branch guilds as well what if the emperor got carried away and launched a few more can't centred the attacks bold and that quickly allowed saocheng to serpa 100 000 player keys 1 000 gold grant a hidden achievement and a legendary treasure chest what about 100 000 al toge cold and te guaranteed gold be 100% the probability was still quite a emperor or emperor e suddenly find you quite a pleasing to the eye capital saocheng secretly rejoice what was originally used a simple act of revenge against the emperor unexpectedly turned into a pleasant surprise it must be said that saocheng's bad impression of the emperor had improved a bit this guy may not have a great character but is a good person he wonder if such good fortune can happen again he start killing players and see how the emperor reacts saocheng come down and quietly slaughtered the remaining 10 000 players in front of him swiss swiss swiss a series of witte lights appear and the remaining player seems to stand their reactions sluggish saocheng found the incredibly easy to kill suddenly a scream rang out brothers the boss has spoken retreat what running away saocheng was taken aback them became a furious emperor but going on with you just a moment ago he pressed you for being sensible and now you're a fally apart you can run away but can the temple run away too you're abandoning your guild however no matter how angry saocheng was the players on the opposite side were all fleeing in panic clutching their heads he found himself in the same situation as of see the redmond city too many people were running away for one person to kill meanwhile the all-looking casual players nearby were utterly stunned instantaneously killing 20 000 but no what kind of trouble did the proud guild get into is such a furious npc the proud guild truly has some skills redmond city after receiving news from his abominates swangai oswari build a complex expression all the way to the opposite home scaring everyone into not daring to defend the home that siangai is really too dominating is the the aoc guild has truly run out of like this team ito have provoked him swangauk so recall the words saocheng accepted her before a living her are filled with complex emotions on one hand she felt a sadden fraude at the current state of the aoc guild on the other hand she was alone by saocheng's dominating behavior displayed in this incident who would have talked that one of the 10 most recognized guilds in the game would suffer a fatal blow so soon after the server opened used for offending alone a ball at this moment swangauk so felt incredibly fortunate that their guilds fanking one single world friends and the members of their own right and treated him with great respect which had for the good relationship say it seems one can be as arrogant as the emperor one must be humble and cautious swangauk so it slowly then an encounter level excitement bubbled up in side here the aoc guild at hundreds of thousands of members but due to the current limit on guild members there were about 50 or 60 branch guilds with one main guild led by the emperor and composed of elite members after this battle with saocheng althog the aoc guild bold and they completely disband it would undoubtedly suffer a severe blow one step behind me and fall in further vain the aoc guild guild never catch up to them again swangauk so i never imagined that one day simply be cause of the completely apesitate towards the same person her own guild will become the leading player force among the human race does their fengming guild once again one effortlessly on the other side outside the main gate of the aoc guild saocheng had already killed all the aoc guild members called si as for those who had mixed in with the crowd used to watch and wanted to escape and couldn't be bothered to chase them down otherwise if accidentally involved the casual players it bolded the line with his plans after all this was a conflict with the aoc guild and the casual players were innocent saocheng basteable odtirstie demon juinjoid killing for fun evoontesloutere ordinary players for nor reason be cause of this the casual players mantan the distance that was neither to far nor to close neither fleeing nor daring to approach to pick up equipment while saocheng was still there are the aoc guild members giving up resistance after waiting for a while without seeing any aoc guild players saocheng felt a wave of disappointment the emperor seemed to have recognized reality this time and directly abandoned the guild headquarters to be fair the emperor's decision was quite sensible in front of saocheng numbers at lost their significance and the sea of people tactical turn it into a strategy for the a the emperor's decision to learn from the heck and shed its talent to survive was very wise but for saocheng it was quite frustrating it had been preparing for a 10 000 man slaughter hoping to see if a cold get another legendary chest but the emperor had backed down say since they be decided to be a turtle hiding in itself going to other brand guilds would probably be a waste after all creating a guild don't take much effort this time you can consider it a wall achieve it was the wasted trip saocheng matter to himself and made a decision the aoc guild was vollear terribly avoiding battle it was disappointed but also powerless who told him was a casual player if only at his own guild force gathering hundreds of thousands of little brothers to fight together the other side boldnt they want to engage but they would have to perhaps this time the aoc guild would be directly beaten into oblivion for the the first time so in felt the medetto create a guild as soon as possible let's call it a day in it to herito the junmin mars complete the second transfer while also finishing the lord's quest and get the village construction order to create a guild saocheng made up his mind and focused his thoughts and removed the disguise effect of the sadouk cloud in front of everyone his figure was restored in other are players from the overlook guild among you saocheng slowly set to the dust crowd of see the go back and tell the emperor if you have the guts kept gathering people to take revenge on me the atmosphere around was the silent saocheng didn't take care he walked into the hall of the overlook guild an oval stone pillar stood in the center of the hall this was the cornerstone of the guild destroying this cornerstone bull force the number one guild overlooked to this band so king the mysterious npc by chi is actually the demon king kyan jimsel transforming outfits as a so king can spire scene history the downfall of the overlook guild how terrifying is the demon

implies thus everyone talked of the source of this incident the president overlook emperor if the emperor called nte come up with a satisfactory answer the overlook guild would basically be finished the emperor himself realized this and said we are full of pain for each fall and pleasure he will compensate 500 contributions and in the next half month he will gradually compensate each person with

equipment that could be exchanged in the warehouse sorry used what a moment and with 40 000 people each contributing 100 gold coins that amount to 4 million gold coins even the emperor nearly spat out blow from now on the entire guild will have a total tenter belts thinking of the culprit being this situation the recently rebuilt sao chen the emperor couldn't help but burn with rage greeting his teasing hatred xianji is worth to you we will not coexist since i started playing the game the emperor had never suffered such a huge loss a good never swallowed this anger the phases of the guild sick ranking members around him were equally flushed with frustration filled with fury that's right we will definitely not let this guy off or guild must take revenge firstly damn chen don't let me

reddening as they clenched their jaws in silence each person knew that this incident was far from over unless the main guild was destroyed the other side would not relent everyone wanted revenge even

back to the community but Emperor, Prida of the Guild, was disbanded. By Qianji, a sense of confusion rose in. Everion's minds. The next moment, as the information registered, the player snapped back to reality. Boom. This time, it was an explosion ringing in the player's minds. The once. Domineering Prida of the Guild had truly been disbanded by the great demon Xianji. This confrontation. Ultimately ended with the lone wolf clamming victory. My go. Xianji, you actually talk. Down Prida of the Guild number one. After the system prompt, Suangauksue, far away in serious city. Immediately sent a message. Suangauksue was bot excited and letal. Calling him that wish. Surprising is despite her previous reluctance. A guild being disbanded is even more impressive than you. Killing their 40,000 players. It deals a devastating blow to the reputation of Prida of the Guild. I can't wait to see how the Emperor as the face to remand the Guild leader. Hahaha, speaking of. Which, they offended my dad sin you. So this. Outcome is only to be expected. Giaokian. Sihil Fantley, having already exited the Guild Hall. However, apart from the scattered players, no. Members of the AOC Guild dare to appear before him. That's what you're planning to do. Now, how about going after the AOC Guild's branch? I can provide the location. Suangauksue transformed into a psicopat. The more severely the AOC Guild was hit. The greater. The advantage for their functioning guild. But what disappointed Suangauksue was that Saochen had no intention. Of continuing. Just he be the malesen. We can. Take our team later. Yabe things to do. And not team it always here. All right, then that's something. Shall we go into a dungeon together later? What are you thinking? In it, to do my second class. Transfer it on to a team for such boring. Things or as on as a finish, the speaking Giaokianun, an update, and you're not going to be a case in a way. A moment longer, but Emperor's figure still ante a peer than the shook his head in disappointment. Say little brother Emperor, you've completely lost all face, realizing this Giaokianun. Didn't linger and directly turn it to walk towards the teleportation officer in Swambu City. Next, the West heading to the human race is far this boundary. Go visit it West one of the border. Areas between the human race and the demon race Lord of Chiyue City, Limusi. Ad informed him that from Gobi City, heading west and crossing the border on foot would lead to the area joining the demon race, which was the human mars. South chance destruction of the house, Chuenchon, numero uno. Guild naturally stirred quite a wave on the forum. After all, what a destroyed was not some random guild, it was one of the top 10 guilds recognized across the server. Of course, after this series of events, the once needs to be added before the top 10. As one Gaukse said, this incident delta severe blot to the reputation of the house. Guild. The scatterplice. Couldn't the hell but wonder how cold a large guild with hundreds of thousands of members be suppressed by a lone or especially since the botcides have become irreconcilable, only an idiot would join the weaker side. Moreover, players were originally at little attachment to the house. The situation guild is to withdraw after this incident. In notime, the number of players in the house. Guild started. To shrink significantly. The overall strength of the guild plummeted compared to before. Of course, all of this was temporarily in the latitudes out there. After teleporting to Gobi City, a didn't bother with sanity and directly left the city heading straight west. As one of the 20 main cities of the human race, Gobi City, despite being close to the border, was not lacking in player numbers. After exiting the city gates, the leveling area outside was filled with players. Senje, disguised himself as an ordinary warrior, altering both his appearance as a pass through various leveling areas. Some players, a pan, seeing Saochun, looked at him wearily, feeling a good snack their leveling spots, only relaxing their guard after. A moved away. Saochun didn't mind, a vast, a vender to level up, a benefit. Monopoly said at the low-level monsters in these areas, evolved into the interest. From here to June, Mars, at my speed, it will take at least 3 days. Saochun from a, his walking speed, but slow, given his agility attribute. It was used that the journey was a bit too boring. Saochun considered whether a soul get a mount to play with. Currently, there was a mount system in the original. After completing a relatively difficult task at the mount train airing the main city, players would receive an ordinary donkey. However, this donkey had no attribute bonuses and it's increase in movement speed was not significant. So, during the few days that Saochun spent in Redmond City, it didn't eliminate them out of a sense of trouble. But now, it suddenly felt a thing of regret. Travelling on foot is total, if you had a donkey, you could sit on it and rest for a while. Although, players in the original don't need to rest, the nerds that are always on a child so need to be sitting on. A donkey to relax a bit bold and to be back. Just a Saochun was contemplating weather. To waste. An hour to returning to go visit to find a mount trainer for a quest, suddenly, a commotion of fighting. Sounds come from not far away. Saochun happened to be a bit bold, so it turned his head to take a look and found. About a hundred players surrounding a female player in the middle. The beside female player. Seem to be a holy priest. What picked Saochun's curiosity was that this female priest, under the sea, of over a hundred opponents, surprisingly and died on the spot. Saochun steadied his mind and observed the game. So that the more than a hundred attackers adused to rounds of skills, yet the female priest still appeared to be fine, only cast a few heels. Ah, sorry Syrian? Saochun clicked his stand. What kind of person can stand for a long time while facing the sea of over a hundred? Plus, this left him a bit puzzle. Cold did be that these female priest skills had also. Rich LV9, used like his, had gone massive experience from grinding the demon go. At the start, but what made her able to level up so he saw indecided to watch a little longer. After all, his future gave a dead level. Plus, if she was talented, a good to step into hell, who got out, they would surely be laughed but there was nothing they called though, this one was too formidable, with a pool that was a bad at leas over 10,000. Moreover, after they had finally worn her down, she casually cast a skill and heal back up, which was incredibly frustrating. No, this is a golden treasure chest that my sister and were heart of in. In the way, one rain glared at them and will never hand it over. Upon hearing, this, the warrior immediately made a harsh remark, and let's see what you do. In the head, her man was running low. The lucky part was that this morning, while she and her sister were grinding in the wild, they encountered the LV 40 silver boss and the two of them spent a full two hours to take lucky. Attributes, the boss dropped a silver level staff, a golden level magic skill book, and a kit to hidden dung geon. But the unlucky part was that while fighting the boss, they were targeted by the shameless members of the prophet first kill, and before they could return to the city, they were ambushed by over a hundred of them. Coat of guard, she didn't have a and took her sister at decent gear, she was quickly taken down. Only who is running man, struggling under the sea of 100 opponents. If it beren't for her fortunate, hidden class as a priest, with power for healing skills and her altan. Defensas for exceeding to say of typical players at her level, she felt she would have already followed in her sisters. Footsteps But the current situation was not estimated to last at most another 5 minutes before it's completely depleted. Hunes was extremely anxious and at that moment the leader of the opposing side killing Bracker spoke up again. Hunes considering our old friendship how about you? Hanover the golden skill book and whispered your lie? In your dreams. Hunes regained small. Face turned red with anger. The golden skill book was something they had worked hard together. Why soul? She he paid to this group of beasts? Moreover, her sister had been ambushed and killed by them. What? Would we sign this now? Even if she died, she wouldn't tell them sexy. Hmm, filthy bitch, you re. Asking for it. Killing Bracker's face darkened, now. He changed my mind, not only will kill you. Once, but he also make sure you can surviving deposing guild and after witnessing their ruthless axe killing and looting, they had withdrawn. This group of people was nothing but despicable escondrels. However, while prophet first was at top tier guild with so many players against her and her sister, it was simply too easy. At this moment, she saw switch to another main city to develop with her sister. You then a strange voice came to a a stranger warrior. Jun Zran instantly concluded this was an ordinary player without any remarkable threats. Realizing this, her gal began who at the same team killing wolf looked at the newcomer with a dark expression. Sao Chen's words were undoubtedly looking down on tail guild. As the president killing wolf could not tolerate the TCH who the hell do you team you are right to medley or profit first guilds business seeing that the newcomer was an unfamiliar warrior killing wolf scov kid if you want to play the hero you better be prepared to pay the price brothers kill him he didn't want to make a move but if you're looking for that don't blame me the newcomer was a ochent he had served for a while and finally determined that huns ran was a real talent so he decided to step in and help this could be seen as an early recruitment for his future guild seeing the opposing leader immediately wanting to attack he didn't hold back boom a long tajan bomb right away since he had decided to recruit this female priests outche naturally at the river his identity so he didn't plant all back like a deal against the proud guild avoiding skills to prevent being recognized early the power of the hian bomb was evident minus 1982 minus 2069 after the deafening explosion denser clement of over a hundred opponents was instantly had holy crap you are the demon king of a thousand knights killing breaker size widened in terror if you were to ask who the most famous player in the current game of original west there was no doubt it was souchen a few days ago he had let the phoenix guilds ride the am to them and at the abyss level dung he on and his invincible figure had already been achieved into countless players minds now as he unleashed his skill it immediately awakened killing wolf's memory you guessed right souchen snapped his fingers calmly simultaneously removing the disguise of the sadoclua looking at the posing side as if they were corpses as a reward and he sent you back to the city for free kill the wolf was terrified send a great demon no send you that sperme i wanted to plead for mercy but before he called finish his sentence souchen rushed over and killed him with a single sword strike minus 2 330 a piece of silver equipment draped but souchen didn't even glance at it he rasped his sword and looked at the others with this done in his eyes and didn't want to leave the impression of a murderous maniac on the future guilds talent so he casually uttered a word scram in an instant the remaining members of the profit first guilds scattered like frightened birds and beasts once the crowd had completely dispersed souchen slowly walked over to lucus ran hello i'm yanje souchen gritty while instinctively castinaricanes and spell under the suppression of being over level 10 most of lucus ratings information was revealed the world's

looked at souchen with admiration chien jeda chien jeda the moment to see forwards came out souchen felt a bit speechless about the game why does every corner of this game have a daughter fortunately

straightforwardly i'm planning to create a gill in a while do you want to join ah yes yes yes lv 1 ran west taken back then immediately nadid vigorously feeling a bit pleased in sede si and that skill how many people's dreams is that her class is purely supportive in the original the supportive class leveling process is essentially a quest for a father figure now the strongest father in the entire server was inviting her to join a gill how could she not be excited well then let's add a chatter as friends first okay after they added a chatter as friends they chatted for a while lujuzan intentionally flattered him telling sao chen all about the circumstances of being besieged by the g prophet first gilded her class information without holding back trying to demonstrate her value sao chen added in appreciation admired her straightforwardness not only was she a talent but her personality was also quite good after a while another girl ran over from the direction of gobi city looking about 15 or 16 years old sao chen focused his gas and found that she was a female warrior wielding a sword from a distance the girls shouted loudly sister are you okay i heard that daddy and you came to the rescue of my sister you reso lucky daddy and you smile i did as she spoke the female warrior ran over to sao chen and lujuzyu her gas swept over sao chen instantly bursting with an unusual

bit surprised these two sisters were both hidden classes how lucky daddy chen ya he admire you the most at this moment lujuz flower looked up her face filled with fervor as she gas that sao chen

the second class change still had nearly 200 million experience points in his experience pool and after the second class change a good likely jump several levels just like the first class change at that time a cold challenge again difficulty maps in dungeons since the original was humanity second world and saw chen had such an opportunity and naturally leading the plan to waste it and not only

different from the ordinary dungeons in the mine city they were of the type that cold be encountered but not sought after and the rewards were generally quite generous currently only a handful of lucky players on the forum adapt and kisto hidden dungeons according to luju their key code only allowed them to enter three times after three attempts regardless of whether they cleared it or not the key would definitely be rendered useless we have a very few friends in gobby city and we don't trust the skills of random teams so we happen to run into you daddy yanja and wanted to make this request

original had only been light for 2 months and players had very limited knowledge about dungeons the so call it the best difficulty seemed too easy in sao chen size the monster templates were sluggish and the boss alert range was too small even without such attributes echoed slowly clear it with skill so the this level difficulty may just be equivalent to an initiation as the game progresses and players level a future dungeons may introduce a quinto sexto orebe septimo difficulty of course it's still too early for sao chen to think about that now then you and your team have selected nightmare difficulty entering the dungeon countdown please prepare 3 2 1 you have entered the dungeon lv35 and you have nightmare difficulty as the systems prompt and the scenes shifted and the three appeared in a decilit ring this was a ballet like terran with red magma flowing through the slender ravines around the ground and not a blade of grass core visiting anywhere there was a quiz a sense of the

this old also be one of the first batches of enchantment stones in the game sao chen was a bit curious about how many enchantment attributes there were of the demon crystal league where you're finding

organized their equipment and continued for bar before alone their eyes brightened as they reach the deepest part of the valley here was also the final level of the ee-yoon dung-he-on from a distance

Both of them were powerful hidden classes, and they called take down a silver boss of similar. Level with some effort. A gold boss, however, was a different story, barely managing to Wittell. Downal Fitzalt would be considered an extraordinary performance. They called Nteb Endareto Team. About a Dark Gold Boss. Yet now, what were they? It was actually a legendary boss. Even if they had 10 lives, they wouldn't have the confidence to withstand a single claw from the. A John. Don't be afraid. Just leave this little dog to me. At that moment, Sao Chen said lightly. However, dead down, he was a different asset. He felt a rare spark of interest. Despite his million-level stats, Kachuel using a skill called Giltens of Millions in Damage. But the. Was based on the opponent having zero defense which could be considered the most ideal output value. When. Defense was taken into account, the final number would have to factor in division. The. The. Jones. Defense was not low-handed at damage reduction skills. Thinking of this, Sao Chen couldn't help a. Smile. This little. Dog's all be able to withstand a hit from me and not the. The sisters? The legendary boss, the. Jones. Was considered top tier in the original. The only ones. Stronger than it would be the gods from background legends, that is, mid-level boss. At this stage. Everyone was struggling to take down even a golden boss, let alone. Such a terrifying legendary. Boss? But what did the Hunrein sisters hear? Their father, Senji, actually said that the. LV40 legendary a young meek viable to take a hit from me and survive? This was. Legendary. Was not concerned about his reputation? The sisters even doubted if there was something. Wrong with their ears. However, recalling the terrifying combat power their father, a. Consistently displayed a Sife were striking from a lower dimension made them believe it. This man was. A.

Seriously. Don't worry. Use the stand here and watch. Sao Chen calmly instructed. Before leading the way toward the. Jones. His footsteps made a soft rustling sound on the ground. Breaking the silence of the hollow valley. The. Jones seemed to sense something unusual and instantly opened its. Six eyes. Looking at. Am I. H. You seen a thing? Is that a. O. Man? The. Jones focused its. Gas and immediately let out an excited howl. It quickly stood up. Gridentally staring at Sao Chen. O. Lowly human adventurer. Are you here to challenge the great Cerberus? Wonderful. You haven't eaten a woman in a thousand years. You missed the exquisite taste of the human body. Now. Come men. Be my meal. As the. Jones spoke. It drolleth. It was nothing like the Dalvasis. Sao Chen at fast before it. Its lines were incredibly laively. As if it had its own. Independent soaps. The. Jones. It self-existed intelligence.

In front of his nearly 300,000 HP, it was utterly insignificant. Sao Chen. Nodded insatisfaction. Not bad. The Ejong Mount would appear in this dungeon under his N.S.T.S.T.E.L.T.L.E.D. The Ejong attack was to test the future Mount's attributes. The results of the test now left him very satisfied. Truly legendary level, we see output. Game. T.M.A.S.A.P. Now you can test my attack. Sao Chen was not going to waste any more T.M.A.N. wanted to kill the Ejong for rewards. However, at that moment the Ejong suddenly weakened, kneeling on the ground. Y.S.T.E.L.E.D. Dad, please perme. Dad, please give me. A break. As T.S.E.W.E.R.S.T.E.L.E.S.A.P. Sao Chen's lips tweet, staring in shock at the Ejong. Damn. This. Game player calls me that. And now this boss wants to acknowledge. May his father T.O.E.L.E.D. A.L.E.D. Legendary boss in the original. Is this cunning? This is T.O.E.L.E.D. Sao Chen said. Unhappily. Surrender? What do I get out of it? A was confident. A call take this moods lie. Within three moves. So I didn't mind hearing what the other side at T.O.E.L.E.D. Who knows? Their mic be unexpected. Surprise. Benefits? De Ejong. Suddenly Riella is pulling out a pile of shiny items from who knows where that is this what you may have never seen say was grably injured and fell into a comma a thousand years ago when he woke up again. This thing suddenly appeared on me de Ejong. Heritly explained fearing that if it spoke to a slowly this terrifying woman in front of it would kill it in an instant that tried it was afraid of being killed as a member of the egg ranking demons de Ejong. Adani could not lower than that of an adult man when its strongest attack was easily taken by Sao Chen. It understood the vast difference between itself and Sao Chen. As if the gap was like a Benander's. If it were to grow to level 100 or even above level 150, the situation would definitely be different. But right now, there were no ifs. After the Ejong was grably injured. And fell into a comma a thousand years ago. It had finally began canches and it didn't want to experience that dark, hopeless feeling again. What was face work? To survive, it was willing to do anything. There is a sign among humans. What was it again? To say who know the times are heroes. At this moment, the Ejong felt like a hero. It shamelessly said that are you satisfied with the settings. Sao Chun. This dog was so shameless, adaptable and flexible. Truly a model in the dog world. Sao Chun took a the breast and accepted the peel off. Items pushed over by Ejong. Dark god equipment. Item. Butchers helmet item. Butchers. Armor item. Butchers pants item. Butchers gloves item.

As for the Demon Monbloodring. Blueprint. This was a great item. A level 36 dark gold ring. With excellent attributes. As long as the materials were replenished in time. It represented a continued supply of dark gold. Equipment. This element significance for South chains future guild development. Just. Imagine. After South chain established the guild. Tosing a hundred or so the Monmon blood rings into the guild. Warehouse. And with some wings applies. How excited the members would be. The drop rate for jewelry was. Already low. And this was dark gold. As for the materials. They were relatively common in the. Market. Easily purchaseable with a bit of gold. The only issue was that an adept of a in a master. Level blacksmith in advance. Which would take some effort. However. There was no rush for now. After. Admiring all the items presented by the A. John. South chain looked apatite again. Threateningly speaking. Do you have. Any more of these items? Don't hide anything. Eh. I'd already noticed that this a young was. Very afraid of the ad. Although I didn't understand why. I didn't mind using this to see if a cold squeeze. Out more items. Daddy. How cold did I? Are you really having nothing left? They showed immediately. Reply sincerely. Almost swearing to the heavens. Eh. Really? As long as South chains. Words fell. And instantly unleashed a hand bomb. Boom. Minus. 490,000 as expected. Just like the D. Kianji said at the beginning. When he. Don't take it down. At this moment. The sisters veined. South chain talked to themselves. They had naturally seen the pile of items. The A. John that used handy to bear. But there was not a shred of greed in the. Eh. The most important thing for a person. Is to have self-awareness. Forcing a legendary. Boss to surrender was the D. Kianji's kill. No envy or jealousy here. The A. Jones. Suddenly suffer. From this kill strike. Looking at South chain in terror. Wanting to cry. But having not ears. Daddy. Daddy. Don't kill me. You really have nothing left. It didn't expect that this. Woman. On the other side. Was ruthless. Sign it surrendered. And still attacking. At the same time. This blow. Cause it's a alto drop. By more than 80%. Completely driving. It of the character. Is.

South chain matter. And use. As they don't saw. With a relief expression. South chain spoke again. But this is the no. I came. Here. My little tan among. If you don't die. How can I get among. The young didn't. Expect that after handing over. Alex's talk. This man on the other side. Was still not satisfied. What was this about wanting among. Was the disused. Lasting after my body. Bah. Despicable. The young declared. With a hitches. Indignation. From today on. I. Cerberus. Shall be you. Mount. Daddy. How could he possibly go back. On my work. When he promised.

And precious item materials. But they also got a legendary mount. A was very satisfied. The Huner Rain sisters were even more pleased. Speaking of which. Huner Rain's whole was not small leader. A.

The Ae John. Was his newly given name. Thank you. Daddy Yanje. No need to tan. Me. It thanks to the kiss you provided. Sao Chun felt a bit speechless. After being. Callebed daddy so many times.

They get the level of the monsters. Fortunately. Along the way. There is TV and Annie target that pose the challenge to Sao Chen. So it didn't waste Annie.

instantly restored sao chen las dan eyebrow somewhat surprise as expected of high level legendary boss attributes are used the basics the most terrifying part is its unknown skills for instance this self-real can instantly restore and lost the al as a melee demon having healing skills is a bit too much after walking up the troll sends sao chen's terrifying power and without a war and leaked its ultimate move human perish under my eyes swamp troll suddenly erupted with blow red steam and in the next moment its body transformed into a blood red lightning bolt moving up an incredible speed system prompt the swamp troll uses the skill frenzy all attributes increased by 100% lasting 1 mini system prompt the swamp troll uses the skills of the mountains the swamp troll brought its fists together and smashed them down towards sao chun the terrifying momentum distorting the sao chun quickly died moving away from the central position boom the swamp troll's fists struck down shocking the earth and within a radius of 200 meters all the trees were blown away by the soquave and the ground cracked like a spider web minus 103,451 used over a hundred thousand damage sao chen's alt suddenly dropped by a tear this was still the result of the dying of the dying of the soquave center kemper to my attack my defense is still too low sao chen shook his head helplessly with a million attack only at 260 000 defense and his alt was the machida all of this was due to the poor quality of his armor the lv 40 dark gold set was simply insufficient against the game stick level legendary basis if it burned the for having 120 000 stamina and the demon god shield that number would be even bigger right now effect like a fragile sportsman in a martial arts story we see got put bad gul nail after taking used a few punches from the enemy it's emcee need to get my hands on some legendary level armor as soon as possible there is no other choice i wanted to enjoy this but now you can use the sao chen's gas sharpen since the swamp troll had already posed a certain threat to him decided not to mess around any longer and instantly unleashed his ultimate move sword of annihilation a massive with a sword aura suddenly appeared in front of sao chen and all targets within the path of the sword aura vanished silently if you were to ask what sao chen's strongest output skill was the answer would undoubtedly be the skill that came with the epic weapon the sword of the menacing sword of annihilation with an output of 12 000 on the panel can bind with various buffs that previously acquired dash 1999999 a terrifying crimson number path in the next moment the swamp troll was almost clavet into by the sword aura its chest system notification the swamp troll triggered the skill demon god's protection forcing itself to remain at 1.4 20 seconds is that is used like this in burial skill effect from hunsran sao chen talked to himself clicking his tongue the skills of high level legendary boss are in the edin pression the damage from the sword of annihilation was not beyond sao chen's expectations with 120 times the base attack power it was 15 times that of the water monday by in dance if it hit a monster with zero defense it called the benixi 200 million no matter how strong the swamp troll's defense was it couldn't withstand such terrifying output say he originally talked that the legendary level boss in the cloud dream swank could pick a mile interesting battle a bit but he didn't expect that due to my low defense he called only once you see sawing shook his head silently saying the troll would definitely know the waiting 20 seconds and the west to all us it to make a move quietly waiting the next moment so the swamp troll supporting its almost broken upper body with both hands then it twisted its head in turn to run ah let's form a guild and come up with a guild name everyone sorry your opinions eh in the dark woods the swamp troll staggered away supporting its bubbling upper body it was filled with immense horror this human kid was so terrifying used one move had brought it to the blink of the eye the swamp troll had fought against hundreds of human experts before but never had any one of them pushed it to this extent this was simply not something it called handy if it weren't for the trump card of the mongott's protection that sword used now would have attacked in its light even though it boldened today in the short term the swamp troll called the monster and his hopes of counter-attacking all that filled its mind where swam or escape escape with all its meat the swamp troll took that with its speed it called ensure an absolute advantage after all its massive body cold cover dozens of meters with a single step and that human on the other side even if it tried his hardest probably couldn't take a chapter it but when it instinctively glanced back it was horrified to find that the woman was actually reading on a age owned literally trailing vain that relaxed feeling was as if a seasoned hunter was quietly waiting for its prato bleed to the in its panic the swamp troll's speed actually increased a bit master this troll still thinks it can escape how ridiculous Xiao's cough filled with pretty Xiao Chen's lips curled slightly his eyes full of agreement despite the swamp troll's massive see everything in the original was based on data with his agility his running speed far surpassed that of the troll plus with the additional 60% boost from his mount Xiao hey it was as fast as a flash when it put in full effort every second a cold advance at least 50 meters the swamp troll was fleeing with a little smear but in Xiao Chen's eyes it was like a joke the demon got protection last only 20 seconds calculating it out it's all be about time Xiao Chen looked the head at the hand troll with great interest and increased his speed and struck with his sword sure and august this ordinary attack hit the swamp troll's running motion post and its eyes began to gradually lose it like minus one a trivial number pata pebab its head in the next moment its massive body as large as a small mountain collapsed to his sanders crossed before a completely losing its life the swamp troll glared at Xiao Chen with hatred leaving behind the final word how cold did you hear my king will event me as soon as the words left its mouse it unwillingly closed its eyes beside it a pile of shining items appear among which a purple legendary equipment stood out like a crane among chickens din you have killed the lv 85 legendary boss one troll gaining 85 million experience din you have received the first kill reward 1.000 free attribute points 1.000 reputation points in major cities 10.000 gold legendary chest x1 suitable for your level system prompt a server wait an announcement is about to be made would you like to cancel your name the first kill reward is really good you pay can get something nice as for the announcement so Chen indifferently click no server wait an announcement player kyanji has achieved the first kill of the lv 85 legendary boss one troll and his heroic deeds are celebrated by the world server wait an announcement player server wait a server wait an announcement was repeated three times players in every corner of the original step take actions in unison is it the demon king kyanji again i feel like i'm getting upset toy i was wondering why didn't it continue to mess with the plea the guilt turns out that the kyanji went to farming level maps lv 85 legendary boss can't be in yours there is only one demon king kyanji in the game if you have the bm 10 of the kyanji's attributes equal what up laughing in my dreams on the forum players began to discuss again if someone else had achieved the first kill of the swamp troll it would have certainly turned heads but so Chen had already shocked them too much now the place where some wetnam they react as calm as adequate many people boldly declare so what it it's a lv 85 legendary boss in a few days that the kyanji will be able to take down an epic boss but there to be surprised about in so one sentence that the kyanji is also and that's all that matters in the june min soon so Chen began to sort of the loot the legendary chest from the first kill reward will yield items that match my level yes i wait for now after carefully reading the description how chimp la set the legendary chest into his backpap his level was to allow right now opening the legendary chest would be a bit wasfeel after the second hop change when his level increased it would open it to obtain even more powerful items then a look at the loot drop by the swamp troll item crimson helmet level lv 80 epic equipment requirement attributes lv 80 strengths 20,000 equipment requirement class warrior hp 50,000 strength last time n 20,000 physical slash magic defense 50,000 skill 1 steel bonus passive skill reduces damage taken by 20% skill 2 self-heal active skill instantly restore 50% ea the pan use cooldown time 24 ors skill 3 demon guts protection passive skill when receiving fatal damage can maintain a tebab one point for 20 seconds cooldown time 24 ors the attributes of the crimson helmet are excellent the attributes of the strength stamina and defense have significantly increased and with the three skills that come we see so Chen's combat abilities improved remarkably with this helmet is confident that if a phase is the swamp troll skill suck the mountains again the damage attacks will be reduced by a play as that so Chen immediately put it on the five-piece set effect of the slayer dark goal c disappear but the overall defense attributes increase considerably h perich 453 000 physical defense 291 000 magic defense 283 000 it's a pity this boss is top or apart from this epic helmet there are another valuable items so Chen picked up all the loot and examined it one by one finally muttering in disappointment after tidying up a prepared to continue exploring the june min swamp map a kept in mind the words the swamp trolls before a dying the demonic creatures in the june min swamp are under the command of a demon king kai jet duos only epic level or eager can make a legendary level boss bow down dealing with an epic boss me be a bit challenging for me now but it can hit a track so Chen talked to himself an epic level tempered boss would definitely be much stronger than a legendary one if it were about level 100 so Chen felt a good likely be unable to defeat it especially since he only had two pieces of legendary level defense equipment which is too low however the june min swamp is a level 80 to 90 map so this demon king must also be between level 80 and level 90 at this level so Chen felt a cold he beat asio if he won it would be a uge profit at least acquiring an epic level piece of equipment if he lost it bolden te mate after all he is a player dying just me and se can respawn once anyway dying to monsters want to drop any equipment today's pass one wingly during which so Chen did not encounter any legendary level boss this made him somewhat disappointed as it seemed that the number of legendary level boss was naughty over the two days encountered no less than five dark gold boss and the equipment and items dropped nearly filled his backpack moreover xiao's advancement bara also chanto mil 21 10 000 completing one tense storing equipment is enjoyable and it will be in history plan is the guild warehouse after creating a guild in the future but that is not my main goal having hunted so many demonic creatures the demon king duo is probably on his way right after clearing the surrounding demonic creatures again so Chen stopped to rest for a moment silently organizing his outs the map of june min swamp is vast field we see level is man monsters and the exploration progress is average his main goal is still to complete to that's but has been in the june min swamp for five days without any clues it was abd patience to continue exploring the map while also looking forward to the era evil of the epic level boss so Chen felt that as the ruler of this map the demon king duos probably as the task clues a once after all the mentor who qualifies in for the second transfer a yet must not be an ordinary npc perhaps they are a legendary level npc above level 80 otherwise how cold they possibly appear in the june men swan ye ye work harder tc they sun kill a few more demonic creatures so Chen stood up deciding to to continue grinding monsters as for what to do when the backpack is full a good habit to throw away the worthless equipment with his mind made up so Chen planned back into the daily grind of monster hunting system prompt you have been hit by the skill black flando man of the lv 90 epic level boss demon king duos hp decreases by 0.5 per second entering combat stay finally here so Chen glanced at the system prompt quickly eliminating the demon creature in front of him then recalls xiawei back into the mode space in the face of a level 90 epic creature xiawei's role was minimal this battle still relied on him alone after a while a small black dot appeared in the sky the flying speed of the black dot was extremely fast and by the team is out and noticed it had already reached a position 200 meters in front of him it was a humanoid creature with a pair of black winds about the height of an average adult emanating a fan black mist its skin was dark blue resembling a fallen angel from a comic with a pair of blood red eyes fixed intently on sao Chen instinctively dao Chen cast a detection spell demon king 12 epic level level LV 90e alt 1 00000000 as 1000 000 000 attack double defense skills remarks ruler of the cloud dream mass , but seems to be in and on abnormal stay as expected most of the information identified which use question max a flying boss what a hassle sao chun focus and prepare himself currently there is not possess the ability to fly so in this battle the demon king el de initiative the sky was its advantage mortal you have hunted my people tese past few days as the ruler of this land he will not forgive you a voice full of charisma suddenly echoed in sao chen's mind sao chen from air the speaker was the demon king and the antebensin its mouse move if you want to fight then fight stop talking nonsense sao chen said bluntly surprisingly a pan hearing his unfriendly words the demon king did not attack immediately tese past few days yabe been quietly observing you he admitted your carry and strengths why not become a my subject the demon king suddenly pointed its left hand at sao chen a drop of black blood emerging from its pal swallow this drop of blood and you will transform into a member of the demon race from ten on you will have a brick future is this recruitment hiao chen's expression turn it estrangea and t expected that after being courted by various player guilds and npc would also extend a hand to insistent prompt the demon king do es y su simblog line a power on you do you wish to transform into the demon race transforming into the demon race will reduce strengths by 10 increase intelligence by 20 and raise human race talents in the original he has raised his unique talents the demon race's racial talent links towards magic while the human race has advantages in leveling a sao chen blank that the system prompt indifferently and decisively chose to refuse not to mention that tal his skills were based on physical attacks he absolutely would not accept the demon race's ugly appearance you be mad and a ways choice the demon king said deeply upon learning of sao chen's decision i'm curious are you no afraid of the atatal you talk too much just get on we see sao chen last the tip of his sword impatiently signaling the other party to hurry upon fight however the demon king suddenly shook its head again your strength is decent but it's still not an og in front of me he admitted your carry so he decided to forgive your actions live now sao chen are you out of your mind sao chen looked at it with a strange expression and suddenly a flash of inspiration crossed his mind perhaps you reign so making of trouble right now lacking the confidence to fight me a suddenly realized that when the detection spell talk effect the demon king's remark section indicated it was in an unknown abnormal state called this abnormal state be affecting its combat ability so it was delayed again and again even boldly clamming to live without a hint of epic temper the more how chen talked about it the more i felt it was possible and that down a was certain there was a problem just as his words fell the demon king's expression darkened truly unforgivable the speakable human decoy later part of this sentence passed the hero chen as it seemed not directed at him coded very latitudes a un inexplicable abnormal state sure and now got that moment a look of struggle appeared on the demon king's face he channeled his breath and focused his gas a human fast spantum gradually emerged from the demon king's head and at this moment the demon king's struggle even more fears even cursing loudly we had already agreed that the first of every month is your team at home free why have you broken the agreement it's done to feel good to forcefully content with me do it see the speakable human you are untrustworthy the demon king 12 will not let you off after forcefully starting tc two sentences the struggling expression of the demon king 12 instantly vanished in the next moment a pair of human eyes appear clear and distinct eagerly sign something that sepreyest sia ocheni senior i am a member of the human royal family elite in it your help second term mentor elite althogiam elite a member of the human royal family i am not well known do you recognize me elite noticed the change in sao chen's expression and hesitantly aske yes sao chen quickly explained i am a destroyer class and ikame to the human mars this team eto find you mentor to help me break through the second term limit destroyer elite widened his eyes in surprise carefully observing sao chen a barely noticeable with a lie flashed and in the house sao chen felt that all his attributes were not better under the gas of this npc it really is elite became as yo if elas

little bit if it weren't for the understanding that this gas can tend really an admiration ea good have been unable to hold back from cursing senior elite may ask what your current situation is sao chen suppressed his discomfort and ask ee elite now appeared with only a face and his state clearly indicated was in trouble sao chen didn't care about the life or the act of an npc used sadly reminding him to hurry and help him change classes sae elite side then briefly explained a thousand years ago when he fought against the monk king 12 ee was defeated and killed by ee fortunately my soul did not perish after the a and the a baby trapped in this body sharing it with 12 for the past thousand years we have been fighting for control of the body almost every day but since the body

outside the world through his eyes so when ee so you ee was willing to pay a uge price to break the agreement and secure 10 minutes of time yabe an important task to entrust to you elite's brief words made sao chun realize ee was not in control with only 10 minutes of time to manage on his own the so call it uge price must be for something extremely important which forced him to act this way in the game such behavior from an npc is usually understood by players as a quest as a peer sao chen cam down and decisively listen to elite's continued narration as for the second transfer task 10 minutes

Adab quite a few pieces of equipment and skillbooks for various professions, but it always kept them in his personal warehouse, not yet deciding how to deal with them. Although, it bolden te take much effort for him to get some equality equipment and skillbooks, it bolden te just give them away for free. As for strangers, there was no way a good give them away for free. And for all, friends, like Feng King Wu, giving her equipment would be an insult. After all, Feng King Wu was not a freeload. And bolden te accept things for nothing. Even brothers would settle accounts clearly. When a gap here. A top notch golden stuff during a dungeon run, a child here. Now, this epic equipment was of immeasurable value, something Feng King Wu calleden te for the benefits she sold everything she had. But just keeping it like this is the solution. When you have some free time, you need to think carefully about how to handle it. So Chen Matter, pushing this matter to the back of his mind. Next, a look at the two pieces of legendary equipment. Item, the monkeys' armor level, LV85. Legendary. Equipment requirement attributes, LV85, 30,000 strengths. Equipment requirement profession, warrior.

Is something remarkable, although it can be worn by all classes. Its attributes lead and towards. Magic professions. The third skill is quite a good, but unfortunately, sao Chen peseis the ring of chaos. And as no slato equi. It's, therefore, this legendary ring can only be stored for future. Plans. Next, there is another skill book of special quality. Item, fury, skill book. Quality. Special learning prerequisite, all classes, 10,000 agility LV1 effect after releasing. The skill, gana 30% movement speed boost for 40 seconds. Call down time 60 seconds. This skill is a universal skill with decent effects, allowing sao Chen to approach land attack bases more. Quickly.

To 70%, which is an excellent boost. Aside from the equipment and skill books and. The dart the monkeys head from the main quest. There is tare materials who uses are temporarily unaw. Sao Chen blanked at them without much concern. Stored everything in his backpack. Completely feeling it up. 10. A walk towards the demon king's life. Next, let's find Leelinger. In see the delay. Of the demon king do is. Leelinger's consciousness suddenly awoken from a house. She then realized. That she was crafting war equipment specifically for the demon race. The 11 human beings. Around her also began consciousness at the same time. What happened to me? Ah? Why am I? Here? Where is this? The last scene in my memory is being heavily injured by the demon king. Oh no, this is the demon king's life. All 12 people, including Leelinger, remembered everything. The last scene in their memories was all of them being defeated by the demon king and falling into a heavy injury induced coma. And then, the next scene is. What they see now? To see we squid. Main sabe already guess what happened. We must have been controlled by the demon king do is. Continuously helping him craft supplies. Exactly, it think so too. Although we don't know what happened to. Make us a wake up. Bah. Everyone, let's find a way to escape. An old man with a scruffy face. Suggested. That's true, but how do we escape? Someone questioned. We're not in a good state right now. The group looked around, noticing tweak-level demons guarding not far away. Fortunately, they were speaking. In low voices. So the two demons and ten out is tanitin and usual yet. But the two demons. Were guarding the only exit in this hole. As soon as they tried to leave, they would inevitably be intercepted. The group, having worked in manufacturing for years, at their bodies, severely stranded. Combat power was very weak. Just as they were contemplating how to plant their escape, the situation. Suddenly Chang. A few terrified demons rushed in without a greeting, charging straptors. Them. It's terrifying. My king has been killed. There are humans here. Great capture them. Unsretened that terrifying. Human power house. Outside the incoming demons were very strong. Far beyond what this 12 NPC is a cold match. But from the few sword roars the group seemed to understand what had happened. And without further talk, they fought back desperately. The demon king. As been killed a human power house is a man here to save us everyone all done. Don't give up everyone in care. They are shotter straggling under the assault of several demons. The gap in strength was simply to agree. Moreover, these demons had become in red and vega. The fight was dead in 10. In just a few blinks, a weak NPC was done apart. So after, other NPCs were also killed intermittently. Before alone, only lay linger and the. Lay an old man, the man don't feel. Little girl, even lived long and all. The old man said to lay. Linger without looking back. As if had made a decision. I had a beast of you run. Lay linger gritty. Her teeth. Don't say that, old senior. I could never abandon my king to save myself. Little. Girl, you. The old man was about to say something more when suddenly, the door was kicked open. A light figure slowly appeared in front of everyone. It was a chain. It seemed a kill. Or king. The speakable human, how dare you? Don't come. Any closer. Or we all take out. Tese to humans. The demons present shouted angrily while trembling with threats. Their unbalance. Mindset had diminished their combat effectiveness, which improved the situation for Linger and the old man significantly. Sochen talking the scene before him, this damsel of arguing with the demons. A quickly stepped forward, delivering a few ordinary sword streaks that killed all the demons present. Are you Linger? Sochen looked at the young girl beside him. Without waiting for her response. A. Continued. Your grandfather sent me to rescue you. Come with me. Linger opened her mouth. Wanting to say many things, but in the end, she only managed to utter one more. Okay. Seeing this. The old man's gas flickered slightly, and silently followed alone. Next, under the witness of the two. NPC natives. Sochen encountered gods and. Killed gods, met demons and slidged demons. Facing almost no significant resistance. His overwhelming strength caused an unusual sparkle to appear. In Linger's eyes. The process of finding Linger went quickly. After the demon king was. Killed. There were no demons left in its lair that called pose atreat to Sochen. During this time, he did. Encounter to legendary level bases, but he didn't waste my time. With a round of skills, he killed them instantly. It was a bit unfortunate that the two new legendary equipment pieces that dropped were not useful to him. However, throughout his sweeping journey, Sochen killed about 3,000 demons, bringing little. Black's advancement bar to fortens full. There are too many small monsters here. It feels great to. Far. Sochen decided to continue farming here for another two days. Planning to live once. Little black advanced. After staying in the demon territory for a long time, he felt a bit bored. Moreover, the respawn cycle for small monsters in the June-Mend Mars map was quite long, only once. Every 24 hours and the boss level respawn time was even longer. Sochen didn't want to. What idly. Completing the main quest and the second transfer quest was the more important task at hand. In the next two days, Sochen as per his original plan. Farmed the demon kingslaire twice. More. The young little black's advancement bar successfully reach 100%. Leveling apto. LV40 and got stuck at the second advancement. After advancing, Xiao Ace Tributes. Experience Explosive Grout.

It literally lies ahead and watch. It's. About time. We sold head back. Sao Chen looked at an EPC Lilinger and the Leon Old Man Weibuji. For the past. Two days. I have been with the two of them and a two set de scouting technique. Lilinger was a bitiger. In level Danima TLV60 and her class was the archer branch range. A code Nt. Cigere tributes. Or skills. But surprisingly. Lilinger secondary profession was a master level blacksmith. As for the Leon Old Man Weibuji. A was at an eveniger level. Sao. Chen called only scout that the west. LV80. We is nothing else alone. This old man had the strength to return to the main city alone. But Sao. Chen was curious as to why. A silently followed him. However. Since the old man didn't speak. He had no way to ask. Are we fine. Lilinger exclam. Nearly. Jumping. She looked about 16 or 17 years old. And after a couple of days of rest. Her complexion was gradually becoming rosy. He was my grandpa so. Much. And to see little friends. In the imperial city. He can't what to see them. By the way. Brother Yang Ye. Can he come to find you to play. Every day after we. Return to Chiyue City. Lilinger looked at Sao Chun with anticipation. People always seek support when they are vulnerable. The scene of Sao Chen appearing like a deity. When she feels three gun consciousness was deeply aching her mind. And she would probably never forget it. Lilinger felt that she must rip a her benefactor. Of course. Once they create the village in a couple of days. He might even have something to ask you for help with. Sao Chen smiled slightly. A master level. Blacksmith was hard to come by. Estillada dark gold equipment blueprinting his backpack. And rather than. Waiting for players to find a master level Blacksmith. It was better to set his sights on the NPC. As long as brother Yang Ye. As. E. Lilinger will definitely agree unconditionally. Lilinger. Said earnestly. Ten. Ye ye thank you in advance. Sao Chen replied then turn it to the. Silent Weibuji. Old man. What are your plans? Are you coming with us at Ochile City? Of course. Weibuji's file and agree. Not revealing what the Westin can. Fake mean mystery. I want to see what exactly you plan to do. Sao Chen talked to himself. After leveling up. See away. Had grown significantly larger. About the size of a small house. The three of them could sit on it. With plenty. Of room to move around. Sao Chen didn't mind other reading his mount as it was the fastest way to travel. Battle on the way. Si away ye cacknelly let out this grant the less nurse. Siming to have some. Objections to any one other than its master reading it. However. Sao Chen didn't end all. Two days. Later. The group successfully arrived at Gobi City. To avoid travel.

Limusi's identity was used that of an ordinary elder whose granddaughter had been away for. Many years. And his expression couldn't help but swell with emotion. Once the emotions of the. Grandfather and granddaughter gradually come down. Limusi turned to Sao Chen and pulled out a token from. Somewhere. Lord Yanja. Thank you for saving. My granddaughter. This is the promised reward. It's only right. Sao Chen pelately accepted the token. Used before examining the token. A prompt. Suddenly sounded in his ear. System prompt. Finally linger task completed. Calculating. Rewards. Task completion rating. Perfect task rewards. Village establishment order. X1. Dark gold chest. X1. Legendary chest X1. Perfect task bonus reward. Legendary chest X1. There are actually two legendary chests. Sao Chen was taken away. This was an. Unexpected surprise. So far. He had said upon dark gold chest. Three legendary chests. And one epic chest. Sao Chen had already made plans. Currently. His level was still a bit low. And after the second class change. Usina of the stored experience. His level would no longer. Rise like a rocket.

Create a guild called be put into action. Lord city lord. If there is nothing else. Ye ye take my. Leave. Sao Chen said to limousie. At that moment. Wei Wu he. Who advanced island. Suddenly.

Want to have been in ban. Way buji's words were quite straightforward. Ea. Lo lost the combat power of his peak days. And in order to avoid being made by old friends in the future. Nd. To find the success in advance. Sao Chun. Naturally agreed. Ea was already planning to go to. The imperial city to complete the main quest. So why not take on a task along the way. Sure no. At the.

Legendary chests. 4 epic chests. And 1 music chest alone with the title. Of course. Generally. Speaking. They gave the rewards. The greater the difficulty of the quest. How can felt a golden debito. Optimistic. His current equipment and attributes would likely make it difficult to clear the levels. So in a death to work. Hard to improve. At the very last. Es all complete his second class transition. To gand de tribu. Grought and new skills that come with. Tenec old also work on his equipment. Use to be se. So. Chen decisively clicked except quest. Old man. Ye grito this. Good. Good. Good. I am very satisfied. Way. Woojia stroked his bear. His eyes is kinting with a smile. Challenging the dark temple. I wear the recommendation. Not use teniguan was qualified to take on the challenge. What way Woojia didn't mention was that each guardian of the Empire only had three opportunities in the lifetime. And one of those recommendations was given to Xiao Chen. The monsters in the dark temple were. Kita powerful. But after observing for the past few days. Way Woojia was certain that was the combat power. This kid at this plat. Clearing 200 levels would be no problem. And even at the strengths to push for. 250 levels. Given some etime to a chuny let's strengths. Clearing level 300 gold also be. Within rich. Are you the guardian? Of the Empire. M.R. Way. Woojia. On the other side. Observing all of this. The Lord of Chiyue City. Limusi. So with an expression of embarrassment. A hundred years ago. When he first started out. Yet my ear you greatly and took you as my goal. Ah. To see are all past events. The Lord of Chiyue City is the one who is young and promising. Way. Woojia. This plat a proud expression. Detube gan to flat a chote. So Chenroult his eyes. Gritty. Them. And ten left. Now. There were many things. So Chencoldo. The mine quest was completed. So. Echol got to the mine city. To collect his rewards. And then take on the second phase of the mine quest. Echol. Also take the opportunity. To challenge the dark temple. In the imperial city. After all. It was a once a. Weak chance. Emit as well. Test the waters. And see how far Echol get. The second transfer. Task as be. Completed half. What? E only needs. To find 6 legendary. Basis. A bab level 40. To successfully. Transition to a junior war go. After the second transfer. The increasing combat abilities. Expect to be quite considerable. But for now. So Chen decided to set this matters. Is I. At the moment. Nd to implement his original plan. Establishing a guild. The. Location for creating the guild is very important. Where so they choose. So Chen's mind rush. A guild is the. Used about finding a random place. And determining the headquarters hall. That would be too. Hasty. Especially since. A deviled construction order. Based on the main storylines. Predictions. The future direction of the game. Will be a battle between. The human race. And the demon race. So how. About climbing sommel. And see the gobi city. Gobi city. Is one of the main cities. Closest to the demon. Brass's territory. After future battles. The human NPC forces. Will undoubtedly mobilize. Troops to the outskirts. Of gobi city. Countless players. Will also receive a faction war quest. During the. War. Making gobi city. Undoubtedly one of the most important. Main cities. With an explosive flow of. People. Clamming land earth. To serve as the guild headquarters. Along with setting up. An auction house. Can sumer. Schaps. And other basic infrastructure. As long as the quality is good. No. Gold can be done. Like a tidal wave. As for how to ensure quality. Whatever is lacking. So Chen can use gohan. For it. After all. Legendary basis of the same level. See mas easy to defeat. As chapping vegetables. Mh it's this idea. So Chen made up his mind. And the set of teleportation. Array to gobi city. Tenefone the NPC. In the main city. Dispensable for player guilds. And successfully created a guild. The. Call the came the 10.000 people. It's worth mentioning that. While others need to pay a thousand gold. Created a guild. So Chun. Due to his secret reputation. Only for the price. Amere 500 gold in. Feast. Does his guild of 10.000. Ruling the world was established. Jeje. I'll talk this guild name. Is a big cliche. As long as it's a big guild. Which one is the cliche? As long as it's. Is it to remember. That's a no. So Chun. To. Nonchalantly. Next. Nd. To clam land. Otside the city. And determine the location. Of the guild headquarters. Of course. After this. Two things were. Settled. E also. Nd. To consider. How to recruit members. After all. We's only 10.000. Sluts. Not use. Anyone. Coat join. They must. Atleas. Pc. Outstanding. Combatability. Or. Impressive. Secondary. Profession. Levels. Otside gobi city. In a leveling. Spot. We's level. 33 monsters. Over a hundred members of the profit first guild. Led by it. The president. Supahun. Were attacking a newly spawned level. 35 silver boss. The process was quite. Tense. The main tank is down. Off tank. Getting there. Quickly. DPS classes. Stop. Let the off tank establish chakra first. Where is the gile? Everyone. Pay attention. Don't let the off tank go down toe. Brothers. He made you real. Sapahun shouted passionately. The. Guild channel. As the guild leader. E at some elevery. After being killed by Isao Chen. That day. He was willing to spend a hundred gold. To find a priest in the main city. To remove his weekend state. But after. Being. Killed. He dropped a top quality silver. Lonsword and cold. Teff. Aindari plasma. He had. Opus for this attack on the silver boss. I'll talk the process of taking down the silver boss. West tense and toe. Some time. They managed to succeed. President. We got a top quality silver. Staff and some. Young brands gear. But no Lonsword. The report from a guild member. Darkensapahun's expression. He was secretly furious. The drop rate for silver basis. Is still too low. It's all that damn chan is fault for playing hero. To save the beauty. Cousing metal. Ose de top quality silver. Lonsword. It's used to infuriating. Huns rain and huns flowers. To setu annoying sisters. To my silver sword and aventer return edi. Since that day. The Hunrein sisters have not left Gobi. City and Siapu Juanis elefonte route of movement. However. A truly dared not take. Action. The reason was simple. A favorite aliashen from the demon king Yanji. Used look. At the probably overlooking al guild. After a death with them. They were instantly weakened. Dropping from the top 10. Guilds. A wicked past and the situation sowed no sins of improvement. A lesson from. The past serves as a guide for the future. If the probably overlooking al guild met such a fact. Siapu Juan felt that his small guild would surely disband quickly. If the younger the demon king Yanji and Beckham. His target for Reben. Thinking of this. Siapu Juan felt an overwhelming jealousy. Why was this. Do Yanji so terrifyingly powerful. One person was an opto withstand a thousand. Troops. Just as a way secretly cursing. A figure suddenly brought not far away. Siapu Juan rubbed his eyes. Revealing a look of terror. The surrounding guild members also were anxious. Expressions. Because this figure was someone every player in the game recognized. Demon. King Yanji. We didn't do anything this time. As the guild leader. Siapu Juan still himself to. Can front him. However. His words carry. A hint of pleading. The implication was that they. Had to done anything wrong. And they couldn't just chop them down at will. Had to same time. A cunningly activity. The recording system has evidenced. If Yanji came up to attack them without a word. Alto. They couldn't resist. They would still try to smear his image on the forums. Hmm. He wanted him to know that we are an auto. Bit reflected we see there. Siapu Juan talked. Feeling frustrated. The opponent was overwhelmingly. Strong. Which only fueled his rebellious spirit. But unexpectedly. Sao Chen merely glanced at. Him indifferently. As if he were. That disdainful look mad. Siapu Juan's face flash. In a. Moment of heated impulse. He was about to say something harsh. But the next second. So the other party pull out. A small token like object from his backpack. And crush it with force. Suddenly. A system announcement. Echoes throughout the server. Server announcement. Player Chani has created the first player villa. In the whales of Gobi City. Reward reputation. Mil points. Free attributes. Mil. Points. World legend degree. Un point. Server announcement. Player Chani has created the first. Player village in the whales of Gobi City. Reward reputation. Mil points. Free attributes. Mil points. World legend degree. Un point.

The server announcements are divided into 10 parts. And the demon. King Sinju monopolies is the mall. Others can only watch. What? The demon King Sinju. Created a village. Do is that man my chance to cling to him as come? Great. It's in the whales of Gobi City. The monk King Sinju. I'm coming. All alone. Many players in the server. Long to cling to Saochen. Especially to see from the human faction. They used struggle to find the. Right way to worship him. Keeping this desire battle up in Sida. Silently. Fermenting. Now it. Sind an opportunity of finally appear. How cold they all back. In an instant. Gobi City became a. Paradise in the earth of players and countless people began teleporting there. Establishing a. Villade was not just a simple matter of marking out the land. The moment Saochen crashed the token. The. Surrounding environment chained dramatically. Buildings and walls rose from the ground as it. Conjured from sin air. The villa chef's house. Auction house. Consumable street. Hope Chained hall. Players toll area. Mercenary hall. Clergy branch. Dungeon entrance. Toge small. It was fully. Equipped. Countless buildings slowly appeared. The uneven grounds of sand and hills on the. Ground transformed in the blink of an eye into a wide avenue. This scene was also witnessed by the plaza. So. The profit first kill. So we see bedentoneverion's face. We can. Sapa huns pupils constricted as a west about to say something. The next moment they were forcibly. Teleported out of the village. System. Notification. You have been expelled from Chania. Villade by pleasure Chania. System notification. The conditions to enter yanje village a bebeen. Set by the village here. Pleasure yanje.

After establishing the village. A west. Directly expelled from the place. Recognizing the situation. Sapa hun took a de brez. Decided. To endure. And let his guild members away. Let's go. However. Just as spoke. The. Chat interface in the human region suddenly saw its first show. Human channel. Siange. Iabe. Created the whole in Tiantan guild. The. The. The. The. In the. Human region channel. The. The. The. The. first announcement instantly ignited the human. Plus, PSR is a WeChat public account for I930126, a new book from the little. Fairy, unregular activities, get voting, will all be conducted on this account. If the followers increase by 500, an extra chapter will be added. Remove I and use that we need 80. More people for an extra chapter, after this account. Reaches 500 followers, a new book will also be serialized. Oh, everyone at sea. Thank you, thank you. Brothers are really strong. The number of comments. As already broken 1888, this Friday will change to a female outfit avatar for a day. Thanks to all the brothers and sisters for their support. The guild has limited. Number of members, recruiting requires careful selection. Watch on first send guild invitations to a few people at previously promised. Young and Daini, Tegu, and Ako. All talk they had only. Met once, Saochen learned that they had good time skills and had already leveled up to LV30, entering the main city. Therefore, Saochen chose to fulfill his promise and brought the tree in. Additionally, his nominal disciple, the Little Fairy, had been mingling with the Fongming Guild's exploration team. Recently, and brought her in as well. The sisters Lujus Rain and Lujus Flower also didn't miss. Out and were brought into the guild at the first opportunity. With this, the guild members now included. Seven people, including him. Saochen set the following conditions on the guild application interface. 1. Any secondary profession proficiency. Must reach advanced, alchemist, blacksmith, gatherer, plant, etc. 2. Player level must exceed LV35 and PCs at least 20 and tag. Buford goal the level output skill. 3. Hidden profession. Saochen wanted to do it right. To do it best. He called also create other sub-guilds like other large guilds to continue recruiting members. However, 2. Many people will come picket management, so Saochen abandoned that option. He decided to take the litter. 3. Three conditions where an opt to filter out to Sehu. Simply wanted to cling to a strong leg. To Sehu met the conditions called apply directly without needing his approval. Sabing him a lot of trouble. Not only that, in order to make the guild more attractive to talented players, Saochen also decided to spend some time randomly taking people into dungeons. He posted this on the game forum. On the other side, Wen Xiaopei Hun heard Saochen shouting the human channel, he immediately opened the guild over the interface. Searched for Hun Lin Tian Xi'an. Check the membership requirements. After reading the three simple and blunt recruitment conditions, Zapa Hun's expression changed instantly. There weren't many players at level 35 at this stage. To Sehuizard van set proficiency in secondary professions where even there. Hidden professions were even more illusive. However, among their guilds players, there happened to be one hidden profession along with a senior plant. The next movement as this belief fills Zapa Hun's eyes. The guild system sent those notifications. Guild notification. Player ill of planting has left the guild. Guild notification. Player crazy priest has left the guild. You, dare to bitrame. Zapa Hun roar through gritty cities. Tch. People strive. Folger ground. Water. Flows to lower ground. Zapa Hun, are you an idiot? Why would you stay here when you can join daddy? Can? Yes, guild? That's right. I belong at it. This trash guild that likes to bully ordinary players. And now I'm finally out. I love. Planting and crazy priest said this damnfully. I want to let. You of the oak. Zapa Hun's face turned red with anger and after dropping a harsh remark. Left with the remaining members there was no wait. Tch. To where the cunning day had just left the. Interest first guild and instantly joined the hun in tiancia guild even with a hundred of. Zapa Hun's carry the golden ted are to gonna pont tch. To right now more overlooking at the other. Gid members around very few were angry instead most saw with ambiguous expressions. It was basically impossible to get them to take action however, getting them to be. Relationships with tch. To would likely have a few objections. Das, defrastratitziapahun. Heritli left with the remaining members. Meanwhile, the plant master and crazy priest in Turkey. G-town. A villa named after Sao Chen C-de. With great satisfaction. On the player forum. There was a wide-ranging discussion about Sao Chen creating a villa and the gil. Countless players che. Tears of regret after witnessing the three extremely angry requirements. Tc. Three conditions. Are you still difficult? Daddy can g-please relax the requirements. G-a. G-a. How many people. Can reach level 35 now? Yes. Demid that in Fungu City. There are less than a thousand players. The advanced proficiency in secondary professions is also insane. You have to know that secondary professions. Are a built a power team. Since the game launched. You haven't seen any hidden professions. It's tough. Harsh. You beg that you can't relax the conditions. Or let this loser join the guild. G-g. You don't love fighting. You focus on forging. And I'm only at level 20. Still in the Nubia village. But you want to. Join the great demon king Yanis guild. The vast majority of people requested Sao Chen to. Relax the conditions. There were also a various number of people who met the requirements and after joining. Sao Chen's guild. They expressed their smug opinions. At this moment. A post was pushed to. The front page by forum players. The ad ways of the charts. Used as players were curious about. What happened. Sao Pai. Players had already noticed something unusual. The poster of this read. At the ID Kianji. It is well known that the ID is on the original game forum are the same as to saying. The game. Therefore. This post was. Personally edited by the great demon king Xinji. Realizing this. Excited players quickly opened the top view. Hunlin Tiansya is recruiting. Xinji. Posteria be created the Hunlin Tiansya gear. Welcoming all talented players of the. Human race to join and have fun together. Xinji. Hosti promise that as long as you have time. It will. Select members from the guild in the order they join the very day to. Take them to the LV 30 bis level spider. Kabe Dungeon or the LV 40 minotaur king Dungeon. All the equipment that drops will be up for grabs. For the team members to roll. The bis level Dungeon is too easy for. Sao Chen. He can take them. Down with just a flick of his hand. Even the LV 40 minotaur king Dungeon sold be about the same. Therefore. He decided that whenever he has free time. He would use it at the Dungeon. Runs every day and take guild. Members alone. It's just a little pair. Of course. If it's busy. He won't take anyone. For example. Like before in the June and March. He had to return to the main city for over a week. So how could he take anyone? In a few days. He be heading to the Imperial City. And it's likely he won't. A bit. Timote neither. Sao Chen created the guild to help those who play solo. But the bold and the. The light is. On development. He simply started to have a storm on the game for him. Wow. Siangye the great demon king is going to lead a Dungeon run. Wow. I'm so in view of the players who join. Hunlin. Tiantan. A why? Why haven't they met the joining requirements yet? I'm. So unwilling. Siangye daddy. Do you need a well-behaved and cute daughter? The king that warns you. Be. Just let me join the guild and the A.J. be your cutest daughter. Boa siangye daddy. Take me with you. E.E. I be joined Hunlin Tiantan. And I'm the vigésimos está in the joining order. I'm so happy. I'm about to be spoiled by eachin you daddy. At the bottom of the post. Countless players. Left there please. Along with a few showing off. For the vast majority of ordinary players. Get in torron. Dungeon's with Sao Chen is like reaching for the stars. Many ig-level players in the game also. Be. Come interested. Sao Chen's premise has immense appeal. Following the exposure of the guild warehouse. By Hunlin Tiantan members. Hunlin Tiantan instantly be came de hotest. Guild in the game. After posting on the forum. Sao Chen opened the guild interface and sold at the guild had only dos. 967 members. Since it's creation. It had been less than an hour. And this. Number was already getting precious. But Sao Chen was not satisfied. I'll talk the three. Joining conditions is that are relatively. There are about 400 million human players. We such a. Large base. At least 10000 sold made the requirements. Why are there only 3.000? People so far? Sao Chen pandered quietly and after a moment. A look of realization crossed his. Face. Whether they are LV35 combat players or ex-skilled secondary profession. Players. They are all cavited by major guilds. And hidden professions are the backbone talents of most. Guilds. These players are inter-original guilds. Which have decent conditions. So. They are reluctant. To switch easily. Even casual players often have a tear on small teams for exploring. Feeling quite. Comfortable and not wanting to change to a new environment. And get to set to new teammates. However. Hou Qin. Felt that there is no corner of the world that can't be prayed open. Only that the chips are in TNO. It's team atoput. The stocky bee cungelated over the days into the guild warehouse. Sao Chen made up his mind. And prepared to take action. Since the coming out of the final demon god's temple. It had subdub 63. Pieces of golden equipment. 24 pieces of dark gold equipment. 10 legendary items. 1 Aide. Epic robe. And at last 6 skill books of golden quality. At this stage. When most players go. Fight to San Nal for a top-knit silver equipment. Sao Chen's tagpile is a deadly attraction for everyone. Especially the epic. Robe. A mage who possesses it can truly be kallied a mage king. However. Before placing them in the guild warehouse. Sao Chen talked for a moment and set the exchange conditions. Now in. The original. The major. Guilds have a their members exchange contribution points for equipment and items of. Different qualities. And the worst. To earn contribution points can generally be divided into four messages. First. Directly rewarded. By the guild leader. Second. Members they are apt to clear dungeons. Together. Third. Bying with gold coins or exchanging equipment and items. Fourth. Guild. Activities. Members work hard to earn contribution points to. Exchange for equipment. And their efforts in clearing dungeons also allow the guild to gradually accumulate experience and level up. The two aspects complement each other. Sao Chen prohibitly message. Soan gao's way. Queen form. In that a the legend ordinary member called earn about 100 contribution points a day. Sao Chen. Pander. Let's calculate it a 100 points a day. Then four golden equipment. Base on the. Equipment level. Position. And attributes. Let's temporarily set the require contribution points. To be between 1500 and 300. Four dark gold equipment. 30 hundred to 60 hundred. Legendary equipment. 8000 to 10 thousand. And four epic equipment. Tentatively setta. 100 thousand. Moreover. Only to se hume the equipment wearing requirements can exchange for it to. Prevent be installed by undercover members from other guilds. As for the price of skill books. It. Sold be the same. This is considered a very cheap price. Generally. If members work hard. They can. Save an oak for a piece of golden equipment in alpha month. And a little over a month can get them a dark gold piece. And after three months of hard work. They can exchange for a legendary item. As for epic equipment. It's a lure is greater than its practicality. And Sao Chen set the threshold. Berry. 100.000. Contribution points is equivalent to three and a half years of effort for a navegator. Play. Edwente ting. Anyone can't earn it early. After setting the exchange prices. Sao Chen stored at the inventory in. The warehouse. Guild history record. Guild leader Qiang's store del V35. Golden equipment. The mon mon staff in the warehouse. Guild history record. Guild leader Qiang's store del V36. Dark gold equipment. A beast armor upper garment in the warehouse. Guild history record. Guild leader Qiang's store del V85. Legendary equipment. Dark flame ring in the warehouse. Guild history record. Guild leader Qiang's store del V180. Legendary equipment. E.T. Staff in the warehouse. Guild history record. Guild leader Qiang's store del V85. Epic equipment. The mon king robe in the warehouse. A series of records than the new players who are used to in the guild. Looking at the visible increasing contents of the guild warehouse. Everyone felt a overwhelming show. Wow. 63 pieces of golden equipment. 24 pieces of dark gold. Equipment. 10 legendary items. And 1 epic robe plus 6 equality skill books. The. Guild leader is Mike T. Guild leader Qiang. Oh sir. Damn. We so many amazing pieces of. Equipment. Working under guild leader Qiang is so satisfying. So. Apart from to see. Items on the leaderboard. Guild leader Qiang actually has so much esto. Wow. Look at this LV. 85 epic robe. It's incredible. But it's an epic robe compared to that second to last. In 3D LV 180. There's tough. That's what you call explosive attributes. The excited. Newbies look from top to bottom when a day ever since such a magnificent warehouse. The only downside is that it's too expensive. The lowest level golden equipment requires at least 1500. Contribution points. Most of the guild members had jumped from other guilds and were well aware of how precious. Contribution points are 1500 points gold take at least half a month of hard grinding if algo is smoothly. But no one was foolish enough token plan because in other guilds even if they had no contribution points. There were no golden equipment available. For exchange. Moreover, considering that golden. Gears used a basket. Once they witnessed the terrifying attributes of dark gold, legendary, and the B. Epic Gear. Everyone secretly vowed to stay in the ruling. The world guild for life. At this moment. The guild channel was buzzing with discussions. Some inter-excitement couldn't take help but show of unposting. Screenshots on the forum. Instantly, a new storm erupting. On the forum. Come on. Admire the splendor of epic gear. The terrifying LV 180 legendary priest staff. The terrifying LV 85 epic robe. The dream warehouse of ruling the world. We are the happiest. Plus. One post after another sprouted up like bamboo shoots after the rain. All players who. Browsed the screenshots were left stunned. Doubting whether they were seeing any use. After all. The gear on the. War. Leader board had hidden information. So this western first team is seeing the terrifying attributes of. Legendary and epic gear. The incredibly base stats. The four dimensional attributes. The. Terrifying three skills. It could be said that any player who owned a piece of legendary gear at this stage. Cold Lip to become the second strongest in the entire server. As for the first that was. Still. Still. Sao Chen. Gradually. The upward intensified. Spreading from the forum to every corner of the. Original world. Countless powerfully. Leveled players simultaneously left their original. Guilds and flag to Sao Chen side. Ruling the world. Became the undisputed guild that players most.

Combat power, they were also sealed by the egg drop rate of the abyss level. Dung Heon. In the team. Apart from the little fairy and the Hun Reinsister duo, everyone else, including the eternal gile, at berry. Few pieces of silver equipment. The top quality silver round shield dropped from this wave of monsters was the same item that Sao Chen had done during the first kill with the Fung Ming Guild's right team, which was sold for 300 gold coins by Ysuan Gallo Suawa. A silver round shield typically costs around 100 gold coins, highlighting how enticing its top quality attributes are. Before long, as per Sao Chen's initial instructions, the German priest. In the team began to roll for the equipment. In the end, it was climbed by a newbie. Seeing it nearly brought to tears with excitement. Sao Chen smiled frankly. The attributes of silver equipment are at all low, it's just a transitional piece. There are still gold and dark gold equipment. Everyone thinks we're here and hurry up to follow Little Black. After discussing for a while, Little Black had already taken the lead into the depths of the spider cave. The group heavily followed, hoping that when they fast the next boss, they would drop equipment or skill books for tail-round classes. What made them a bit regret for was that the first boss did not drop any golden equipment. This was also normal. I'll talk the first boss was a LV-38 golden quality into the original, aside from the guaranteed drop of equipment. Matching the boss quality upon the first kill, the drop rate for subsequent kills was not it. It was precisely for this reason that players at this stage were still lacking even silver equipment. However, the members of the team were not so disappointed. The fact that the first boss was instantly killed by a Xiaoyi sparked heated discussions among everyone. What is the amount of our president? Also this terrifying instant kill another instant kill so so king of us. Can't be in can't even compare to a little amount I'm so embarrassed but thinking that this is the president's amount if he'll at peace exactly with a man as brava as our president his amount definitely can't embarrass him. Xiaoyi was quite clever with wisdom comparable to that of an adult the compliments from everyone made Xiaoyi feel very comfortable this was an unprecedented experience that Xiaoyi became even more courageous not needing Xiaoyi. Chentourge and talk the leading routine towards the spider cave. Following been that literally passe was the group keeping a distance that was neither too far nor too close. Instant kill. Instant kill, still instant kill. Xiaoyi truly lived up to the legendary boss template without standing. Attack and defense that's taking down all the small monsters and the second boss with a single skill. The second boss dropped a golden long bow which was fortunately rolled into the backpack of a KO in the team. As they fasted the third boss the group curiously looked at Xiaoyi wanting to see if it cold continue the instant kills. This is a dark gold boss it sold into viable to instant kill right? Amount can instant kill a LV40 dark gold boss? Idon Beliebei. Several members instinctively shook their heads thinking that Xiaoyi bought into viable to do it. Otherwise Amount's soloing an abuse level spider cave? That would be too terrifying. However, the result disappointed them. They got between a dark gold boss and a legendary one. Was not small, at least five times greater. If Xiaoyi used a small skill, it ended bold into viable. To instant kill. But with its one strike ultimate vitality bomb boosted, the dark gold. Explosive spider was instantly melted away. After dropping an LV35 dark gold dagger. It reluctantly closed its eyes. The atmosphere in the team was dead silent. After alone. While someone gasped in so. It can't believe it, it really can instant kill. President. Can you let Xiaoyi take us alone more often? So strong, truly worthy of being the president's mom. Incredible after a while the dark gold equipment was collected by Ian Newfay Sun. Assassin in the team by Ian out and tire a B's level spider cave at been cleared taking less than 10. Minutes the team members who rolled for silver gold and dark gold equipment so it gratfe. Zwei Isto Gia 800 who did not have tan equipment were not disappointed either be cause after clearing the dungeon everyone would receive a golden treasure chest which called GILD golden quality equipment or skill books or even rare items after clearing some golden tegwad to open their treasure chests. Ah, he drew a golden staff. So happy. He also drew a golden equipment. It's as chill. So awesome. Is this the reward for clearing an A B's level Dungeon? He drew a golden output skill book used what in the damn channel was filled with exclamations. Even after exiting the Dungeon, they began to show off in the guild channel. This drew in views remarks from GILD members who were in the included a guaranteed drop of at least one golden item equivalent to half a month's worth of guild contribution points. Everyone in the guild is eagerly looking forward to the day when it's their turn to be taken on a Dungeon run by the guild leader, Da. After finishing a wave of Dungeons, Sao Chen disbanded the team and instructed the members to go about their own business. The village is now empty with very few players around. Although it is the first village established by players in the game. To ordinary players, the two gold coins for residency every two weeks seems a bit pricey. This one te do. Every bit of income from the village is mine, and that's a lot of gold coins I'm losing every day. He need to think of a way to change the situation. Sao Chen matter to himself and suddenly a flash of inspiration striking. The fact that casual players are unwilling to settle here in the cat's-da. The village's appeal is still lacking. So, if a could find a way to change the situation and make the villa more attractive, wouldn't that be great? Right now, there is a single NPC in the village. It's completely deserted. Sao Chen planned to get to go visit the chat with various single-level NPCs and see if a could hire a few. Also, I wanted to stop by Ichiyo's city to look for the linger. He had a dark gold level ring, the Monmon, Blood ring, in his backpack, which is a level 36 ring, perfectly suited for most members, levels, with outstanding attributes, making it one of the essential mainstream equipment for the future capital of large-scale production. Just. As Sao Chen was about to set off the chat interfaces suddenly be system notification player. Frosty. Snow sent you a voice request. Do you accept? Sao Chen was not in familie. We's Frosty Snow so accepted without his attention. Hey, Xian Yeda, he was wondering why you didn't want to join our Phoenix. Guild turns out you were planning to create you round. But wrong with so. Phoenix Guild? It's full of cute and pretty girls. Are you worried we can't satisfy you? If it comes to. It, he called youst Han. Over the position of Guild Leader to you. As soon as the call connected. Frosty Snow's jealous to unca-metro. Did you send the voice message you used to discuss this? Sao Chen. Asked with a smile. No, he was just a bit down. Frosty Snow put away her petulance. She took the opportunity to express her true feelings. Seeing the benefits. Of Sao Chen's. Guild, Frosty Snow genuinely felt in yours. Not only the members have the chance of running level dungeons. But the warehouse is also stacked with various powerful equipment and items. It's a paradise for players. Which Guild in the original doente envi the dominance of Hunlin Tiansha? Several. Members from the Phoenix Guild called Nterisys the temptation and sweet over. However, Frosty Snow didn't. Blame them. If she weren't the the Guild leader, she made a beswitch to work under Yan Yedad as well. Frosty. Snow let out a barely audible sigh, adjusted her emotions, and got to the point. Yan Yedad got. Yee be straightforward, or Guild wants. To form an alliance with your Guild, and he wanted to ask if you. Agree. An alliance? So Chun talked for a moment and nodded. Yabe. A good impression of the. Fenix Guild that's fine, but it's limited to your main Guild, not the other branches. Guilds come for. Alliance. A yet Guilds can share some resources and jointly tackle certain difficulties. In. Les dan 20 hours, the village will face. A monster si. Given the village is a. It. Cane came that around 200,000 players, so the number of monsters attacking will undoubtedly. Be significant. Fortunately, the monsters, level sold in Te be too much bigger than the players, and the B. If they are a legendary, Sao Chen can take them down in an instant. However, Sao Chen felt that. Even if it was strong, there are limits to what one person can do. Although a cold take down. Monsters quickly, if there were too many, it would be inevitable that a meek not be able to handle them all. Falling to defend the city was not an option, but if the village's buildings were dummy, it would surely make. Im feel a bit pan. Now that they have a yet with the Fongming Guild, they can come over and defend the. City together with their own. Guild. This significantly increases their defensive strengths. Of course, the equipment that drops will inevitably have to be shared with the Fongming Guild. However, Sao Chen has a good impression of Suang Auxue believing she is a great friend, so a doente. Mind them coming over to sare despoils. But most importantly, Sao Chen won't heave them more than. They deserve. How much reward they get will depend on how much effort they put in system notification. The president of the Fongming Guild, Suang Auxue has sent you a request for a guild alliance. Do you agree? Agree. After making his choice, Sao Chen said to Suang Auxue. Tomorrow. At noon, all members of your guild sold arrive at Yanjataun on time for the city defense, is that okay? Of course, no problem. As long as you, Daddy Yanja, say the word, ye ye bring everyone. Over. Suang Auxue replied happily. Finally, she has latched onto a big leg again. Without Sao Chen reminding her, Suang Auxue was already planning to bring people to Yanja town for development. As for the monster. See it, with the Yanja's personality, it would definitely not let them suffer. Therefore, Suang Auxue was very willing, both rationally and emotionally. Alright. Let's do it this way. Yare thinks to etento. After concluding the discussion, Sao Chen said his goodbye is and unab the communication ten set of four gobies city as a regionally planned. Recruiting NPCs went very smoothly. Seeing Sao Chen, who had a reputation of admiration, the vast majority of NPCs expressed their willingness to come and to change a top-muisim. Sao Chen selected three blacksmiths who called for ordinary equipment and repair gear and one priest who called eliminat. The weakness status after player de a in total, he prepared to bring back 60 NPCs, including alchemists and hub transfer mentors. As for his request. For Lilinger to help for the demon-mon-blood ring in Chile City, despite limousis disapproving gas. Lilinger still agree. Before a going, Sao Chen had already browsed the auction house in Gobi City. Spending nearly 50,000 gold coins on materials for 50 blueprints. Next, a used nede. To what a few days for the 50 finished products. After bringing the NPCs back to Sanje. Town, an ordinary day quickly passed. The next day had known, the monster sealer I've just promised. The system notification interface. Also displayed a new quest system notification, Juabe. Triggered the quest, protect Sanje town. Quest content, every newly established villages. Always met with attacks from dark forces. Only by defending the village come and truly possess territory. Total. Number of monster attacks, 5 WAPs. Quest requirements, with stand 5. WAPs of monster assaults and maintain the integrity of Yanje. Tom's walls at over 50%. Quest rewards, experience x 6 million, with additional rewards based on the ranking of the teams that eliminated monsters, with a minimum of 1 silver chest and a maximum of 1 legendary chest. Note, EHTAM can have a maximum of 10 members and during the siege, EH play. Accepting the quest can resurrect without penalty 5 times. After using up the 5 chances, they will no longer resurrect until the sea quest ends. System notification, the first wave of monster cities about tobegin. Countdown, 5 minutes. Note, this wave consists of a total of 10,000 LV35 ordinary creatures, 200 LV35 silver creatures, and 20 golden creatures. Please prepare, defending players. The system's notification. Echoed in every player's ears. In front of the main gate of Sinjatobn, a dense army. Of monsters appear, resembling a massive dark claw. A smart portion of them were slowly gathering a, the front. Seeing this scene all the players were unable to can't enter excitement when ave. They ever seen so many monsters wow so many little monsters after we. Finish them off not to mention the equipment and items that make drapeben the experience points will be. Kite impressive exactly plus the quest rewards it think imiq level up this is. So exciting joining the Hunlin Tiontang guild is just thrilling of course it's. Exciting not only do we ave the love of our guild leader but there are also a bunch of girls from the. Naberin Fongming guild waiting for us to discover. You idiots al you do is chate. They be. Lex ave already been. Snatcha. What? They actually formed a team while we were chatting? That's outrageous. The players immediately erupted in chaos. Everyone forgot about. Chatting and started looking for team mats. The rewards for this scene were determined by the rankings of the. Teams. And the acteam called ave a maximum of only 10 people. To achieve a rank in tse. 10 people must be super strong players. Throughout the day many members quietly familiarize themselves with who the top players were. Hunes rain, Hunes flowers, let's form. Ateam. Aku Aku, include me in your team. My area damage output is super strong. Little. Ferry, begging to be included. Brother. Gangsy, come to Orteam, we need a super strong. Thank, it's a laptop to you. Brother ba, brother ba, please take me alone. Countless. Player Swiss. Eagle level equipment and skills instantly received invitations from most people. Among them, the Hunes. Brain sisters and the. Little Ferry were the most popular. The first two were super strong hidden. Classies, while the latter had a golden level group buff. Warrior Sear, which was also very powerful. As for Sao Chen, it was undoubtedly the number one big leg. However, in the eyes of many. Guild members, there was only one guild leader and they would definitely want to team up with people it was familiar. With. So, very few. Members unconsciously approached him. And Sao Chen was not about to waste the opportunity. Since the rewards were distributed based on. The teams, it meant. That everyone in his team would definitely have a legendary treasure chest. Such a thing require familiar. People to team up with. Thus, Sao informed the team with the Hunes flower sisters, the little. Fairy, the eternal great healer trio. Frosty, Snow, Fon Ching Woo, and the Sheed Warrior Name. Brother Gangsy. The other members in the team were al familiar. Only Brother Gangsy was a new. Addition. Brother Gangsy was recommended by the Hunes rain sisters, saying that they performed very well well. They fought the difficult levels by their care together yesterday. Sao Chen did the mind nurturing. Talent, so a brought him in. A legendary level chest. Would definitely be a UG boost. For him. Brother Gangsy himself was very aware of this and looked extremely grateful. Guild leader. He can thank you and know. He will definitely work hard for the development of Hunlin Tian Tan. In the future. I'll talk most of the guild. Members call it the leader that. Brother Gangsy, being an older man, felt embarrassed to say that and could only call him great go. This statement expressed his attitude. A commitment to serve the guild boleh arterli. Opportunities are earned by one self-due. Skills are equate good and work nurturing. Heo Chan added secretly no matter how. Brother Gangsy will perform in the future. His current attempted made him feel comfortable humble. Ungrateful people can get alone anywhere. Brother Gangsy expressed his sense a few more times. But Heo Chan used to yield and not sign any. In further five minutes past in a flash. Son the countdown ended and the first wave of attacks. Vegan on team a full 10. 000 little monsters alone with a considerable number of bases. Even if their levels were in T-Law. Were not overwhelming in front of over 20. 000 players. As the defenders, the players only needed to wait for the monsters to attack. However, often before they even got close, the players would unleash a round of damage. Once they truly engage the struggle between both sides. Officially began. Master, aren't we going to make a move? The little fight is here. Each in here is kept darting towards a golden boss, eager to strike. The others in the time were equally deathless. However, without a command from Sao Chen, none of them dare to act. If you want a fight, go ahead. Sao Chen is mirked and daddy, ye ye used be a feast. Out of water for. A while, let everyone else take the lead. His meaning was clear, and everyone understood. Then let's. Go. Huns. Flower said excitedly, we can still have a some fun now. Once daddy can g-makes. A move, it will definitely be one-sided. Exactly. There are a total of five waps in the sea. And it will only get harder as we go on. Right now, the highest is used the golden boss, which is. Perfect for us to challenge. Huns. Reynch. Medin. Let's go. The other 9 members of the. The am. Including Suangai Oswe. I'll set off to you in the battle. I'll talk the first wave of. Small monsters was numerous. It was nothing compared to the overall player. Count. As time. Past day quickly dwindled and many players also used a pachance to respawn. On the field, only. The silver and golden. Bases were still struggling to hold on. The members of Hun Lin. Tiantan. Were all elite players and a 10 person. The am was more than an oak to the always a silver boss. It was used. A matter of time. The players from Fungming Guild were also exceptional. They were all strengths. Sightly inferior to Hun Lin. Tiantan. But they worked together more harmoniously. Making it hard to say who. Were stronger or weaker. At last. The silver boss posed not reatatá. Meanwhile, the 20. Golden Bases were losing galt rapidly under the unslought of the crowd. Of course, it's. 20 golden bases a terrifying output as well. With players being sent back to the village's respawn point. Almost every second. Gradually, the team ranking stabilized. Among the second to the decimals. Places 5 were from Hul Lin. Tiantan. And 4 from Fungming Guild. However, the 1st place was occupied by each other's chance. The output of the 1st place was visibly increasing. Kemper to the 2nd place. Once this result stabilized. Everyone couldn't help but draw in. Envy. This team is the first. Is it's made up of the top players in the entire server. Right. As the president. That he made a move yet and 1st place is. Already secure. Once president. That he makes a move. Wanted the output explode immediately. I'm used to roll in the cause. I used to the element. Do you believe me? Although the number of monsters in the 1st web was large. It was still not a no-gin. Front of 20,000. Plus. Even with 10 golden bases and 100 silver bases. They. Were gradually worn down. Dropping several pieces of golden. Equipment. T.C. Golden Items. Were randomly awarded to the top 10 output teams participating in the battle through a role point system. With priority given total professions. The remaining drops of ordinary wheat awards, brands, and silver were first come a first survey. How much one cold get depended on how fast everyone was. After simply clearing the battlefield before the many players had a chance. T.R.S. The second wave. Of monster siege vegan. System notification. The second wave of monster siege is about tobeging. Note this. Weight consists of a total of 20,000 LV35 ordinary creatures. 300. LV35 silver creatures. 30 golden creatures. And a dark gold creature. Please prepare. Defending players. The difficulty of the second wave was nearly double compared to the first. Not. Only did the number of small monsters surge. But there were also many more bases. Including a gold boss. Son. A dense swarm of monsters are there. As expected. This team. Houching still did not make a move. Living all the opportunities to the ordinary players. As a result. The. Brutality of the battlefield was comparable to certain war blackbusters. One monster after another. Fail and one player after another. Transformed into with a light. Only to resurrect and rejoin the. Fight. Among the monsters. There were also to a wish round attack capabilities and in the face of. Such a large scale siege war. The sacrifice rate of ordinary players was alarmingly fast. Fortunately. The players were defending the village and their speed of resurrection and rejoining the battle did detect the. Long. Thus. For a team. But. See this where in astalman.

Ended, many players discussing the guild channel. Sao Chen took a quick glance and found that the best. Majority of players had already used up their resurrection opportunities. There is only 1 or 2 left. In the face of the tier, 4's and 5's of attacks, the top 10. Teams were already too exhausted to continue fighting. They had died only 2 or 3 times, slightly. Let's then others, but their numbers were too few to make. A significant impact. Das, Sao Chen. Decided to take matters into his own hands. After the finish of the boss, remember to pick up any equipment. Or items a bad goal. Level. Sao Chen set to the others in the team. Understood. Ok, President A. Everyone replied excitedly. Before alone, news of Sao Chen's. Decision to join the battle spray. 20,000 players were instantly thrilled. Easy. Finally team for President A. That's one hit kill show. Thank you, President Da, for giving us. The chance to boost our task ratings. From now on, we can only watch. Go, President. Do. Your best. I want to see President Da once you have the dark gold boss. Players buzz with excitement. In the guild channel. Sao Chen's combat power was evident. No full gold doubt his strengths now. Do. The players. Tese monsters between levels 35 and 40. Only one outcome instant. Do. After a quick cleanup of the battlefield. The third wave of seed monsters are a system. Notification. The third wave of monster seed is about to begin. Note. This wave can see so far. Total of 30,000 level 35 normal creatures. 500 level 35 silver creatures. 50 level 36 gold creatures. And 5 level 36 dark gold creatures. Players. Defending the city. Please prepare. The monster seed was indeed getting more difficult as it. Progress. Many members of the Tumajor guilds looked at the system. Notification was wary. Expressions. Al toque del President. That was powerful. Code handled so many monsters. Son. A massive order of monsters surrounded in Tirei and Jatown like dark clouds. However. The players. Were is banished in the next moment. Replaced by overwhelming excitement. Destruction slas. This move was out chance most powerful area damage skill. Minus 6 mil. Minus 6 mil. Minus 26 mil. As soon as destructions as was a leech. All creatures within a 2 mil. By 2 mil meter radius. Weather normal monsters. Silver bases. Or gold bases. Were a blitter at it. The progress of the third wave so would over 10,000 creatures de. Instantly. The players erupt. In excitement. My god. One mob. And over 10,000 kill. This is simply a nuclear. Bomb. President that is mighty. Incredible. Incredible. I'm completely convinced. President that. This is just terrifying. Seeing it in person felt completely different from watching it. On video. Previously. Players had seen recordings on the forum and knew that President Sao Chen had the. Terrifying power to one shot dark gold. Basis. Later. After a series of notifications. They understood that even an epic level 85 called be so allowed for a first kill. However. Players simply. Talked Sao Chen had extremely extreme el target output. And never expected de pesest such a terrifying. Area damage skill comparable to a mages forbidden spell. Just one move. We're that. Massive sword energy when. No creature called with standing. Even the dark gold boss. Unwilling to die in ban. Left vein the pile of equipment and items. President that. You call probably. Defend the city all by yourself. Right? Many players called in the help but think this. This wave of. Battle was far from over. Be cause the cooldown for destruction as was stolen a full 24. Ors. How can you call in the use it a second team in this ill battle? However. It didn't panic. After activating the dual buffs of Unmatched Dance and Transcendence. Echaled into other areas. Like a deity descending from the heavens. Flying impacts. Area bombs. Hand bombs. Watermoid. Dance. With Transcendence reducing the cooldown by 50% and Unmatched Dance increasing attack. Speed by 200%. The speed at which a kid monster saw it no sense of slowing down. It was used that there were simply too many monsters. Some of which had already began attacking the outer walls of the. Village. If the damage to the world exceeded 50%. This monster seed would fall. Saochem felt somewhat overwhelmed. Realizing it was outmatched. And it helped to quickly clear the. Ordinary small monsters near the walls. Why fighting? It talked for a moment and suddenly remembered thing. King Wu. It took out the. Item. Meteor fall. Skill book. From the guild warehouse. Along with a set of. L. V. 35. Dark god equipment. And handed them to Fen King Wu. Xiao Wu. Take this and clear out. Desmond monsters. Fen King Wu. Size widened in disbelief. Such a precious kill book and equipment. Just even to her like that. A. Joan. This item saretov all jebel. You can't accept them. Fen. King Wu. Has a 30. Her mouse opening slightly. Just take them. No need to be polite with me. The. Most important thing right now. Is to defend the walls against the monsters. Xiao can set firmly. Leaving no room for refusal. Although dark god equipment was highly valued by ordinary players. Xiao can aplenty. And giving away a set didn't get him at all. However. He felt a bit reluctant. About the. Meteor fall. Skill book. This special quality skill book. Which dropped from the LV200. Music final demon god. Not only a base attack damage of 1200% a TLV1. But also an attack range of 500 by 500 meters. With a cooldown of only. 180 seconds. It was truly a godly output skill for mages. But sao chun. But still a magic. And this skill book would eventually be given to someone else. Which was while at placidating the guild. Warehouse was an exorbitant price of 30.000 contribution points. Second only to the epic. Robe. The situation was special now. During the third wave of the sea. Monsters had already begun to threaten the. Walls. While most players had run out of resurrection. Chances. What about the next two waps? Realizing this. So chun had to admit the advance of what sorts Haiti. Previously. Had simply. Wanted to help the guild members complete the task evaluations. But there. So had led the first two waps play. Out from the back. Causing the situation to slip slightly out of control. Sao chun had deliberately kept. Powerful skills like the sword of annihilation. And twilight of the gods for the upcoming two waps. Makin it is ito. They always the boss. But they couldn't handle the small monsters intime. Now. Nd. Dastron. Helper to they always the small monsters. Fortunately. The problem was the to be. Onsefen. Kingu learned meteor fall and equip the dark gold gear. She could handle the task. Of defending the walls on. Her own. While sao chun called focus on dealing with the small monsters oxide and pinpointing the boss level creatures. For quick kills. Seeing that feng kingu still wanted to refuse. Sao chun's expression darken. Xiao Wu. We bebe and all team match struck several online games together. Are you really going to be polite with me? Do you look down on me? No. No. No. Feng kingu shook her head bigger as it. It's just that they are too precious. I really feel. Bad accepting them. Then you do look down on me. A mere set of dark gold equipment and a skill book. How important can they be to me? Sao chun said in a de. Boys. Take them. And hurry up and help clear the small monsters at the walls. Olaik. Ten ye ye remember this and. Find a way to pay you back in gold later. After he's at it in for a moment. Feng kingu fa ine lina di. And talk the skill book and equipment that sao chun handed over. Sao chun secretly nadi. Not say. Anything more. Feng kingu. This. Old team match. And knows very well that a good never take. Advantage of others for free. Even if a can't afford the money. A will do his. At most to make. Up for it afterward. Being friends with such a principal pleasure is undoubtedly an easy thing. And conflicts. Arrere. Meanwhile. Soangasui and the others listening on the conversation. Embiosely looking at. Feng kingu. After acquiring a set of dark gold equipment. Her outputs cae equity. And. With the meteor draw. A skill that is godly for mages. Feng kingu called bc to have a comedy and disputed number. One mage in the world of original. With her overall strength ranking only second to sao chun. Everyone glance again at sao chun. Who was slaughtering enemies left and right and silently. Marvel. This man. Liking strong helpers. Directed round one on the spot. This is not about. Strengths. But about demeanor. If it were anyone else present. They would be reluctant to part with that say. Of equipment and skill book. But so it no has a tashen atal. Even forcefully handing it to her after. Feng kingu has a tit to refuse. This demeanor made them feel inferior. At the same. Time. It deeply impressed them. Especially for the newly joined member. Brother Henksi. Made a firm decision in his heart. To closely follow the president's instructions. If the president told him to go. East. I would go east. If told to go west. I would go west. Without a second toe. Such a. Leader is truly admirable. And is willing to follow him silently. After accepting sao chun's hit. Feng kingu quickly equipped the gear. And learned the skill book. In the next moment. She ras her staff and unleashed. The skill on a group of small monsters. Obscid the city war. Meteor. Dra. 10. Massive meteors fell from the sky. The intensity causing the surrounding air to war. In the standest. Gases of countless players. Just a second a third. They crashed down to the ground. Minus seis mi. Minus seis mi. Minus seis mi. A flurry of numbers erupti. And in an instant. All the small monsters in this area were melted away. The terrifying attack range and immense damage lead. All the players witnessing this scene in so. Many recognize this as a magic skill. This lead. All the magic players present to watch in rap fashion ashe. What the hell? Who did this? Step. For part if you know. He won't bow down. This issues. Ridiculous. Besides president. Are. There really are terrifying players at this stage. It's actually a magic. Did you see that? Whoever says mages are useless. Yee be the first to disagree. By the way. Is that this the. Item. Meteor draft skill book from the guild warehouse. How did it appear here? Did someone. Learn it? No way. Remember this skill book requires 30.000 contribution points to. Exchange. And the guild was only created the day before yesterday. Am I remembering wrong? Idiot. It's obvious that president actively gave it away. Everyone was astonished by the terrifying. Power. Of the meteor drop skill. And then curious about who exactly received this skill book. In the. After checking the. History records. Of the guild warehouse. Everyone confirmed that the skill book was. Given away by the beloved president. The question now is. Who is the lucky one favored by the president? And then curious about who exactly received this skill book. With her dark gold gleaming. Equipment enchanting pasture. It was clear that the lucky one had been identified. Who is she? Even ever seen her before. Is she from our guild? No way. She seems to be from the feng min. Guild. He remembers she is an old friend of the president. There were many interactions when we were fighting. The base level spider cave players in the november. And to a ye kept us around them. This made the vast majority of the newly joined members. Even more determined to certainly implement a love. The president's requirements look at feng chingus. She was a really used an ordinary expert. But to her closer relationship with the guild. Leaders she instantly lipped to become the number one mage. In the game it simply enviable enough to make one role. Players called and the help but let the. Imagine strong while. What if they could the guild later say in the future? Bold and the day also have. The chance for such an opportunity? As this doctor owes. Their gases towards south and back. Feren. The cooldown for the meteor fall skill is. Keep the sword and we're feng chingus. Support from red arc gold. Equipment. Her output was incredibly powerful. Level 35 small monsters had no chance. Observable gains this skill. Even a level 35 silver boss would lose. More than outfits. He had in an instant. And with a few additional small skills. It would have a tonal. We're feng chingus. Holding the city wall. So. Senna nowhere is at all. A transformed into a phantom. We've been trod the crowd of bases. Engaging in fierce combat. Minus 200,000. Minus. 400,000. Minus 600,000. After Satchalon Battle. The. Basic skill of the destroyer. Combo. Along with the legendary passive skill. Warrior secretar. Infinite power. At stack to the max. Increasing his four dimensional attributes. Bahia and edition. 150% and granting him lifestyle effects. In this state. Whether it was a goal. Boss or a dark gold boss. They couldn't withstand any of his skills. Even a normal attack. Cold only. Be barely blocked. Bahia dark gold boss. Preventing it from being instantly killed. Bahia basic. Attack. Under these circumstances. Eliminating the third wave of enemies. Was merely a matter of time. Sure and no. Use 5 minutes later. There was not. The single small monster left on the field. Is that. It. Faster than our 20,000. Taking down the first wave. The guild leader is mighty. The guild leader is awesome. So fast. Is expect time playing a fake game. Our 20,000. Can use. Godie. It feels so ineffective. Don't belittle yourselves. You can shout. 666. The players were astonished. They anticipated that the cooperation. Between Sao Chen and Fenkin would make the third wave of attacks so simple. In fact, the entire process was even quicker than the team they spent on the first two waves. Their admiration. For Sao Chen deepened even further. After the third wave of attacks, the fourth wave was about to arrive. Sao Chen and. Swung out. We directed all surviving players to quickly gather their equipment. The gold and dark gold equipment was first collected by Isao Chen's team. And they would discuss the. Distribution method after the battle. But others probably felt too embarrassed to ask for any. As for the. Brands and silver equipment. Everyone could pick them up freely. Still following the profession priority. Rolling method which ensured that every player had a relatively fair chance. As for the bit of our. Equipment. Members of the two major guilds expressed that after seeing nearly 10,000 pieces of brands. And silver. Equipment. They simply looked down on bit of our items. Skills books and other items. Were also distributed according to quality. System notification. The fourth wave of monster. Cities about to begin. Note. This wave consists of a total of 100,000 LV level ordinary. Creatures. 1,000 LV 35 silver. Creatures. 500 LV 36 gold creatures. 50 LV 36 dark gold creatures. And 1 LV 40 legendary boss. Please prepare. Defending players. 100,000 LV. Ordinary small monsters. Thinking who was a. Bit slow at clearing them. This is troublesome. South and from it. And they expected that the force. Wave of monsters. It would have such a massive number. A full 10 times that of the first wave. We saw where 100,000 monsters in total. They completely surrounded. Xiongye Town. However. It wasn't too surprising when it talked about it. After all. Xiongye Town was a village that called. A came to 200,000 players. If full is the. Ordinary small monsters. Ver in the theater. Only. The basis were the main force of the monsters. But the problem is. There are only 20,000 players. In Xiongye Town right now. So we asked. So and out. So it took all the players from the various branches of. Fongmin. Or so. We trained a few. I got put players on the spot. To specifically slaughter the small monsters. South and pandered for a moment. In the end. Evanded altos ideas. First. Considering the situation. Where his own guild called. Maximize profits. With the Fongmin. Mine guild. Decided that 20,000 players. Were no gun calling. In others. For support. Would be quite embarrassing. South and west. And willing. To do the. Second. Edith. Not a be any skill books. With the magic. And are. Comparable. Tomite. Falling his inventory. And relying solely on dark gold. Equipment. Would not kill. Outstanding results. As for legendary equipment. Unfortunately. Even if. Hiao. Chen gab it away. For free. The players. Bold. And. The viable. To equip it. Duet. And sufficient requirements. Therefore. This battle. Would manly rely on him. And thank. Ching was for the others. Most of the. Teams ranked in the top 10. Are equipped. One or two pieces of golden gear. Which served as a. Supplementary fighting force. There is no way around it. We can't use charging. Recklessly anymore. We must push forward. Slowly from the front. And we need to conserve. Some skills. To ensure we get through. The. Fifth way. South Chunto. For a moment. Summon his mount. The John Xiaong. And. Ordered it to guard. The east side of the village. Thanking. One. The other players. Would defend. The. South side of the village. As for the northwest cities. South Chunto. Decided to take matters. Into his own hands. This was the first monster. See. In Yuan Chu. Attracting the attention. Of players across the. Server. From the first wave. There were bored. And curious players. Watching from not far outside. Xian Ye. Town. Recording videos. Of what they saw. And posting them. On the game forum. So far. Nearly all. 20.000. Ordinary players. Ad exhausted. Resurrection counts. With no more than a thousand. Active. On the battlefield. The terrifying combat. Powered. South Chunto. Displored during the third wave. Of attacks. Let players in saw.

Although this fighting style was not as stunning as the instant kill of the oblivion slash its efficiency was not low. The tide of monsters under Sao Chen's assault. Cold. Not even approached the city walls. Let alone cause any damage. Sao Chen even talked the team to quickly unleash several skills in succession. Taking down the TLV 40 legendary boss within 5 seconds. Countless members witnessed. This scene for the first time. They are stuck and beyond measure. And a talking ball entirely popped into their minds. What does it mean for one person to withstand a thousand troops? This was the best explanation. Meanwhile. On the other sides. With fanking wonder the remaining players holding their ground. The southern city wall. Had not encountered any significant issues for the team being. The eastern side. Guarded by the. Elan Xiao A. Achieve results nearly comparable to Sao Chen's. In front of a LV 40. Legendary boss. No matter how many small monsters there were. They were not a concern. Especially. With Xiao APC's in numerous large area attack skills. Ultimately. After 8 minutes. The force. Wave of attacks was successfully defended. Taking advantage of the fact that the final wave of the. Si had not yet begun. The surviving players rushed to pick up equipment. With the player count not being. E. Only used under 800. The equipment available to pick up was. Kit limited. Yet. The battlefield was covered in loot. With silver and gold level equipment and items everywhere. Making it hard to. Choose. Equipment above gold level was. As usual. Picked up by Sao Chun and his group. If it weren't for the temporary expenditure of 50,000 gold coins to expand the guild warehouse to 10. 0-0-0. They truly bought into a bebe enable to carry a tal. The 800 lucky. Players also began. To put the extra equipment into the guild warehouse to exchange for guild contribution points. After this battle. It was estimated that the. H of them would gain at least over 500. Guild contribution points. Bringing them one step closer to exchanging for gold quality equipment and skill books. Of course. For. Players who had already died five times. How can we also generate planning to consider how to. Distribute compensation after it was over. A understood the principle of caring for the few Ratterdal. The many. Before alone. The battlefield was cleared. And how can finally add the team to take out. And admitted the long sword wrapped by the legendary boss earlier. Item. Sword of Kings level. LV 35 legendary equipment. Requirement attributes. LV 35. Strength. 6000 equipment. Requirement class. Warriors. Assassin physicals.

After reading the attributes of this equipment. Sao Chen. Couldn't help but from slightly. To mediocre. Not only were the attribute increases minimal. But none of the three skills were powerful output skills. It was more of a team oriented piece of. Equipment. Sao Chen talked for a moment and decided. Not to store it in the warehouse but to use it. Directly. It looked at the only two warriors in the team. Xiao Xian Nguan. Suang Ai Ose. Huamon Yu. To once this long sword. The force wave of monster seeds further reduced the remaining plair sun. Facing the impending final wave of monster attacks. Sao Chen wanted to enhance his seed's combat. Capability as much as possible. The current damage level of the city wall has reached 9. 6%. The last wave of monsters attacking the city will only make things more. Difficult. He decided to convert this legendary long sword into immediate combat power to. Increase the chances of defending the city. Sao Chen Adi. This is the a hit you sold consider who can. Effort it. As on as a finished. Spekin. The little fight is I's dimmed. While swung as we was. In that field we surprise. At this stage. The value of legendary equipment goes without. Sign. Moreover. This legendary long sword is the first one as I eat from Sao Chen's. Awaiting. It would not only significantly enhance their combat. Capabilities but also allow them to rank on the. Server weight equipment leaderboard. Gratly boosting their fame. After thinking for a moment. Swan. Auxoey greeted her teeth. As if she had made a decision. And said. Lord Xenia. The value of this. Legendary long sword in the market is immeasurable. He can only attempt to make an offer. First. After decisions. He will present you with 100.000 gold coins. Second. Within the next. Two months. It will be paid you with two legendary main weapons or accessories of atleas TLV 35. This prize was in that full of sincerity. 100.000 gold coins would nearly. The plete de reserves of the Fongming Guild and the promised to rip out with two pieces of legendary equipment in the. Future was even there. However. In swung as us view. It was all worth it. Because after obtaining this legendary long sword. The players in their guild called tackle and gear difficulty. Dungeons or outdoor bases. Gilding tremendous benefits. They called even attempt to challenge legendary. Basis below LV 40. All right. You can take it. Sao Chen was secretly impressed by his one. Auxo's boldness and also included a set of his discarded LV 36 Dark Gold gear. The five pieces of the. Butcher armor. Along with three LV 35 Dark Gold accessories and a Dark Gold of Hand weapon. Guard. In terms of value. This set of Dark Gold equipment also started at around 100.000. However. Since swung as us was so sincere. Edim Theodba. Once she done the Dark Gold gear. Swung as need for wielding the long sword was satisfied. After converting it into immediate combat. Power. Their chances of defending the city increased once again. Thank you. Lord Yangji. Swung as we took the equipment. Sao Chen. Handed over. Her hands trembling slightly with excitement. Once she wore this set. She instantly transformed into the second strongest warrior in the entire server. Used being. Sao Chen. Making a tremendous impact on the Fenming. Guild. The Little Fairy beside her also. So with a calm expression. She was very impressed by his own. And also substantial investment. Moreover. To be fair. The Little Fairy had a very accurate understanding of her own position. She was. Simply focused on clinging to Master Yangji. And would never expect to receive a powerful equipment. And. Items for free. Because if that were the case. Her relationship with Master Yangji. Would become a distorted. The Sisters of Hun Dan. And the Group of Eternal Great Healy. Also expressed admiration. On one hand. They admired Sao Chen's decisiveness and generosity. Able to say of the equipment adios. A tan without hesitation. On the other hand. They were astonished by his one. Gaux's boldness. However. They didn't pay too much attention to it. Because under such circumstances. Once the siguiente. As a chance team match. They would inevitably receive a legendary treasure chest. Wow. Is Lord Yangja. Even human. With his own strengths. A single-handedly chant the course of the battlefield. It's terrifying. It's simply explosive. It didn't expect such terrifying explosive power. And excellent endurance. Upstairs. Is expect your red driving. It's your own thoughts that are too wicked. We're clearly discussing how powerful. The Dianja is. Yet you think like that. Such a man deserves the title of the number one in the gaming. World. Seeing the force wave of attacks easily defended. The players excitedly began to discuss. The terrifying power of the John Xiaoyi. Along with his own extraordinary stun. Output ability. This team. Sao Chen has once again redefined the power ceiling of the game's top player. Facing a hundred thousand monsters. His contribution alone accounts for at least 90%. The remaining 10% is mostly due to Fen King Wu's efforts. After such a long period. Of promotion. Players have gradually come to understand how this previously unown ordinary level. Player. Fen King Wu. Suddenly became so powerful. Is this all the result of Yann Jaskerfeld? Kelte Bashen? For a team. Fen King Wu was held as the luckiest player in the original. Barnone. Meanwhile. The Emperor. Far away in Swambu City. No longer felt the comfortable pleasure of watching a. Cho. His expression was completely panic. As this guy finally started to be generous. The Emperor's eyes freaked with a complex mix of panic and jealousy. He had sources of information. That revealed more than what ordinary players knew. Understanding who had used the wire. The legendary. Lonsor. In the Emperor's view. Frosthouse was offered with Kitteries and Eve. At this stage. A LV-36 legendary piece of equipment is worth its waiting goal. Having a. Inmeasurable impact on both personal and guild development. If it were him. He would be willing to. Offer an even eager prize. This situation also made the Emperor's eyes out. Change transformation from. Alone. Both focused solely on his own development. A king willing to plead his friend. Such a. Player would only become more terrifying. With more and more. E-level players willing to support him. Follow. Iman helping defeat all enemies. And sword all schemes. Currently the Azure Guild is the. Only force clearly standing against. Iman the outcome is easy to imagine. After today. The. Guild's development will undoubtedly become even more difficult. Dammit if it better. And therefore that bit dark. Rose. Betraying us a. Guild have had a chance to. Vigin around the boat. Way the Emperor. Couldn't help back. Gry. His days after the. Oster Hill fell into trouble. Dark Rose had already. Turned against them. If it. Beren't for the potential. Usefulness. Chimit still ave. The Emperor. Guild have exposed. Her long ago. Bah. Why did dark. Rose betray them. Is that al. Be cause of. Chi and yes rise. If it. Triti. Impelitely back then. How great would that. Have been. Unfortunately. Now one misplits to another. And it feels as if he be. Falling into an. A. Colden Teh. Help but feel a. Tinge of regret. For his earlier wrong decision. If a. Triti. Siangy with respect. Bolden Teh. Bidem. The Oster Hill. Standing beside Hunli. Tiansia today. Instead of the Fongming Hill. Unfortunately. There is no such thing as appeal. For regret in this world. As for the outcome of this. Battle. The Emperor had grown. Toh. Lass it to pay. Attention. If a. Hundred thousand monsters. Cold be held off. A truly colden Teh. Imagine what. Unexpected situations. Cold arise. Siangy town. As out. Chainsol the sword of. Kingst of Rostaswa. Defeat wave of monster seeds on an arrive. System notification. Defeat. Wave of monster seeds about tobeging. Note. This wave consists of a total of 5.000. L. V. 35 silver creatures. 500 L. V. 36 gold creatures. 200 L. V. 36 da. Gold creatures. And 5 L. V. 40 legendary bases. Please prepare. Defending players. This. Wave of attack. Are there really no small monsters? Saocheng was pleasantly surprised. Be willing a. Relaxed smile. We so many bases. If it were a village established by an other player. Even gathering 200.000 players would be utterly powerless to resist. However. In. Front of him. Creatures below L. V40. Whether ordinary small monsters or dark gold creatures. Madden o. Difference at all. They cold all be taken down in a single block. Only at the legendary level. Relying on their defense and they at attributes. Cold they withstand a few hits. Therefore. This final. Wave was. For Saocheng. The easiest one yet. The reduction in the number of seed monsters allowed into. Charge forward with confidence. Without worrying about a large number of stragglers. The ordinary. Players also breed the size of relief. Hey. Facing so many bases. I'm actually not. Worryed at all. Ha ha ha. Me too. What a coincidence. It's all thanks to our guild leader da. That's right. We's guild leader da. Around. This monster. Seag is completely secure. Guild. Leader da. Go for it. Drop more gear so we come and save a better chance when it comes to loot. Distribution. Bye. The way. We so much gear from this monster. Seag. Our whole intentan. Guild has undoubtedly become the number one in the entire server. Right. Looking at the massive army of. Bases approaching in the distance. The players discussed casually. Some even starting to anticipate how. Many good items they would get after it was a little bit. In every one size. This boss battle was simply. A welfare giveaway. The monsters it was so exhilarating. They hoped there would be more. Opportunities in the future. As expected. It was not surprising to anyone. Saocheng. Alone. Child strut into the crowd of bases first. Normally. We so many bases. A single. Round of focus. Fire call takes Saocheng down instantly. After all. His defense wasn't. Particularly outstanding. But the bases didn't. Pc's the intelligence of players. The bases. Below the dark gold level in the original. Were basically used all templates. Lacking any coordination. When. Gathered together. Moreover. Saocheng at the protection of the demon god. A guaranteed skill. 7. If a level 200 final demon god resurrected. And stood in front of him. It called at most rang his salt in. A few moments. But bold and the viable to kill him instantly. Although I'm confident. It can be. Careless. Saocheng's gas sharpened. As entered full fire power mode. Level 9 twilight of. The gods. Activity. Level 9 unmatched. Dance. Activity. Level 9. Fearless. Activity. Level 9 fury. Activity. With the addition of these 4 buffs. Saocheng instantly felt like a celestial beam descending to the mortal hell. Not only did his attack speed. And movement speed skyrocket. But his output nearly double. And the also the 50% reduction in. Called on time. Makinin imiuntohani control skills for the entire 70 seconds of twilight of. The gods. It's worth mentioning that previously. When passing tens of thousands of monsters. Many of the bases had control skills. However. We see a 8100 000. Plus it at the tribute and the demon king armor reducing control by 30 the duration of TC control. Skills was observed that it was almost negligibly only dark gold level bases called me. His movements pause for about a second but now with twilight of the gods activated their goal. Binodon time at a level 9. Sunderstep level 9. Giant Bomb level 9. Watermon debindance as an elite skill after skill can bind with the passive skills. Level 9. Combo. And. Level 9. Warrior secret art. Endless power. Saocheng's combat bekame increasingly. Terefaing gobert time. Minus 50,000. Minus 50,000. Minus 600. 000. No dark gold level boss called withstand any of his skills. Even legendary basis. Colden the old out for long under Saocheng's nearly full fire power stay. Monsters below level. 40. Minus only bitaken seriously by Saocheng if they were epic or even musical level bases. Unfortunately. The highest amount of bases in front of him was only 5 legendary ones. The sunset. West blood red. Otsides any a town. Countless boss corpses lie scattered have hazardly on the ground. On the ground. Countless silver. Gold. Dark gold. And legendary quality equipment and. Items emitted and enticing blow. As the last legendary boss reluctantly fell. This final. Wave of monsters. The system's notification echoed in the ears of Saocheng's. The arm. System notification. World damage is below 50%. Monster seed mission has been completed. Calculating. Mission results. Your team ranks first among 2,210. Teams. Mission rewards. 60 million experience. 1,000 reputation. 1,000. Free attribute points. Legendary chest X1. Soutable for your level and profession.

The team's rank segunda to decimo received dark gold. Chests. Teams rank decima to quincuagésimo received gold chest. While the remaining teams received. Silver chests. Use the mission settlement rewards. Prepelled Hunin Tiantang and Funkming guilds to become. Two of the strongest guilds in the game. Not to mention the numerous equipment. Draped by the five whops of monster. Basis. Because Saocheng was the president of Hunin Tiantang. Players outside generally. Recognize Hunin Tiantang as the undisputed number one in the entire server. But that was a. Story for later. Now. The excited players eagerly opened the. Chests. Wow. Y. Got a top notch silver dagger. This is awesome. Ja ja ja. But equipment can pertome. Y got a. Silver quality area damage skill. With a base attack power of 180% a TLV1. So great.

Out with the big shots. And got a dark gold chest. Opened a super healing skill of dark gold quality. One. By one. The players were flashed with excitement. And able to stop discussing among themselves. After this. Wave of rewards. They were incredibly. Fortunate. Not only did the vast majority receive the. Dream top notch silver equipment. But there were also lucky ones who got gold quality. Or even dark gold. Quality equipment and skill books. Such a quality equipment and skill books would take at least a month. To all fall to 10 if they didn't join Hun Lin Tiantang. Yet now. It was only the. Second day since they joined. Moreover. The equipment dropped from the monster base is allowed. Large number of players to be fully equipped with silver quality or above. Making them feel like they were in a dream. How could they not be thrill? However. The most excited were actually sao chensteam. Bk. C. What they received was a legendary quality. Chest. Wow. You opened a legendary quality. Skill book. Lv1 blessing of the gods at a 20% damage reduction. Increases. 2000 attack power. 1000 4 dimensional attributes. And 1000 dual defenses for. Alteam members. This skill is used to strong. The little fairy exclam. Excitedly. Ben sim. To think of something and express some regret. I'm clearly a heavy armored warrior. Why do your ways get these above skills? I got a Lv36 legendary helmet. I got a Lv36 legendary small round. Still. The attributes are insane. I got a legendary quality single target. Damage skill. That's not bad either. Eternal great healer. The brother. Anna Kowa looked flushed with excitement. This equipment and item significantly boosted their combat power. Prepelling them from ordinary. Elite players to the very top tier in the entire server. The trick couldn't help but look at sao. Chen. Their eyes filled with gratitude. They never expected that a chance encounter good ultimately lead to. Such. A tremendous opportunity. I love this was brought to them by a president that thank you. For your support president that eternal big boobs respectfully bowed and the brother and the. So also been down in a similar manner. He also translates. Slightly appreciated the gratitude. From TSE3. For players who understood the situation. He was willing to offer even more. Support the requirements for wearing legendary equipment are a key take right so. Why don't you are go to the guild warehouse first. If you find any gold or dark gold quality equipment. You like. Just let me know. And ye ye consider it as a loan to you. After this monster siege. And no. Longhair cared about dark gold equipment at all. If it beren't for his concern that the people below me develop an. Ungrateful attitude. So involved in the have a mind it giving it away for free. You alto. If you see any. Equipment you like. Just say it directly. So inte looked at the homeflower sisters. Little fairy. And. Brother gongsi. TSE4 were also his kitranies. So he treated them equally. As for the other twin de team. Soan Gao Sui and Feng King Wu. They would definitely receive a. Significant amount of equality equipment from this city battle for the Fongming Guild. As the leader. And the top mage of the Fongming Guild they didn't need to worry about their own equipment. Thank you. Master. Thank you. President. That's last great. Go. The four from Hunsran also. About equally move. They were at a loss for words regarding South Chains and warring support only. Hablet to express their depth loyalty. Brother gongsi even secretly about that in the future. As. Lo nas it was the president's command. A goal. Follow it without hesitation. Even if it meant going through. Fear and water. Or even committing suicide. As a player who had gradually climb. Up from the. Bottom. Brother gongsi. Tae deeply understood how are these opportunities. Soan Gao Sui and Feng. King Wu looked on and beautifully at this. Sene. After a long while. They gradually come to. Emotions. Soan Gao Sui handed Saochen a pair of earrings shimmering with purple light. Daddy. Yanja. This is a legendary level earring used to open. Men for warriors. And it happens to be one of the two. Pieces of equipment. The prime history turned to you. Fenging also presented a skill book glowing. With purple light. This is a group attack skill book for fear. Majes. Samen come. Although it can. Compared to the meteor file you gave me before. It's still pretty good. Let's consider it a partial. Ripamen. The two of them prepared to give all the equipment and skill books they had used to done from the legendary. Trasure chest to Saochen. Why the roos? Did you urge you? Saochen shot the magler. These are exactly what you can use. And they're very precious. What until you get equipment for other professions. That you can't use anymore before talking about it. After thinking for a moment. Saochen had it. Even though we're not in the same guild. We don't need to be so formal. We see a shot. So and Gaukzui and Feng. Kingu were naturally moved again. However. To refuse further gold somewhat in very Saochen. So they accepted it. The most obvious result of this monster seed was clear from the major leaderboards. The world level leaderboard didn't change much. Saochen still dominated with his LV50 level. And the guild members ranking only increased by a few places. Starting from the reputation leaderboard. There were some changes. The top 10 on the reputation leaderboard were dominated by the two major guilds. Accepying 6 spots. From the decimato de centésimo. 66 people made the list. We saw those tercera success rate. The skill leaderboard had been eager to keep in the reputation. Leaderboard. The most exaggerated was the equipment. Leaderboard. From the primera to the centésimo. There were players from the two major guilds. Without exception. From the centésima primera to the milésimo. 90% were also players from the two major guilds. PSRs a which a public account. File in 930126 for such a new book. Along with regular activities and guild. Voting are will be conducted through this account. If the followers increase by 500, an extra. Chapter will be added. Remove a yayanda di. The female outfit will arrive tomorrow. So. Yelle post on the public account first. Of course. The temato also needs to be chained. As promised. Iope. Everyone can have the public account and support Sauccia. Thank you very much. Since the female outfit has been there I am today. Yelle at a chapter to camp and set everyone. It will be chained tomorrow. Players from the outside world have been naturally noticed the unusual state of the leaderboard. In the world of primordial. The main sources of power for players are skills and equipment. Previously. I'll talk the great demon. King Xiangji tapped the various leaderboards. After him. The other rankings were fierce. Contested by Yig level players from various races. However. Used after a wave of seed battles. Ended. The two most important leaderboards underwent earth-shattering changes. On the skill. Leaderboard. A full 80 out of the top 100 belong to players from the Hulintian Tang or Fongmin. Guilds. This was simply. Unbelievable. And this was a king situation that does a lumen. Ice was even more disheartening when facing the equipment leaderboard. The top 100 were all from the two. Mejor guilds. The top mila. A market are exceeding 90%. Only. A few well-known yg-level players from other guilds barely occupied positions oxide the top 200. Originally. The player from the celestial race who rank highest. After Chowchen at his golden dagger. Drapped to the ducentésima vigésimo tercera position. Moreover. Duet to the fact that the two major guilds had not. Yet finished distributing their equipment. The occupancy rate of the top 1,000 goal continue to. Increase. Perhaps on. Their goal be no outsiders in the top 1,000. Wow. That's terrifying. He talked of a sign when one person ascends to heaven. Even the chickens and dogs rise. I'm so happy. He also want to be a chicken or dog of Zulintiantan. Yonse met Sian Yes. Recruitment criteria but be cause a necessity. He missed the opportunity. Now he feel like I'm regretting it so much. Everyone. Don't panic. I'll talk the members of Hunlin Tiantan. Are a fool. There is still the fengming guild. There is still a chance. Google begging Kianji to open a branch. Guild. On the forum. There was a chorus of Jele Sian Walling. Everyone and beat the good fortune of the Hunlin Tiantan players while lamenting their inability to join such a welfare rich guild. To say. Level players were in a limit of chance recruitment criteria but he's a tated and ultimately missed. Out where even more regret fell. Beating their chests and walling. All of these mad at the members of the Hunlin. Tiantan guild incredibly proud. Wherever they went. They attracted them both glances. So. Chung was unaware of what was happening on the forum. Even if a new evolved and a bad demuto. Observe. Because back in the June and Mars. He had already killed 4 legendary bases. And we. The 6th kill in the sea battle. He finally completed his second hop transfer quest. System Pro. You have completed the second hop transfer quest legendary. Hunter. Would you like to change hops? Immediately. Note. After changing hops. All stored experience points will be used to increase your character. Level. So change decisively. Yes. As for the consumption of experience. Points. It would be used to level up sooner or later. As for the experience points needed for skill levels. A can only grind for them. Slowly. After this seed battle. Yabe a total of 10.1. Billion experience points. I wonder how many levels he can increase. Sao Chen look to be. Curiously. And so. A witty beam of light descended from the sky. System prompt. You have. Successfully. Chant to the second hop. Junior war go. You have unlearned skills. You can click on the. Skill tree interface to view and learn them afterwards. System notification. You have. Can zoom. 100 million experience points. And your level as in Cristo. LV51. System notification. You have. Can zoom. 150 million experience points. And your level as in Cristo. LV52. System notification. You have. Can zoom. 200 million experience points. And your level as in Cristo. LV53. As series of system notifications appeared on Sao Chen's my. Interface. The witty light from the level up also left the surrounding players in So. After alone. While. The upgrade glow for the. Presidenta. What level is this now? Holy crap. LV70. Junior war go. Awesome. My presidenta. The players were left. Doom found it. A Sao Chen. Who was on the level. Leaderboard. A jump from LV50. Al the way to LV70. Without discussing the incredible process. Just look at the second place. The power of berserker was. Only at LV40. 101 billion experience points. And the only level that 20. Levels. Sao Chen felt that the level increase was a bit too little. And after carefully examining. The system notification interface is suddenly realized. Starting from LV50. The experience. The requirement increases by a full 50 million for every 10 levels. From LV60. Andwards. The experience requirement is 75 million for every 10 levels. Sao Chen roughly. Calculated and talked it was about right. The ground after LV50 left him speechless. This. Game. Is really lacking in experience. Forget it. Yage level up slowly. Level is the most. Important thing. Equipment and skills are at the foundation. Sao Chen comforted himself and looked at the. Improvements. After the hub change system notification. You have a successfully transitioned to Junio. Wargo. Your four basic attributes increase by 20%. And you gain 50 fixed attribute points and. 50 free attribute points. For each level up. The basic four dimensional attributes refer to. The naked attributes without equipment. Right? Not bad. Sao Chen felt a bit anxiety. This ground make not seem significant to others. But for him. We seek basic four dimensional. Attributes. A 20% increase was quite considerable. Moreover. Many skills enhancements. The four dimensional attributes were also. Based on the basic attributes. For example. If you. Have 100 free attribute points. Ten a 20% skill bonus. Good total 120 points. If you have 200 attribute points. It would be 240 points. The eager de base. The greater the effect of the buffs. Receive. From this perspective. The legendary buff skilletan. By the little fairy was outstanding. Next. Ho Chen looked at the skill notifications. The skill interface. After the second hub chant. Not only at max variations of the first hub skills. But also added to new skills to learn. One active and one passive. LV1 Dragon Roar. Yroncloth passive skill. Increase your HP by 20%. Stamine by 20%. And resistance top normal. Attributes by 20%.

It's a pity that you've run out of experience. All my skills are only at LV1. Otherwise, you would be even stronger. South Chang has that the display personal panel murmuring to himself. The success of this second advancement left him. Feeling key temas. The increasing strength after the second advancement was far beyond his expectations. Although the major attributes have only roughly doubled, the percentage increasing skills is based on the panel. The eager the base panel, the stronger the output. Moreover, if the panel's attributes succeed, the targets defense by a significant margin. Under the system's judgment, honest output will receive a substantial boost. In short, Saochen now feels a truly libres up to the name of the war god. After breaking through. To level 50 pulgadas de second transition. Not only did he gain enhancements from his advanced class, but also. Unluck the master disciple. System. Saochen looked at the newly appeared system prompt. System. Prompt. Master disciple. System open. Disciple quote. 03. Master disciple. Explenation 1. Disciples can only share the same base class as their master. Confirm the warrior. And the. Masters level must exceed the disciples by at least 30 levels. The master can just stop as. Only one skill after confirming the disciples target, and once the disciple learns that skill to level 9. The master's skill can break through the level 9 limit, reaching a maximum of level 19. Master. Disciple explanation 2. If the past don't kill as 10, disciples reach level 9. The. Master's skill can break through the level 19 limit, reaching a maximum of level 29. This. Continues, with every 10 disciples. Graduating, allowing the master's past don't kill to break through its. Level K, up to level 99. Note, only 3 disciples can be accepted at the same. Time. Once a disciples passed on skill which is level 9, they can graduate, and the quote. Resets. Allowing the master to continue accepting disciples. The master system, there is in the little. Feria de audacity to call him master was because of this. Accepting disciples allows for skill. Transfer. Even breaking. The level cap of the transfer skills. Sao Chen spirits lifted. In the original, no player was willing to casually pass on their skills, and Sao Chen was no. Exception. Aim safe was a powerful hidden class, with a skill being exceptional, far surpassing the. Other branches of the warrior class in terms of attack range, attack power, cooldown team, and buff strengths. In history, Sao Chen was reluctant to teach skills to outsiders, but the emergence of the. Master disciple system chant his mind. Breaking through the skill level cap was great news. If team a skill leveled up, there was decent ground, and every 10 levels, there was a significantly. The difference between level 9 and level 10 was considerable. Reaching the highest level 99 would me an a. Complete transformation. Even a small skill called Become a terrifying ultimate move. So enticing. However, while the master system is tempting, it will take a considerable amount of time. For disciples to raise these skills to level 9, making it a long-term enhancement direction. He can talk for a moment, since he had made up his mind, and me as well actively. He can talk for a moment, and he can talk for a moment, and he can talk for a moment, and which to become the other. Partis disciple? Note. After becoming the other partis disciple, you can learn one skill pass. On by them, and that skill cannot be taught to others. The interface for the little fairy. And. Brother Gangsy immediately chimed with no tefe questions. Wow, the little fairy exclaimed. Decisively clicking agree, master, master, you can learn your skills. Now Brother Gangsy. Standing beside her, looked slightly excited and also clicked agree without hesitation. There was no doubt about. How strong Sao Chen's skills were, anyone who refused to learn one would be a fool. Hello. Master Kianji. Brother Gangsy. I immediately learned with great enthusiasm. At this point. The slots for the three disciples have been confirmed for two of them. What type of skills do you want to. Learn? Sao Chen said directly, without any hesitation. He had many skills, and. Aside from profession mastery to, he called teach the rest. If we re going to learn, let's learn the strongest. The little fairy exclaimed excitedly. He want to learn that move from master that can kill tens of thousands in. One so restry. That move is so cool. A pan hearing this, brother can also show the look of interest. If a cold learn that move, it bold and te viva. What a little fairy refer to us the LV. 9 Desolation Slash. LV 9 Desolation Slash. Active skill. After charging for. 1 second. It can unleash a massive sword energy covering a range of 2000 by 2000 meters in front. With 3000% of the base panel attack power. Cold on time. 24 hours. D. Power of Desolation Slash needs no further explanation. Even at LV 1. It is outstanding. With attack power and range being the strongest. Among all of Sao Chen skills. Aside from the. Apocalypse sword on the epic launch world. Which is even more impressive in terms of attack power. Nothing else can. Compare. The final damage of the skill is determined by its own attributes. So the little fairy girl. Never catch up to Sao Chen in this lifetime. Moreover. The skills taught by the master to the. Disciples cannot be passed on to others. So Sao Chen was not worried about this skill becoming widespread. Only the disciples acknowledge the qualification to learn his skills. After pandering. For a moment. Sao Chen nadie. This skill just happens to make up for your lack of output due to having. Too many buff skills. It's quite a suitable bad. The cold on time. Is to also think it over. No need to. Think he want to learn this. Thank you master. The little fire is face flashed with excitement. A panic saving the answers she wanted. After finishing the teaching. He auch in turn. Net to brother. God. And ask it. What do you want to learn besides desolation? Sao's the most important purpose. Of he auch in taking on disciples. Was to raise the skill level. Caps oe bolden te sacrifice the. Essentials for the trivial at this stage. There were only 3 slots for disciples. Which were very precious. In the original. The improvement of pleasure skill levels was very slow. It was estimated that it. Would take about a year to cultivate 10 disciples ready to graduate. Usina al slots to raise. One level would be too slow. Therefore. How do you want to engage in such low yield transactions? What type do you want to learn? Just say it directly. Buff type. Master. You decide. I'm fine. We sanity. Brother gang has it. It's for a moment before speaking. Tenielle pass the skill on to. You. Sao Chan made a decision. System prompt. Master. Kianji teaches you the skill. Peerly sword. Dance. You have learned LV1. Peerly sword dance. Peerly sword dance. LV9. Increases. You run attack speed by 200%. Buff duration last 120 seconds. Cold out. 180 minutes. In the original. The faster the attack speed. The quicker the skill sare. Released. Normally. The team attack for a basic attack. Can view set. To perform 3 basic attacks. After applying the buff. Doubling the attack speed. This is extremely beneficial for. Situations requiring explosive power. Therefore. Sao Chan wanted to add a second skill that needed. A level cap. Increase to peerly sword dance. LV1. Increases attack speed by 100. Brother gangster that the description. Completely stand. This buff is too strong. Although it didn't. Increase attack power or reduce damage. The effect of attack speed was understood by E. Alplaz. Through the description of this skill. A show a glimpse of Sao Chan's true strength. Due to soul prioritize leveling. The skill set out due to LV9. Is that okay? Sao Chan instructed. Of course. No problem. The two disciples replied earnestly. Almost swearing to the heavens. Seeing this. Sao Chan nodded secretly. Thus. The matter of talking on disciples came to a conclusion. As. For the remaining spot. Sao Chan said and the talked to Trugge. Just kidding. Who do is a thing. Is. Evolving the use. Randomly pick up a servaito. Forcefully hebe benefits. The city siyas. Ended. And considering the players who set up their 5 resurrection chances. First day rewards were minimal. So on. Edition. El 200 guild contribution points were compensated. In the following days. Siang. Taun beg and to gradually get back on track. Usually. A good lead the beast level spider cabe and han. Wild basis. Not lo nago. Sao Chan retrieved the agreed 50 dark gold rings from Lee. Linger and placered them in the guild warehouse at a price of 3.000 contribution points. H. Alto. Tse dark gold rings cost 50.000 gold coins. To buy materials for Lee Linger to craft the development of the guild itself is a costly endeavor. So Sao Chan didn't tell about one dark gold equipment. Is worth a month of grinding for an ordinary member. After the monster seal. The guilds. Experience went from 0.10.000 to 110.000. Completing 1% of the progress. Once they reach a level 2 guild. The number of members they can absorb will increase to 50.000. Along with guild skills and buffs available for each member to learn. The management of the guild will also have more benefits. As the guild leader. Sao Chan will gain a new title. Exclusive. Bonuses. And more. Which is key to this. Now that Siang Taun is on the right track. I can lift it to. So I'm going to go to help manage it. Next. And the original. The human days is under an imperial system. There. Area total of 20 main cities. Spreared across the 8 directions of human territory. With a royal city. Located in the central area. At this stage. Players. Levels are too low. And the royal city is not. Yet opened. But after the second class transfer. They can use the teleportation. Eras of the major main. Cities to reach the royal city for use. 10 gold coins. From the royal city. And where. The game. The. Original. Is just beginning. Rotary in the. Do you know General Lee Chanan? On the. Streets of the royal city. Lee Linger. Having learned about Sao Chan's target mission. Looked at him curiously. Lee Chanan. General. Sao. Chan's mind stir. And the inquire. Linger. Can. You tell me who General Lee Chanan is? Initially. The main quest issued by a light required into. Deliver the demon kings. Get to an NPC. Na met Lee Changan. But Sao Chan had no idea. Who Lee Chanan. Gan was. A was equally clueless about how to find him. So. A pan learning that Lee Linger was coming. To the royal city. We seem. A catchphrase. A long way. Of course. Lee Changan is. One of the most admire figures. Amon al de students. At our Imperial Star Academy. Lee Linger's. I sparkled as she mentioned. Lee Changan. General Lee Changan. Except to a bebe. Inborn 300. Years ago. And from the age of 5. A displever. Marked Beltale. At 18. Inherited. The legacy of the last sword. Saint. Daijuan. And with his exceptional comprension. A founded a new school. Of sportsmanship. Earning the title of sword emperor. From the outside world. Now. General Lee. Changan is among the strongest. In terms of combat power. And authority. In the entire human race. So. Esa super NPC. Sao Chan added silently. And as que. Then how can he find him? Lee. Lee Linger looked at Sao Chan in confusion. Tiptoe into touch his head. Brother Yanja. Are you? Confused? If you want to find General Lee. You have to go to the General's mansion. A question mark. Slowly appear the bab Sao Chan's head. As a player. Not knowing the information about NPCS. Is a perfectly reasonable thing. This little girl is. Asking for a beating. Sao Chan. Gently tap Lee Linger on the head. And with her blushing. Shy gas. Es va a hidden leer. Lee Linger was. Returning to the imperial. Star Academy. So Sao Chan set of alone on the road to find Lee. Chuan Gans Residence. The human race is imperial city. West bus. Estimated to be more than 10. Times. This is a of Redmond City. The streets where Chris Croce. Bustling with NPCS. Laively. And noisy. Along the way. Sao Chan has kept many NPCS. Four directions. And. Due to day. Repetition enjoyed among the human race. The NPCS questioned where very force coming. In. Fact by the end. As all year even personal. I led a Black Horse for Sao Chan. To mountain guide. I did him to. Lee Chuan Gans Residence. A walk from morning until noon. Before a final stepping in front of a large. General's Mansion. Thank you. Little brother. There is your reward. Sao Chan took out this goal. Coins. And in the grateful gas of the NPC soldier. And act on the door of the General's Mansion. Son. The butler of the mansion came out to inquire about his visit. The butler was a sin on man. And. A pan seeing Sao Chan. A clearly saw the look of surprise. A pan learning Sao Chan's purpose. A talk the initiative to lead him into the General's Mansion. Without even reporting to his master. Before a long. Sao Chan saw the master of the mansion. Sword Emperor Lee Chung Gan. Haha. Yabel on her. That all human race has produced a genius immortality. And seeing you today. You are in the head extraordinary. Lee Chung Gan laughed heartily. His gas was hard. And Sao Chan felt as if all his secrets were laid bare. The term immortal is what NPCs used to refer to players. Meaning un gin and imperishable fitting. The characteristic of players being able to respawn continuously. Lee Chung Gan was well known among the human race. And given Sao Chan's esteemed reputation. And naturally did not bow and scraw. In fact many. NPCs in the imperial city have reputations far exceeding Sao Chan's. Sao Chun. Himself did not mind. Tese trivial matters. And said slowly. He came to date to report the findings of mentor. Elite have what rock his sentence. He was excitedly interrupted by Lee Chan. What? You saw Elite? Is he still alive? Sao Chun shook his head. He don't know if he is. Still alive. It's hard to explain in a few words. General Lee. Please take a look. He pulled out the. Head of the Demon King does from his backpack. And handed it to Lee Chan. The next moment. Elite's serial figure emerged from the Demon King's head. Gritting softly. Oldly. Lonty me no. See. It's. You. How did you end up in this state? Lee Chung Gan exclaimed in so. Immediately recognizing that Elite was in a sole state and weak to the point of him and. Extinction. E. Don't have a matinee left. So ye ye be breath. Ignoring Lee Chung Gan's reaction. Elite succinctly. Recounted the conspiracy of the Demon Race. A. C. Neratit. Sao Chan's mind. Quest was finally completed. System notification. You have completed the mind quest. First Fast.

K., personas had previously speculated that the Mine Quests of the Human Race belong to faction quests. Although he initiated this quest, it would inevitably lead it to all players participating in the water in their third stages. Therefore, I was not surprised by the announcement in the Human Race Area. Human Race Area announcement.

Human Race Area Announcement Player Can. 3 Announcements from the Human Race Area appeared as if a Level 12 Hurricane a suddenly materialized sweeping through 20 Mind Cities in every corner of thousands of Human Race Navies. Villages. Damn, it's the Great Demon King Yanji again. It's actually a Mind Quest. Brothers, is it all that to join the Hunlin Tianzu Guild now? The Rewards for the Mind Quest. Must be substantial. I really want to participate. No need to say more. Is they just a Gold Coin entry? Fi, I'm heading to Kyanji Town. Right now. Exactly. The Quick Get It and the Slow Miss Out. What if Kyanji Town fills up with 200,000 players? There won't even be a chance to pay later. Nearly 3 months since the server opened, all players called only take-on daily quests. Or hidden side quests. Everyone knew that the most rewarding aspect of a game was the Mind Quest. At this moment, all players of the Human Race focused on Kyanji Town. What they were thinking. Was betting on the OPE that they took old Sarai in the spoils. On the other side, incide the Generals. Mansión. After hearing Illit's message, let you gang's expression 10 series. This matter is of great importance. We must prepare as soon as possible. The Awakening of the Beast. Lord of the Demon. Race and the Gods could not be taken lightly by the Chugang. The tragedy on the continent 3,000 years. Ago West Coast by the Demon Race and the Old Race start in our first. Of course, the process. Of the Beast Lord and the Gods Awakening would take some time. But since there were already sins. The Human Race. Must prepare everything quickly to ensure the safety of its people. He must report this to His Majesty. Lee Chugang said solemnly. Ten glance at Saochun. Revealing a hint of doubt. Elite is. This the godlier you chose. Exactly. He has great potential. Elite's not yet banished soul set. Without hesitation. He admit he is. Extraordinary. He is currently a junior war god. But it will only get harder from here. Strength and temperament are both essential. And even when challenging the divine. Position. If there is even a side deficiency. It called. Lee Tofaye. The looking li. Chugang's eyes gradually revealed distrust as a look that Saochun. He is an unjin. The unjin's. Fearlessness of that makes most of them careless when facing overwhelming challenges. He doubted as the. Talented challenge the divine position. So what do you want to do? Elidas que. Lee. Chugang. Enlese can pass my test. The system prompt sounded in Saochun. Seed as expected. System. Prompt. You. Have a trigger. The second phase of the mind quest. The test of sword emperor. Lee Chugang. Quest. Canton. Lee Chugang has doubts about your ability. To inherit the title of war god. And as decided to test you. Quest reward. Swiss Stanley. Chugin's assault for 30 seconds. To receive a golden chest. Swiss stand for. Uno mini. To receive a dark gold. Swiss stand for. Cinco minutes. To receive uno skill from sword emperor. Lee. Chugang. With stand for. 10 minutes. To gain the recognition of sword emperor. Lee Chugang. 2,000 reputation. Points. 2,000 free attribute points. Reward of uno legendary chest. And qualification for the tier. Fast of the mind quest. The rewards for the quest. Were quite generous. Nearly enduring for uno minute gold. Gilt the minimum reward. And Saochens goar. Was of course. To obtain the highest reward. But. 10 minutes. Should not be a big problem. Right? Saochun pander. Silently for a moment. The rewards for quests are often linked to their difficulty. Since the second phase of this mind quest. Required him to withstand Lee Chugang's moves rather than defeat him. It indirectly indicated that Lee. Chugang's strengths far exceeded his own. However. Thinking about it. This is also normal. As I. Ranking authority in the entire human NPC faction. And holding the title of sword emperor. His strengths is. Undoubtedly formidable. Moreover. He is also a general of the human empire. A position. Typically. And through hard fought battles. It is unlikely for an ordinary NPC to reach such a chance. Although we don't know what level it's in. And he's based on my strengths. And he's the mid-datevenal. L. V. 120 epic boss would be qualified to achieve the final victory. So there's only two billion and seven prizes. Saocheng was quite confident in him. The summer is in a place. Since a quest can be. Trigger. It indicates that it is not completely unsorvable. If he cannot complete this task at this stage. Then no one else would be qualified to receive the rewards. Except this task. In the generals. Mansion. Training ground. As one of the influential figures in the empire. The generals mansion. Actuals. A place a vast area. And the space designated for NPCs. To practice and sparsies. Naturally considerable. Looking around. On the 2,000 square meters of open ground. Li. Chang'an and Saocheng stood in the center. While a group of about a dozen soldiers. Like NPCs. What from the periphery. Anabel to se presteil whispers. Who is this young man? How dare es parwis de general? Looking at his age. Esemst obby under 20. At such a young age. He really doubt the can. We stand any of the general's moods. He feel the same way. No matter how outstanding his talent. Is his age is a factor. His strengths and combat experience are simply insufficient in front. Of the general. By the way. This guy seems to be the most famous among the recent group of immortals. So is an immortal? That makes sense. The characteristic of being ungin and indestructible makes him. Fearless. NPCs grow upon this continent. Psecing teeran joys and sorrows. And the llave. Curiosity to. Players treat NPCs as mere tools. But do. NPCs no view. Players with a different perspective. Do NPCs. Players make be a kind of wonder of the continent. A. Special kind of bears. However. Currently. NPCs generally is cof at the strengths of the. Immortals. Especially to se within the imperial city. Now. Seeing a well known immortal. Actually. Sparring with the renowned sword emperor is truly reckless. A group of NPC soldiers even doubted whether. Houching cold withstand a single move from the air general. After all. The name of sword emperor Li. Chung gone is among the top experts in dentire empire. While the opponent is an unimorte. Relying on the characteristic of being ungin and indestructible. No one knows how strong he is. The only certainty is that he is definitely far inferior to the general. On the training. Ground. Li Chung gone picked a plan three foot long sword. Catcherly performed a flourish. And look. Seriously at sao chun. Young man. It's not that he don't believe in your talent. But the current situation. Settens the safety of dentire continent. So he must be cautious. Only by passing my test. Will he consider you qualified to participate? Otherwise. You will need more time to grow. Before he can join. Sao chun's expression was alemassen added slightly. Generally. No need to. Say more. He understand completely. Let the test begin. He am hundreds of years. Older than you. So he will let you have a three moves first. Li Chung gone added. Alto gaintendi. To test sao chun. Given his status. It would be somewhat unfair to take the initiative. So he prepared to let sao. Chen have. Three moves first as his words fell a system prompt appeared system prompt.

Sao chun's expression gradually became serious. Currently. Lichugan. Is the strongest NPC. As encountered in the original. We both attack and defense capabilities that are. Incredibly formidable. Whether it can last 10 minutes under his hands. Sao chun began to doubt. For the first time. At this rate. A good zone trigger. The demon god's protection. And when they fail. Disappears. That would inevitably follow. The gap is too large. How cold possibly. Last 10 minutes. Sao chun blanked at the time. And realized that barely 15 seconds. Pass. Weasley chugang strength. His attack speed must be much faster than mine. To have only performed 15. Normal attack in this long time. Is already. Showing mercy. Sao chun took a dead breath. He's outs. Racing.

skills from lichugan truly invigorated him the boitsas is merely a powerful small area damage skill sao chen does not lack damage skills it can only be considered an addition good to a b bad not essentially the bone pierce is a decent buff type skill which is quite a considerable damage output if it be rente for the finale bad slash sao chen would definitely choose it however in the face of a bad slash the bad effect of bone pierce palcing can parecen a 1 second invincibility buff with a nocho second cooldown it can be used freely in any action makin it incredibly flexible previously when

immortals like this to sell astrie attacks really started me yeah if it were me instead of the general he definitely bold and the abbe enable to handle it so terrifying not only do they have the characteristic of being immortal but even after standing serious injuries their combat powers not affected at all if we had a lot of immortals in our army 10 dangerous missions would be much easier to handle the soldiers watching from a distance also with expressions of so in a situation where his body was almost cut in our south chain still maintain immense combat strengths completely unaffected by his injuries npcs had never seen such a situation it was already so king and oh and when sao chen was subsequently met with li chung gong's all techniques not a single part of him was enslave yet a demand full of vitality the last three attacks unleashed let them unable to imagine speed listen so now that li chung gong had stopped everyone couldn't help but whisper among themselves after witnessing these series of changes in sao chen no one doubted his terrifying strength as an immortal anymore instead they talked of something deeper although it is currently a team of peace conflicts between various races are still inevitable and in dangerous moments the lives of soldiers cannot be guaranteed but if we recruit immortals like sao chen handing dangerous missions to them would surely make things much safer right no one would want to miss out on having an immortal with such characteristics for a moment the gases directed at sao chen were filled with intense in sucesive what everyone could think of general li chung gong naturally understood even more kyan ji acknowledge that you have the qualifications to participate in national affairs li chung gong's face so with undisgusted admiration but have you considered serving in our imperial army the benefits in my tiger bank camp are quite good system prompt you have triggered the hidden quest recruitment of the empire quest content you have passed the test of soul emperor li chengon and your performance during the test of mother li chengon appreciate you talent and wish to recruit you into the tiger bank camp as a centurion detail explanation after entering the tiger camp you will have the qualification to purchase imperial strategy materials and your status within the empire will rise again however from now on you will be under the command of the imperial army and cannot leave the tiger camp at will would you like to join sao chen immediately clicked no without hesitation are you kidding joining the npc faction is fine but being restricted in movement is not acceptable if it's not acceptable if it's not in the tiger camp all the time how can i enjoy the fan of fighting but is how can i develop his skill so there is no need to think about it just rejected to try thank you general li for the invitation but i'm used to being a free spirit and i don't think he can adapt to the strict rules of the army let's not bring this up again for now all right i'm not the tact to force others but if you change your mind in the future feel free to find me let you can shook his head and didn't continue the conversation at 10 fulfill his promise and issued the third ring of the main quest to sao chen system notification you have triggered the third ring of the main quest explore the reality of the demon faction quest content disorderly to gain a send you to the demon territory to gather information on the 108 demon lords and 8 dates of the demon race you only need to learn their status quest duration 180 days quest rewards calculated based on quest progress minimum legendary chest x1 maximum musical chest x1 the third ring quest is triggered this quest is actually a mystery exploration time sao chen felt a bit over when as a player and naturally basnt a fright of any demon lords or demon dates however we saw many tarjetas it was easy to imagine that for the next several months a good habit to stay in the demon territory the third ring of the main quest was destined to be a long-term task so sao chen temporarily set it is a deciding to the always it later it envied farewell to lichugan and let the general residence along the way a few friends sent messages in wearing about the main quest information seemingly wanting to sare and the rewards so kind of the main after all it was already so strong that no players called come a closet or surpassing man sharing benefits with friends was nice unfortunately the main quest was still a solo task up to this point and the cold only proceed along it was likely that only after a large scale battle between the human and demon race is good many players viable to participate but that was a long way of so there was no need to think about it for now the main quest is taken there is nothing else to do in the imperial city why not challenge the dark tower sao chen pandered for a moment and turned to look for the location of the dark tower don't be fooled by a general is lack of respect for him that was because he'll each hug himself held a transcended status in the empire with a reputation that surpassed admiration however in front of ordinary npc sao chen still had a lot of face it didn't take long for him to find the location of the dark tower the dark tower is located in the south eastern area of the imperial city and is a multi-plared ungeon the dark tower looks an remarkable appearing to be used an ancient single story building with two equal level npc's station that the entrance sao chune pro out to inquire and learn some information used as the old man way books yace the dark tower has a total of 300 floors they get the floor you challenge starting from the the first the stronger the monsters within that floors tower only players who are a level 50 and the above and above undergone tail second class shine chare qualified to challenge it however ordinary players need to pay an entrance fee of 1.000 gold coins to challenge the tower but sao chun with the recommendation from the old man way bookie was exempt from this fee additionally troc the npc's recommendation sao chun received a 5% damage in creation but which was better than nothing the dark tower is a 4% dunggeon and challenging it's solo increases the difficulty quite a bit sao chun from it slightly a person is definitely different from 4 people even if sao chun's combat power far exceeds that of ordinary players still lacks the buffs from other professions and cannot fully unleash his abilities when fast in gig level basis for example during the previous trial against le chun one having a strong healing profession would have a mad things much simpler a team with a tank heal a dps and support profession significantly increases overall combat power if we call gather a four person team we call definitely reach eager levels and mad even clarity moango earning music level rewards unfortunately ah this stage players levels and attributes are a tough are apart and in the short term they don't even qualify to enter the main city sao chun sai the few people like hun's run brother gun si and feng king wu under his training belong to the top tier but it will take at least a mountain all for them to reach level 50 and complete their second class change qualifying them to enter the imperial city if this a few are like this other players are even less likely to succeed forget it the dark tower can only be challenged once a week ye ye used test the waters first sao chun made up his mind and so with the entry qualification certificate given by yui buji to the two tower guarding npcs 10 with a flash of his body he entered the dark tower shortly after sao chun entered the dark tower the two npcs appeared outside the tower all the way the one who used went in is the young immortal you have a jurayon e dar esto challenge alone you don't know how strong he is ba eduentes invariably one of the npcs a female magia around 30 looked at the old man beside her with a playful expression the lean old man being questioned was none other than way buji he had received the news and rushed over immediately but the dint aspect to be followed by yatale siau siau siau you remistaken besides kyan ji which other immortals the kule fk 120 the imperial city so i had no choice about the challenge alone mm i don't care about that you used tinkes not as good as me the female magia befer to a siau siau siau scoff this damn felii i think you're still holding a great becausse idinte recommend you for the last spot to challenge the da tower back then way buji said with a smile siau siau's expression became a nachere in a verse that you used tink your judgment is top or to choose an immortal and admit that the immortal group has good potential but betting on them now is a bit too early eh you might not know but you's now a past the trial of sword emperor li chung won right way buji smiled frankly what a past the trial of the sword emperor siau siau was taken aback slightly thus how is that possible that guy sword emperor li chung won holds a transcended status in the minds of npcs his judgment is beyond doubt siau siau had been brooding over the fact that way buji did not give a her the last recommendation to challenge the dark tower years ago believing that there is in the triscentesimo floor had not been cleared for decades west the lack of a clearest blessing 5% the magic creates above a pan hearing that way buji had given the spot to an immortal she immediately felt dissatisfied her master and way buji are alike brothers so she didn't tell ba and expressed her opinions directly she had rushed over a pan hearing the news ready tomo way buji's judgment fiercely but unexpectedly sword emperor li chung won recognize the strengths of this immortal siau siau greeted her tears this guy really as the lack of a dog you don't believe that at this stage in front of the dark tower it can rus up more than a hundred floors in one go inside the dark tower sauchen was anywhere that to npcs outside the world watching him like a dunggion teleportation a pastro garrino flight and was transported to the first floor of the dark tower after a three second countdown for preparation alv-50 golden boss appeared with a first momentum charging towards sauchen boss sauchen

attribute points with the trigesima level yielding 300 points and obsidian providing 3 materials per level first clear reward doubling every 10 levels sao chen added silently feeling quite satisfied although the current rewards were not much the accumulated amount was considerable moreover if discontinued the rewards after reaching a 100 levels would be even more satisfying challenging the dark tower at a gradual process from the first level to the 99 level although the levels became increasingly and the number of monsters per level gradually increased overall they were all lv 100 or below golden bases for sao chen there was absolutely no difficulty it was a smooth journey sound and it was a smooth journey the boss at the centesima level is at lv 70 dark gold boss sao chen curled his lips dark gold boss equally insignificant watermonde by indance max minus 600 000 a casual skill cast and it was instantly kill the boss is instantly kill the boss is in the dark tower do not drop equipment or items and another characteristic is that every team a new level is challenged all skill cooldowns on the challenge her are reset including equipment cooldowns this was both beneficial and disadvantageous for sao chen the benefit was that skills like annihilation slash and world destruction sword called buz without hesitation the downside was that debuffs from the passive skills of

Back and forth. Saochune's disadvantage was particularly obvious. Is this what a musical? Level boss is like? Damn. It's too overpowered. He probably won't take qualified to challenge it until he reached. Level 100 and a back in my class. Saochune couldn't help but see where. Efelta. This challenge was likely at an end. At that moment. A prompt suddenly rang in his ears. System. Notification. You have triggered the hidden quest. Unseal the sword of domination quest content. D. Sword of domination as 4 layers of seals.

Reduce the seal count of the sword of domination by 1 layer. Holy. Gra. Unseal the sword of domination. Saochune's mouth went dry. From the moment. Etan the sword of domination. Saochune was well aware that it only displayed 1 fifth of its. A tributes. While the remaining 4 fifths were sealed. For such a long time. It had been completely in the. Dark about how to unseal it. Even the few epic level bases encountered. Couldn't trigger it. Saochune talked that it would probably be impossible to unseal it in the short term. It didn't expect that the quest. Would only trigger after defeating a musical level boss. Those that may and the sword of domination. Can be upgraded to musical level equipment. After all. It was equipment dropped by a. Musical level boss. Which was very likely. In the primordial. Basis that were first kill. Generally dropped an item or equipment of the same qualities of boss. The final. Demon got off. The LV200 musical boss dropped the highest quality item. Which was the seed epic weapon. The sword of. The menace. At that time. Saochune found it a bit strange. And now it's M7 more. And this level. Therefore. His guess was probably correct. With this talk in mind. Saochune look. At the undead bone dragon. We see your anticipation. The unseal in quest as no deadline. I'll talk the. Musical level boss is terrifying. And we'll have to face it sooner or later. Let me see how far it can go. For now. On the other side. Sing saoch. Enclear level 289 pulgadas. Ombre san esta.

The battle had not lasted long. They. Had entered at a very opportune moment. Just as both cities had begun to clash. Therefore. They witnessed Sao Chang in full firepower. And the undead bone dragon. Under the barrage of his soul. Energies. Rapidly losing air. It was truly astonishing. This kind of output ability. Wow. It's terrifying. If per duisa tanks as gilet o create a good output space. It may. Really be possible to take down the undead bone dragon. This guy is truly incredible. Among all the immortals. I be seen. I will call him the strongest. However. The undead bone dragon strength is not. Something I can solo at this stage. It's all obediently to amap we sue. And fight again next week. Sua. Xiao Xiao's beautiful eye sparkled duisa juni. Light as she murmured to herself. It seems she called si. Herself passing troc de ducentesima nonagesima level of OP. Meanwhile.

It just depends on whether he is willing to wat a bit longer to fight again or te amap we sue. You. In Weibu his view. Xiao Chen's output against the undead bone dragon was not much inferior. His biggest disadvantage was his low defense. The battle had only lasted a minute. If. Given timet to stack up his defense attributes. The outcome could still be uncertain. Having 3 team mats. In the group to attract the hatred of the undead bone dragon while creating a good output spaces in the. A good strategy. In og of that. Is all be coming out soon. Seeing that Xiao Chen was knocked down by. The undead bone dragon's claw during the battle. Sva. Xiao Xiao her it le exited the observation mode. Thinking about how to invite him to te ama. At this point. Her need for Xiao Chen far exceeded his need for her. She had to think carefully about how to extend the invitation. Battle information. You have been killed by.

Attempts will reset next week at the summit time. Trip ramp sounded. The next moment. Xiao Chen's vision blurred. And the west. Teleported to the entrance of the dark tower. Challenging the. Undead bone dragon at this stage is simply impossible. You must quickly improve myself. Xiao Chen. Pandered silently after leveling up. All the stored experience was used up. And now after completing level. 290 of the dark tower. He had gone a total of 310 million experience. Was used 10 million sort of leveling up to LV71. However the effect of. Leveling up was kit insignificance. So Xiao Chen decided to use the experience to enhance his skill levels. All the free attribute points from the first completion have already been spent. So if he want to improve. He can only. Rely on new equipment and skills. At this moment. Xiao Chen's tagpile came into play. Regardless of the golden and dark gold chest. Having more equipment of this quality. West of no use. He had said up a total of 11 legendary. Quality chests. And 4 epic chests. The only piece of equipment. He have issues. Which are a dark gold. There is a legendary. As specials las epic. Quality. So it would be best. If the legendary chest yield skills. And the epic chest yield. Equipment. How chin silently brought for good luck. And decided to open them now. The item 7. From opening chest. In the original. Corresponded to on his level. And profession. So it would definitely. Use the mall. Moreover. Since leveling up. Westlow anyway. He had already decided to use. Up his tagpile at this stage. He used to take the team. Before he became. He was busy. Completing the main storyline. Tasks and continues. And challenging the dark tower. Now. All main storyline tasks. In guild development. To take a back. Sea. The most important thing. Was to kill the undead bone. Dragon. And. Complete the uncealing. Task of the sword. Of the menace. He used to saw Chen. Decided to open the. Chest. He was interrupted. By way. Bugy. And. Sua Xiao Xiao. Visite him. Lord Chenya. Long time. No. See. Oh. It's you. Old way. Xiao Chen. Gritted him. Ever since the task. Was released. In. Chiyue City. Old way. Had disappeared. And. Didn't expect. To run into him. Here. De. To chat. Catch. Actually for a bit. Anten. Weibu. Introduced. The nearby. Mage NPC. Sua Xiao Xiao. To Xiao Chen. This is my useless apprentice. She has also been challenging. The dark tower recently. Lord. Siangya. You can't. Te am up with her. Before Xiao Chen. Cold respond. Weibu. Adi. By the way. Teres. One more thing. Sui Xiao Xiao is preparing. To recommend you. To join the imperial. De vain machine. Can't think about whether you want to join. I had used to climb. The tiger camp. During the day and now. De vain. Machine. Can't. I am really dispopular. Sao Chen talked for a moment. Ready to pelately decline. When the task function triggered as usual. System prompt. You have a trigger. The task join. The divine machine camp. Task content. The divine machine camp. Is one of the most elite special. Forces of the human empire. Manly dispensable. For gathering intelligence. And eliminating. Dangerous creatures in major cities. The divine machine camp benefits. 1. Qual efficacia. Toparches strategic equipment. Apto epic level 2. The right to command. NPC. Soldiers in major cities. Apto 100. Maximum 2 hours per week. 3. Apart from. Important tasks. The divine machine camp. Do not limit your free actions. Do you want to. Join. Epic level equipment. NPC soldier command. Sao Chen says little. The divine machine camp. Was different from the tiger camp. It did very strict free movement. So was there any. Need to hesitate. A decisively click. Yes. It's like a pillow. Where I've been used. When I'm feeling. Sleepy. I wonder how many epic level pieces. There are. And what the prices are. With the. Opportunity to challenge. Level 290. And receiving such good news. Sao Chen called. Nte Helba. Phil Delaiti. He readily accepted. The invitation from. Sua Sao. Sao and Wei Buji. The. Outcome of this challenge. In the dark tower. Not only brought him. Numerous rewards. But more importantly. Allow. Him to gain a preliminary. Understanding of his own strengths. After coming out of. The ultimate demon gods. Temple. The only boss that Sao Chen found. Travels in west. The demon king does. From the Jun Minzon. However. After his second class change. It far surpassed. The demon king. And it was only now. That the final. So clearly. The goal of his ultimate challenge. He can take on. Music level. Basis at level. 10 for now. Baty Cole. Probably challenge epic level. Basis around level. 150 yes for. Basis below epic level. Including legendary ones. Deiger the boss level. The greater the. Challenge. Sao Chen felt that the goal. Probably hand the legendary level. Basis at least. Up to level. 170. And for to see below legendary. Evoling the have. Match travel with sanity. Below level 200. But right now. Basis below epic level. Are a hard topic. My interest. The most important thing is. To clear the tricentésimo. Floor of the dark tower. Sao Chen talked for a moment. And the sidepto follows. With Xiao Xiao. To. The divine machine. Camp first. To see what equipment. Was available for purchase. As part of the faction. Benefits. Meanwhile. Wee Buji. The old man. Adonally. The divine machine. Camp was located on the outskirts. Of the imperial city. And its headquarters. Covered a considerable area. Outside the main gate. Apart from a few. Level NPCs. There were basically. No other personnel. Moving. Above. It looked quite. And the market. The divine machine. Camp holds a special position. In the. Imperial army. Members only gather. When specific orders. Are issued from above. And most of the team. They are a frito. Move about. Explained. Fearing that Sao Chen. Me. Tender estimate. The camp. Since it was his. First visit. By the way. The two friends. He mentioned. Who are a teaming up. To challenge the tower. Are also from the divine. Machine cam. They are a special mission. So they want to be available. Until we clatter. So asao. So. Adi. Sao Chen replied. Nonchalantly. Not long after coming out. Of the dark tower. So asao. Sao directly invited him. To team up. For the next challenge. Of the ducentesimo. Nonagesimo flow. The other two members. Of the team. Were a tankan agile. A league level. NPCS. Sao Chen. Was secretly a bit. Surprised at the team. Teaming up. With players. Was normal. But teaming up. With NPCS. Was a first. For him. The authenticity. Of the original. Was once again. Refreshed in his mind. However. Without much hesitation. He agreed. After all. The rewards. For solo challenges. And for a full 4. Person team challenge. In the dark tower. Were the same. And the attributes. Of the monsters. Both didn't change. So. I didn't mind teaming up. On the contrary. Having a team. Would make the challenge. Of the last 11 floor. So. The dark tower. Much easier for him. It was a win-win situation. Seeing that. Sao Chen. Didn't mind. Suciao. Xiao Chang. The subject. Yelle. Take you to register. And then we can check. With the warehouse manager. To see if there is. Any suitable equipment. For you. Sure. Sao Chen. Nadie. Readily. So. After completing. The enlistment procedures. Sao Chen successfully. Became a centurion. Of the divine. Machine cam. It had no NPCs. To command under him. But a cold recruit. Apto 100 players. In the divine. Machine cam. Players called. By equipment. From the NPC. Official faction. And except. Quest. Basically. No player. Would refuse to join. Whether recruiting. Members from the Hulin. Tiantang guild. Or friendly. Solo players. It was a good choice. For Sao Chen. After walking. We. Suciao. Xiao. For a while. Long hair. They arrived at the entrance. Of an underground warehouse. Suciao. Xiao. Step forward. And chatted. With the NPC. At the gate. For a few moments. 10. In front of Sao Chen. A line of prompts. Appeared at system prompt. The warehouse interface. Of the divine. Machine. Campus open. A box appeared. Before Sao Chen. The warehouse. Was divided. Into four sections. The first. Section. Can tank. Consumables. Like potions. With a variety. Of health and man. Recovery items. As. Well as a considerable number. Of attribute. Enhancing potions. The second section. Was the skill book. Interface. Which included. A wide array.

To purchase it later. The third section. Can tank. Miscellaneous items. And materials. The. Four sections. Was filled with equipment. For various professions. The lowest. Was LV50. Silver quality. And the highest. Was three pieces. Of epic equipment. At LV160. It seemed that epic. Quality equipment. Was not easily stored. In the divine machine. Cam. The quantity. Was already limited. And. Colby taken. By other NPCs. Sao Chen. Steaded himself. Ignoring the low quality. Equipment. And directly. Looked at the three pieces. Of epic gear. A long sword. A ring. And an earring. Only one of them. Is just felt to me. To be honest. Sao Chen felt a bit disappointed. And already at the sword of. Demenation. And intended. Not an epic long sword. The ring. A special quality. Tem.

Deciried juice. and merit rewards after rank advancement as stated in the pdp rules which sao chan was not surprised about without lingering and entered matech macking again the number of low level players was overwhelming just a few seconds later a successfully match with an opponent without a doubt another one-sided battle began today's later after sao chan swiftly defeated a level 36 self-girl the system notification soundy system notification battle victory you have gained 45 merit points system notification your merit points have a huge let it go 30.000 system notification after reaching 60.000 merit points you can advance to the strongest king rank finally reach the master rank it was tasty ugao chan siding relief in use today's at platniarly 6.000 personal matches at first brands silver and gold ranks were manageable there were plenty of players and the cold match we sun opponent every 5 seconds on average however starting from platinum the number of players vegan to decline by the team eric diamond it token average of 1.2 minutes to find the match if it weren't for his continuous victories having not lost a single match it would have been impossible to reach the master ranking use those days now my merit points have a huge let it go 30.000 still 70.000 to go so many points luckily after reaching the master rank each victory grants a full 60 merit points and so near your reach the king rank if it were an average master rank player they bolden tebias fears as sao chan his winning streak allowed him to gana 50% increase in merit points per match which meant 90 points per match 1.5 times that of others reaching the king rank require 60.000 merit points and sao chan only needed 30.000 which he wanted to about 330 victories sao chan incurred himself go for it victory is used around the corner in tc today's the player forum at sterk ita wait pause were flooding in what is the purpose of the great demon king kyanji working hard in the arena the nightmare of pekka players the master with 6.000 consecutive wins how many master players are there in this broken game come out and face your doom currently no player has reached the strongest king rank perhaps it won't be long before a yanji braxtro looking forward to yanji's next server waidan on cement at this stage who is recognized as the number one player in the arts of the players it's not the renowned leaders of the top 10 gills nor the top professional players who dominate multiple online games used as kenny one and they will firmly tell you the answer is only kyanji this universal yek nali number one player whom the vast majority of players yet to support as tb grinding dungg ons challenging gig level maps or competing for first kills on various bases instead as b tirelessly grinding personal pvp matches for two whole days what's going on is there's some benefit that we don't know about regarding south chancy profile actions players couldn't help but discuss it is well known that currently pvp only grants merit points with no other rewards however the true value of merit points has yet to be uncovered therefore apart from the pk maniacs or players who want to own their skills to say willing to spend long hours in the pk arena are are a just a small fraction of dentire player base for the vast majority of players pk is a waste of time now the game is recognized number one player has started climbing the ladder there must be some benefits thus many players eventos who don't know what the specific benefits are a be began to immerse themselves in the ladder pdp arena from a certain perspective so chenas become a parameter in the arts of the players of original whatever it does others want to follow suit and to see who follow believe themselves to be quite clever on one hand they think there must be a reason for south chan's actions the effects of merit are a one-on-to everyone now but that don't mean and they will remain a one-on-in the future on the other hand everyone also wants to chance upon south chan and see if they can establish a connection this is quite common among the master ranks with a 50% win rate the average merit of players in the ladder pvp individual matches steadily increasing however they get the rank the more difficulties for players to pk achote maintaining a win rate of 50% or a benefit of 60% is exceedingly rare only achievable by the very top tier but the top players who need to run down g once complete quests and trade equipment daily how cold they possibly spend all their team in the ladder so three months after the server opened there still has tb in a single strongest king if a few more months pass it's likely that a pk maniac will accungle at 60 000 merit points and reach the first place but now that south chan has arrived it will undoubtedly be the first to reach the king run system prompt you have a match with an opponent the map is randomly set to snowy wall south chan heard the systems prompt and with a flash appeared on the map in the heavy snow a female elf archer appeared not far from him the countdown began for 10 seconds under south chan's strange gas the archer girl put away her main weapon looking as if she was surrendering what are you doing do you think you go easy on you like this south chan called out curiously the earth hills face turned red and she stammered and no it's not that daddy and ya can you give me a friend request so she was asking for a friend request south chan curled his lips so on the 10 seconds pass and without hesitation south chan struck with a single sword killing her instantly as the elf girl wore a look of grievance before a herd demise south chan casually replied friend list is full see you if fat allows don't joke just because you're a girl don't even have a special status in front of me some people are a simps but i saw chan and not in fact there is another reason out of curiosity south chan once added a cute girl as a friend but later regretted it because she discute girl was talking the sending him hundreds of greeting messages a day all basically begging for attention her voice was affected it mad ams so since then unless he really likes a girl and rejects all friend requests the matching team for the master rank is about 3-4 minutes each team not long after south chan matched with a new opponent it was a rugged orc man just as south chan was preparing for battle as a surprising scene unfolded the seemingly tauron orc man suddenly put away his equipment and slowly walk towards him grabbing his hands together south chan was a bit dust this big chest dude also wants to admit as a friend like the cute girls south chan decided to remand silent and he be in a quicken and unfamiliar tauron wants to admit as a friend put south chan resolved to instant kill him as soon as the countdown ending just as a west about to flatly refuse the minotaurs friend request the minotaurs player suddenly introduced in self yabe a golden quality buff skill leveled up to lv3 which can increase might amates 4-dimensional attributes by 10% for 30 seconds with a cold down of 180 seconds at the same time i am also a hidden class with skill intensity and career growth far exceeding that of ordinary class advancements may ask that you can't join the guild you created the sabrin of the world so chan was taken back after hearing this also actually wants to join the guild not used as a friend unfortunately the guild is full and no one has left in recent days so it can take in new members heo chun shook his head again besides you are a from the orc race even if there was a spot you wouldn't be able to join the human race right a new guild with players only coming in and no one going out is hard to imagine what kind of benefits does this guild offer to have such a question even heo chun himself felt surprised after a levant the gold coins no matter how strong it was not everyone would be willing to support him yet it had been a week since the guild was creative and not a single person had left moreover according to hunsran and others no one had broken the rules and incurred the rise of the crowd it truly made the south chance i the 10 000 members in the guild were incredibly honest and as said even if there was a spot in the guild this minotaurs couldn't join currently no the loud cross faction members to join the same guild if it could be done it would set a precedent and saochem bolden tem mind putting the minotaur on the back up list after hearing saochem's words the minotaur player looked invigorate that's okay daddy and ya i'm willing to go cover to the human map and then you can join your guild if you have that ability then you agree saochem was somewhat speechless crossing factions was not something that could be casually accomplished and atracial factions territory was filled with vast level monster maps and ordinary players simply couldn't take crossover without taking damage used like when saochem went to the dreaming mars before the lv80 map was warming with gold slasda gold buses at this stage who besides him called confidently crossovers softly so if the minotaur cold really do it saochem would definitely be willing to take him in ten it's settle i'm heading to the human race right now the minotaur player said excitedly all right if you really make it to yanja town let me know and yeye look out for you saochem didn't mind giving a friend slato such a uniquely minded player after they had the achotter as friends saochem sent him out of the match while the minotaur wore a face full of righteous enthusiasm what a clown making me look like a villain who enjoys killing saochem silently can plan this was just a small episode in his matthewa king and a quickly put it behind the man continued matching daddy yanja let's be friends great god yanja does your guild still need members daddy yanja i'm a hidden class can you in your guild what it's full and no one has left damn this bunch of animals daddy yanja why don't you create a brand guild the top guilds in the original alabe 10 or 8 brand guilds which can attract talent daddy yanja the opponent's a match with gradually began to lose a focus on the battle basically 9 out of 10 players were introducing themselves asking if they could join sabrin of the world or requesting to add him as a friend 10 after saochem decisively refused they also with the hecked expressions and stood there quietly what into the saochem was curious why not struggle a bit at least it would make earning merit points less boring saochem ask a player and the response was quite insightful because daddy can't you your win rate is 100% even if we use all our strengths we bolden test and a chance right saochem was speechless and gave the player a test of being instantly killed after several hours of grinding saochem finally encountered a decent opponent don't get me wrong they were only decent in attitude in terms of strengths they were still no match for saochem this was an assassin from the celestial clan a hidden class with skills that allowed them to move stealthily perfectly refreshed in the fog environment making it hard for saochem to defend himself unfortunately even if heo chin stood still and to set the reflection skill from the demon god shield the cold and the withstand the attack battle information you have activated the zone skill battle information celestial clan assassin 568 uset the skill backstab on you reflected by his zone c at minus 6 1988 battle information celestial clan assassin 568 as died system notification you have defeated your opponent under 90 merit points with several system notifications the celestial clan assassin with the the id 568 where in a look of the pan willingness banished celestial clan city of gods heavenly blue guild headquarters a figure of an assassin slowly appeared out of center the surrounding players immediately gathered around 568 how did it go did you win how far are you from 60 000 merit points can you be the first or rich the top as the strongest king in front of chenji everyone was asking questions a lot of the plan if any celestial clan players were to see this they would surely be astonished because everyone present was a member of the heavenly blue guilds right they am the strongest players of tianza and the heavenly blue guild is recognized as one of the top 10 guilds in the original the leader of the celestial clan at this moment 568 saidan gently shook his head the crotch expressions immediately dim why did kyanji suddenly start grinding the ladder what bad luck exactly 11 568 reaches the top as the the strongest king it can complete that fighter hidden class quest even if it's not for the hidden quest the player who ranks first as the strongest king will get a server why did an 11 men which is a great opportunity for our heavenly blue guild to make a name for itself such a pity it was only a week away from completion i'm not willing to accept this all the players present were well aware that the assassin 568 had received a hidden quest with the completion condition being to become the strongest king although any strongest king rank will sefais being the first to reach the top world guild extra rewards and there would definitely be a system and 11 men which would have a uge positive effect on the heavenly blue guild and the entire celestial clan according to the conventions of online games pvp inevitably has a leaderboard at this stage saw channeled all five major leaderboards and the heavenly blue guild wanted to climb a new one even if it only lasted for three days it would still be a remarkable achievement originally with 568 s 81% win rate and 51 000 merit points a cold have completed it in a week at most but now encountering the freak that is can't be a pesadely sim distant system notification battle victory you have earned 90 merit points system notification your merit points have a key ungelated to 60.060 points system notification you have been promoted to the strongest king rank earning 6 000 merit points and the title pick fighter pick fighter the first player in the server to become the strongest king can't have done this title effect reduces personal skill cooldown by 20% increases output by 20% gains humanoid monsters system notification you have become the first to reach the top as the strongest king the ladder leaderboard is now open do you want to hide your name the master rank matechua king is such a waste of time clearly and more merit points at match yeti talk those days just to level up the master rank is just like this the strongest king is just me alone is that a waste of time watching side deeply it was still over 33 000 away from the requirement of 100 000 merit points but it was difficult to earn more from pvp however once eric the strongest king rank a call participate in the npc arena challenge stronger opponents and then more merit points npc are not as easy to deal with us players there are many equal level npc is that it can't crush if my winning streak is interrupted it would undoubtedly waste a lot of time so i sold us at my stock first south chandeside to challenge the arena later to avoid any accidents a good first open the 11 legendary chests and 4 epic chests on one hand to improve himself and on the other if a god duplicate equipment a good say directly and currently at least than 300 000 gold coins the 200 000 and given to frost as well for the king's sword was already spent and for the team being a call only rely on selling equipment to gather 1.5 million once i gather in oak capital to buy the lv 160 epic eating frost it sold be about a week later just in time to meet a puis sua siaos siaos to team mats to take the ducentesimo nonagésimo floor of the dark tower against the undead bone dragon just thinking about being able to uncialde sword of domination in a week madesau chun extremely excited as for the system notifications it is easily declined the next moment three system notifications rang out server announcement player kianji has advanced to the strongest king ranking the personal ladder competition rewarded with 2 000 reputation points 2 000 free attributes 1 world legend point and the ladder leader board is now open server announcement player kianji has advanced to the strongest king ranking the personal ladder competition rewarded with 2 000 reputation points 2 000 free attributes 1 world legend point and the ladder leader board is now open server announcement player kianji has advanced to the ladder sao chen server announcement was anticipated by countless players therefore when tc3 announcements flooded the screen most players saw the expressions of he knew it would be like this sao chen had proven countless times his terrifying strengths that surpassed top players by many times in the latter it was not weakened it was like a max level god entering a navi's village and drinking havoc simply invincible d players feelings of comfort out what they're so we's nearly 6 000 matches and a 100% win rate securing the announcement was a matter of course no one made any sorry max countless players on the forum or in the city channel guild channel free channel etc plus congratulations to daddy kianji for another server announcement congratulations to the great the monkey kianji for dominating the leader board again congratulations to the great demon kianji for climbing the top spot daddy kianji unifying the original millions bow down four generations the supreme of humanity daddy is mighty the guild channel ruling the world was also basing after sao chen sank them lightly a tournament with anticipation to open the chests d 11 legendary chests don't matter much it would be best to get some skills and for the 4 epic chests yopede algyd equipment and preferably non-duplicate ones sao chen silently pra the chest gold guild equipment and items that match his level and profession currently apart from his shoes being of dark gold quality all his equipment was legendary oreba the sword of the menation the ring of chaos and the shield of the demon god were definitely not going to be replaced the first two were necessities and even talk the shield of the demon god was legendary its equipment level was and the lv70 epic would likely not surpass it so it was also very likely that the bold intent it to change it plus with the earring was about to buy frost there the only parts called change were 6 slots moreover the scarlet helmet comes with a divine skill demon god's protection which allows a ochentu abandoned defense and focus on output even in a defense disadvantage the monkey doce and the lv150 yalong were both defeated thanks to the existence of the among god's protection so it really called the be a part we see the effect of not dying for 20 seconds is just so crucial in sao chen's view it makes even be stronger than an average epic level helmet you hope to get upper armor lower armor gloves shoes and necklace gold bean is too and maybe some skill books sao chen took a dead breath and no longer he said that he opened once legendary treasure chests sao chen close his eyes and click randomly and so on a long chest were open then opened his eyes to take a closer look and was immediately a bit disappointed out of tc 11 legendary chests surprisingly got 2 long swords 1 chill 4 helmets 1 ring 2 necklaces and 1 skill book except for the skill book every single else was actually useless item blood of the gods legendary skill book learning requirement lv70 beginner war got active skill effect sacrifice 10% of your h peto increase your attack speeds as movement speed by by 100% and your attack powers las 4 dimensional attributes by 20% lasting for 5 minutes coldo time 24 hours a powerful buff type skill this was also the fundamental listen sao chen baste to disappointing in a very really valued legendary equipment that match having this skill book is already satisfying sao chen exhaled abreast of staler and decisively learn the skill book the skill of blood of the gods is terrifying the status increase is the match the attack speed is the as good as the unmatched sword dance and the attack power boost is the leader plus the cold on team is quite long and entire day however the five minute duration makes the shortcoming seba suddenly unimportant just imagine when hiao chen's passive state is fully stacked and the active its fury and unmatched sword dance tenuces blood of the gods putting aside the attack power boost hiao chen's attack speed would quadruple dismeans that the attack speed of swinging as all in a normal state would directly turn into four swings skills would be released faster this plus auger role when explosive output is needed and the cost used a mere 10% hp loss which is negligible the skill of divine power is very powerful next it's time to open the epic treasure chests sao chen steadied his mind and clicked four times without hesitation upon closer inspection sao chen's eyes suddenly lit up his a massive stroke of la among the four items there were two pieces of lv70 epic equipment and two skill books and they were all usable for him also sao chen's cold and taken down his excitement and examine the h1 carefully item boots of

love which are equite overpower increases movement speed reflects damage evades physical attacks grants invincibility races hp's astamene cap and asa especial camouflage function h1 as its unique role the enhancement of saochen's overall combat abilities terrifying and the two skill books are equally powerful they get the level of the boss the more defense and damage reduction skills it has when saochen challenges them what does 10% true damage represent for example the output of the sword of annihilation is 120 times the base panel without any buffs saochen can de alniarly 300 million damage 10% is 30 million exactly the total hp of dlv 100 musical boss the undead bone dragon if fully stacked it could even reach 1 billion with 100 million true damage equivalent of the total hp of dlv 200 musical boss the final demon of course a musical boss can not be easily killed by saochen becaus a few days ago so asa saw saw it informed saochen about this musical boss have various life saving skills for instance magic shells and if they are overly powerful saochen 100 million true damage make not even break their shield or they make the best skills that reduce true damage or blood lacking skills like demon gods protection plus they can all themselves basically no musical boss would be one shot kill in this top tier for all china of the world of primal hp attributes etc are use the basics they're incredibly powerful skills are what truly make them difficult to the always however this does not affect saochen's good mood after all the duration of the joelit sword the art is a full 60 seconds the boost of saochen's output is terrifying and while the joelit sword might not match the former's explosive power its stand output is also considerable although it cannot reduce the targets various damage reduction skills ignoring up to 40% of the opponent's dual defenses is already quite good wearing this to epic level pieces of equipment and the two new skills if challenge the undeat bone dragon again he can serve the blest emit his old viable to take down below 30% hp saochen speculated quietly insert this team opening the chest significantly enhance his overall combat

epic bloodmon bluffs legendary boots of swift walking epic fashion shadow claw s class fashion mount little black legendary the overall attribute increase the da significant its mainly the skills from the equipment and maya own skills choo chan silently shook his head al talk the skills from the earth core lower garment and boots of swift walking are a good their level is to all only lv70 so the enhancement to choo chan disntea vs his strengths are served nearly 200-0-0-0 during this team's thanks to the free attribute points rewarded from places like the dark tower in a few days when he get the lv160 epic earrings that's when the panel will see an explosive improvement xiao chen smirke the defensive attributes are manly added by the armor in the equipment slack while the two weapons and three pieces of juelly on the right manly at attack attributes once where's the earth of frost his minimum attack will immediately break through 3 million at the team it will truly be an explosive output epic quality equipment is after all the second tier of the entire game even a lv70 it is an auto-dominated the tier than force positions on the equipment leaderboard second only to xiao chen sort of domination in ring of chaos even the demon got shielded as well pushed back a position the changes on the equipment leaderboard are even more so king to place than xiao chen previous it topping the latter leaderboard damn when did xenia the gray the monkey unknowingly get two pieces of epic equipment this is really bizarre when did epic equipment become so easy to turn and still treat a single silver piece as a trasure how embarrassing by the way have you talked about what xiao chen that has been doing tc days and think about tc two pieces of equipment don't you have any clue are you implying that tc two pieces of epic armor where xx chen do his merit points are you blind xiao chen that's merit points on the latter leaderboard avente chan incredible epic equipment is as common as kavi the players were in an apro the forums in the game world were discussing it in almost every corner meanwhile over at xiao chen site i was thinking about getting rid of the excess legendary equipment he opened once a legendary trasure chest gilding a total of 10 pieces of lv70 warrior legendary equipment although golden equipment is rare and highly valuable at this stage xiao chen estimated that selling it now would lead to significant depreciation this is not only because players are financially can strand but also duet to the limited amount of gold that even top tier guilds can gather for instance defending guild where swang out so many to gather 300 000 gold is already quite impressive moreover while the level 70 legendary equipment is in the head overpower players cannot equip it even if they buy it therefore after match contemplation xiao chen decided to abandon this plan let's store these items for now if we auction them we can use take them from the

sets 1 6 million gold sold be no problem but selling to whom is the selling let's prioritize around people first saochen opened a private chat with suangaux and sent her the attributed illustrations of tc5 legendary pieces of equipment take a look how many can you take suangaux was currently grinding and a pan seeing saochen's private message she heard itly stop her actions and look closely at first glance she couldn't take help but draw the dianji can can he have the mall on credit what kind of dream are you having in it goal or like then he won that necklace a flat price of 300 000 gold can you give me a few days to gather it suangaux greeted her this unstated her bottom line this five pieces of equipment at bay in the guild warehouse of sulintian tank for kites ometime and even this ally of hers nut a tributes she originally talked that dianja would kept them for guild benefits but unexpectedly i wanted to sell them all talks she didn't know the reason suangaux was at long been rolling over this five pieces of equipment and couldn't help but start bidding in fact suangaux was only at 50.000 golden hair pocket together 300 000 she would have to find a way to get it from the members of the fongmingyil once the 300 000 west mansion suangaux was able to tighten her bell but for a legendary necklace it was awarded moreover daddy can just keep her needs before selling mother suangaux was very touch this side told on the west nothing bad there were feelings now on the other side so indeed the gc ted match and agree all i use 300 000 gold you can get it to me within five days right 300 000 gold bebe if left out there so be about right so chenfeld suangaux was sincerity no problem suangaux was quickly agreed and curious as kee daddy and ya how much gold do you need within 500 000 you can think of a way as the president of one of the top 10 guilds suangaux had many friends and even if it was borrowing she could get a considerable amount in a sort time however she didn't expect sao chen's next sentence to scare her you need 1.6 million what suangaux had out it her ears 1.6 million gold gold gold wipe out the entire treasury of five fengming guilds daddy and ya are you joking so chen scratched his head i'm that bored and no talk i'm going to say the equipment what a minute after confirming that sao chen we series suangaux was a selling equipment sold bill a two professionals and no a very powerful merchant player can i call her oberto discuss sao chen was taken back for a moment but not it nonchalantly sure since suangaux was this intention and didn't mind meeting the socajet powerful merchant players she mentioned who knows what surprises it could bring him pinks s felt that her lack had been exceptionally good this past few days no only did she receive several basic antidote potion blueprints which were essential for dungeons but also a dark gold quality skill book with this items she was confident that she called delivered the reputation of the auction house she established to the top tier among the human race reputation equals beal pinks s felt that the team to get rich was approaching just as ping dooduo was preparing to flex her muscles and plan a grand auction event her friend swangaux was sadden private message almost made her scream with excitement wow the overlord of original daddy yanja is going to sell equipment alfan or later ping si si era ive dat yanja town daddy yanja this is the merchant it told you about swangaux introduced to sao chen upon hearing this sao chen immediately turned to lu in front of hers to the mature woman around 30 years old dressed in a chape donned with dark golden patterns she wore no equipment and looked like an ordinary secondary profession player hello daddy yanja ive heard so much about you ping si si said with a flattering smile just call me yanja sao chen was pitless for a moment this woman was much older than him and they certainly didn't want to be called her father i'll talk sao chen at countless sons and daughters in the original to se juderto calling that were mostly young ladies and gentlemen this was the first time of us a woman in her años 30 being called the dimad in feeling comfortable alo ver if it beren te for swangas usake emi tabe just left with a cold face all right great god sin you ping si si quickly adapted e her from so sue that you have four sets of equipment ready for auction or star auction house is willing to relieve your worries ping si si was a businessman with a keen sense of smell she noticed that a simple greeting had already made the other party feel somewhat dissatisfied so she got struck to the point if you hand over the equipment to us or auction house will not only charge no handling fees but also guarantee that you won't have to worry used what for the world to arrive sao chen generally had a good impression of decisive merchants like hair and the felt a bit more comfortable as for the handling fee it don't like that you used charge 5% of the official transaction price but you have one request what request no later than 5 days say the mall is that okay 5 days is too sore can you extend it a few more days ping cc get it for a moment and add it if we have 10 days you can guarantee that tc 4 sets will say for atleas 2.1 million gold as a businessman pinks s was well aware of market prices although golden quality equipment was rare at this stage it didn't affect her giant legendary equipment paired with dark gold what does that mean it meant that whoever ultimately got their hands on one of tc 4 sets would sort on ux instantly becoming one of the top players second only to the great demon king chen j no one could remain indifferent to the especially to set up guilds who would spare no effort to find a way to buy a set suddenly two words popped into pinks is his mind god maki she talked that if she called wds days for promotion allowing the powerful bigs chats to gather money and holding the auction after were good surely gild an incredible price unfortunately sawing shook his head rejecting her repose at most 5 days it's fine to earn a little less you don't care oh like the corner of pinks is his mouse twitch slightly she suddenly remembered that legendary equipment was unattainable for 99.99% of players in the entire server but this man before her her call left and it was hardly any effort for him a little more or less probably didn't matter how enviable she had to build a good relationship pinks is steady herself and smile the promise he made earlier about no handling fees was not just a formality having you consume your equipment at our star auction house is the greatest benefit for us if you are satisfied this time is sincerely opedat if you have more equipment to auction in the future you will choose our star auction house again in pinks is his view securing this the aluysianya was the most important thing guabbing the 5% handling fee was panfell but she believed a successful business person must have a long-term vision that 5% handling fee was at most just over 100 000 gold rather than taking it it was better to use it to build a good relationship with the other party which would bring more benefits moreover after this auction they're on star auction house instantly lipped to become the most renowned player auction house it is conservatively estimated that 50% of human players will choose to trade equipment and items at their auction house as that is where the real profits lie regarding the request from pin cc saw chen had no objections all right it settled 10 take these pieces of equipment pin cc was a merchant introduced by iswang auxwe and saw chen had no doubts about her integrity a traded 4 sets of equipment to pin cc gab her a

had already instructed their members to go out and farm gold tiani city by whom city hooks in city all the major forces in the 20 main cities of the human race vegan tomo ve lies each leveling area in the wild west occupied by the seguid members we've ever players called bisin they were all working hard to grain for gold and on south chains side eva's the wasting team either purchasing dlv 160 epic eating frost air required 100 000 merit points and the west still sort about 34 000 so in the day to save up quickly south and team that we see the sisters lucius ran and lucius flower along with the little fairy and eternal milk to take turns participating in team matches unfortunately the number of players in the original choosing solo matches during pvp was far greater than to see up team for 4v4 team matches this let the south chains team consuming much more team in pvp than in solo matches just the south chains let everyone focusing on the team matches a dish harmonious atmosphere emergent within the guild for the first team why is the president like this is it feels uncomfortable to be meto how can i go back on his word and say the equipment that's clearly in the warehouse this where originally or give members equipment used like that they regani also feel a bit upset the glorious image of president in maya atas collapsed you bunch of idiots used chat up with your disgusting comments one after an other similar messages flooded the guild channel at all they had just appeared and were met with the battles and insults from others they demand very active here on chun you chuelly didn't pay attention to this but after the promotion on pindodo lasted a whole day they finally understood the situation thanks to lucius rance reminder a look truck the messages feeling a bit does antena surge of anger rose within him the situation was quite simple there is and was that after he had originally placed this five legendary pieces of equipment in the warehouse some members had already regarded them as theirs as for the guild point requirements been to it to afford for now that was not a problem as long as the equipment was still there they believed they would eventually get it but unexpectedly due to saocheng's are in move this a pieces of equipment would be put up for auction in a few days this caused a smart group of members to start feeling dissatisfied with the star auction house promoting vigorously and players in the game paying attention this dissatisfaction gradually grew and was no longer hidden in terriards but began to be expressed thus they occasionally invented negative energy in the guild channel steering depot seeing that saocheng didn't intervene immediately talk steering depot become a bolder gradually the guild channel was in an approach most players are actually neutral they stay where the benefits are plentiful they are not fanceters but rather players who lack their own opinions a few words of provocation can easily shift their mindset only a small portion about one fee remains loyal to saochun this a neutral player sabe become somewhat lost in the rhythm of the game gradually they began to lean towards the dissatisfied group this cannot be allowed to continue remember that the legendary boss and the monster seed was all defeated by me right am i mistaken didn't they single handedly defeat tc5 legendary basis to obtain this legendary equipment no i'm not mistaken some people seriously lack self-awareness saochun used his authority to set the guild channel so that only a cold speak al 10 000 members of the guild listen quietly to him as soon as starters pekin the rhythm driven players began to feel anxious unfortunately due to the authority issue they couldn't even admit their mistakes saochun continued to speak not to mention this five pieces of legendary equipment even the more than a thousand pieces of gold and dark gold equipment in the warehouse were alerted by me alone doing it to consult you on how to distribute the equipment yet done still not satisfied what are you trying to teach me how to do my how the more powerful members of the guild had the opportunity to obtain work equipment but after getting it they mostly kept it for themselves or sold it with very few storing it in the guild warehouse as a chance words fell the emotions of the guild members became even more perent to see whether it is a hidden wisdom began to celebrate the indecisive neutral party started to awaken the greeting to change of the meanwhile the small group data initially stirred the pot was completely panic because everyone understood from saochun's words that this matter would not be resolved with just a few sentences the smart ones realized that this was a great opportunity to establish authority all alone due to saochun's overwhelming combat power and the guild's enviable benefits the members had never caused any trouble and the guild had been harmonious however to the wise this seemed very unstable a qualified guild must have a commanding voice to ensure that everyone is convinced at critical moments and the guild leader is the best candidate now to support saithid instigators had successfully caught the leaders attention and the clever members began to anticipate what will happen next heo chen did not disappoint them well finally took action edit so without mercy some people like to call me father so let me exercise a father's authority disobedient children often haven't even properly disciplined remember what i am willing to give you is your opportunity to take if you are unwilling don't have think about it after saochun finished speaking and immediately began to kick players out guild history player sky was kicked out of the guild by the guild leader kyan ji never to be employed again guild history player was kicked out of the guild by the guild leader kyan ji never to be employed again guild history player was kicked out of the guild by the guild leader kyan ji never to be employed again a series of system notifications appear sao chen kicked out a hundred of the most active players before stopping it was that the west soft heart it was used that his energy was limited and the cold to carefully observe and kick out all the instigators so it treated it as a warning the effect was kittery market the rhythm driven players began to fear becoming the next once to be kicked out players who sawed said been distorted by the instigators also started to panic afraid they would be the next unfortunate ones even if sao chen stopped now no one would relax being kicked out of the guild and never to be employed again was too harsh a punishment for the members considering they had initially come for sao chen's regetation in the vast array of equality equipment in the guild warehouse changing to another guild even if it's one of the top ten would still be far inferior in terms of benefits compared to hun lintian tan therefore the members quadrigan their senses felt quite regretful this incident ends here he do not wish for anything similar to happen again sao chen spoke again now he announced three things first the guild will have a huns ran an eternal be milka's vice presidents with little fairy the brother brother gongsi maco and huns flower as officials all of whom have the right to kick members second the guild's warehouse will never lack the equality equipment you need so it's the sure third any player who have done a hidden don't john ki can prohibit the message the management if you can't handle it come find me after sign this sao chen lifted the spec in restrictions in the guild channel and tossed on cpc so lv70 legendary equipment into the guild warehouse

third command was sao chen's way of wanting to secure more fears clear soft dungeons to gain the tribute point rewards al tog the rewards from lower level dungeons berente match even as mal mosquito

don't notice you want to have a easy the guild channel began to flat with prices for sao chen la es no flag is falling endlessly in the eyes of the guild members sao chen series of actions was truly gratifying not only did they kick out the troublemakers but they also replenished the guild warehouse the entire atmosphere of the guild became a positive and uplifting again however sao chen's close ads felt a bit anxious daddy chen yeah maybe in vice president it's too sad i'm afraid they wanted to well who's ambience idim looked a bit frustrated eternal be make next to her a the similarly panicked expression cold they really handle being vice presidents be more confident i believe you can do it sao chen in care it don't underestimate me yourselves you be quietly observe your management abilities tc days work hard and you want to be treated unfairly you others too be confident sao chen's appointment of the management the ambas nt are betrary the guild a total of 10 000 members but they had only a few impressions mostly of all friends who was closer to everyone at management potential and among them who's ran an eternal big milk at the best relationships where a pride this is even their actions and clear inter principles making them suitable for the vice president roles in his eyes of course if they found any the religion of duty later evolving the gc to create a size or dismiss them on the other hand everyone felt deeply moved by sao chen's trust they secretly bought a life up to tear the dis expectations four days pass unknowingly during tc4 days sao chen let the guild members to tackle the base level spider cave and secure the first kills of two hidden dungeons before a diving had first into multiple pvp by now and already been promoted to the diamond rank in team competitions the merit points have finally surpassed 100 0 0 0 after completing the goal sao chen quickly withdrew from the latter match letting out a sigh of relief few finally out of the boring pekka the disparity in strengths was enormous and there was no fun in picking with players it was a one hit kills along the way which had long since and no it sao chen therefore edin te won't waste any more time sao chen blank that the leaderboard currently the rankings on the world region ladder leaderboard were first place xiang ji strongest king ranking individual matches 6,591 matches win

de tercerato décimo places 4 were from the hun lintia tangil sao chen nadit silently feeling quite satisfied among the major leaderboards except for the beat leaderboard the huling tian tanga gepaid the most spots in the other five major leaderboards a sense of comfort emerged in sao chen's mind however a quickly came down and turned to live there was still alfanor left until the scheduled auction time and as the owner of the equipment is time and he did to go see the situation on side by the way to witness his fears time becoming a millionaire in the past few days the cindian auction house rented a piece of land in yangji town reportedly as the headquarters which sao chen agred to at 6 y 50 de la tarde sao chen appeared in the number one beat box of the cindian auction house

set of equipment was brought up by the attendance there were only four sets in total and with each set sold the remaining ones decrease by one the players present felt the urgency as the first legendary magie gem set already an owner no one qualified to attend the auction wanted to use via bystander therefore the competition for the second set of equipment was even more intense than for the first ten minutes later the set centered around the lv 36 legendary dagger was bought by the azure blue guild for the estrenamique price of 450 000 gold coins an utter 10 minutes later the third set the lv 36 legendary priest staff set was purchased by the alliance leader of the ascension city guild for 600 000 gold coins at this point only the last set remand in the auction the final item the jagment moment lv 36 legendary small round shield if you randomly interview the eagle-level player and ask which profession is the most important in a dung-g-on-team-day goal undoubtedly answer without hesitation tank profession commonly known as the dung-g-on-team requires output healing and support professions but without a good the difficulty of clearing the dung-g-on can increase by more than 30 percent instantly this is no joke without a stable tetodraw agro the boss hatred can become chaotic and the output professions want to be able to the all damage for even a few seconds while the healing professions want to be able to add how can you clear the dung-g-on like this therefore only with a profession that has stable agro skills and extremely hp and dual defenses can everything be orderly during a boss fight this is true for both 10 man dung-g-ons and large scale 10 000 man dung-g-ons the role of the ther profession is a necessary condition for clearing dung-g-ons and now the last step displayed in the auction house the jagment moment is precisely the small round shield for the ther profession the jagment priest its value is beyond doubt many people present initially am not for the explosive output of the vision the assassin dagger red flash or the holy priest staff ras of the giant elephant instead it was this jagment moment so when the auction staff brought it up the atmosphere in the room instantly richard speak he won't waste any more words i believe everyone understands the value of this small round shield better than it now the auction begins starting prices 300 000 gold coins and the hatch bit must be no less than 10 000 gold coins on stage this is simply an onset the star as soon as the words fell someone instantly stood out we the old man guild of 9 star city will take this small round shield for 500 thousand we choose one statement they are as the starting price by a staggering 200 000 in the deep section slightly turned his head feeling a sense of admiration it realized that this person was catching everyone off guard trying to secure the jagment moment in one go however believe that no one aiming for the jagment moment was a fool it would be too difficult to trick them with such small cleverness sure and now before the old man guilds be the been past three seconds someone else immediately placera be 550 000 600 000 610 000 one by one the leaders of top guilds the welsiest group among the players of work competing fiercely finally when the beat reached the astronomical figure of 800 000 the voices in the room gradually quieted down but before the person called feel happy for a few seconds the people in the big room began to call out their beats the shining stars guild fighting for the world one million gold coins boom everyone was in an apro one million gold coins this was an astronomical figure that no one called have anticipated beyond imagination unbelievable everyone was done the unlockers in the life stream were overly excited and posts on the forum erupted like a hurricane flooding the screen every moment what the hell one million is there's something wrong with my ears oh my god are these big guilds really that rich one million used to buy a set of equipment what a big spend the president of stars shining is fighting the world right from now on you read the second person you admire besides my dad's in ya by the way stars shining is even one of the top 10 guilds in the server how cold they possibly have a million gold coins yeah yeah it can be a false number right you two idiots upstairs go check the game the rankings right whether it's true or not just look at the bell rankings the unlockers seem to have received the revelation and the turn it is attention to the world bell rankings 1 place human days pink sixy 1 y 43 million gold coins 2 place human race sang tianxia 1 y 23 million gold coins 3 place human days tianxin hiao go 1 y 10 million gold coins 4 place human days kianpian swire 1 y 9 million gold coins quinto place human days laochu 960 000 gold coins sexto place human days senior mage 510 000 gold coins the bealt rankings were not like the other five leaderboards where the rankings chan frequently saw indian tecker match about the temporary ranking had already spent most of the gold coins at the time so had long lost the top position now spared by the atmosphere of gold farming across the server everyone wanting to get as are of the auction was gathering tail money with alter me becaused the gold coins from the three sets of equipment sold at not yet been traded to sao chen the first place was pink sisi and the second to force places a la dober one million gold coins in fact the numbers were still increasing the spectacle of the human race left players from other racism found the but to say in the nowhere curious how cold they gather such an astronomical figure of one million gold coins for example sao chen called nte hell but start to wonder because as one of the top 10 guilds the founding guild called nte sques out that match gold from its 500 000 members even if they didn't say the equipment to swang jose she called a most gather 600 000 gold coins which would be impressive how cold tc guilds not at the top tier of the top 10 come a pui so much after carefully observing the rankings for a while sao chen finally realized so they felt they called nte handled it alone and team that with allies starting from the sexto place the gold coins saw the cliff like dra they got between top girls called nte vida large so aside from the top three of pin cc they must have borrowed from their respective allies realizing this sao chen called nte hell but marvel tc3 were really putting in a lot of effort to get the matching equipment for the small round shield they were even willing to bear ugedets however sao chen only said for a moment before becoming happy again because no matter how hard tc3 thought the ultimate beneficiary would be him thinking of this sao chen didn't mind giving the final buyer a little surprise so a privately mess it pin cc the skype price of 1 million scared of the vast majority of participants leaving only sang tiancia tian singhyu gu and pin pin suareto start competing 1 million and 5 1 million and 6 1 million and 10 the tribe began to chase a shotter in the veal rankings and the bidding entered a fever pitch 1 million and 40 at one moment tian singhyu shouted with a fierce expression a a borrowed from every source a cold and now we had no more options left this was his final bian pian sware and santi and she exchanged series logs and consulted with this to see visa y dem five seconds later santi and she made his b 1.450 000 the three of them raised the price and when it reached over 1.300 000 they were increasing it by 10 000 at this moment santi and she added 50 000 pulgadas one go showing his confidence that the west determined to win brother hugh sister sware this prices already exceeded the value of the equipment by too much how about letting it go to me santi and she said with a smile at the entrance of the big box the snfl silent as everyone whacked the trivi shots compete under the gas of the crowd thinking hugh her imans silent for a long time before finally is chucking his head bitterly forget it i jibba a simply couldn't the borrow anymore and thinking hugh had no choice about to admit his inferiority thank you for your understanding brother hugh sang tiansyan added with a smile ten turn to the box of pian pian sware sware have you made your decision we're not familiar don't call me that it's disgusting a cold female voice came out her tone barely cancelling her annoyance a fierce look flashed in sang tiansyas eyes but his smiley man and chan all right then ye ye call you pin pin sware so have you to it over as far as you know your goal coincident is efficient anymore right as on a c finish this pekin santi and she couldn't help but show a confident expression three minutes ago his ranking on the bell leaderboard alongside the tanking hugh and pin pin sware gradually stabilized he had gathered 1 500 000 button and bid 1 4 500 000 this number was used right exceeding pin pin sware by 10 000 and tanking hugh by 30 000. in santiansia's view tc two opponents had already run out of options in this bidding war it was ultimately in santiansia who would win the final victory moreover what made santiansia even happier was that if this set of equipment ended up in his hands the guild created starry sky would instantly gain immense fame even having the potential to rival the top 10 guilds in dentire server be cause a new that this auction had been under the watchful eyes of most players in dentire server from start to finish it could be set to be the focus of billions to win this set of equipment at the highest price was undoubtedly a demonstration of strengths it would showcase the foundation of the starry sky guild to the fullest young tiansia's symptoms and the trend of his guild's rapid development in the future and have also a presser smile however at that moment pian pian sware spoke a 1 500 000 she beat again surpassing gal of santiansia's gold coins how is that possible san tiansia's expression twisted in this belief as a look that the beat leaderboard the first place had already been clam by pian pian sware was a total of 1 500 000 it turned out it wasn't a false beat how cold she passed every boro anotar 50 000 gold coins san tiansia panic this was a winner takes all outcome and the was unwilling to accept it so he racked his brain trying to find a way to to gather anotar 10 000 gold coins to make a newbie but as a west privately messaging people to borrow money the countdown had already began 1 500 000 first time 1 500 000 second time 1 500 000 third time sold the auctioners america me down decisively at the same time with sanctians and willing gas the auction had already come to a close no how cold this happen sanctiansia was left in despair be cause by the end although pmp were at 1 500 000 gold coins and also at 1 500 000 we only a difference of 1 or 2 000 gold coins according to the rule that h beat must be at least 10 000 gold coins whoever first beat 1 500 000 would be the winner if he draws the price to 1 500 000 from the start the final winner would have been him but the tragic reality was that there were no ifs his moment of arrogance wanting to save money had given pmp and where the opportunity to come from being thinking of this sanctiansia regretted it to the core watching pin pin schwarer grass fellie take the stage to trade with pin 11. 11 his gasoline poison filled with an unyielding malice what would is getting the equipment you want to see if you can hold on to it in sanctiansia's view there was only one demon king yang in the game everyone else had their limits no matter how strong he decided to gather an elite team a panic turning finding a way to ambush pin pin schwarer he wanted her to know that some people were not to be three flat ways on the other side after the 4 sets of equipment were sold the unlockers were left to be found the 1 1 500 000 gold coins god am missing things what guild is this pian pian schwarer from he want to follow her around one set of equipment cost 1 500 000 my desire to clean tokyan yes legacy intensify 4 sets totaling 2 900 000 gold coins wow change them had nearly 3 million gold coins used from a few scraps and sadly envy the members of the hun lin tiansia gear every corner of the server buzz with excited discussions this auction exceeded many people's imagination starting at 300 50 000 for asset was already so king ten 45 000 60 000 which made the unlector's trembling with

really happening most players yearn for silver quality equipment priced between 10 to 50 gold coins the contrast was to star no one called remand call in an instant the members of hun lin tiansia guild became the most coveted position in every one's hands meanwhile pian pian pian schwarer's sunny guild also gone some spotlight at the auction venue pian pian schwarer called hardly height her excitement after completing the trade with pian sisi with the small pieces of equipment added to her backpack the 1 500 000 gold coins she advanced technically gathered banished leaving her feelings somewhat complicated initially pian pian schwarer intended to buy the set of abysal orbs simply becauses she was a mage however after discussions within the guild they decided to purchase the judgment priest's settings the used as most wise in the video stoked the management of pm pm schwarer's guild including herself believed that the tank role was the more important training target with this set led by judgment moment her guild's right time called tackle eager difficulty don't get on at that time golden dark gold and even legendary equipment would gradually become available most importantly her younger brother was a judgment priest so she felt as sure to see it for family however even talks she had considered it before a coming pian pian schwarer still felt a bit thus now was it really worth it to spend 1 500 000 gold coins on one legendary and needed are quality pieces of equipment they had to work hard for the next two months to pay of their debts for a moment pian pian schwarer couldn't be sure if this decision was the right one used as she was about to leave pin 11 once again out of her president pin pin schwarer please what mm passing pin pin schwarer's puzzle expression pin 11 once failed slightly before auctioning this set of equipment lord xiangie privately mess it me if this ultimately sells for over 1 400 000 gold coins it will take the buyer for a free run at the highest difficulty level of the lv 40 tower and king dungeon provided the immediate entry requirements and all the loot from the dungeon will only got to him if and it's it pin pin schwarer was momentarily stand as if struck by a pie falling from the sky revealing a complex expression of surprise excitement and disbelief minotaur kingdom geon any difficulty jesu heard it right pin schwarer looked at the lucky person in front of her wiss amusement fully understanding their state when she at first heard the news from the great god senia she toward being utterly astonished she had originally planned to rebuild it before the auction ended to rise her stacks but unexpectedly senia wanted to treat it as an additional surprise as the two converse the crowd that had yet to leave the auction hall suddenly widened their eyes falling into a dead silence silence then tira always so quiet that a pin drop called bigger after alone while someones face turned red and they gasped screaming in disbelief any difficulty for the minotaur king dungeon it can be hearing this right oh my god he demand a review ah dummy why did he let that group of bastards from the right time sweep the auction house last week even if they real decked out in top tier silver gear how can they tackle the first boss of the nightmare level minotaur king dungeon he regretted the whole instantly erupted into chaos tanking joe baan jan tanciat stiff expressions especially the latter who was over when we see gre he's this nearly grinding to dust the entry requirements for the lv40 minotaur king dungeon are to fall one five players of lv40 including lv40 to the cost to enter the dungeon the second point is not difficult but the first point is quite straight currently in the human region leaderboard aside from chenye who is far ahead at lv70 the second places only lv39 however the minotaur king dungeon like the lv30 spider cave as no limit on the number of attempts for any player makinita mainstream dungeon the main place for leveling up a tanning gear and skill books moreover the highest difficulty of the minotaur king dungeon is nightmare level with a probability of legendary level basis appearing this means that for the first kill there will definitely be a play as one piece of lv40 legendary equipment everyone adore waste talk that aside from the guilds and you belong to no other guild would reach nightmare difficulty within three months but now senja promised to almost selflessly lead the team with pn pn schwaer troge how cold sanctiancia not feel jealous at this moment regret and envy flooded his mind silently bout to make pn pn schwaer pay the price if pn pn schwaer knew his thoughts she would surely scope this damn fairly promise was given by the great god sianja if you have the ability go find siamja what do you want from me a cobert who bullies the week as pn ceseribildi sepra is the auction fine elikame toanen the wealthy participants left with buried expressions and sao chans friends code no longer can't enter curiosity master what if pn pn schwaer richie's lv40 before us and chamles lias you to take her troge the nightmare level minotaur kingdom geon bolden the first kill be taken by her the words of the little fairy made everyone around sao chan luca team with curiosity among them the female players like huns rain and frosty snow couldn't help but feel a twinge of jealousy exchanging glances it was simply because pn pn schwaer was a young and beautiful female player and also the president of a major guild cancaring such a woman was something many men would willingly do sao chan was powerful and mysterious with a strong personality generous ruthless to enemies yet caring to his own his charm was an parallel he had lo knowingly captivated frosty snow and the others although they usually call it him daddy happily into the arts to see towards a chan becoming a source of interest if possible they would still prefer to call him usban unfortunately sao chan being so dense seem oblivious to their feelings now suddenly being so nice to a stranger the women felt a sudden sense of crisis this pn pn schwaer mi in the future compete with them for a place by sao chan's eye bler sao chan was unaware of the hidden thoughts of the girls around him and added what he say he will definitely do so if you want to secure the first kill without it being snatched away by where are and here guild here upon reach level 40 sao chan's intention was merely to urge everyone to level up mentioning where casually but to swang a oswe feng king wu lu just ran and the others there was an underlying meaning where so intimate there must be ulterior motives it's confirm the girls exchange glances seeing sparks in each other size and sadly nadie they have to level up to lv 40 before aware of it sao chan was oblivious to the fa that the female players around him or a ingin after receiving the 2 9 million gold coins from a pindu do transaction and instantly tap the belt leaderboard a glance at it bad didn't pay match attention the belt leaderboard was the last prestigious among all the rankings after all gold coins were not like equipment or level rankings where new faces rarely appeared in the top spots the belt leaderboard updated so quickly now we have 100 000 mary points and 1.6 million gold coins meeting the requirements to parches the lv 160 epic eating frosted this feels great sao chan left the group and had its tract to the royal cities the buying machine account to find the warehouse manager to buy equipment in the original eagle bell npcs at long if spans until the pass of life was correspondingly much slower it had been a total of eight days since sao chan last left and the warehouse stock had hardly changed at all the warehouse manager remember sao chan the newly appointed centurion upon learning his purpose the manager curiously scrapped his head how did you gather so much gold and merit in such a zone time i'm un immortal anything is possible the npc didn't know that players receive merit rewards for piking and sao chan didn't know how to explain so i used brass tito under the warehouse managers curious and puzzle gas sao chan completed the exchange for frosted the effects of the lv epic equipment were remarkable after equipping his stats and the remandes change the kyan j

upper limit nearly four and a half million seeing this panel saw chem felt a sense of fear himself it was now more than twice as strong compared to when a child in the dark tower eight days ago new equipment and new skills suddenly elevated his output to a new level with this kind of strength challenging the lv 100 music boss the undeat bonnet dragon sold be no problem right sao chen clenched his fist feeling the abundant power in his body and couldn't help but smile a lv 100 music boss was supposed to be a terrifying existence that only players had completed their class awakening level 100 and equipped with epic gear called challenge one oman however sao chen was confident even at lv 70 in the second transfer stage partly due to the strengths of his own class secondly it was be cause of the hundreds of thousands of free attribute points that found in the final demon god temple coupled with various first kill rewards after his return sao chen's attributes excluding equipment and skill bonuses so now surpassed those of anormal player at lv 150 ore ba in the original it was basically a human shop ba alfan or later at the tower of darkness sao chen met up with sao chen from a distance sao chen's ears and she was momentarily stand you you actually bought the earth of frost why can't you buy it sao chen has kept curiously that's unreasonable sao chen shook her head in disbelief ebay worked hard for nearly 10 years and still couldn't gather an auto exchange for the earth of frost yet you managed to do it in used 8 days oh sao chen's cracked his head was being criticized npc grow brothers were far 20 of players and in the future they would surely be constantly caught up by players as for himself it was used the biggest war hunger among the player community a mixture is that unreasonable meeting him so she also had certainly broadened her horizons there is nothing unreasonable about it you already gradually get to set to say sao chen said nonchalantly is that even human language so asia oxia or it ordi what do you want me to say sao chen counter so asia oxia or old her eyes and shamelessly said since you're so rich why not he be this a of frost or your sister eep dream on it didn't expect you to be such a freeload how's shameless sao chen is done fairly rejected her three times fortunately so asia oxia was used joking and she didn't mind being looked down upon laughing cheerfully after all the stronger sao chen became they get the chances of getting through the 200 and in a tit floor thinking of this so she also said yes curiously you got so many enhancement materials from the tower of darkness why aren't you seeing them it's so she also wanted to be my indeed him sao chen would have almost forgotten after getting the first kill on the 289th floor of the tower of darkness last week he had that nearly 60 000 obsidian which was quietly lying in the corner of his backpack the original currently had no information regarding enhancements so sao chen had never talked about it now that the tower of darkness rewarded obsidian materials there must be a way to enhance sao chen couldn't help but feel a bit excited anyone who has played an online game knows that enhancing equipment greatly boosts a character's performance to a certain extent it could even double triple or quadruple attributes for example sao chen's epic mind weapon the sword of the menace it already had a base physical panel of 300 000 if there were enhancement effects bold and date become 600 000 or 900 000 with this talk sao chen looked at suciao xiao i'm not familiar with the imperial city do you know where to enhance equipment take me there follow me suciao xiao was a bit speechless at sao chen's carelessness but said nothing more and directly led the way the enhancement location was not far from the tower of darkness before long that we're right in front of a massive iron block this iron block is about this is a of a two-story small building displayed on the game system map as an equipment enhance it glimmers with a silver xenon alcides and the area of small black holes at its base numbering around 70 or 80 this is a divine artifact gifted to us humans by the god of forging from the celestial clan 3 000 years ago as long as you invest gold coins and materials according to the enhancement requirements along with the equipment you wish to enhance you can start the enhancement suciao xiao explain note that for the first three enhancements of each piece of equipment there will be no failures starting from the third enhancement there is a certain chance of failure and no materials will be return the palm failure the eager the enhancement level the greater the chance of failure between the third and tense enhancements failure will result in a waste of materials and gold coins and there is a chance of reducing the effects of previous enhancements however starting from the tense enhancement if it falls it could lead to the equipment breaking suciao xiao quickly introduced this and as if recalling something she said with lingering fear yonce so we smile on ice high level mercenary lost his beloved dagger during the tense enhancement it was said that the dagger was the reward for his hard work over decades he still remember his tearful expression it's terrifying enhancing more than 10 times is simply gambling so chenasque curiously is there any item that guarantees safety for enhancements beyond 10 i was planning to prioritize enhancing the sort of demination but if it broke i would probably want to die so i wanted to ask if there were any material similar to equipment protection vouchers in other online games to ensure the safety of pushing equipment beyond plus 10 so asiaoxia auto for a moment instead there is but it's a that the blood of the buying level demon creatures can create a material that yet dark blow adding this material during enhancement will ensure the equipment won't break but it's extremely rare you might know see it for decades i think it's best to stop after 9 enhancements suciaoxia oka in the advice so chen no to get to carry away unless absolutely necessary assaulting the gamblon the chances of success so chen nadie indicating the understood and turn to study the equipment enhance system prompt select the equipment to enhance and deposit the corresponding obsidian and gold coins into the window the enhancement will be completed in one minute the rules are simple just put in the items and it's done so chen is easily top down the sword of the menation system prompt this enhancement of the sword of the menation requires 1.000 obsidian and 50.000 gold coins a pan successful enhancement all attributes will increase by 3% this price is still within an acceptable range let's take a look at the enhancement prices for other equipment chen ten equipped rings a secondary weapon a helmet and so on system prompt this enhancement of the art of frost requires 500 obsidian and 10.000 gold coins a pan successful enhancement all attributes will increase by 3% system prompt this enhancement of the demon god she requires 200 obsidian and 4.000 gold coins a pan successful enhancement all attributes will increase by 3% system from the increase after successful enhancements regardless of the equipment level the first enhancement always increases by 3% it's used that the materials and gold coins required for enhancement vary depending on the quality and level of the equipment enhancing armor doente significantly improve my capabilities but it's cheap enough if you have enough materials you don't mind enhancing some but you still need to prioritize upgrading my main weapon and earrings forget it you put the earrings on the back burner and focus on the sword of the menation first so chen fought for a moment and finally made up his mind even if the armor attributes double it bolden the old ape gains the mid-level boss so it was better to continue boosting his output the output 10 would consider weapons and accessories the difference in base attributes between the lv 160 earrings and the lv 180 main weapon is the significant but now saochun is confident they can take down the undead bone dragon 11e completes the quest the main weapon is expected to evolve from epic to miss equality at that time the attributes of the main weapon will likely far exit to see of the earrings therefore even though the price to enhance the sword of the menation is the highest still decides to go for it system notification this enhancement of the sword of the menation requires 1000 obsidian and 50 000 gold upon successful enhancement all attributes will increase by 3% would you like to enhance after making his decision saochun didn't the gc tetan click yes directly a minute later the enhancement was successful and the suffix plus one appeared on the sword of the menation we saw attributes increasing by 3% the 3% boost was too low and saochun clicked to enhance again without hesitation enhancement successful equipment enhancement level plus 1 attributes increased by another 3% enhancement successful equipment enhancement level plus 1 attributes increased by 4% after 3 enhancements the sword of the menation had a total boost of 10% which was quite good saochun clicked to continue system notification this enhancement of the sword of the menation requires 2000 obsidian and 100 000 gold upon successful enhancement all attributes will increase by 5% there is a 5% chance of failure in enhancement materials will not be returned to the pan failure and equipment attributes will remain and change would you like to enhance eva plus 3 the enhancement boost is starting to get bigger is the just as it as for the failure rate 5% is too low let's enhance how chan click to enhance again it didn't mind the increased material and gold costs after receiving 2 9 million gold from pingoduo the 300 000 gold from selling the legendary necklace to swan aswa adalso b in credit plus already had over 200 000 pulgadas savings even after spending 1 6 million on the earth of frost still had over 1.8 million left a cold still effort the obsidian enhancement successful equipment enhancement level plus 1 attributes increased by 5% enhancement successful equipment enhancement level e autres�� GL-ite I sched plus 8 after reaching plus 8 the total attribute increase was 53% if he wanted to reach plus 9 a gold need 8,000 obsidian and 300,000 gold if successful the tributes would increase by 21% if he fall no materials would be returned and the level called randomly dropped by unto 2 levels so change 70 for a moment steady himself and decided to continue enhancing the attribute increase is too significant and the failure rate 4 plus 9 is 35% if it exceed 50% it's worth taking the gamble as long as it doente break everything else is fine a minute later enhancement successful equipment enhancement level plus 1 attributes increased by 21% also total increase is rich 73% so change felt invigorated and now enhanced it plus 9 system notification this enhancement of the sword of the menace and it wires 10,000 obsidian and 400,000 gold a pan successful enhancement all attributes will increase by 27% note there is a 40% chance of failure in enhancement materials will not be returned the pan failure and enhancement level may randomly drop by unto 3 levels would you like to continue enhancing the golden material cost are rising again but with a 60% success rate let's continue enhancing so change greeted his design click yes again it was the use the lure of the 27% grouting attributes so channel so that slight excessive compulsive disorder effect and comforted belief the percentage of attribute increase based the whole number and not terminate later enhancement successful equipment enhancement level plus 1 attributes increased by 27% this feels great so tune skin ted his eyes feeling as refreshing as if he attack in a big group of ice cold cocaine a scorching day a successfully enhanced the sword of the menace and to plus 10 pulgadas one go without a single failure what luck this was called it be that yabe a hidden like a tribute so tune called it helped but let his imagination run while his fingers it a bit wanting to continue enhancing however a pan seeing the prompt for enhancement to plus 11 a west douse twist cold water system prompt this enhancement of the sword of the menace and it wires 15,000 obsidian and 600,000 gold coins a pan successful enhancement all attributes will increase by 35% note there is a 50% chance of failure and materials will not be refunded the enhancement level will randomly drop by unto 5 levels with an additional 20% chance of the equipment breaking tip adding dark blood can eliminate the possibility of equipment breaking would you like to continue enhancing a total of 50% failure probability so chance mind instantly clear this failure probability is to be losing a level would be panther and if it breaks he would regret it to the core absolutely not gambling so chance lab his eager hands the sword of the menace and was irreplaceable among all his equipment and it was estimated that a cold do say directly up to level 200 without the guarantee of the dark blood material se absolutely could not go for plus 11 moreover he had spent a total of 1.75 million gold coins on 10 enhancements leaving him with less than 100 000 there was no way to continue enhancing to plus 10 is already quite a good with a full 100% increase one must learn to be satisfied so chance silently comforted himself and 10 admire the plus 10 sword of the menace and 10 sword of the menace and plus 10 level lv 180 epic equipment requirement attributes lv 180 strength

equipment in here and 60% attack power that 300,000 with equivalent to 480,000 on the panel during battles with various buff status added it could increase even more very important moreover it seemed that duet to the seal state the sword of the menace and did not increase tributes like strength and stamina as to determine weapons the saocheng speculated that perhaps after uncealing a liar new attributes would appear let's enhance the art of frost as well and spend all the golden materials the enhancement price for the lv 160 epic quality rings was much lower than that of the sword of the menace and saocheng only spent 30,000 gold coins to enhance it to plus 3 however starting from the force enhancement the consumption of materials and gold coins increased accordingly saocheng didn't mind this consumption but perhaps it was be cause it exhausted all his luck enhancing the sword of the menace and the enhancement plus 4 for the earrings actually fall a 5% chance reminding saocheng to keep a low profile continue enhancing saocheng was somewhat speechless but still chose to continue moments later it has the enhancement level of the art of frost plus 5 but his gold coins were a lucida panda at less than 3,000 obsidian lead seeing that finally stop suciao xiao finally spoke out of money for enhancing do you need me to lend you a little system prompt you have triggered a hidden quest suciao xiao's little sauce quest can't suciao xiao has many suitors in the imperial city and she is willing to lend you up to 500,000 gold coins in exchange you will pretend to be suciao xiao's boyfriend and fan of her suitors in the imperial city one year do you accept sao cheng glanced at suciao xiao in silence undescibly chose to refuse what are you thinking a me the first of the unjin so certain money that he need to stuck to this 500,000 gold coins were nothing to sao cheng selling used one piece of a legendary plus dark gold set would be about that much so it held no elure for him suciao xiao was very beautiful but sao cheng was not a psychopath helping suciao xiao fend off her suitors sounded like a hassle and they had no intention of doing something that offered no benefits suciao xiao's face flashed she seemed to see this done in sao cheng size how cold that be they had only met a few times how cold they guess her socks the age of eight level npcse was nothing there were many who had lived for thousands of years suciao xiao's age was not an issue her locks were among the best in the entire imperial city and she was powerful with numerous suitors each of these suitors was extraordinary young talents from various families and suciao xiao called and they just eliminated them it was quite bad when she first met sao cheng she had a little toe if she called a be sao cheng plitento be her boyfriend and the bird the suitors attention bold that be wonderful in suciao xiao's view those elusers were far inferior to sao cheng and posed no realtea moreover sao cheng was an unjin not afraid of being skinned against so used now she had a fleeting talk and talk the opportunity to testing unfortunately sao ing was not full and his eyes seen topes is the power to sitropoplece arts living her in beres sociao xiao cheng the subject if you don't lack money why not continue to strengthen do it's obviously because they don't have no obsidian so ing casually found an excuse to brush her off sociao xiao's face turned red hair gas drifting let's go a one gun siyao tingare probably here let's push the tower sociao xiao had already introduced the author to who will be pushing the tower without chun but the pan meeting she was still a bit sepra is system prompt npc sociao xiao invites you to join the team system prompt you have join the team team information lv 135 legendary archmage sociao xiao lv 133 legendary paladin sociao one lv 120 legendary holy guardian sociao xiao lv 70 legendary junior warlord kiang ji sociao xiao is actually a lv 135 archmage the author to also have legendary titles the legendary status of npc 6 and through hard fought battles distinct their true strengths sociao xiao legendary the italian western by defeating the lv 200 final the mongoda the start of the server recorded in the primordial stone tablet generally speaking the strengths of bases and npcs in primordial so not differ much this is a three man itoclear the 289 floor of the dark tower if it better for the presence of experts their strengths must be formidable however suciao xiao adonc told sociao that the imperial guardians among the npc factions had an unwritten rule not to take juniors through the levels therefore suciao xiao and the others had fought their way up with sheer strengths although they had seen the other person yet it was just a damage dealer not important now the tema agile and the tank with two damage the alerts including sao chen they can figure it easy and was quite recently at this moment suciao xiao introduced a one xiao ting this is the one jimma it told you about hello sao chen talked the initiative to greet them hello misto may you please take care of me the group chatted casually for a bit a sao chen except suon se one and chu ting ting the two of them were also saying in gima so once one was ociao xiao's cousin and his profession was paladin chuting ting was ociao xiao's cousin as well and her profession was holy guardian belonging to the gile plus support that they had long heard of sao chen's reputation it was two months ago when the group of immortals suddenly appeared and someone spread the news that the immortal namet chen jia kill the final demon god causing it to fall into adepes lumber for atleas another 10.000 years before it called a bucket sad news spread like wildfire among the human race celestial beings and elves making it hard not to know however suon se one gansu ting ting tog they had no connection to it and after being shocked for a moment they brushed it is a ii unexpectedly a week ago they sister suciao xiao actually invited him to join her in tackling the ducentésima nonagésima level musical boss i heard that last week is all outroge the ducentésima octogésima novena level in one go his strengths is simply incredible so once one gansu ting ting exchange glances feeling that this team the possibility of clearing the ducentésima nonagésima level was quite a sociao xiao simply instructed once we enter the dark tower it's the same all routine a one will hold the undead bone dragon xiao team will focus on healing a one and it will handle the damage output whiskey and g this team we must clear the ducentésima nonagésima level we have to reach the triscentésima level within a year hearing this suon se one gansu ting ting percta okay big sister you's thinking about the rewards from the royal family after clearing the triscentésima level made them incredibly excited meanwhile sao chen shook his head suciao xiao west a keneva but strong chen ji is there a problem planning to clear 300 levels in a year that's too slow you don't agree with your statement let's clear it today as soon as a finished speaking the three of them were left to from the clear the triscentésima level today that's impossible right so once once shouted in this valley xiang ji big sister said you are very confident but now we think your confidence has turned into arrogance so ting ting retorted seriously the dark tower has been around for 300 years and to se juave cleared it are all of the caliber of generally the sword emperor can you really compare yourself to the sword emperor now exactly be a bit more grounded don't get to carried away so siao xiao also advised helplessly they felt that sao chen's words were far too unrealistic steps must be taken one at a time one cannot am toy sao chen starting differently if you don't believe me there is nothing you can though let's just start fighting among the holders of the title imperial guardian sao chen only knew wei wu he and li chungan as for that old man wei wu he his strengths are probably already started to decline dropping down to around level 80 and the sword emperor li chungan was merely a level 160 epic npc after these days of improvement sao chen felt that if he were to spar with li chungan again it would surely yield a different result in fact emicc tb viable to defeat li chungan so since li chungan called cleary why couldn't he sao chen more importantly after defeating the undead bonnet dragon it would complete the first layer of the task to unseal the sword of domination likely resulting in another significant boosting strengths if it very therefore the desire for the ambas and having promised we xiao xiao a wikago sao chen gul davegan solo after the first successful pass of the dark tower the second advance did not require starting from the first level and slowly working up one cold simply press sweep to directly enter the lattice challenge level which meant directly challenging the ducentesima nonagésima level undead bonnet dragon the previous sweep of the 289 levels granted sauchan 310 million experience and a little over 10 000 obsidian this match experience automatically leveled im apto level 71 sauchan felt that the weekly dark tower challenge was not to be missed it was much faster than simply grinding troc maps required little effort and also yielded obsidian at the top the number of obsidian stones was not asigas during the first clear it was still quite considerable little by little after amont and all e11 again at 60 000 obsidian stones before starting the challenge against the undead bonnet dragon the first applied buffs to enhance his combat state battle information suasi one cast the skill holy

combined they elevate met a new level the players levels are a tall auto-capacus me if you need to format them in the future is all look for tc npcs the strengths of the enhancement buffs was indeniable how chin talked that if a were to participate in faction wars in the future teaming up with npcs would be a great idea on the other side although xiao xiao and the others called not see the specific battle information they called feel that they had become a match stronger they were all teammates very familiar with such other skills so they answer was obvious it was how chung what given them the buffs wow it feels so much stronger it's not just a feeling the energy in my wand is much more abandoned it's about a 30% in creation invasibility plus a continuous hp recovery stay so strong is this what it means to be the first of the immortal so siao siao and the others whispered among themselves they were all experienced the level combatants belong into the upper echelon of the human race this level of power allowed them to clearly censor exchanges in their own abilities none of sauchen skills where the ambas types but ad equipment the aura of the sword of the menace increased the attack power of social siao and the other to by 30% the legendary the monkey necklaces sacrifice aura allowed everyone to recover 0.5% of their hpp second although it was not the match it was permanent in its continuity in the undead bone dragon's arm of the dead the speed at which hp decreased was significantly slow all right let's start fighting the 3 second countdown vegan and the undead bone dragon appeared so chenny minded oh yey go pull the monster the paladin suha once one snap back to reality charging towards the undead bone dragon with a small round shield the others to

and don't stabilize the tank outputs they had always done it this way and it was actually the same when fighting dunge on swiss players however what su siao xiao xiao din ten no was that this arrangement could only be made under normal circumstances suon seguang got out put it to the undead bone dragon for about 5 seconds and used when suasi guang and su ting ting talked the agro at bay stabilized suddenly the undead bone dragon ignored suasi guang and charged directly at sao chen how cold this happened suasi guang west taken about what's going on suasi au xiao and su ting ting were also very confused sao chen looked at the latest prompt battle information de undead bone dragon ascends your curse of the demon god increasing its hatred towards you by 100% is this the curse that

several basic attacks edelt nearly 4 million in output and the undead bone dragons hp sadly lead rap from 98,5% to 83,6% al talk the counter attack from the undead bone dragon deltit damage with the 1,6 second cooldown on the evades la sand de hability to block damage with a shield plus de dede que te healing from bain sao chen's hp was dropping slower than that of the undead bone dragon even when the undead bone dragon unleashed damage continue skills sao chen cold withstand it to sin de equip skills great whirlpool roar and frost nova along with su asi once group's shield at this point sao chen was to all as it to run around and directly started to face off against the undead bone dragon that tried a standoff alv70 player standing to todo with a lv100 music boss this nlfd3 npc is nearby utterly stan what the hell is this guy i can take hits better than i can so as he once shouted in frustration with altes invincibility and blocks i'm supposed to be the toughest class the paladin so as you can see how cold the help but be chuck murmuring what level of output is this in 10 seconds it took down nearly 20% of the undead bone dragon's total hp that's terrifying so tintinadi and healing is so easy it's nothing like before when he was just healing a one which was particularly exhausting he feel completely at his now so see one couldn't take help but can plan this guy is not human sia o ting don't compare me to him when they had previously decided to let sao chen be the main tank everyone had quietly stop attacking to let him output for a while and stabilize the agro but they never expected that just his solo round of output would bring the undead bone dragon's hp down by almost 20% this was totally fine so she also felt she couldn't even keep up and as for the paladin susi one and the holy guardian sutintin they were even escape of output since they were entered a magedyling classist obegin with among the three sutintin being the youngest calling the help but exclaim it feels like a cold solo de undead bone dragon by himself we make as well use be buff tools we sao chen stable output de undead bone dragon's hp continue to decrease meanwhile nothing unexpected happened on his side having teammates makes all the difference it feels great sao chen sai the difference between being solo and in a team was to obe's de undead bone dragon's output was also e but with the 1 second invincibility from evades la sanda 1.6 second cooldown the actual team sao chen tog damage was only 0.6 seconds moreover su tintins healing was ample whenever his hp dropped a bit she called immediately replenish it does even tog de undead bone dragon's skills were impressive it had no wait to deal with sao chen meanwhile suciao xiao and suz yuan were also dealing considerable damage de undead bone dragons hp gradually dropped from 83.5% to 73.5% and after an utter half minute it felt to 40% with various passive skills and buff in play sao chen estimated they have reached the kill 3 sword so immediately unleashed elite sword they are preparing to use lv11 annihilation slash and world ending sword to take it down in one blow used in case something unexpected happen dlv11 annihilation slash skill ada damage multiply of 4.500% of the base panel which meant 45 times the panel damage the world ending sword was a skill that came with the main weapon although it was enhanced by the passive skill of frosted it 120 times output was undoubtedly the highest amount of sao chen's skills plus we sell it sword they are converting 10% of the damage to true damage sao chen was confident that tc2 skills gold the alat leas 15 million hp and damage to de undead bone dragon and since de undead bone dragons total hp was only 30 million 40% of that was used 12 million which was right at the kill 3 score but just a sao chen was about to finish of de undead bone dragon suddenly a massive golden shield appeared around the battle information de undead bone dragons hp has dropped 40% triggering the demon god's blessing status lasting for 15 seconds the undead bone dragon will not take any damage for 15 seconds attack speed increases by 100% and the trickables 2% hp per second not limited by durashen so eno y sao chen's mouse twitch eno data god level boss must have impressive life saving tricks which is why you have to instantaneously kill it on the slime line eustin the spectator still unleash its power the 15 seconds of invincibility based on the big deal sao chen's lv70 epic lower gear came with a 20 seconds invincibility buff plus an utter 20 seconds from the demon god's protection still giving him a uge advantage bat increase 100% attack speed and the 2% hp recovery per second made infill habit and comfort level the former mente bold and the viable to take it easy anymore d later meant that after de undead bone dragons 15 seconds of invincibility and the its hp would recover to 75% thinking of this how chen couldn't help but say fortunately the buff from elites or their still has 45 seconds left and the output is still explosive but the op that besides this demon god's blessing de undead bone dragon don't take any other invincibility skills al toge and they experience the 10% true damage yet sao chen was confident the cold the aleven more furious output making the undead bone dragons hp drop faster moreover the boss ultimate move also at hidden skill cooldowns so it was impossible for it to release this demon god's blessing again in this battle for sao chen as long as it vasntean invincibility buff a cold use the sword of annihilation and the oblivion slasto instantaneously take down over 40% of its hp no problem the situation was still under control meanwhile suzi one seeing this at a gleam in his eyes he directly used a strong town skill forcefully transferring de undead bone dragon's aggro to himself for the team a being cng this guy can't hit right now ye ye ordered it for a bit this is the shining moment of our tank class as on us he finished speaking suzi one activated his precious invincibility skill invincibility against invincibility suzi one advanced having this skill waiting for this moment at that moment he felt like a paladin sao chen opened his mouse he set it for a moment but still see nothing more so si one was the last impact fell off the tree npc se presento sao chen practically dispensable sao chen originally wanted to say that it didn't ten it to do this but seeing so si one's determined expression and so siya o siya o an su tinting looking

great demon king xenia the unknown was what truly instilled fear so a hint of and is still arose that when arguing with the demon race players the confidence inevitably felt a bit lacking but now it's different no one expected the reversal to come so quickly it and even be in 5 minutes it was simply miraculous now aside from a full no human player thinks that the great demon king xenia would lose in a one-on-one again prince vigil the top spot on the equipment leader board returned to the great demon king xenia and the human players felt deeply honored look this is our human race number one

the forums home pad to ensure it bold and the very in contrast to the human players all day demon race and other race players were done found that he's a suspected of the great demon king xenia can't provoke can't provoke he feel embarrassed for prince vigil so tragic the number one for five minutes originally talked it was a signal for the rise of the demon race but unexpectedly capsized in used

Sao Chen an additional 4.000.000 Attack Power when entering a Dungeon. This is terrifying. A. Single Sword nearly supports more than half of Sao Chen's attack panel. Sao Chen himself was about to burst. With excitement. After obtaining the musical level Sword of the Menachem, his output made. Even him feel scared. If he were to fight the Undead Bone Dragon again, Sao Chen bolden te even need to stack. Passive Buffs. A code used to start with one strike of Warden and he'll action sword and instantly kill it. Of course, this is based on the premise that the Undead Bone Dragon does not trigger the Demon God's blessing stay. After the Sword of Domination subgrade, there are still three large of seals. Once he'll are unsealed. And can't even imagine what kind of terrifying attributes it will have. Sao Chen felt a bit and most channel. No wonder it was equipment draped from the final de Mungoda TLV200. It was truly unbelievably strong. This all called this elibiused until graduation. However, while Sao Chen was real, he felt a bit regretful that the task to unseal the third layer had not been trigger. It was predictable that this would be troublesome. The process was also filled with uncertainty. However, the task to unseal the second layer gap Sao Chen some inspiration. Colded be that there is a chance to trigger. It only when facing league level basis. For example, I get level demon God boss. Y. Need to quickly go to the demon territory to have a some fan looking for me if you can level basis to see. If he can continue triggering the unseal in task. By the way, him it as well tackle the main quest. Sao Chen matter to himself a couple of times. Then refocus at his thoughts. For now. He had to clear all the levels of the dark tower and collect all the rewards. The boss on the ducentésimo nonagésimo floor goal. Grant him a music level treasure chest, which called Gild equipment and items that match his level in class. D. Boss is above the ducentésimo nonagésimo. Floor goal definitely also be music level, which left Sao. Chun with some room for imagination. Colded be that for every level clear the goal recebe a music level. Treasure chest? I was so looking for Bartoy. What are you dreaming about? Let's go. Sao Chun greeted the three NPCs. Suciao Xiao and the others. And Harry towards the teleportation array. Iger took clear the levels quickly. At that moment, the three NPCs finally snapped out of tail. So. With one sword, you took down. The undead bonnet dragon? Suciao Xiao doubted whether her eyes were playing tricks on her. But the courts of the undead bonnet dragon lie there, leaving no room for disbelief. So. We used Bristro Vip. Su tintinal so sim das. Is this man really the unjin? The unjin who has only been in the Caritia continent for less than four months? Lo si one. Murmured. I feel like I've wasted over a hundred years of my life. From the perspective of the three. It was clear how terrifying Sao Chen's final strike at BN against the undead bonnet dragon. Toputi. Bluntly. Even if they can buy intel strengths without using invincibility skills, they would have had no chance of. Surviving. Suciao Xiao's original four-person team was already full. But seeing that Sao. Chen was a powerful damage dealer. She reluctantly extended an invitation after Wei Buji's persuasion. She even diste fending a nother old teammate for this. But unexpectedly, what she thought would be a gradual time effort turned into Sao Chen's solo challenge while she and the others cheered and shouted. 666. Lo si one and su tintin shared the same thoughts. It was all. So surreal. After witnessing Sao Chen's explosive output first hand, all three. Couldn't they help but question their lives. Were they really over a hundred years old in a PCS? Why did they suddenly feel like kneeling? Sao Chen wasn't aware of Sua Xiao Xiao and the others. Mindset. Seeing the minadase, a walk his hand again, what are you passing out for? Hurry up and clear the tricentésimo floor so we can go home and sleep. Oh, Sua Xiao Xiao and the others. With blank. Expressions. Stepped into the teleportation array together. When the sword of the menacean was still of happy. Quality. Sao Chen had no trouble dealing with the LV100. Undead bone dragon. E felt that if the music level basis after the ducentésimo nonagésimo primero floor were not much stronger than the undead bone. Dragon. Clearing the level so be no problem. Now that the sword of the menacean had advanced to music. Quality. It was a steady as a mountain. In the next 10 levels. Sua Xiao Xiao and the other.

Why the announcements. Counting. Carefully. Aside from the first three announcements about the Sokallet Dark Tower cleared by the Great Demon King. Chania. The rest were all about musical quality equipment and skills. 11. The irrigante. Can poacher. The players all fell into a state of confusion. When did the highest quality musical equipment.

Thousands or tens of thousands of free attribute points. Too many questions served in the players. E. Arts. Leaving them utterly perplexed. Can players had already noticed that ever since the information. About the dark tower emergent. And yet frequently appeared in the announcements and many musical quality equipment likely came from there. Therefore. This dark tower is the source of it all. How to. Find the dark tower. And use how difficulties to clear the triscentésimo floor. Is what the supplies. Desperately want to know. This topic will remain 11 until the mainstream level lit LV50. And the second class transfer was completed. However. Once the mainstream players found the dark tower. One by one. Termines good crash. Be cause 7 the lowest floor as a LV50 golden. Boss and only a few 4-man teams called challenge such a level of boss at LV50. Under the 27. Notifications flooding the screen. Players close it to Saochun. Such as members of the Hulin. Tiantang and Fongming guilds were excitedly dancing with. Joy. By extender players waiting to. Ice in disbelief. Meanwhile. Another group. Shacked and filled with despair. Were Saochun's enemies. The AOC guilds emper. Or. Potential enemies. The Prince of Byhill. Al top de. AOC guild advanced severely hit by Saochun and dropped out of the top 10 guilds. They still maintained the. Foundation. Expected of an old guild. Undeniably the overlord of Sunbu City. After such. Alontime. They had finally started to recover. However. Saochun's previous sale of equipment. Specifically refusing the AOC guilds participation. Made many realized that the conflict was far. From over. Who knows when they would settle the score again. This led to a wave of anxiety. Among the majority of AOC guild players. Triggering a wave of withdrawals. Now that the notifications. Were flooding in again. This made the AOC guild members. Who initially talked the issue was minor. Wabe once more. In notime. The Emperor received related reports from his subordinates. Greeting his. Tissing anger. Damianja. Why? Doe se abet o goe gains me? After the jealousy. Sebsaid it. A sense of powerlessness suddenly arose. The stronger change be came. The harder it was. For the AOC guild to develop. And the demon clan. The president of the Dark Lord guild prince. By hill. Was even more anxious than the Emperor. Trembling in fear. Bekausé the Emperor was. Already a past enemy of Sao Chen. While he had used issued a provocation. That was known to everyone. Who knows if Sao Chen. Will treat him the same way. He treated the AOC guild. After thinking for a. Moment. By here comforted himself silently. It's not like he had a depth. Seated grave against him. He. Sold. He. Come to the. As for the post. Forget it. He used deleted. He can't worry about. Face or anything right now. By here called never have imagined. That things would develop so. Dramatically. He had used to have done a LV.

stats nearly double during the buff duration this is terrifying after browsing through the lines so the game felt a hint of fear in cell with my current attributes it probably have a few rivals have been among npc factions right perhaps only god level npc humanoids can pose a treat to me after a long while sao chen gradually come his emotions next a plant got to the demon faction to gather information on the movements of the ancient gods initially feeling somewhat uncertain it was now filled with conference the dark tower at been cleared across the server and sao chen at noting else it's to doing the imperial city so i plan to return to the guild to rest before tackling the main quest aside from enhancing the sword of the menace into plus 10 and defrosted to plus 5. the other equipment sold also be enhanced to boost my attributes again i have no materials but the gap in gold is significant i sold 6 some low level legendary equipment there are a total of 116 objectives in the main quest which may and she will be stationed in the demon faction for a long time so in it to take care of the deal now i have 5 aid l lv 77 music level equipment and 3 epi once is all put this in the guild warehouse after thinking for a moment sao chen decided to put all the unused equipment into the guild warehouse of course music level equipment is too powerful and the guild contribution required for each piece is astronomical therefore members would only viable to draw all over them for at least two years however even so it would indirectly enhance the guild's question after all looking across the entire server which guild can boast having music level equipment like theirs who would be willing to leave a pan seeing such a quality equipment in the guild warehouse unless they were out of their minds used as a sao chen was heading to the teleportation array preparing to leave the imperial city suddenly su haciao xiao caught up with him yanja what for me but sao sao chen was taken a back and scratched his head after clearing the dark tower a call directly clan various rewards from the game system while su haciao xiao and the other three npcs at to go to the palace to receive the rewards from the human empire so they are dispersed right after clearing it sao chen to the connection with su haciao xiao was no longer significant but why was she coming to find him now was she issuing a quest sao indecisably start and look at su haciao xiao with curiosity well called you help me out the royal igupe is already know about your clearing of the dark tower and the emperor himself is very curious about such a powerful immortal like you saw as start to pay attention ascent met observe the immortal group so we can travel together okay suciao xiao brief x plan at that moment a panel notification era yidas expecte system notification you have trigger the hidden quest royal observation quest content after sword emperor lichuan inform the human emperor about the revival of the demon factions gods the human emperor decided to do everything possible to enhance the national combat power at this moment your heroic figure code the emperor's attention sparking his curiosity about the immortal player faction leading him to sensuaciao xiao to observe dot task progress total of 10 rings 0s las 10 task reward to be determined based on completion dot giao chen's mouse tweak the task evaluation criteria verente even clearly stated it was truly a strange task however no matter how it was given that it was a task chain sao chen at nor recent to refuse what do you want observe sao chen ask that potential growth rate all i sao chen nadid and invited ibe created the player community one of the strongest among the immortals would you like to stay in my territory the territory was young town which was siaoxia on a cherelinu and the pan hearing this she was instantly delighted that would be perfect she had witnessed senia strength's first hand to be honest at single-handedly taken down most of the music level basis on the last once floors of the dark tower such a master had no need to deceive her the strongest among the immortals that's fantastic but the next moment sao chen's words left her stand it can help you observe ba but she need for me but she need for you since the task didn't specify the exact rewards sao chen had to think of something himself so asiaoxia's goal was to observe the player community how was she supposed to do that she couldn't use the standby and watch right so she definitely needed to find a way to integrate into the group to complete the observation task sao chen believed that his leverage was his ability to rally players which was exactly what su siaoxia on a day according to siani immediate benefits for himself but for the players in yanje town it need be a good opportunity as a guild leader and the lord of yanje town sao chen felt it was his responsibility to help everyone with some benefits in fact it was just a matter of convenience seeing su siaoxia looking confused sao chen chuckle think about it to observe the immortals you definitely need to participate in their daily activities right and it can expansively tell you that one of the characteristics of the immortals is that they want to get up early without benefits they will only maintain great enthusiasm when they see something advantages so think about it what benefits can you offer the immortal community so xiao has a tit for a moment and tentatively say gold sao chen was somewhat speechless gold is one aspect but it's not attractive no it was true that players like gold but sao chen didn't want to squeeze out used a bit of gold from social so what other benefits can you offer you can't just give away weapons and equipment right my stock isn't too much so xiao xiao said irritably full sao chen un ceremonious lit up so xiao xiao on the head making her expression slightly awkward the gesture was so intimate however sao chen didn't think much of it and reminded her besides gold and weapons you have another advantage you have a huge appeal to the immortal magic profession you use a venture realized the what advantage so xiao xiao asked curiously apprenticeship apprenticeship exactly sao chen affirm your profession is a grand sorceress right you can command certain immortals to do things for you and in return you can teach them certain skills even becoming a mentor when they need to advance their profession this was sao chen's wall su xiao xiao was a lv-135 legendary grand sorceress this profession was likely an advanced form of some magic class probably one of the hidden professions if she was willing to take on apprentices in since new town it would be an irresistible traction for the mage members within the guild no only was it a hidden profession but she could also teach relevant skills sparing the new class changers from the arduous task of grinding skill books like at the profession as appeal oh so that's how it is so xiao xiao seem to be depended even conjuring up more characteristics murmuring to herself it's not used me i can also catch me like my cousins i want and my cousins i'm sitting and they can take on apprentice to when they are team and can invite them over to help me moreover so in secondary profession is a master level alchemist do these secondary professionals all great appeal so can immediately not be that right that's right you're absolutely correct so siguan is a paladin and so tintin is a holy protector both holding the same professional status as you see a xiao and a master level alchemist is truly remarking that all talks are chenevers is that some of the potions like red and blue during dungeon lands tc are a hot selling items among ordinary players essential for dungeon rights whether you think tingis creating potions to reward players or teaching potions skills to them it's alquite beneficial besides that i think you should immediately take on a few apprentices and get involved in the daily activities of the immortals so chan suggested the game sure so siao siao agree after thinking for a moment she took out a scroll with so many people he can't teach them all so let's start with used one this is the class change contract scroll for the team and space magi besides you you don't know any other immortals so please help me pick a suitable one oh and it can only be used by image classes the advanced class of the team and space magi is the arch magi and don't say waken they will be a gran arch magi like me so chan talk the scroll nodding in satisfaction all right he promised to pick the one with the most potential for you he was writing his estimation the apprentice so siao xiao wanted to take on what definitely belong to a hidden class the team and space magi was an heard of used by the name it was different from the usual magi's humanitial elements like wind fire and lightning it was a noble profession that dealt with the rules of space and team it's worth mentioning that an image below level 50 regardless of their profession can instantly change classes after using the scroll this meant sao chan didn't have to specifically find a level 10 player to train in the moment they receive the class change scroll and already had a candidate in mind feng king wu although feng king wu was the same guild as him the feng mingill and the whole intention gilded and a shared relationship and were quite close feng king wu was also an old friend of sao chan their relationship was far from ordinary as the sign goes when one person ascends their chickens and dogs rise to have a sound chan atlombin invincible among players and after equipping music level gear and now accept that top tier position even among npc factions with such a status if given the chance is certainly wanted to take care of his or teammates thus sao chan made up his mind and quietly clicked on the private chat request from feng king wu at the base level spider kbc combo's checkpoint feng king wu little fairy huns ran eternal great gile and tail grew at leading 10 members from their respective guilds were starting to tackle the base level dunggion the level gap between sao chan and them was growing larger and they hardly studying young town anymore this made everyone feel a a sense of crisis prompting them to work hard to gradually catch up to sao chan's base the current beast level spider cave was atrial during this time the improvement sao chan had given them equipped them with the strength to clear the beast level spider cave but since they were enteable to defeat everything in one hit like sao chan they made it to slowly gather the boss skills and devise a strategy today they are just defeated the second boss however everyone was too curious and them just to pay attention to the equipment dropped by the boss all guessing at feng king wu we see her expressions because just a moment ago they admired sanya that that prohibitly mess it feng king wu after a moment when feng king wu finished her communication everyone called nte what to ask sister wu what did the master want with you can we help in any way the little fairy was the last patient and the most innocent so she was the first to ask a question the crowd opened their mouse but said nothing collectively waiting for feng king wu's answer and the reverence gas feng king wu's small face turned a little excited and flashed her cherry lips slightly party sao chan and so on as the words fell everyone wu i didn't take eyes wow sao chan town tog small wu's fully equipped kem perto the major human cities aside from being a bit smaller the infrastructure wu's almost the same sao chan and suasi auxiao era if that sao chan from the imperial city truck the teleportation array standing at the headquarters of the hul in tian tangy soon after phone king wu and the others also arrived in front of the two from a distance the little fairy cheer felice shouted master you reba one sao chan added lightly a ten greeted lu just ran and others before a handing the hawk change voucher to feng king wu right in front of sociao xiao sociao xiao's eyes flashed is this the ungin you have a jurayon she took sao chan gul take some etime to carefully select after all she was the someone who casually talked to disciples but unexpectedly used a few minutes later sao chan had already made the decision for her was this is pit of us was a serious that's right however sao chan looked at her calmly and confidently explained feng king wu is currently the strongest magion dentile can't say it from her you can't think of anyone else who qualifies to be your disciple suciao xiao carefully examined feng king wu pan hearing this she didn't know how she assessed her but after a long while she nodded lightly not bad but she's still far behind you suciao xiao was somewhere dissatisfied but didn't directly show her this pleasure she felt that his fellow ungin feng king was strengths attributes was far inferior to sao chan's the gap was like a avenanders but because of sao chan's decision she didn't refute plus weas lu just ran and others around who she also looked down upon she used to accept the don't be unsatisfied sao chan looked at her with a strange expression if feng king wu had my strengths call she still come to you as a master so asiaoxiao was taken back for a moment before realizing sao chan was speaking the truth if this ungin in front of her at strengths comparable to his calls she qualified to be her master the answer was obviously no so she had overtoked in the team i talked to exchange a few words feng king wu had already completed her hope change transitioning from a fire mage to a team space mage the gases of young hondaini and others towards feng king wu were filled with envy a hidden profession the dream of countless players however they were in the jeles becaused ericent feng king wu had this opportunity was all thanks to their guild leader daddy so as long as daddy didn't abandon them they told me that they same chance so chan briefly introduced so asiaoxiaos background to everyone the crowd size on her immediately became eager a level 135 grand sorceress will she be a permanent member of our guild interacting with us are there other ig level npcs that make come that is mighty awesome in the eyes of the players ig level npcs meant sources of quests sao chan's ability to recruit an npc like su asiaoxiao as everyone talk was simply immense everyone including feng king wu couldn't help but feel excited inside on the other side sao chan talked to the team to throw the spare equipment into the guild warehouse instantly causing gaster throughout the guild guild history guild leader kyanji plus praise the level 77 musical quality long signatures of the ancients into the guild warehouse guild history guild leader kyanji plus ed the level 77 musical quality rin blood ring of the knight elves into the guild warehouse guild history president kyanji as plaza dhl 77 music quality helmet ramps packers helm into the guild warehouse guild history president kyanji as plaza dhl V85 legendary quality helmet crimson helmet crimson helm into the guild warehouse sao chan not only putscico pieces of music level pieces of music level equipment into the warehouse but also opened numerous legendary chests dark gold and gold chest septan from the dark tower placing all the equipment acquired in city it's worth noting that from the first floor to the ducentesimo octogesimo noveno floor there are chests for every 10 floors clear coupled with the idle equipment saochem replaced the guild history recorded nearly 40 messages screen span sock all the players in the guild were stand the nearly 40 pieces of equipment saochem placed in the warehouse although insignificant compared to the quantity dropped during the monster sig were of such equality that it was hard to believe what the hell am i seeing things or did president adi were having somewhere so many equality pieces a pira latonse why do i feel like it's just a bunch of cabbages president adi is also the lowest quality is gold president adi is also ebay counted excluding gold and dark gold quality the area total of 23 legendary 9 epic and 5 music pieces joining hu lin tian tang was the way is its decision of my life awesome so awesome legendary equipment is fine everyone has inquieted a bit of it and has a mental expectation of its attributes however epic equipment is exceedingly there before it is a side from the demon king robed rat by saochem after defeating the demon king there were basically no other reference targets after carefully examining the attributes of the 9 epic pieces all the players in the guild were left speechless in so if epic equipment is like this what about the beniger quality music level the 5 pieces of music quality equipment hoochem placeding were all four warriors dueto level differences the attributes were roughly three quarters lower than the base attributes of the lv 180 ruler sword but they still far surpassed the same level epic equipment leaving the guild members dum fondate their eyes way not to mention that each piece of music equipment comes with 40 guild skills if we set a number of 10 000 for the process from character creation to obtaining god level gear then epic quality can allow a player to advance 100 points instantly while music quality starts at 500 points music equipment of the same level is about 5 times the yield of epic equipment looking at the top 5 music pieces to work suddenly popped into the minds of all guild members terrifying since its establishment the guild warehouse of hu lin tian tang has always been a focal point of interest for other players outside now with saochem's actions the guild members overwhelmed whispered and joy immediately talked to the game for unto boasts once boasted it instantly caused a stare across the entire server legendary epic missy oh my god amazing illusions at such a young age the world so can no longer describe my feelings he now declared that hu lin tian tang is undoubtedly the number one guild on the server who dare esto disagree he used wanna know what does prince he think after seeing this saochem had a bit of browsing forums during his free time son elen about the commotion caused by the guild members updating the warehouse on the forum tc guild members really loved to show off saochem chuckled and shook his head but the cold understand after all the players tendency to show off in games is the something that developed overnight unless they genuinely prefer to keep a low profile or like him no longer care much about fame the vast majority of players will make choices that reflect their desired of love there were too many envios and jealous posts on the forum and saochem took a moment to appreciate them before preparing to log off however just as a was about to close the forum several unusual posts that went against the mainstream suddenly caught his eye hmm prince by who wants to challenge me is that for real saochem instantly became interested scrolled through the forum and found quite a few related posts previously when he opened 13 music chests and flooded the server with announcements although prince vigil had panicked and deleted his challenge post the human players still remembered his arrogant remarks at the team leading to a flurry of sarcastic posts smacking him in the eyes of the human players vigil's act of issuing a challenge and then deleting his post was seen as a contradiction his previous arrogance had stirred up a great deal of anger among the human players now think in a cold use check it off as if nothing had happened was not something they would let slide so easily the human players were eager to now into the pillar of sham players from other races mostly joined in the mackery a cacknelly adding they're on hubs even the demon players felt somewhat annoyed with prince vial after this incident they felt his behavior was too embarrassing it tarnished the image of all demon players significantly thus altezer is enskembaind let to the fact that i'll talk about 90 out of 100 posts on the forum were discussing the guild warehouse of the ruling the world guild at leas two or three were still dragging him out to ridicule after browsing several posts and confirming with his guild members so chan finally had a clear understanding of the situation alv 10 music dagger that esto provoke me this guy really has no fear of the a but after all he did it done the first music equipment inventir a server so it's inevitable he feels a bit inflated at this moment he sold teach him how to behave like a woman so chan mattered a few words under his breath his expression sought for a call ignore this matter if he didn't know about it but now that he did it couldn't just brush it off the reasons were quite simple first it was somewhat displaced that vigil at stolen his server and on cement it's a common player be hired to take action when feeling wrong in a game and so chan was no exception it was used the nature of players second looking at the bigger picture based on the main case predictions there was a 99.9% chance that a war between races would occur in the future at that time players with immortality make play a significant role in the war therefore if a cold weaken the opponent's development in advance a certainly colden them is the opportunity there be hill was the first to speak up if a ignore this what would happen when other clowns ganda bit of power and then challenge him such and colden they use refuse colde if a did the other party make take the opportunity to spread rumors that the west a fry responding would veto of others and waste his team thus given the situation sao chan decided to take action against be here not only coldes showcase his strengths to serve as a warning to others but the cold also eliminate potential future travels as much as possible but since by he had already backed down how cold they take action against him after thinking for a moment a brilliant idea suddenly popped into sao chan's mind on the game forum after the recent good recruitment incident sao chan cede admirably beat 8 million followers at this moment he opened a post that instantly attracted the attention of at least several million fans the title of the post was title overestimating yourself and accept your challenge vigil the title was very eye catching even carrying a tone of this done as long as there are players who remember the previous question caused by vigil curiosity vegan to stay the content of the post was quite simple first sao chan explained why and responded earlier starting that the west busy grinding in the dark tower and that not time second sao chan accepted the challenge issued by vigil agreeing to create a room for a solo ladder match online setting the team for tonight at 9 o'clock which was 5 hours away tier the outcome of the challenge was not a matter of life and the add rather it was that sao chan would stand still and if vigil cold reduce his hp by 5% within 3 minutes from start to finish vigil would win force since it was a rearranged duel there at to be some stacks in ball the wire was a piece of missing quality equipment with the winner attacking the others as soon as tc 4 points were released it immediately caused a uge a pro on the forum after carefully reading trogi the tone was filled with this done for by you and the forum spectator sirapti wow daddy yanje is so dominating as a 10 year fan i'm so excited but a bit wary this condition for winning or losing how confident is the great demon king yanje in in cell yeah standing still is equivalent not being able to fight back right by you can output for 3 minutes can a really not take down 5% of his hp are you underestimating prince by you don't forget he also has missing quality equipment if he like this wire is going to be tough for daddy yanje h mph you saw cited folks upstairs it is done to associate with you daddy yanje will definitely win if vigil dare to accept he will surely lose his only missing dagger standing still allowing the opponent to attack for 3 minutes and as long as his hp drops by 5% it counts as a win for the opponent this condition seems to look down on vigil to match all targets dominating isn't it a bit too arrogant after all prince vigil is not some random player he is one of the only to indentire server with missing quality equipment most of the spectators were shouting about how awesome chania was impressed by his dominance while also an abel to suppress their worries about him losing especially with a piece of music quality equipment as the wire it was truly concerning this astonishing gamble in the eyes of the players if vigil won his fame would surely soar washing away the previous humiliation and the code of tan a second piece of music equipment though many benefits on the other hand if the great demon kings in you won a good only gonna piece of music quality equipment that was inconsequential to him if a loss a would be branded with this charm of being arrogant and inflated which would be a loss that outlaw they gan the disparity in potentia rewards for both cities was a bit too great but sao chem bolden te consider failure it was only focused on whether vigil would accept an hour later vigil responded on the forum excepted demon clan bloodmon city an hour ago at the headquarters of the dark lord guild prince vigil wiped the cold sweat from his fury feeling but frustrated and angry had naturally learned the content of sao chan's post from his guild members a pan seeing the win loss a condition set by the other party in the post vigil size turned red with anger wishing a cold degree on the spot three minutes to lose a 5% of his head while standing still and letting him sell the attack what was that it was simply too disrespectful furious trembling core vigil felt a surge of anger building in his chest as if he was about to explode however the reminders from his guild members el pedim began some campouch president if he dare esto say that he must have some backing we can't fall for it exactly if he studied this guy and ever fights without confidence after all he has 7 pieces of music quality equipment a league level his strength is unfathomable president think ways vigils faced with a few times before he finally began his ability to think followed by a wave of fear he had almost fallen into the opponents tra only players who truly possess music quality equipment understand used how terrifying the enhancement of combat power is this was evident from his lv 10 music dagger which at once outperformed chan yas lv 180 epic sword on the equipment leaderboard and the only at one piece of lv 10 music equipment while the opponent had atleas seven pieces of music equipment at lv 77 who was strong and who was weak was clear at a glance vigil at no conferencing being able to deal with such an enemy however just as a was preparing to retreat like a turtle the vice president's words mad in think quietly president what are you afraid of others might not know but don't you know yourself your music dagger has a skill that that's true damage if chenya dare esto stan still and let you strike no matter how weak his defense it won't matter in the face of true damage three minutes is a knock for you to the all over a million hp right do sabe over a million hp was used five percent in my opinion is used giving you fame and equipment is simply a great person by he'll say's turn it and now he's a prize served within him that's right one of the four skills on princeby whose music dagger was to increase a true damage atchata added 3000 points of true damage lasting for 150 seconds be whole at personally tested this effect which was actually not limited by skills in simple terms it meant that by releasing league frequency attack skills atchata gold at 3000 points of true damage this was to important be whole estimated that in three minutes according to the ideal over a million points of true damage calculating this way taking away five percent of the opponent's hp would be a piece of cake according to believe that and his total hp called exceed 20 million that was an incomprensible number impossible for anyone to reach after thinking for a moment by hill smile you rewrite this yang is here to deliver equipment and faint to me hahaha and that estimate me will come at a price having made a his mind by hill immediately responded to the challenge request on the forum as for the outcome of losing by hill instinctively chose not to think about it time knowingly approach 9 o'clock in the evening saw chen atlonset up the room waiting for by hill seraibe this duela detracted the attention of players across the entire server one was the universal recognized number one player in the game sende who code one shot even legendary level basis below lv 50 the other was the first demon player in the world of primordial toctan missy quality equipment the president of one of the top 10 guilds the dark lord with a transcended status the battle between tc2 was already filled with high adding to that where the and equal conditions of victory and the unparalleled stacks of the way no player wanted to miss this five so when sao chen set it up for online spectators the number of viewers flooding into the room grew by tens of thousands every second by the time prince by hill finally arrived the number of spectators had already exceeded 200 million truly a billion eyes were watching once prince by hill enter sao chen wasted no time and clicked start immediately in the next second the crowd saw a flash and sao chen and by hill suddenly appeared in a narrow canyon oh no this map is canyon of one line sky in the spectator interface fengking wu se are sang the phases of hunes ran and others beside her also chan slightly if we randomly land in maps like the lava cave or misty island searching for the target will take an endless amount of time if lack is not on our side we could waste half of our team in just three minutes but now it's the canyon of one line sky and vigilas directly respawned right in front of the guild leader brother hengzi couldn't help but feel a surge of worry fasty or swatted with a serious phase this map means that the hill can reach the guild leader in no more than five seconds the crowd exchange glances and from each others eyes they could see a hint of obvious concern emerging the rules set by sao chen made them feel a bit anxious despite their confidence because this rule is worth all favorable for by hill with 5% hp standing still a cold output damage for three minutes and the one line sky map meant by hill cold get close this to sao chen the fastest saving a lot of travel time the disadvantage for sao chen side was even more per do you think the guild leader can win who's ran a sketch softly taking advantage of the 10 second countdown the crowd whispered among themselves it's hard to say it's a bit dangerous but it just to believe in the guild leader a must have confidence in doing this he agree he believe master will definitely win the little fairy spoke with full confidence in sao chun among everyone present the one who sao chun the earliest in the game original was definitely the little fairy all alone sao chun was like a godly figure in here a capital of vanity forget about 5% even if sao chun said 1% the little fairy would believe a cold win upon hearing this everyone felt inexplicably sure at that moment the 10 second countdown ended and by here charge towards sao chen meanwhile sao chen stood still as it had drawn a line for himself not moving an inch not even taking a battle stance with his chill slung laser over his shoulder can a really win like this frosty auxway cold and the hell but murmur 200 million viewers watch the scene and a question mark instantly appeared in their minds just as the crowd outside west puzzle by hills raster dagger firstly into sao chen however a pitiful number lit up minus 1 instantly the entire benju erupted in an apro did my eyes deceive me no damage he actually delta force point of damage without breaking the defense what the hell how it gives the defense of the demon king chenny it's an imaginable it my pants of use to see this use this all 200 million viewers one in all where stand minus undamage meant big hills attack at not even broken truck the defense of the demon king chenny this result west of so king they had talked that the demon king yanja mitabe strong confidence to boast about setting this bet but they never expected that by hill cold and te break trucks out chen's defense how cold by hill fight now the minus one number cold and te even kepa with the self recovery of the demon king yanja right the shock of the crowd outside the west equally fell by by hill inside the arena is the gap between one musical equipment and seven pieces really this be this is used to insane by hill finally understood why the opponent there to be so arrogant because they have the capital to be arrogant if it were in the for the trump card of true damage by hill felt a good most likely concede on the spot ah luckily he had already considered this and was prepared the ultimate victor of this battle can only be me if you want to blame someone blame yourself for drawing a line for yourself vigil was not panic a admire his mind as the president of one of the top 10 guilds with a debt foundation before it tani the musical dagger he was already among the top players in the demon race with the acquisition of musical equipment he also got several trump cards it did not immediately activate the skill for true damage on the dagger instead he used normal attacks and sword cooldown skills to start buff status but you wanted to fully stack the passive skill buff to increase his attack speed before unleashing the true damage time passed second by second above south chance head numbers like dash one dash one dash one kept popping up the frequency increasing but he grew more and more in passion a change his previously silent demeanor and this damn felly killed his lip you think you can take away 5% of my head with force damage what are you dreaming about by his mouse tweets but his hands did not stop moving hey don't be so tough you have your moment to cry son is that so i'm looking for bar toy sao chen does the corner of his mouse you opades interesting other ways if someone like you that is to challenge me you'll be very disappointed as for the result of disappointment of course it would be anger this was what sao chen didn't say but by you understood his gas suddenly sharpened and the cold and the help but feel a bit flustered at the game thinking about the consequences of angering the opponent used to look at the current situation of the proud deal and you would know it was careless is all the time to have provoked him back then by hill egretti but this was not the team before regret and since the situation had already cared it was useless to lament echoed only fight desperately to win this be so on 20 seconds pass unknowingly just as over 200 million viewers began to grow a bit impatient the musical dagger in by hills hand glimmer and the suddenly a lit a lightning fast combo against sao chun minus 3000 minus 3000 minus 3000 dozens of densely packed numbers adapted from evap sao chen's head a pan careful counting in used one second at delta staggering 54 000 damage to sao chen meanwhile he hill was still focused on outputting fiercely although it cold and the compare to the earlier burst the attack frequency and the decrease match consistently maintaining around 3-4 attacks per second the sudden change in the battle between the two sides share the 200 million players in the audience interface what the hell what's going on suddenly from unto 3,000 every attack is a fixed 3,000 damage how insane is the underestimating prince by hugh zenye that is in danger with this attack frequency losing 5% in 3 minutes sold and they be difficult right if zenye the great losses his perfect image in my yard will be shattered disillusionment plus 1 the audience called in the hell bad gasping surprise while they were astonished by hugh zenye by hugh zenye in attack they felt the skulls of victory gradually tipping in his favor on the other hand they began to consider the changing sao chenye's image he fell off arrogant conceitai trying to show off but ending up being humiliated in short it bolden t be a good impression however some sap and call jewel suddenly realized that the situation and t actually chained at all shut up idiots look at how machi and ya the great hp percentage has drawn a comment flashed by and countless players noticed the battle is total information list i pan seeing this they wait and tell i seen this belief but going on still at 100% it's at 99 8% then instantly jump back to 100% are you kidding me but this healing speed damn are we playing the same game as yandida hey idiots pay attention healing speed is one thing but haven't you calculated and is total hp yet report ib calculated used now be alone the total of of six attacks causing yanje that to lose 18 000 hp bat the total display was 99 8% a preliminary estimate suggests that the hp of the great demon king yanje exceeds 9 million damage the information display to the spectators did not show all of sao chen's attributes only a 0% to 100 hp percentage attack power defense power skills etc where i'll not display however as more and more players noticed the anomaly everyone was greatly shocked by the total hp rebuild by sao chen the calculation was precise over 9 million hp what does this man excluding who lintian and the fongming guild who monopolize a tier it's worth noting that the mainstream players in the original mostly have hp totals still within 5 000 points a cacknery one or two players make break the 5 000 point limit but they are already among the elite certainly possessing a piece of top tier silver armor someone likes sao chum with 9 million is simply an imaginable it's 1.800 times the of mainstream players the 200 million viewers called only think as expected is the strongest man in the entire server you're revealing a type of the iceberg was already shockingly an imaginable not to mention ordinary players eventos a closet of sao chen like swangaswa where equal is the terrifying hp recovery speed the total hp is this use the type of the severe of the anger that strength at least 9 million total hp okay i'm kneeling that's 1000 times my total hp master is amazing meanwhile in the battle by hill although lacking the analysis of the external audience was not a full and naturally sense the abnormal situation moreover as the president of one of the top 10 guilds his mind was sharper than that of ordinary people why is this guy still unfathed after attacking somata mage by hill was very confused and called into hell back glance at the battle information he had been focused on attacking and until he looked before it but now he had to divert a bit of his attention however this glance was alarming by hill almost called into steady the dagger in his hand sao chen's hp was at 100% normal skills only inflicted one point of force damage on the opponent only by activating the additional true damage state of the musical dagger called the all decent output his trump card in this way was his confidence in the true damage that came with the musical dagger skill which i believed would ensure his victory but what did be hill see now after working hard for over 10 seconds the opponent's hp still he mande bad 99% and even after a moment of his attention the opponent's hp returned to 100% what a terrifying total hp and what kind of recovery speed was this at that moment a phrase suddenly popped into be hill's mind the donkey in a desperate situation be hill felt like that donkey having no other way to scare off the tiger except for a kick for head about five percent even two percent is hard what so did i do if he lost the only musical dagger will be gambi hill mechanically outputted his mind already in this era even began to consider a retreat the code never be artojano ver the musical dagger to the opponent's also the default if he defaults how can a do it to minimize his disgrace be hill so we're completely no longer in this battle all alone sao chen advanced in as powerful and invincible in the eyes of the original players countless players were curious about what his limits were attacked skills equipment it was hard to imagine to mysterious and now the estimated total hp and built rock the spectator view was like exposing a tip of the iceberg instantly it caused a massive earthquake across the entire server we saw 200 million players in the audience interface there was little interest left in this pk match after all if they believed that by hill strength had already picked then the winner of this pk was destined to be the great demon king chenya as team gradually passed by hill still had not made a move a westbound to lose this talk became increasingly firm in the minds of the spectators so chen glanced at the team and realized that nearly two minutes had passed since they start growing somewhat impatient if you have any trump cards here yeah and do see them otherwise let's not waste the achoters team by hill forced a bitter smile but shook his head remaining silent if any trump cards left would they need the other party to urge him the consequences of losing this pk were something a was unwilling to accept that down sao chen waited for another 10 seconds seeing by hill still relentlessly attacking with 3000 damage and couldn't help but score is this it he took battling you will be somewhat interesting but it turns out to be so boring yeyee give you 5 seconds if you don't use any other attack cards you want to have another chance as soon as sao chen's words fell by hill's eyes suddenly lit up and he opened his mouth but didn't say anything want to attack me have you forgotten the cage you drew for yourself no attacking at that moment by hill suddenly talked of a good excuse to play dirty the tribute gap was too great i believe that once the other party attacked him a good probably be instantly eliminated him one or two skills but that was exactly what by hill wanted if you strike it's a violation of the rules a violation of the rules gives me a reason to play dirty since it has been been three minutes yet this was the reason by hill suddenly fell silent avoiding to stop the other party from attacking him and was seven eagerly anticipating 5 4 3 1 the five seconds passed in the blink of an eye by you looked at sao chen with anticipation waiting for him to strike and eliminate him at this moment the audience odcede was also curious about sao chen's choice under the watchful eyes of the crowd sao chen slowly spoke who said standing still can't kill anyone lv 23 star power was unleashed a massive beam of the blue light appeared resembling an inverted handball almost enveloping the entire map of jigsianche this music quality area skill was being showcased for the first team in front of players the overwhelming power cause the various expressions to change a red number suddenly popped up about big hills head 16 117 big hill said was instantly depleted in his final moments before leaving the map ejerce out chen's last words to him remember it's because you are in the world might timidatist track you down as for the promised music level equipment you pay you send it over quickly or you have a face of consequences consequences to bear vigil in a flurry found it somewhat amusing the scene flashed and when he appeared at the headquarters of the dark lord guild a disdain felles my one on his lips ah you don't care what your license are once you strike it's a strike you broke the rules and you want technology threatening me if you have the guts come to the demon clan fears vigil wasn't worried that the other party called rich the demon clans camp to the all we see him at this stage the international crossing had not yet been opened entering the demon clan from the human clan west throat with danger moreover even if the great demon king xenia was exceptionally powerful instantly eliminating all encounter basis once eric developed mon city of the demon clan their goal naturally big level npc's to the all we seem regular players make not know but us someone had accepted the main quest vigil understood the demon clans at the towards the human clan so he wasn't worried at all overall accepting this bet only slightly tarnished my reputation there is no real loss by hill fought for a moment anato popped into his head causing him to chuck it he decided to use some unconventional tactics to tarnish and his image while minimizing the damage to his own reputation that was about to collapse this duel ultimately did not last the full three minutes but the vast majority of players were not dissatisfied because anyone we saw discerning he could see that by hill was completely crushed in front of sao chen therefore after everyone dispersed what they eagerly disgust was would buy you honor the bat and han over the only musical quality dagger to the great demon king yanje this was a piece of musical quality equipment after all in the entire game besides the great demon king yanje only by you possessed the cold it really part we see but if he refused to hand it over it would be tantamount to offending yanje was not afraid of yanje's revenge you think about the fact of the proud and mighty gill did by you really have the guts to the foul but if he truly refused to pay the dagger what called yanje do in any case until vigil hand it over the dagger this storm was far from over what the specific outcome would be all the players in the server were extremely curious on the forum numerous posts weren't lessy debating most people felt that vigil sold act like a man and kept his promise however a very small number of players had only began to start the pot is the chenya really going to force vigil to hand over the dagger and already so many musical quality items do you really need this one plus a can't even use the dagger similar comments a cacnel appeared in various posts making many players feel disgusted it's just a lvd's musical dagger one sold let it go when they can i believe senia is not a petty person yeah yeah the great demon king senia has so many musical quality items good still covet this vigil is so pitiful does it really have to have the only musical dagger is the great demon king senia trying to wait him out the great demon king senia can't possibly lack the capacity to be forgiving right no way no way hey whether or not to he be to andize his business you guys wish you're santly mentality are really disgusting exactly what era is this still holding on to the idea that the week are right are you all idiots it only takes a few players to stir the pot even one out of a hundred can make others feel very annoyed on the forum many people were utterly disgusted by this sudden influx of players intermouse if such enforceability by his musical quality dagger it would be petty and able to tell her at others and of poor character canversely if it ended here it would be worthy of the title of the game is number one anyone who saw discerningly called sida this was a twisted reasoning after all who said that the number one player in the game apt to be generous and unconcerned with details such moral coercion was truly unbearable to watch yet there were still quite a few ordinary players who believed the day at their thoughts distorted by the central idea of the weaker right and gradually felt that if saw chen did not let by hill go he was unworthy to call himself the number one player in the game the monk clan blood moon city the president is amazing how did you come up with such a useful tree also under the pressure of public opinion let's see how younger responds now what would he see personal combat power if the brain is the working well ee around prince vigil a dozen players from the dark lord management team gabby masamsa in the head it was prince vigil himself who was orchestrating the rhythm on the forum as the president of a major guild he understood the terror of public opinion and had a lot of experience in how to steer the narrative seeing the forum getting muddy vigil couldn't help but chuck most ordinary players don't have strong convictions they can be easily swat often either the east wind overwhelms the west wind or the west wind overwhelms the east wind the focus of the current issue is shifted from whether result hannover the dagger to senia to whether senia sold excepty vigil felt that after the turmoil on the forum senia would most likely not seek trouble with him after all referencing the incident where the the 11 proud guild leader offended him multiple times and only retaliated 11 before ignoring it it seemed clear senia still valued his reputation and probably boldnt want to leave a level of being petty in the minds of all players seeing so many players think a sold let me go senia probably want to pursue this any further right at least on the surface assaulting by him matter in his view since senia rose to fame he had crafted a perfect persona strong mysterious dominating generous gente a likely boldnt goto estreme so versacha trivial matter otherwise his perfect image called collapse besides what to segul a level 10 mystical dagger between to ruin his perfect persona over an unnecessary piso equipment not worth it with this talk vigil's face broke into a smile again as neither of the main characters poke up the turmoil on the forum gradually intensified such a liable matter such and naturally called nte being aware evas ntenai after understanding the background specifically looked for to se most active in staring the pot most of whom were from the demon race seeing this so chen understood who the mastermind been the scenes was staring public opinion is quite a cunning move but is this an attempt to back out of the bed hey interesting so chen couldn't help but laugh initially a plant to let this matter slide as long as by hill humbly apologize perhaps i would be happy enough to say the dagger back to him especially since and a dead goal to enhance musical quality equipment but now by hill's actions had made so chen sang with unhappy what was this moral coercion sao chung fought for a moment and decided to respond publicly on the forum using his idea e didn't specify that by hill was the mastermind as a lack more concrete evidence and sign it make backfire most people make fine such a situation tricky but sao chung bolden tevi travel by names as for by hugh so kallet perfect persona sao chung believe that his perfect person is perfect person not include being assigned to suppliers advising me to be kind chatta everyone must pay for their own actions i chenya officially informed you that if prince by hill does not deliver a piece of musical quality equipment to chenya town within a week as agreed i will personally got to blow out moncity to see what carry just to do such a thing the response was brief only three sentences but the impact it caused on the forum was definitive reckless dominating this was impression sao cheng up to the external players at that moment as soon as this post twist three sentences was released it immediately sparked countless responses from players also chenya that is so dominating you can only take what he hibayu how dare you take what he done hibayu this is the mindset of the number one player in the game exactly what about to say staring the pot come out and sorry your so she actually look forward to be hill not handy over the dagger within a week there will definitely be a good show to watch um a daunting vigilas the guts how can the great demon king yanja be like this pera talk for others brain dead get lost in this wave of public opinion supporting sao chen to fulfill the bet players who saw the main characters strong response were over joye interview such reckless dominating yet reasonable individuals deserve the title of the number one player in the game otherwise the sadly words would surely frustrate most of his supporters from a certain perspective sao chen's response can be seen a stepping up to bear the pressure for the fans in contrast to tc people the players who were stirring the pot felt their mood plummy among them the mastermind vijal worried dark and uncertain expression but angst ches and frustrate fag hingee how dare you do this is another fright of ruining his image at a mm if i think i can make me hand over the musical dagger it won't be that simple if i want to see if it can still be so arrogant in front of the eagle bel npcs in blood moon city vigil decide to ignore it and resist to the end after all if the sky where to fall there would be a tall person to hold it if a human pleasure there to come to blood moon city the npc forces would be the first object it's all been noted that humans and demons have been attacked for 3000 years president that are you really going to the demon race camp the international teleportation array as tvn activity yet the journey is long thing twice sao chen's response on the forum was quickly understood by ilu just ran and the others they didn't comment much on his attitude towards vigil after all as the top player in the game at the capital to act recklessly especially under the circumstances where it was in the right it would be frustrating to he be up demanding the musical equipment used because of the influence from the forum moreover they didn't doubt sao chen's ability to fulfill his premises what was concerning however was that going to the demon race camp was not just a matter of words the back and forth would take too long even if sao chen swept away all obstacles it would likely take at least alpha moon alto who linked and tangled the transcendent status all members fundamentally wished to follow sao chen's orders from the bottom of the earth as the vice president her authority came from sao chen's direct command and her prestige was not particularly if it were to live for alpha month the guild's development meet stagnate sao chen himself naturally understood this in fact punishing vigil was used a matter of convenience his mind goal was to go to the demon camp to complete the mind quest exploring or challenging the 116 demon god level npc set this task was not as simple as used alpha month for sao chen the lower combat power of the demon gods posed no obstacles biggest challenge was the team spent searching for their whereabouts the deadline for the third ring of the mind quest was 180 days and the flag was not on his side it might not be enough therefore any death to clearly around the guild sapphires during his absence there was nothing to hide about doing the mind quest after thinking for a moment hochen's poo this matter don't need discussion it will definitely go to the demon race the mind listen is to complete the mind quest as soon as a finished speaking everyone around lujo's land fell silent when it came to the mind quest they had no right to interfere how long will it take lujo's land quickly as ke as the vice president she had to take on his responsibility so she was even more concerned about the guild's development at least three months at most about five months sao chen reply so long lujo's land westakeneva the current rapid development of the guild really relies on you if you don't return for a few months the momentum mixed all the reason for the stagnation was that without sao chen providing various quality equipment to the warehouse the guild's question would decline and its deterrent power would also diminish significantly there might even be an invasion from external enemies for example the aoc kung si guild from what she knew the aoc kung si guild still had a solid foundation and they might take the opportunity to attack hun lintian tang retaliating for the humiliation sao chun had given them before liu just ran la dalte se concerns veran sao chun looked at her with satisfaction she was becoming increasingly competent as the vice president don't worry if he already considered it he will grant you the permissions sao chen said as long as you can use any equipment or items from the guild warehouse feel free to take them out and wear them without worrying about guild contribution points this lujo's language in her eyes and after a moment she revealed that that expression sao chen's trust moved her deeply the guild warehouse was open for lujo's land to take from the others around her also saw the expressions of envy and jealousy master master can he also take equipment the little fairy called nte olba her eyes wide and adorably looking at sao chen everyone present was sao chen's trusty confidence only she had no dark or quality equipment the box from the monster's idly world agile did a skill book she desperately wanted equality equipment and had initially felt embarrassed to ask but seeing how her master treated liu just ran she called nte help herself sao chen nodded nonchalantly of course after saying that i didn't look at the little fairy suddenly excited expression but turn it to young gundaini lujo's flower brother hengsi and others nothing seriously to signal them you all have this privilege though but like lujo's run you can only take out equipment that meets the wearing requirements you are the people who trust the most you peduring my team away from senietown you will protect senietown and contribute to the development of the guild yes senietown's last master upon hearing this everyone instantly been with joy they the arts filled with gratitude ordinary members at the world they and night to exchange the contribution points they earn for equipment while they directly at the qualification to take it without any cause this trust moved them deeply as the sign goes on said teacher or ways a father they wished they codes were on the spot to follow the guild letters orders for life with no second thoughts sao chen had already considered giving the guild warehouse privileges to a few managers the reasons were simple mainly three points first during his team with the demon clan the guild needed to develop and require top-tier combat power second since the premise was to made the equipment requirements to take them out the missing quality equipment was unusable by everyone tier even if someone among who just runs group turn the gains team their strengths was insignificant in front of him once the third phase of the mind quest was completed a good teach them a lesson a but stay worried about an expected incident and believe this a few people would make wise choices after chatting for a while longer sao chen had completed the guild's serendments next a plant to save some equipment to raise a few million gold coins strengthen his equipment in the main city and 10g to the demon clan as for selling the equipment sao chen decided to auction it of like last time he opened the list and clicked on the avatar of pink cc sao chen applied for a voice call the last collaboration with pink cc had been pleasant and the west all last it of a in someone else so he decided to leave this matter to pink cc did the voice call rank wise before a pink cc immediately answered xianja boss what can it do for you let's all another auction used like last time yeye put out 5 sets of dark gold plus legendary gear sao chen took out 5 pieces of legendary gear at level 35 and 45 pieces of dark gold still feeling no pressure upon hearing this pink once she was overjoyed d to discuss the details finalizing the time value and so on and then pink once she confidently stated that this auction would definitely satisfy sao chen before sao chen unabdekal she hesitated for a moment and informed him of something senje boss do you remember the equipment bought by pin pin shuai someone told me that the legendary staff she bought was dropped by his son tiansha sawing west taken aback is there such a thing in the human races liang city at the headquarters of the seo yang guild ban a young german priest smashed the cat fiercely breathing heavily with anger santi ansia you got to offer e eon head boy will not coexist with him they rank in members of the seo yang guild around him also go expressions of righteous indignation that's right santi ansia must pay for his recklessness dare to play with suez in killing and looting or he joan guild is not to be trifled with dammit let's go to war with the things in shining guild president we can't swallow this the atmosphere in the conference room was filled with anger and almost everyone spoke up insisting that said tiansy sold paid the price we saw me been suggesting to directly declare a guild war however the president champion's wire sat calmly at the top and did not issue a decision the young man priest eon head boy who looked the most upset was her incompetent younger brother the equipment a purchased a great expense from the star auction house was a liquid on him at the first opportunity the species of equipment h1 pin pin shuai was very familiar with cold be recognized data glance at this moment the most important legendary small round shield was already missing from your own head boys possession used alpha de jago the president of things in shining sun tiansia gathered 2 000 players and instantly killed your own head boy at that time a hero head boy was still a red name and was bad luck a direct lead the legendary small round shield judgment moment this was the reason why this group of people was discussing here now sister he really can't swallow this anger let's go to war with sanctia iron head boy greeted his tisanset shut up he will decide this matter myself pian pian shuai was right in a cold glance if it weren't for your red name would you have dropped your equipment umph you have a somn responsibility in this matter too iron head boy opened his mouse his face turning blue and red but it didn't take a red to speak pian pian shuai was right if it had remained a with the name the probability of dropping equipment would be les dan 1% and dropping the legendary small round shield in one that would be even les dan 0,1% therefore in the edad to bear some responsibility for this moreover the most important thing was that pian pian shuai was not a brother supporting them on when she told him to shata edin ted are to say a war they ranking members of the gilick's chandglances alfalin silent in unison no matter how he did the discussion was the final decision would still be made by president pian pian sueyere as pian pian sueyere's gas wet over the group she said solemnly the things in shining guilds in france in hian telefe city makes it to burdens and for us to fight across the main city we have incurred a lot of debt to purchase equipment and we can't afford it moreover there must be a large number of players protecting sanctianza and they is a with the name making it difficult to drop anything furthermore there are follow-up consequences so what if sanctianza gets judgment moment if it can't quit it it's just a declaration as soon as she finished speaking a good member reported that son tianxia derived at the center of liang city with a team of 100 wanting to negotiate with pian pian sueyere during to come to or liang city do is a thing we wanted are to kill him in front of the npcs let's go meet him pian pian sueyere's eyes flashed and she was the first to walk out son the group arrived at the center of liang city from a distance they saw sang tianxia and his group standing literally in place with sang tianxia himself having found a child from somewhere looking completely relaxed fan pian sueyere glanced around and found that the location was indeed well chosen the lord's mansion was not far away and npc soldiers se cagnelly passed by in line any player daring to make a move here regardless of whether they could defeat the opponent would definitely be caught by the soldiers and sent to please him for a while seeing pian pian sueyere's gas sent tianxia felt a chill in his ear this woman really was thinking of killing him no he had to quickly dispel that to gg since you were are here and naturally have the legendary small round shield stored in a safe place don't fantasize let's negotiate properly were let out a barely noticeables i think elected her thoughts and said coldly we admit defeat in this matter now tell me what conditions would you require to return this small round shield to us in worse view sanctity was just trying to take advantage of the situation as long as it could be resolved with gold coins it wasn't a big deal after all the deaths were already too many adding one more bolden temate at worst they called borrow again after acquiring judgment moment the seo young guild had gone quite a few allies so borrow in treat of five hundred thousand gold coins bolden teve a problem what worried her was that mere gold coins make no satisfy sanctityansia's appetite therefore shua was prepared for a significant loss however she still underestimated sanctityansia's greed actually what you want is quite simple you so young guild need to become a branch of my starry alliance then we will be one big family and naturally the equipment will be returned to you as soon as the words fell the expressions of the hiaoyangir members chan dramatically tai tuba look that sanctityansia's a murderous intent that symbol most tangible suezga's also turner easy you dare to make such a demand for a legendary small round shield have you lost your mind i'll talk the bar of judgment moment was it it called ntevikem perto the hiaoyangir in suez eyes santian she always dreaming no no no how could this be losing my mind clearly eve fought this so very carefully young tians asking that now this matter as ntevikem the outside world yet right tell me if expose the transfer of the small round still what will your creditors think where's expression stephen previously when borrowing gold coins she had promised or ipa not use with gold but also with a certain number of quality equipment if the news of the the legendary small round shield being lost got out gold to see creditors still believe that the saoyangir that the ability to ripa as a great this would be a huge blot to the guild's reputation one missed and they call become the target of everion's goal if you have the ability go ahead and spread it so you are quickly found that counter me assure as long as you dare to spread it when the great demon king sin you find out that the buyer of his equipment was ambushed let's see if the company can provide after sale support you feel sick woman do you think you were asked on fear some tians you are past nearly jumping and have told back his courses and expected to be so six kin it's just a game and there's even after sale service and never heard of such a thing but even with a 1% chance some tians you are in the dare to be reckless because even if a thousand boldness about the dare to go again so tune after all the last tempered the house in west still on the pillar of sham in response to santiangir's harsh words swearing man and fast asking yanje for after sale service not to mention whether she had the face to do so the idea of needing sale protection for equipment in a game was unprecedented and were called to bring herself to do that therefore after her brother ty too while was defeated by santiangir she didn't got to yanje token plan now bringing this up was simply to increase her bargaining chips with no other purpose afla price of 200 000 gold coins how about returning judgment moment to me where suggested expressionlessly as for what happened before let's just pretend it never happened if 200 000 gold coins called by back the legendary small round she from santiangir she won't mind letting the matter slide after all it was just a matter of skill not being up to par buying a little tuition but a big deal santiangir didn't know if she really wanted to ask tianja for help feeling uncertain so i dismissed his initial greedy thoughts at this moment seeing the conditions that by pian pian schwa santiangir couldn't take help batsko 200 000 gold coins that's a lot is seem to remember that this is centered around judgment moment was auction for a staggering 1.5 milio gold coins back then am you mistaken are you trying to send a big get away santiangir didn't take care about making an enemy of pian pian schwa after all even if he really sold the legendary small round she shield for 200 000 gold coins to her call this matter truly be considered as if it never happened sanctiansia didn't believe that the people from the saoyangir could swallow this humiliation therefore he was determined to make a hefty profit so what do you want be sincere and let's not waste he achoters time pian pian schwa from it you don't think it's a pander for a moment and said all right since the president pian pian schwa is so straightforward and he will be there selling the legendary small round she to you for 200 000 gold coins is impossible even if you offer more without your dildas the strength to come up with you how about this why not say usl 9 pieces of dark gold equipment from jurirone at brotter afla price of 300 000 the pain of being unable to wear legendary equipment was profound this was his back plan from the star as soon as a finished speaking the management of the hiyan gill was instantly furious tailgaz stored sun tiancia filled with venom what carry are you really not afraid of there do you think we recovers president don't hesitate take him down the members of the hiyan gill were sitting with anger wishing they could send sun tiancia and his group back to the city for free right away even if they were killed by npcs for taking action they didn't take care pian pian swiss expression also turned green but she still mantan her campoucher killing san tiancia was not difficult but this was not the early game anymore the cost of dying now was merely a few hundred gold coins to find a priest to remove the weekend state which are almost no impact moreover everyone present was an elite of the guild and being caught by npcs and thrown in jar was not worthy most importantly killing sanctiancia will not help them retrieve the legendary small round shield therefore campiam were barely suppressed her urge to kill you know this is impossible sanctiancia can't leave what his hand hey this is my condition president pnp and where why forsake yourself the feeling of being in depth to the entire guild is not pleasant easy you don't need to worry about that let's talk about how to get the legendary small round shield back my condition iman san chan are you sure you want to make an enemy of or siyung gill so we can reach an agreement sanctiancia killed his lips this damn feliz sign you think you can buy the legendary small round shield from me for 200.000 gold coins do you think i'm an idiot e boldness even for 1 million so he be a sanctiancia melisches liadid that is mal round shield will never return to your hia yang gill after a finished speaking the atmosphere instantly lit a tense standoff pian pian swiss face turned completely cold this is your own choice don't regret it hey if you want revenge ye ye be waiting sanctiancia was indifferent to pian pian swiss trea after all in terms of strengths he seems insane it gill was not inferior to the hia yang gill moreover in across city gill war and less pian pian swallows her mind it bolden the esquelat at this stage let's go pian pian swiss cast a dead glance a sanctiancia and turn it to call her people the group felt extremely frustrated but under the president's orders they called only live in silence however at that moment a figure whose name echo throughout the entire server slowly approached from a distance everyone present recognized him the great demon king yangje wow it's really the demon king yangje why is a no liyan city no kidding yangje must be here to support us the members of the pride sang guild were instantly filled with excitement however swiss gas revealed an unusual sparkle as she greeted xiao chen meanwhile the group led by sang tiancia frozen sang tiancia himself felt a wave of panic damn is this killing god really going to do after sale service is a dad born at that moment the great first surfaced in sang tiancias he ata the non tianja would and this nebly intervene a gulda beben crazy to ambus ironia calm down calm down ma be just passing by sang tiancia silently reassured himself don't be afraid idea of selling equipment was after sale support was almost an heard of in online games it sold nte vi possible just a groundless where just a sang tiancia was lowly is in his tense expression so chen fa in a lilukta team president sang tiancia you know the process of this matter and i want to pursue the reason but the equipment was ultimately sold by me so how about giving me a favor in returning the legendary small round's shield to swear santiancia reality is used that dramatic you think others don't provide after sale support but they do and what can you do about it this favor santiancia no choice but to give other ways a goal fallout with tianja and the consequences were not something history guilt called be a santiancia glance at where are filled with jealousy this woman is so lucky after used a few seconds of contemplation santiancia made a decision and suddenly chuckle of course it was a little misunderstanding my purpose for coming here is to personally return the legendary small round's shield to president were around to express my sincere apologies after saying that someone being deemed to occur the small round's shield and toast it to ironia it's real sis ironia exclaimed in surprise jeje our story yield always a bequitscainni stores others so let's just let this go shall we sang tiancia were a cheerful smile showing nothing so frustration this mad is a ochent look at him with no found respect in fact pinging at all so chen dentier story without any concealment or exaggeration so chen felt that santiancia's actions were justifiable killing and looting was used to normal in the game countless similar incidents happened every day across the server and it was the something a cold money alone but this matter was related to heo chun himself because the legendary equipment was personally interested to pinging for sale and even after it fetched a skylight price of 1 million 500 so send the adma the appramistos were essentially extending a goodwill gesture on tinsiao's actions were somewhat a slap in the face for him moreover if this matter is prea otside the value of sao chen's future equipment actions would likely demean significantly after all having money to buy doente me and you have a life to spend it right the previous and guild was considered one of the top human guilds and its strengths was evident if even such a guild called ntprette legendary equipment who called have a 100% confidence now sao chen wanted to sell a few sets of equipment to gather some gold to enhance his gear and this news negatively impacted his plans making it worth taking action to hell hence the current scene unfolded a used in tsp sang tiansiat almost unecitatingly hebe up the legendary great equipment this was legendary equipment the value of which goes without sign is said the goal hebe it up and did so decisively this mindset made sao chen appreciate him nodding silently sang tiansiat indeed as a bit of a heroic spirit very good and it also gives me face looking at the amicable atmosphere between sang tiansiat and sue sao chen so i'll find liant tour netto sue as a reward for helping you destime the promise him a de to take you to the towering kingdom geon is here by a cancel do you have any objections pnpn suah was taken aback for a moment then quickly responded of course that's only right good sao chen nadie pnpn suah was in the edda sensible person his help wasn't free used right at previously promised to retract allowing him to indulge in the demon faction without any reservations and then turn it to santiansia president santiansia what guidance does president kian ji have santiansia mantana very humble pasture seeing that pian pian schwa dalso suffered a significant loss his mindset balanced out considerably it was hard to say which was of greater value a level 40 minotaur kingdom geon of any difficulty or a level 36 legendary small round shield however sao chen saxchens relieved him as lona sebaste in an intimate relationship with pian pian schwa and didn't have to worry about retaliation this incident was merely a falling out with pian pian schwa as long as kian ji didn't intervene it was fine it's not really guidance he used wanted to inform you of a piece of news that could be good or bad what what santiansia osea skipped a bit could it be that a guest wrong was chen ji still targeting him pian pian schwa beside him also cast a curious glance eager to hear what sao chen at to say the members of the two guilds around them were also focused waiting for sao chen to speak ah it's just a small matter noni to be so tense i decided to auction of 5 sets of equipment again in 3 days the quality will be the same as last time if you want to buy you can participate in the singhian auction house sao chen stati his purpose as the top player in the entire server a leader and a parameter for human players to be honest whether it was santiansia or pian pian schwa in his eyes they were all part of his own group when the team came to battle different factions the stronger the human players were the more they called hell so didn't they mind them growing a bit faster the conflict between santiansia and pian pian schwa from a certain perspective also the competitive aspect if it weren't for the possibility of affecting his equipment selling plans evolved into a becare that was his perspective upon hearing the news from sao chen santiansia immediately been with joy thank you cng for the early notice no more talking i'm going back to gather gold this team at the auction e most by at least once it would be xian ji after saying that sanctiansia greeted sao chen and left with his group pian pian schwa seeing this pothe she had no objections to sao chen's decision she used golden test and sing sanctiansia so please moreover she was heavily in there so she wouldn't be able to participate in this auction but that didn't matter having finally met kyan ji pian pian schwa wanted to seize the opportunity to get closer kyan ji it's your first team in lian city right how about a tour then let's take a look we saw you team by eating him sao chen had no recent or refuse especially since they had no other matters at hand for the team being the next three days went by used like before pin cc posted information on the forum once again attracting the attention of wealthy players across the server and the auction was a great success with sao chen rasing a total of 3 million gold coins after the last auction major human guilds began to intentionally or intentionally store gold coins if it weren't for the sort 3 day deadline sao chen had given pin cc tc 5 sets of equipment would surely have a sold for a eager price however for sao chen the most important team west ogerito the demon faction and complete the mind quest and 3 million gold coins were already efficient any additional funds would be insufficient for strengthening with obsidian so

said tell me the sleeping locations of all the demon lords and 80s if the sky demon called the limb sao chen would save a lot of time sao chen talked to me nick nitto ugly habit but to his surprise the sky demon immediately saw with a smile upon hitting his condition is that it you want to take low questions he can tell you for free in sao chen's stanist expression the sky demon rebuild all the information in you there were a total of 101 coordinates missing only 16 compared to the main quest target which sao chen marked on his minima as if sensing sao chen's confusion the sky demon at monday explained that's how the demon faction is backstabbing a shotter is just a feature if he give you this coordinates why not take them down one by one that way he'll be the top combat power and my status in dentire the moon race will be countless times more important the sky demon even offered sao chen advice what you said makes a lot of sense sao chen was somewhat speechless it turned out that the internal struggles of the demon race were this brutal as a mid-level boss they did the team about uniting tail strengths but instead backstabbing a shotter however after thinking it over sao chen felt it was quite a reason ever the demon faction was not like the human order faction chaos and cruelty were the main themes of demons the parent ruler of the demon faction was the lord of the abyss with 36 main cities ranked used below him small-scale battles occurred between tese main cities from time to time in used 4 months since the server opened there had already been more than 3 wars and the players of the demon faction were extremely excited this owed that competition within the demon faction was very strong so sao chen felt the sky demon sat at it was quite reasonable he told you everything you know can he live now the sky demon looked eagerly at sao chen urging him to let him go now the sky demon's invincible team had passed and his hp had not recovered much without invincibility sao chen called easily take him down with a single sword strike that's right it's timetolive sao chen glanced at the sky demon and slowly ras the sword of the menacee but before he leave he need to take your dog ah the sky demon was furious didn't we agree that he would tell you the information and you would let me go you man you're not trustworthy when did he say he would let you go used now he only said he would consider it now he beth of the true after all the human race and your demon race are naturally irreconcilable so taking you down is quite reasonable right sao chen scoffed and swung his lungs were down towards the sky demon's head shameless he edmund will not let you go used what to be hunted down by all the members of the demon days the sky demon lord his

Can you knowingly take down another big boss? So en bios. The first kill of a LV50 musical boss must trap at least one musical quality piece of equipment, right? I won. It's so badly. Daddy can you, where are you? You wanna tam up with you? You up there? What are you thinking? Daddy can you didn't even take me with him? This time, the app was limited. Because the players had become an app. Anyone who frequently made the server-wide announcements would eventually. That the emotions of their time. Moreover, it was used to LV50 musical boss which was insignificant. In front of Sao Chen had 7 pieces of big-level musical equipment, right? Therefore, the scope of discussion was limited. However, the demon players did not think so. Demon Lord Edmund? Oh my god, isn't they one of our demon race? NPCS? My heavens. Demon Lord Edmund is one of the 108 great lords in the demon compendium and they used to kill. Even the demon lords can't stop the great demon king Sianji? It's over. Why do they? Humanity have such a freak? Hey, hey. Didn't you notice the key point? Demon Lord Edmund? Is on our demon territory, right? This means that the great demon king Sianji has come to our demon territory? Oh, this is really bad news. Mavi Prince Vigil sold big right now. In the game system functions of the demon race players, there is a feature que yet the demon treasure compendium, which records the general information of all the demon lords and the ATS with demon lord Edmund. Permanently at the end. Not only the demon race players, but also humans. Celestial beings. Elves, orcs, and dwarves alabe teirán hero compendiums. Therefore, many demon race players knew. Who was? After word of mouse, it became a common alley. The demon race players were. Not wrong in their speculation. Prince Vigil was in that feeling like crying. At this moment. Damn it. Why did they really dare to come to the demon race? Is it really going to wipe me out? Damn, damn it. Awika. Past since the last highly publicized P.K. And Prince. Vigil had no intention of handing over the only musical quality d'age. Therefore, at this moment, speculative call did be the cause of this that Kyanji came over? Realizing this. Vigil was restless. I am definitely no match. For Kyanji, the tribute chauffeur is so. Great. I am afraid that if the other party used to be a hand, he would be instantaneously killed. No. He can't leave the city during this time. With the protection of NPCs, he can be at this. Vigil made up his mind for now. Before Kyanji leaves, he would play it. After all, this was not the first time for him. Vigil was quite a familiar with him. At this moment, no one understood the terrifying power of the demon race NPCs better than him. I believe that in Bloodmon City, Kyanji definitely had no way to the all within. The turmoil outside the ways of no concern to Sao Chen. At this moment, after the death of the sky demon Edmund, he finally dropped some items. And it. Basté just any ordinary first kill Drap Rate, it could be considered a major Drap, as if all the previous. Fallers of Edmund's numerous board needs to Drap equipment to the Kyanji let it together. Sao Chen counted carefully. 1 LV45 Missy Quality Ring. 1 LV45 Missy. Quality Priest Shoes. 1 Epic. 3 Legendary. Disrap Rate is a massive. It's a pity can. Uc de ring.

Which lowers the equipment requirement level. Sao Chen code only. Be grateful. He plays the blood ring in his backpack. After all. If he plays the ring with the blood ring. Evolving the Diablo to equip. DLV180 Missy quality. Ruler Sword. And DLV160 Epic. Quality Frost. Fortunately. He don't have big expectations for DLV50 Boss. So. There is nothing to be conflicted about. Sao Chen. Placed the blood ring. And other music quality. Priest shoes. And the epic equipment. Aline to his backpack. Next. He began to slowly advance according to. The coordinates. The sky demon. Ad informed him of the demon races map. Is to of us. Since Sao. Chen belongs to the human race. He called. And he used to the main city. Teleportation array. To instantly cross countless. Distances. He called. Only summon his mount. Little black. And slowly run for bar. In this. Situation. The speed of advancement. Was really slow. Even talk. The music level. Basis encounter. Were still in the revival stage. With low levels and attributes. They were basically. Instantaneously killed. In front of. Sao Chen. However. The travel team. He consumed. Was too much. On the first day. He killed the sky demon. On the second day. He killed 2 LV60. Quest targets. On the third. They. He killed one. On the other day. He killed another one. By now. Sao. In adquiled a. Total of 10 main quest targets. Not only at the progress of the quest. Cae requited. But. The. Equipment drag. Was also. Gepile. All stored in his backpack. Even with the expanded backpack. Which had nearly 600 slots. It was surprisingly. Fit have. What went to the numerous basis. Encountered. Along the way. 233. It seems that. If it don't return to the human race. To store my items. Midway. And mid-even. Loose my legendary equipment. Sao. Chen shook his head helplessly. Who can blame for this? Is that all because. Is too powerful? Delving deep into the demon. Come. And on a. Level map. The amount of equipment. Draped. Was overwhelming. My terrifying strengths. O. Sao. Chen shook his head. In resignation. Sigh. E. Then turned. His gast. Little black. After consecutive. Slined. And missing. Level basis. They joined. Little black. Successfully. Completed. It's. Evolution task. At the moment. Little black. Slowly shrunk. Eventually transforming. Into a fiery red. Ane. Sao. Chen west. Akenneba. Wandering. In surprise. So they joined. Little black. Is an eggline creature. System notification. They joined. Is currently evolving. Countdown. Seven days. Seven days. To complete. De. Evolution. So during this time. E. Can only travel on foot. Sao. Chen pote. Feeling a bit. Displaced. Having grown. A custom. To writing on little blacks. Soft back. I really didn't. Te want to. Track long distances. On foot. And less. Absolutely necessary. Moreover. One must understand. That the. Distances between the. Among God. Coordinates are not. Sort. Without little black. Speed boost. It would be. Exhausting and laborious. Far from worthy. Sowing lands. At the minima. The nearby. Are had already been. Cleared by him. According to the original plan. The next target. Will take two. Days to reach. If he had to travel on foot. During these two days. It might take him four days. After all. Burden by the blood. Curse of the sky. The moon at moon. All sorts of monsters. Will come to disturb. Him along the way. Which was quite annoying. Ah. This is. How chin suddenly noticed. That along the plan route. There was a demon mine city. Not far away. And this mine city. Used. Happened to be blood moon city. At this rate. The main quest team is too ample. So there is no ruse. Now that little black can be summoned. Why not go to. Blood moon city. For a bit of fun. And look for prince. Be halto collect some loot. How chin failed. And immediately set off. In the direction of blood moon city. A day later. Sao chin appeared. In the outskirts. Obscid the blood moon city. By this point. It was already. Considered a leveling spot. For the moon players. With the moon players. A cacknelly passing by. Sao chin did not disguise. His appearance. With the shadow claw. A boldly walk. Toward the city gate. His face was too familiar. To the players. And there were hardly any. Who didn't recognize him. Alone. The way. He drew many exclamations. From the moon players. The news of his appearance. So. Moon city spread like. Wildfire. Blood moon city. Headquarters of the dark lord guild. Ban. Prince Vigil slammed his hand on the table. His expression twisted. We's right. What did you say? Si and the actualidad. Esto comet o blow. Moon city. For the past 8 days. Every time Saoche. Kill the music level boss. There would be a server. Why it an on cement. Each an on cement. Felt like a giant hammer. Striking heavily on Vigil. Saar. Making him increasingly certain. That he must not leave the city. However. Just moments ago. The good members can bat the information. That Saochen had appeared. Out see the blood moon. City. This. Let Vigil both shocked and furious. And even a hint of joy. Bubbleed up in see the aim. His emotions incredibly complex. The reason was simple. He was terrified. That Yanji had really. Come to blow. Moon city. To settle the score with him. He was angry. That he had come alone. Was. Incredibly bold or completely confident. Regardless. One thing was certain. Yanji completely. Disregarded him. Yet. He was also delighted. That Yanji's arrogance. Gabi Mope. The Ope of. Slime his immortal. Missy. Yanji. Yanji. So this say you are arrogant or reckless. Daring to. Come to our blood. Moon city alone. You probably still don't know the terrifying strengths of our blood moon. City NPCs. Right? GG. Distime. He will make sure you come and never return. Prince. Her said fiercely. At the blood moon city gate. After all. It was one of the main cities. Of the demon race and the west burden. With several courses from the moon mid-bassies. So entering would be quite. Traveling. Therefore. Saochen originally planned to humiliate her verbally in the world channel. Forcing him to show up and take him down. Ending the matter. Anyway. Coming to find her ways. Merely. A way to pass the time. And Saochen didn't intend to waste too much effort. However. He. Underestimated the sensing range of the demon race and NPCs towards him. From a distance before. He. Ever approached the city war of blood moon within a thousand meters. A group of demon race soldiers rushed. Towards him. Numbering about 20. Look. There is a despicable human. He actually versa. Curse. Brothers. Kill him. It's time to make an ame for ourselves. The NPCs. Child that Saochen was murdered in ten. Yet Saochen was not at and flustered. With his strengths. Beben. The LV 160 epic. NPCs or the emperor. Li Chungon. Would likely be left behind at this. Moment. Dealing with 20 or so soldiers from the demon mine city. Was a piece of cake. Right. Bah. Just a Saochen made his move. And instantly killed the first one. A quest suddenly appeared. System prompt. You have killed a LV 80 NPC soldier from blood moon city. Gaining 10 repietage. Points and 1.6 million experience. System prompt. You have triggered the temporary quest. Eliminate the treaterly. Content the lord of blood moon city has discovered your location and is about to.

Do it not grant additional rewards. Do you accept the quest? This quest is me alone challenging a city? So chance eyes. Why then? It was. Though unexpected. It actually triggered such a quest. This was not something one called for see who would believe it. It got out. At this stage. Any player other than him would face an overwhelming disparity. Strengths against the combat type NPCs of a main city. With a win rate approaching zero. Even so. Chen himself facing it couldn't help but feel a bit uncertain. His strengths in the answer past all. Players. Making him the undisputed number one in the entire server. But how many NPCs were there in a races? Main city. And what was the strengths of the eagle level NPCs? It was still unknown. Xiao Chen. Did not have a complete confidence. However. Thinking about the quest rewards. Xiao Chen admitted it was. Tempted. If he complete all three phases there are 160.000 free attribute points. Repetition and three musical quality. Chess generally speaking the lord is the strongest. NPC in the main city judging by the fact that killing him only rewards an epic quality. Chess this thing had must also be of the epic. Xiao Chen silently analyzed for a moment. Gritted his teeth and clicked to accept the quest not only did analyzing the approximate trends. Of all NPCs in Bloodmon city boost his confidence but more importantly even if he was outmatched. At me and to escape just a few days ago he'd done a special quality can summeb. From a musical boss. A random teleportation scroll. Random teleportation scroll. After use it can randomly teleport to any location within the current racial camp. A very simple explanation. The function of the random teleportation scroll is clear at a glance. Originally a scroll of little use. It has now become irreplaceable. With it. Xiao Chen can ensure that they won't have yet during this mission. Otherwise. If a huerto be defeated and unfortunate and octolose any of his equipment it would be a heavy. Loss. Especially the sword of the menacean which is the most precious piece of equipment. Xiao Chen pacesis must be firmly held in his hands. Alas. It's a pity that there is no equipment. By ending method discovered in the primordial jet. Otherwise. There wouldn't be so many ways. Xiao Chen sighed inwardly. He immediately stopped thinking too much. Gathered his spirits. And swiftly. Eliminated the remaining 20 Bloodmon city soldiers in front of him. Distance. As the. Sound of the horn echoed the city. A order of first fast demon NPCs charged out from Bloodmon city. The task of one person versus an entire city officially vega. At the headquarters of the DA. Lord Gil. The events that you unfolded at the city gate. We saw Chan and the Bloodmon city NPCs. Were visible to all nearby players and the news quickly reach Princee by his ears. Feeling him with. Excitement. What? Senji has already started fighting with the NPCs? Great. Use. Great. Listening to the reports from his guild members. Princee vigil excitedly slam the table. His. Face beaming. With joy. President. This is a great opportunity. Shall we gather our guild members and. Take him down. A member of the guild management suggested opportunistically. Do I need you to remind me? Vigil's cove. No matter. How strong scene is. Is used a pleasure. Compared to a main city that. Has developed for hundreds of years. What chance do you see? In the words of the Hwasia people. But the. Idiom again. Seeking something. Seeking on a sound there. An other member smartly added. Yes. Exactly. Seeking on a sound there. By who laughed heartily. This decision is simply reckless. The news that the first person of the human race is a club wielding fool is used to. By hew la. For a while before issuing his command. Pass it down. Gather all guild members. We must ensure that. Kyan Ji has no way back. He want him to know. Boss homegrown the demon races. Bajajaja. Just thinking. About the detestable. Kyan Ji's unfallin. Unpassably even wrapping his equipment. Made. By hew incredibly excited. From today onwards. The socayet number one player in the game. Sold start to. Declin. This is the price of his recklessness. At the city gate of Bloodmon city. So. Chun had been killing for a while. The NPCs that appeared were all around level 80. Mere father that. Was no match for him. The black red blood flowing beneath. His feet had already formed a small. Estrean. The broken bodies of the demon race lie scattered everywhere. There was a quizá. No cheating stench of blow. The current battle was too easy. So chun even at the licherto. Emite his four-dimensional aura. If this were before the apocalypse. With the realism of the primordial. It would definitely be considered a limited edition game. It seemed that tested the know. When Sao Chen once again. Slaughter the squad of soldiers. A equal level NPC reading a black horse appeared from Bloodmon city. You. Truly have a great carry. Daring to slaughter my demon soldiers so recently. It is simply. Unforgivable. Yeah. I'm a demon general. Chiyueli are. Sent by the city lord to take your life. On the game forum. A zone as Sao Chen appeared on the outskirts of Bloodmon city. A. Already attracted a small amount of attention. Now. As a block the city gate and in guiding affairs. Battle with the NPC forces. It immediately caused the UGA pro. Oh my god. As the. Demon king Yanji really mad at all the demon races. Mine city. Terrifying. To. Terrifying. Is there anything this man that is not do. To punish Amir. Prince vigil. You actually there to. Can front an NPC from the mine city head on. Is there that a bit reckless. Even if Yanji that is. Strong. There are limits. It's a bit irrational to clash with an NPC like this. Yanji. Umf. Amere NPC that is to block my punishment of Baixu. Ridiculous. Ridiculous. Countless people began discussing this on the forum. As a human. So can was naturally. In a position to the demon faction. And it was quite a normal for him not to enter the demon mine city. However. To suddenly engage in a fight with an NPC was truly so king to everyone. After. All. That was a mine city. Not some random fees. Was it really worth it to punish a. Treacherous Baixu. Many players admired Sao Chen's boldness. While also lamenting that his decision was too. Irrational. At this point. Players generally believe that Sao Chen was only confronting the blood mine city. NPC alone because it wanted to punish Prince Baixu. It was indeed reckless. Evento. The battle situation was overwhelmingly one-sided. Hardly anyone told Sao Chen could gain an advantage. Against the NPC forces. Used then. As the lesser beings fell. Blood mine city immediately. Despite a high-level NPC. Sao Chen's fans. Who learned of this from the Mon players. Were extremely worried. But most players were watching with a sense of amusement. This kind of pleasure. Clashing with. Números NPCs was not the first team in the primordial. But it was indeed the first team. On such a large scale. Without a doubt. Sao Chen had no rivals among players. But how it called the rich. In front of the NPC forces. The vast majority of players were incredibly curious. This battle. Sparked by a temporary quest. Attracted the attention of billions of players across the server. At the entrance of Bloodmon City. The demon general Chi-Yu Eliar let out a roar and charged at Sao. Chen. A pitch black longsword slashed down from the air. The entire movement was seamless and. Incredibly smooth. However. In Sao Chen's eyes. The speed was simply lacking. E. Literally lost the night's shield and blocked the attack of the longsword. Battle information. NPC. Chi-Yu Eliar. LV-110 epic. Used the skill head strike on Yu. Yu successfully. Blocked a mager y dos stone point. Minus uno. A pitiful number. Papped a pebap. Sao. Chen's head. With his current strength. A LV-110 epic boss was simply not enocted. Be taken seriously. Glancing at the refreshed battle information. Sao Chen immediately lost interest. Just a LV-110 epic face. How boring. As soon as a finish this pekin. Sao Chen. Colden te be badder to use a skill and simple retaliate to use a normal attack. After a long battle. His passive skills buff had already stacked to the maximum and his stats had undergone a tremendous. Change. The most direct change was that his physical attack went from 1. 28,019. 19,000. 92,000. To 36.11,000. 51,465,000. I. Adniarly triple. Even a normal attack now had an output of over 30,000,000. A Mere LV-110 epic NPC. Sao Chen called and teve liebate cold. A beso many NPCs. However. To his surprise. Is UL-1 actually talking. Minus 16,603,000. This normal attack was withstood by UL-1 which was a bit absurd. Right. Sao Chen. Looked at him in astonishment and quickly understood the reason. From left Xiao Xiao. Elen dat NPCs called. Also enhanced air combat power by equipping gear. And the chi UL-1 before aim was fully equipped. With a set of dark gold heavy armor. Clearly possessing attributes different from an ordinary LV-110 epic. Boss. NPCs. Compared to regular boss creatures. Obviously a digger intelligence. Is this a bit more interesting? Otherwise. It would be so boring to just kill everything in one go. Sao Chen smirke. Looking at Chi UL-1 with great interest. You deserve one of my skills. As soon as I finished speaking. Sao Chen swan the sword of domination. Ready to unleash a Max Watermon. Dance. However. A pan seeing this. Chi UL-1 suddenly shouted and ran towards Bloodmon City. Without looking back. Incide. A was filled with immense fear. That last sword strike had almost cost him. His life. If they wouldn't talk things a bit more seriously now. Was there any chance of survival? Chi UL-1 was scared. This guy. Sao Chen was taken back and shook his head helplessly. He had overestimated. Him. In an instant. Die sword energy simpto habe eyes of the ground. Arriving ahead of time and striking Chi UL-1's fleeing figure like lightning. Minus 2 million. 397,000. Use the first sword energy hit and I UL-1's body. Froze his eyes losing tailspark. The following in a sword energy's turn at his corpse into a sea.

And drive the humans out mission rewards calculated based on completion al participants will. Receive a minimum reward of Silver Chest X-1 and a maximum of Musical Chest X-1. Mission failure no penalties a Musical quality. Chess as the highest reward the players were all standing erupted in joy al top they knew the chances were slim. This was the closest. They had the verbent omisic level equipment and they couldn't help but be tempted. As for the show. Calle Duman powerhouse in the mission? Of course, it was Kianji. But even if it was the number one. Player in the game for surpassing mainstream players by hundreds of levels. The demon players in Bloodmon City were not intimidated. There was no way around it. The rewards were used to enticing. Moreover, no matter how strong it was, Calle Wistan the 3-4 million players in Bloodmon City. Only a GM called Doda. Inotime, countless players accepting the mission last towards the city gate eager to get a piece of the action. Sochen didn't take care about the demons and usual behavior. Ellos need to cut down anyone who got in his way. Anyone who dilat his mission at Todie. Son. The area around the city gate was drenched in Blood. Not far from the city gate, Ville led a group of. Elites from the Dark Lord Guild. Quietly observing from the shadows. President. Sold we going? Someone. Vein. Ville called in the Hell but whisper. Don't rush. Let's watch a bit longer. Sianji. Is not someone to be trifled with. Beher said seriously. Charge. Kill Qian. G. Clan the musical chest reward. The city gate of Bloodmon City was now packed with a. Sea of people. Countless players. Spurden by the massive rewards of the mission. Began to rush. Towards Sao Chen one after another. They're fearless spirits even made the nearby NPCs. Phyllis Chan. And they were greatly inspired to charge towards Sao Chen as well. Demeral on the scene was. Soaring. Unfortunately. Keriya Long was not a no. Al talk Sao Chen was surprised by the. Players. Participation. It did not feel the slightest panic. It wielded the sword of domination. With precision. Using various skills and within a radius of 30 meters. Around the. No. Enemy called successfully breakthrough. The bloody corpses of NPCs and the with the light of players appear. Incessantly. The seed lasted a full 5 minutes and no player or NPC called breakthrough. Sao Chen's 30 meter range. Only run classes called UCT enriched or cast distance kills. Fireballs. Arkans shots. Tracking arrows. Dark fear reigns. Countless skills. Tracking arrows. Chum. But what left the players in despair was that not a single number exceeded one point without. Exception. Where the minimum force a damage was used one skill. Hiao Chun called wipe out a group of. Players. While the players desperate. Concentrated feed output was almost negligible ever since. Hiao Chun at Paik. With VGR online last time. Which player indentire server didn't know that his. Total HP exceeded 9 million. The number recovered every second was even more. Unatteignable how cold they fight. These there were about 70 to 80 thousand players on the. Cene even a legendary boss sold. And they beat this hard to take down right disparities. Moment the players who had been attacking for. So long began to enter tan thoughts of retreat after. While the task rewards were tempting. One must have the ability to compete them right from the current. Results so pecinto obliquist as most players began to backtrack her who was. Observing the situation not far away. Became a display asset with a roll of his eyes. A whisper the. Few words to a subordinate beside him. Son. A demon warrior from the dark lord guild. Step forward and. Shouted loudly. Everyone. Don't panic. Cian G is not invincible. His combat power is in the. Very strong. And none of us can fight against him. But we also have a chance of victory. What up? Also Cian G runs out of mana. Won't they used to be a living target? Shouted desperately. His. Voice a que wing across match of the battlefield. As on as a finished speaking. The players on the scene. Suddenly brighten. Right. A player's greatest strength is always their skills. But without MP. How can you cast skills? You can only. Auto attack. Even talk Cian's auto attacks were. So. The players still saw a glimmer of hope for victory. Just think about how many players there are. In Bloodmon City. At least over 3 million. With such a massive number. As long as there is. A no output space. Even if Cian's altis strong. He can. Recover at all. Right. The more they talked. The brighter the eyes of the many demon players. Became. Brothers. The plan as. Change. Let's use our flesh. Change. Blow out to Drancian's mana. Charge. Think of the. Task rewards. The missing quality. Trasure chess victory is right in front of us. Go. Go. A new round of players. Search for Bard once again. The many demon players on the scene. When while. They didn't even consider that even if Cian's MP was exhausted and they couldn't. Use any skills. Did they have a data output space? 3 million players were in the Eda Ugen number. But. This stage. The farthest skill output distance of mainstream players was only about 500 meters. The number of players who called exceed 500 meters west of you. Therefore. The number of players. Meant nothing in front of Cao Chen. Unfortunately. In the face of the temptation of mis equality. Trasure chess. Very few called mantan absolute rationality. At this moment. Cao Chen understood. Why the demon players had suddenly joined the battle. His expression sought for. So it's because of the angry war. Thus. Keter is an evil. With the intelligence of NPCs. They clearly discovered that players. The underlying. Aver a selection characteristics. Making them the best canon. Father. But after. Sacha long time. The eagle level NPCs observing from the shadow sold. Aver realized it's meaningless. Right. Cao Chen matter to himself. The battlefield situation was clear at a glance. The gathering of 70-80. 0-0-0 players post not react to him at all. So Cao Chen speculated that. The eagle level NPCs goal. So on behalf of all the. As for the demon players. Stock of running his MP to achieve victory. In the task. Cao Chen want to. For a moment. And found it utterly ridiculous. Al. Alone. He had never found himself in trouble. Due to a lack of mana. Not to mention that his current MP. Value was already over a million. Even looking at his intelligence attribute. The MP recovery. Per second was strena miker. Enlace was in full fire power mode. A cold diesel. And last. 10 days and nights at this intensity. Moreover. Even if he were to exhaust his MP. The demon players. Will face a defense level. In the millions. A total HP in the tens of millions. And a stamina. Recovery of 2% per second. Standing still. Enlace a level NPC. Intervined. There was. Noting they called the guys. Cao Chen not to mention. With his agility of 2.89 million. Who called catch up to him. Therefore. The thoughts of the demon players. At this moment. Were completely. Fancified. In this battle. If it were used against a group of players. The initiative was firmly in Cao. Cheng's hands. Although killing demon players. Don't take count towards quest rewards. The rewards. From the hostile relationship of the factions. Arequite dicen. Cao Chen glanced at the system prompt. Page. You have killed LV33 Demon Player Cherry. Gaining 1 point of reputation. 1. Point of merit. 1000 experience points. You have killed LV37 Demon Player. Abilai. Gaining 1 point of reputation. 1 point of merit. 1.000 experience points. The system prompts refreshed quickly. The effect of reputation had not yet revealed any. Significant use for Cao Chen. It felt rather useless. As for merit. It goes without sign that. It could be used to purchase equality equipment. And consumables from the divine machine. And. Although the experience gone from killing demon players. Was only a small 1.000 points. Due to the UG level. Gah. It had adapted up to a considerable amount. Therefore. Cao Chen had no intention of holding. Ba. As long as the demon players. There to come and offer 10 selves. A good dare to accept. 10 minutes later. The players surrounding Cao Chen still sowed. No sense of decreasing. Which gradually made him. A bit impasse. The demon players are continuously replenished from Blood Mon City. Although the collected experience and merit are quite considerable. The quest are getting salt to mid-lian. A ten pcs. Why hasn't that damn city lord sin I used sent any one over yet? Used. A Cao Chen silently complained a few times. Suddenly. The situation on the field. A passage suddenly appeared in the dense crowd surrounding him. On the forum. Countless players were. Paying attention to the battle happening at the entrance of Blood Mon City. Many demon players. Were live streaming with screenshots and commentary posts. So. Most players in the entire server. Understood what had happened in the past 15 minutes. Upon learning that tens of thousands of. Demon players were easily defeated by Cao Chen. The forum it up to. Damn. From. Now on. You only followed the decision in the entire original. Everyone else can step aside. This being. Númeres really strong. No. The decision in vividly taught us a lesson in 15. Minutes. And this is the mid-at-leas. 30. Zero. Zero. Zero. Players were killed by the Great Demon King Chenia. Right. What? 30. Zero. Zero. Zero. You re-underestimating my daddy Chenia. At-leas. 50. Zero. Zero. Zero. Okay. In front of the Great Demon King Chenia. Numbers have already lost their meaning. The temporary mission of the Demon players. In the Blood Mon City. Have become widely known through. Word of mouth. Everyone understood the reason for the shift from battling NPCs. To players. And expect the kill of an entire city's players continuously attacking a single player. Was simply to. I catching as a result it didn't actually surprise most players because. Joe Chen had already crushed the proud and mighty guild. We swan against 10-0-0-0 when we was LV50 and even. That had shocked entire server and was still talked about. To this day and to be honest. The unlockers. In the forum field at-kyanji as-te-even began to exert his full strengths. At-leas the well-known skill that. Can's la tens of thousands with a single strike. Oblivion says ante Venus et-je. From the perspective of. The unlockers. Relaying on numerical superiority to wear down Sao Chen is completely impossible. As for the thoughts of the Blood Mon City players surrounding Sao Chen. The rational crowd called Ntheg. But scoff. They weren't aware of Sao Chen's terrifying total MP and recovery speed. They simply. Understood that the maximum number of people who called simultaneously attack Sao Chen was around 10-0-0-0. Each attack inflicts a forced minimum damage. So even with 10-0-0-0 attackers. Y. Would only amount to 10-0-0-0 points of damage. In front of Sao Chen. That was meaningless. In the player community. Cyanji is already utterly invincible. Let's see what it's a can. Rich again's NPCs. Someone said helplessly. Use 10. The latest battle situation was. Reveal. Damn. The Blood Mon City NPCs area. Look at the screenshot. Wow. So. Cool. Now. The Demon King Cyanji is in trouble. Right? The unlockers third way died at the. Numerous live stream posts. At the entrance of Blood Mon City. Agap appeared in the circle of. Players surrounding Sao Chen. A thousand strong elite demon squad. Fully equipped. Charred forward. They had clear roles. Melee classes at the front. Rand Magis. At the back. Al-wilding tail. Staffs in unison. A humanoid demon. Seemingly the captain. Step forward first. The night. Watch of Blood Mon City is here. Fizzy humans. Prepared to die. A velo. And immediately. The demon. Magis being dimmoved. In perfect unison. Wapping tail walls. Waps of energy. Like ripple scene. Water. Appeared out of. Ciner beside Sao Chen. Battle information. You have been hit by. Then it was. Combo skills. Passe. Prison. Entering any mobile state. HP cannot recover. While immobile. Lasting 20 seconds. Abnormal state assessment in progress. Assessment complete. You remove. Time has been reduced to 4 seconds. Thanks to his sixth amene. And passive skills that reduce. Abnormal state effects. The original 20 seconds of control. Time was cut down to a mere 4 seconds. 4 seconds. That should be variable. How chin squinted his eyes. Suppressing the urge to. Use Ragnar. To break free from the control. Would still solve you said on the blade. The cooldown for. Ragnar X. To alone. No need to use it now. This battle of one against the city had only used to be gun. It was far from the team at or evil. His trump cards. In 4 seconds. Even if this. NPCs and players attack together. It's old and to be a big problem. However. It could be careless. Without the protection of the demon god. How chin focused a bit more on observing. His HP interface. If the decline was faster than expected. The good and least Ragnar X. With equipment granting 60. Seconds of invincibility. And random teleportation. Scrolls as backup. Yao Chen was completely. Unperturbed. While the night watch was acting. The surrounding demon players. Also learned that Yao Chen was under. Control and tear eyes. Let up 20 seconds. Damn brothers. What an opportunity. Let's all focus. Fear a kill watch. Migrate magic ball. Technique. Charge. Charge. Output quickly. With so many players around. Many of whom had control skills. They were. And aware that duet. To south chance. And resistence to abnormal status. These control skills were mostly ineffective. Third battle. Information interface. Evolent. To show Sao Chen's results. After the abnormal status. As men. They naively believe that Sao Chen was trapped in a 20 second immobile state. Who could resist. Such an opportunity. If not now. Then when. Not far away. Hidden on the outskirts. Vigil also brightened that design. The opportunity as. Come. Command all members. Charge. Vigil could be set to be the player. Most eager to send Sao Chen to his day. Without exception. At this moment. Seeing the NPCs so powerful. A code no longer all back. After. Giving instructions to the guild members. A immediately rushed towards Sao Chen. Who was surrounded by the. Crowd. Duet to the short distance. A man it took a path. In an instant. The entrance of law. Mon city was illuminated by countless skills. Minus uno. Minus uno. Minus. Mil seiscientos treinta y uno. Minus tres mil. Countless numbers rose above Sao. Chen's head. The output from the ordinary demon players was still pitifully low. The NPCs. Of the Nick Ward. The Am hovered around 1000 to 2000. Vigil's speed was fast. Seeing. This. Equitly activated the true damage of his dagger. Dealing 3000 points of damage with H. Strike. The numbers were simply overwhelming. Sao Chen's total HP. Starting from. 100%. Gradually decreased. Dropping about 5% every second. The players participating. In the sea weren't aware of the HP. But. From the gradual increasing progress of the quest. They seem. To understand something. Suddenly. They become even more excited. Kill him. Victory is waiting. Reach. Kill. Sianjin Clam. The reward of the mid quality. Tresure chest. 1 second. Later. Sao Chen HP. 95%. 2 seconds. Later. Sao Chen HP. 90%. 3 seconds. Later. Sao Chen HP. 85%. 4 seconds. Later. Sao Chen HP. 79% de. Spatial prison of the Nick Ward. Teams combo. Skill rendered. Sao Chen's HP recovery. Speed useless. In. Used 4 seconds. It dropped to 79%. The progress of the demon players. Also. Bruto 21%. Used as the many players were incredibly excited. Suddenly. Sao Chen. Ras the sword of the menace. Instantly. The players who witnessed this scene were stunned. But it's going. On. Didn't they say it would take 20 seconds? Has it only been a few seconds? However. Before they could clarify their doubts. Sao Chen's horizontally held long sword. Suddenly thrust an arc of atleas. 270 degrees. The next moment. A snow with a sword light appear. LV 31. Obliteration slash. PS. Sorry. The two chapters were updated in diverse. It has. Now been corrected. Really sorry. Obliteration slash. Is Sao Chen's skill. With the largest. Range. DLV 9. Obliteration slash. As a massive range of 2,000 by 2,000 meters. Ana 30. Folding attack power. El timid skill. Braxtroke. DLV 10 level. Y. Undergoes a qualitative enhancement. Sao Chen previously. To the little fairy and genxias disciples. Intending to use the rewards from the master apprentice system. Top grade of skill from LV 9. Now. Do it to the enhancement from numerous mid quality equipment. It had directly transformed into a terrifying. LV 31 high. LV 31. Obliteration slash. Reliaces a sword energy. Of 4000 x 40,000 meters. With damage equal to 6,200% of the base attack. Power. Ana cooldown team of 24 hours. Previously. When passing 10 de vain level. Basis. Yo cannot not use it this move. Now. Facing tens of thousands of demon players and NPCs. Eu said it for the first team. The effect called only be described as terrifying. Amasi. Sword energy. Serounding gaming a 270 degree. Shot out. Instantly melting. Ganytarge. Eating counter. Minus 4,511. Minus 4. 231. Minus 600,000. Campus numbers irapted in the. Area attached by the sword energy. Weather players or the night guard the arm. Alster way die in shock. Ten either. Unwillingly close their eyes or turn it into with a light. Returning to the resurrection point. The sword. Energy extended infinitely. And a small portion of the hundreds of thousands of demon players present sadly. Banished. The remaining ones were left in odd days. Even so tune. Who did this. Blow. Couldn't help but feel a surge of emotion. Terrifying. This is obliteration slash. Web. It passes. There is only annihilation. The effect of the LV 31 obliteration slash. Web simply unbelievable. In this way. His merit points increased by 39,700. Which means that 39,700 demon players died under the oblivion slash. Sao Chen did. Not pause. Preparing to continue. Slashing at the remaining players who were looking out to survive at a. 90 degree angle. However. With a glance. A suddenly exclaimed in surprise. Followed by a beaming. Smile. A ten turn and walk towards. The equipment that had dropped not far away. On. The forum. After Sao Chen used the oblivion slash. The unlookers were instantly chucked into silence. This terrifying attack range and power exceeded the understanding of all players in the serve. After a long while. Someone finally spoke. Trembling with their hands. Are we really playing the same game as. Daddy Yanje. My largest area attack skill can only cover 10 by 10 meters. Kemper to the great demon king Yanje. It simply does. Google are there 50,000 players who. Dieed under the sword. Looking at the screenshots. It seems about right. So so keen. All. Players who were paying attention to Sao Chen were aware of the existence of the oblivion slash. Bad day. Upgrade to LV 31 of the oblivion slash. West truly beyond the veriones imagination. With day. Same attack mechanism. As LV 9. It was used a massive area of remote sword energy. But the range doubled and the band the army composed of it level NPCs. Then it worked was completely. Abliterated under the sword energy. The originally dense battlefield instantly cleared a large. Area. Whether it was the demon players watching on site or the unlockers seeing the screenshots on the forum. There was only one talked into their minds at this moment. Outrides. So trides. Is there really such. A terrifying skill in the original. It was incomprehensibly outrageous. Why. Being shocked and confused. They couldn't help but feel for the first team that they were triggered by Sao Chen's first kill. Of the blood Mon city NPC meet ultimately have only one victor. Sao Chen himself. Ah. The blood Mon city resurrection point. Among the countless respawning demon players. He had looked. Completely bewildered. But they said that the control team is 20 seconds. Why is it so sore? Could it be that the battle information deceived me? After a while. Egil finally understood what happened. And they greeted his teeth in anger. Damn it. It must be that sin just tamen a estoic ore. As a skill buff that reduces abnormal status. Which brought it down to 4 seconds. As the president. Of a top 10 guild. Egil was quite experienced. And was a shift in to. He understood the reason. However. Understanding or not. Egil still found it hard to accept this outcome. Moreover. A vague sense of forever. Invegan to rise in his ear. How it must this wish tamen a be. To reduce it to 4 seconds? Incredible. Terrifying attacking defense. EAL. Mana. H. Percavery speed skills. Do we really have a chance? The players were originally no match. For Chenia. Something vigilant anticipated. But for the first team. I felt that the NPC forces were not. So reliable. At least. From the current results. The NPCs of Bloodmon City were utterly. Powerless before the opponent. By Heal's air gradually beg and to worry whether Bloodmon City cold stock. South chance advance. After thinking for a while. By Heal suddenly woke up and quickly checked his equipment. And inventory. He had already died once. If he was unfortunate and auto-lose his equipment. It would be disastrous. However. Upon checking. His face instantly chan. The music level. Dagger was gone. It. Specifically washed away my red name. How. Could this happen? By Heal felt completely powerless. What changed? South chance mind was precisely the dagger that By Heal. Dra. The LVDs music quality dagger emitted. A unique golden blow. Standing out among. The scattered equipment and items like a crane among chickens. And South chance spotted it at a glance. Is this. The musical quality dagger of By Heal. Among the crowd that used to visit me. It was actually. There. He he. Could this be the fat of a rogue? South chance love. It didn't expect. By Heal to die under his LV31 oblivion's assault energy. Even more surprising was. That used to unkill his altitude in the trap of his only musical quality equipment. This. Coincidence brought him great comfort. I wonder if this guy is lucky or unlucky. It's all be. Considered unlucky. Right? After all. It's a musical quality dagger. If By Heal. Was determined to be a turtle hiding in itself. South chance had no way to the all we seem. After all. Blow. Mon city was his territory. And searching for By Heal alone. Was truly a case of wanting to do. Something but being powerless. To protect the musical dagger. South chance felt that By Heal would most likely. Act that way. However. He. Never expected that by inadvertently clearing the area. He. Would directly cause By Heal's musical dagger to draw. Such is far. By Heal encountering me is. In the end unlucky. Forget it. He wanted our getting many more. South chance decided not to pursue By Heal. Any further. Ten. A look that the many demon players around him who were still in a daze. From that slightly. And said lightly. You all. Since I'm in a good mood. What are you waiting for? Get lost. Boom. As soon as South chance was fell. The demon players around him immediately react. De. There a ing oblivion. As was still fresh in term. In an instant. All the demon players wished they could grow. Four legs and flee into the distance. As for the mission. Sorry. We are not strong enough. Farewell. South chance oblivion has brought back the sanity of this group of players. At that moment. A furious roar suddenly echoed within Bloodmon City. Despicable human. E. The lord of Bloodmon. City. Sinaida. Will not spare you. Sinaida had no idea where this in G. This immortal. Had come from. But he was undoubtedly burdened with the courses of many demon gods. As the lord of a city's demon faction. If he ante sin he. E. Cold ignore it. But having sin he. E. Cold not. Taller at it. Whether out of duty or fight. However. Knowing oneself and on SM ensures. Victory in every battle. At the same time. It was also to maintain his own status. Sinida plant to send the NPCs aboard needs to test the strengths before making further plans. However. The city guards were all slaughtered in used one encounter. Tens of thousands of immortals were. Equally no match. This made sinida very wary of Sianji. And decided to send the night guard. The am to probe. The need war. The am was not only the most elite force in Bloodmon City. But also a top tier. Army within the entire demon faction. Al top tier number was only a thousand. Sinida to. That at the very last. They called retreat and sat. However. Unexpectedly. In used a few. Seconds. The need war. The am was completely annihilated. How cold sinida endure this? En u that the complete destruction of the need war. The am was a los that pandem greatly. Therefore. As on as received the news. Egerito de City gate. Epanera even got the battlefield. And seeing the. Opponents care of numerous. Immortals we used the word. Sinida became even angry. You dare to slaughter my army and my people at will? Do you think my demon faction is without anyone? A mere human. Even the sword empererly chunghing bolden. Te dare to do this. Who lent you such? Do you carry? Hmm. Today we will make sure you come and go without return. Sinida angrily. Question while wielding his long sword. And from a distance he activated his skill. A fun threat steam.

Then the city lord has made a mob and now Sao Chen Knight is doomed exactly there in to. The arrogant in front of the city lord Sao Chen Knight is really asking for it. I'm starting to wonder. If you say Sao Chen Knight gets taken down by the city lord though is that man or mission is still considered. Complete the demon players burst into hearty laughter in Teirais the lord of blood. Mon. City was synonymous with invincibility the great demon king Sao Chen Knight was naturally. Also invincible but cold players compare to iglevel NPCs ridically Sao Chen. Knight was finished. Thinking of this the demon players instantly shook off their previous state of despair. And panic their eyes wide open. What in to see the city lord Sao Knight slice house and knight and bring bloody to blow. Mon city. However upon watching their expressions chant instantly. On the battlefield. The clash between Sao Chen and Sao Knight was very brief. The enormous gap in attributes meant. That Sao Chen didn't even need to activate full firepower.

It's incomprensible. Why is Yanja su strong? Is there still justice? Is there. Still Allah? Damn Yanja. If on the evidence. You still say you're not the avatar of the GM? No wonder we die so miserably. It's not unjust. What was originally talked to be a one. Saeed did battle at Truliecker. However. The situation that many demon race players talked was. Unfolding at reverse. This battle between players and the city. Lord seemed to be heading towards. A victory for the players. Realizing this all the players instantly. Became a get it. It's home.

A child towards him like a cannonball. E. Want it to kill him. However. Ad desametime his sword pierced. Sinaita's head. The latter smile gently. Abake. Under the descent of the Lord of the. Battle information. Sinaita releases. Sacrifice. Losing al current HP. Summoning a projection of the LV 180 musical boss. Lord of the. By the way. I recommend my friend's new book. Beast King Evolution. Starting from being. Summon by a little lowly. I saw someone asking about my. Relationship with the little lowly. Ah. Well. You can imagine that yourself. Event. The battlefield was full of unexpected. Situations. There were still calm demon. Race players. Hueled a mindset of watching the show. Pramptly. Posting the series of events that occurred. So on. The forum was filled with discussions. Wow. Ito. This Bloodmon City Lord was really strong. But it was taken down in just a few seconds. Disappointed. It wasn't satisfying to watch. Yope. The NPCs are stronger. The boss summoned by this. Bloodmon City Lord looks like it may be strong. Yope. It's not used for show. Senja's power as once. Again surpassed my imagination. Is now slaughtering Dentire Demon race. I'm not surprised at all. So. Bruceless. Dentire City's NPCs and players are trembling before the great demon king. Senja. When the Bloodmon City Lord made his grand entrance. Coupled with his status. Almost all players though. A real first battle was about to unfold. However. No one expected the outcome to be so dramatic. 5 seconds. Or 6 seconds. In any case. It definitely didn't take it 10 seconds. Sin idea. Who came seeking revenge. Was directly brought to the brink of death by the great demon king Shinji. Fortunately. Euxed some una unmeans to summon a new NPC. And it seemed the battle was not yet over. The. Players. Anticipation. And Mandy. From the beginning until now. The number of NPCs and players that. At the end that saochens hands was estimated to be around 70-80.000. Among which the NPC. Faction that the demon race players had igopes for at probably lost over 10.000. This led many. Unlookers to have a drastically reduced perception of the NPC faction. Event of the newly appear. NPCs is in the strong. Almost no one believed that the great demon king Xenia would lose. This was the. Result of saocheng gradually changing the perceptions of all players in the server. In stark contrast. To the mood of the unlookers on the forum. The demon race players in Bloodmon City felt the. Spirits plummy. Especially Prince of Ijil and the Dark Lord Guild they belong to. A new that not. Only a de los de only musical quality dagger but also that the number of guild members who die. Under saochens LV31 annihilation saxed y 10.000. The losses were. Incalculable. Not to mention the equipment that was wrapped. This is more than 10.000 players would need to. Spend over a million gold coins to eliminate their weekend stay. Even one of the top 10. Guilds in the entire server. The Dark Lord called NTVR the. Therefore, the player must dissatisfied. With the battle situation right now was no Neuterdan vigil in ser. After being less erected. A quickly era if that the city war of Bloodmon City. Gazing from a distance at the battlefield at the city gate. Seeing the Lord of Bloodmon City knock down in just a few seconds. He greeted his teeth in anger. Useless. All of them are a useless and NPC Lord of Amine City belonging to the highest combat power. Canter and defeat a player under LV80. What a joke who the hell is this newly emergent Lord of the. A busy OPA is that weak while muttering to himself. Vigil was not only feel. With disappointment towards the NPC. But also felt a tremendous panic towards Giao Chen regardless. Of the outcome from the current battle situation. The combat power displayed by Giao Chen was an enemy. That their Dark Lord Guild could not handle at all. It would probably take at least a not terjear to have. Even a slight chance of catching a. Realizing this. Vigil felt utterly hopeless. After all. Their Dark Lord Guild was developing. And Kyanji was not standing still either. At this rate of. Development. A year later. Kyanji would likely be invincible across the entire server. Whether it was. Players. NPCs. Oric level basis. None would be a match for him. How cold Vigil seek. Revenge. Now. Despair. Dead despair. Thinking of this. Vigil sin to lose. All his spirit feeling weak al over. The only reason he didn't flee on the spot was that still el don't to a. Glimmer of OPA. A hope that this newly emerged NPC cold defeat can Jian drab his. Equipment. But if a new that Sao Chen not only had the man's to fight back but also PC starrando. Teleportations growl that allowed him to leave the battlefield at any time. He would surely fall into complete despair. On the battlefield. Sao Chen carefully observed the opponent. The newly summoned Lord of the. A beast was merely a projection. It had wings on its back. Stood at least 5 meters tall. And. Was shrouded in black mist. Making its face indistinguishable. The weapon in its hand was a dark red. Magic wand. Which. From a distance. Failed very uncomfortable land exuded an amenes aura. Overall. It looked like a fallen angel from legend. Sao Chen cast a rican essence spell. Lord of the. A beast at an. LV 180 musical. Attack. Defense. Skills. Equipment. Remarks. A projection summoned by Isina de Usin. Life and soul. Pcessing only 50% of the. Lord of the beast attributes can ignore any damage. Exists for 60 seconds. All the attack and. Defense attributes were question marks. Which was not beyond Sao Chen's expectations. The main point was. The explanation in the last remarks. After reading it. Sao Chen immediately breathed a sigh of. Relief. Other players may not know. But. Because of the previous quest pursuit of the demon faction. He know that the lord of the beast is currently the ruler of the demon race. Equivalent to the emperor of the human. Race. A guy with such a status. Dominating the entire faction. Must be quite a traverser. He actually don't have much confidence. Now. It's fine. No matter how his output is. He only exists for 60 seconds. So it's not a concern. Sao Chen looked at his own. Equipment. With 7 pieces of musical quality gear. He had 60 seconds of invincibility. This meant that simply activating the invincibility state would allow him to safely pass through the projection of. The lord of the beast. Therefore. Sao Chen let out a long side of relief. This task. Eliminating. The danger in advance. Sold be secure. The process of the beast lord's projection descending to OK. Last 5 seconds. Sao Chen wanted to interact but Sinade was in an invincible land. Uninterruptible state during the summoning process. So he only tested a few moves before stopping. After 5 seconds. Sinade collapsed to the ground. The system sent a notification. Congratulations. Congratulations. You have completed the first phase of the task. Eliminate danger in advance. Killing the. Lord of Glowdmon City. Van Helsing. Rewards. 10.000 free attribute points. 10.000 reputation. Epic quality. 3. Sure chest X1. The first phase of the task was. Complete. At this moment. Sao Chen merely glanced at it. He sent a mind was still. Tightly focused on the beast lord's projection. The cold on team for the invincibility effect of his. Equipment was too long. The further progressed. The more felt the preciousness of such an listener. Skills and was relaxed and to use the mall. Used like the sword of annihilation. He kept it in hand. Son. The beast lord made a move. Elitly what the magic wand in his hand and without. Much movement. Suddenly. A black light flashed from Sao Chen's body. Battle information. You have been. He. By the beast lord's projection. Skilled deadly black flame. HP reduced by 8. 907 million and a light of burning status has been applied. Burning. You lose a 103. 0. 0. 0. HP per second. Lasting for 10 seconds can stack up to 3 lives. Minus 8.907 million. A terrifying number. Papped a pebap Sao Chen's head. All the players present were. Stand. Damn. Is this new NPC really that terrifying? Just one skill dead. Nearly 10 million damage. Awesome. Awesome. Seenya daddy sin danger. Now. An NPC of this level is probably one of the strongest in the entire game. Right? Only the word terrifying can describe it. No wonder it's an NPC summoned by the lord with his life. The fallen angel appearance is just impressive. By the way. Aren't they you surprised that Senya the Grey? Demon King has so much HP? The players were discussing animatedly. And the scene Beckham. No easy. The newly appeared the beast lord projection. Which used a small skill. Brought the atmosphere to a. Climax. The situation of the battle Beckham increasingly unclear. By Hill. Who was hidden in the crowd observing. Was even more enlightened. As far as you know. Since total HP. Is less than 10 million. And this casually. Dead nearly 9 million. This is promising. By Hill. Simo's chance completely flip. The sense of anticipation reached an unprecedented high. In his view. The next. Move of the beast lord's projection. Cold causes out. To die on the spot. So how cold and not look for Bartoy? Unfortunately. He was destined to be disappointed. On. The battlefield. The overwhelming power of the beast lord's projection. Also shocked out. In cell. Once killed to a way. 9 million of my HP. Plus a light of burning status. That loses over. 100. 000 HP per second. He can't win. Sao Chen concluded. His current. Passive skill buffs were at stake to the maximum. His tamen attribute reached over 7 million. And his total HP had risen from 12.8 million to 12 y 11 million. However. The increasing defense from the passive skill buffs was actually minimal. The reason was simple. During the battle. The game system promptly provided better information. Supplementing the attack. And defense attributes of the beast lord's projection. Attack power. 22.98 million. Defense power. 18.66 million. With 50% of the attributes. It was this. Formidable. From this. It could be infrared that the peak combat power of this beast lord was probably not. Far from the LV200 mid-level boss. The final demon got that Sao Chen at fast. Before it. Its strength was truly terrifying. Looking at Sao Chun. Counting all the equipment on. His body. The weapons and accessories on. His right side. Far exit to see on the left. A plus. 10 LV180. Missy quality damage. A sword at least. 5 million. To his base stats. On. The left. The 5 piece. Defense. While all Missy quality. Is too low in level. Only LV. 77. The base defense is too low. The difference between Sao Chun. And the lord of the. It is. Now is that their attack levels are on par. But his defense is several tiers lower. Perhaps. Only when eriches LV120. And equips a full set of Missy gear. Can. A take on the challenge. Alone. But right now. It simply cannot withstand a few hits from the lord of the abyss. After quickly. Analyzing in his mind. Sao Chun made a decision. The invincibility skill can't last. Forever. Sai. With a silent sai. Before the next attack from the lord of the abyss era. Sao Chun swiftly activated the invincibility buff. That came with his equipment. Battle. Information. The projection of the lord of the abyss cast the skill of destruction on you. Battle. Information. You have activated the LV77 Missy quality lower armor Berlin skill. Dot. G. Entering a 20 second invincibility stay. Injunct to this attack. The Berlin armor. Can seize off an upper piece. A lower piece. And choose. HP grants 20 seconds of. Invincibility. Therefore. The skill. From the projection of the lord of the abyss hits Sao Chun. But only resulted in a miss. The projection of the lord of the abyss so it no seems of fatigue. Quickly casting several more skills with its one. Battle. Information. The projection of the lord of the abyss cast the skill dark flame on you. Battle. Information. The projection of the lord of the abyss cast the skill abyss all power on you. Battle. Information. The projection of the lord of the abyss cast the skill fatal destruction on you. Miss. Miss. Miss. Three symbols pattapebap Sao Chun's head. The projection of the da. Lord sim tireless continuing to unleash skills. However. Regardless of the outcome. The display abap Sao Chun's head always saw it miss. And the cause the projection is immune to any. Attack. Sao Chun call nte be bothered to waste the fort. Standing there bored and drowning. The cnf. Into silence. The players watching from the outside were. Aldum found the. What the hell. It can be like this. Is this an invincibility buff? So in views. Osem. Osem. As expected of the great demon king. Yanja. Even as an invincibility buff. How about we guess how long the invincibility buff of the great demon king Yanja can last. The demon. Race players expressed. Their amusement. Discussing animatedly. Their longing for the. Invincibility buff filled them with ambian jealousy towards Sao Chun. However. By hillu. Undis da infuji. Generally speaking. The more precious the skill in the original is. The shorter it's duration. And the longer it's cold on. It don't believe it can. We stand it with invincibility in front of. An NPC. By hill was not wrong. Since the launch of the original. There have been players who have done. Invincibility. Bad skills. But without exception. Their durations were very sore. Like a cranny. Alcoholics quick relace. But at this moment. They didn't consider weather. Sao Chun cold be mature. By common sense. On the battlefield. Time passed little by little. 5 seconds. 10 seconds. 20 seconds. Alpha mini. 50 seconds. The players. Emotions shifted from initial envy to uncertainty. Sock and numbness. The projection of the Lord of. The beast continued its relentless assault. But Sao Chun also timely activated the dothe skill of the. Upper armor in shoes of the Berlin set. Therefore. No matter what kind of attack regime. It had no. Effect at all. Due to the increased frequency of attacks. The misimbles of up Sao Chun's head appeared more. Frequently. So the players understood from start to finish that they had been in an invincible. Stay. Realizing this. All the players were stand. What the hell? What the hell? What the hell? Is there any justice left? Is there any law? 50 seconds of invincibility va? No. To be precise. It's been 53 seconds. I'm too many. This? This is one of. The trump cards of the great demon King Yang. I give up. It was really out of my mind to take on the mind. See this quest and go deliver a head to the big guy change. Vigil's face turned pale. His eyes lost. Focus. A matter to himself. What is this? Abba. Is this really the power that players can control at this stage? The entire servers and hackers who learned of this news on the forum were a linan approach. The decision made me. It. You're a walking GM. One. Sentence started flooding the screen. On the battlefield. Unknowingly. The projection team of the Lord of the B's had only 5 seconds left. His gastrointestinal chain. Which had initially been indifferent. Gradually turned to surprise. When there were only 4 seconds left. A. Suddenly stabbed his hand. Very good. You haven't encountered such interesting humans in a long time. The Lord of the B's looked deeply at Sao Chen. As if he wanted to remember him in his mind. So you rest still. And unjin. Interesting. Interesting. Ja ja ja. In the final moments. It felt as if the. Consciousness of his true self had descended. So. What are you planning todo? Sao Chen. Felt a bit of a chill on his scalp. But as the sign goes. When doente loce face in a battle. He greeted his t-san. Said his expression. Was quite a calm. Even known your name for a long time. Edmund and the. Others they were all killed by you. Right. That's right. He outchun admitted generously. Edmund was the first missing boss. A key. Dependent in the demon territory. So he had a deep impression. The other means. Since they were all one shot. Kills. He didn't think much of them. So he didn't think of a much of an. Impression very good. You have got to appreciate an opponent. Like you. The Lord of the. A be said meaning fairly. Yope. You can bring me some fun in the day. So come. After sign. Da. His. Projection suddenly disappear. The system prompt came in time. Tempereritas. Pursuit of the demon. Campas been. The Lord of the. The Lord of the. As. Since you're outstanding combat. Power truck. The projection. So he. Decided to recalde se board. Need se.

How can he be so chanless? Used what for me for al fallar. See if he don't instant kill this guy. I'll talk the rewards. After the task change. Mades. Sao Chen. Very tempted. But thinking about it. And that the difficulty must have increased many times. 1. 100.000. 100.000. Reputation and free attribute points. Plus 5. Missy quality. Trasure chest. And 10 points. Offward legend degree. It was actually harder than this one person versus one city task. Sao. Chen couldn't help but worry. The strength of the Lord of the. Bees was incredibly formidable. A. Projection. Adover 20 million base attack power. And the true sell. It must be. Over 45 million. Right? Not to mention the various passive buffs of the Lord of the. Bees. It made it and break a hundred million. And thinking about the various unknown skills. Bees by a level. 180. Music level existence. At this moment. Sao Chen's mood could only be described with. One word. Damn. Forget it. From now on. Yee. Just play it safe. I'll talk the probability. Of losing is extremely. If he run away. Is all still a besomne trump cards. Sao Chen toca. The breath. Finally managing to calm his emotions. Son.

Which may and see don't have it or slaughter al de NPCS in Bloodmon city. That's ups a lot of trouble. Mh. There are still tens of thousands of NPCS following. Sinade on site. Let's take them all out. Sao Chen made up his mind and rushed towards the NPCS a. The city gate. The battle had reached a point where. To use a trend defrast. It was already garbage time. The highest combat power of Bloodmon city. Sinade. Had already fallen. And the rest were like merry chickens. And dogs in front of Sao Chen. At the city gate. Apart from Sinade's loyal seborrnits. No. Other NPCS had chased out from the city. And Sao Chen actually didn't want to enter Bloodmon city. After all. It was one of the 20 main cities of the demon race. And who knows how many years it had. Existed since its establishment. There were probably mysterious defenses like city protection formations. And Sao Chen wasn't willing to take the risk. There was no need for that anyway. In any case. Sluttering al DNPCS a. The city gate. The goal complete the task. A minute later. The system sent a. Notification. Task eliminated. Danger in advance.

millions of players in cde yet the vast majority of players not only did not resenting but instead bland dn pcs for being ineffective and the main city for its poor capacity so what if a city lord

million players were in this era al searching for a way out and if there was one player in the entire city feeling the most respondent it to be prince vigil and remembered when it done the first music

sip reputation to restore his image in the eyes of so many members a good need to spend at least a million gold coins in compensation the entire dark lord guild would be severely weakened and that was given the main issue the main issue was the strength of the enemy which left him with no decided to resist if only he had been so arrogant back then unprovoked singe or if after he issued to conditions for the duel he had been so greedy maybe the outcome would have been better unfortunately as the chinese say one mispleads to another prince by he regretted it deeply a wish the cold travel

south chun exerted his strength and instantly live onto little black spot next destination let's go all right master all done die one person one mount instantly vanished from the spot it was unclear how mad team at past when a tall figure appeared in this location it was no nether than the lord of the abyss up until now south chun had already taken down 12 of the 116 humanoids both required for the third ring of the main quest this efficiency was simply astonishing after all it had been less than two weeks since they entered the demon clan's territory fortunately back then the celestial demon at moon actively informed the other boss locations otherwise to achieve such progress will have taken at least a month such and secretly rejoice now the progress of the main quest a turn it into plus 24 it team a mid-level boss and revival was discovered the progress increased by plus one but after defeating it the progress jumped to plus 2 the task rewards were determined based on performance so chun felt that if this passage continued it would likely receive the highest rewards after all if i were defeated what would there be left to explore perhaps the future racial faction wars would exist to exist however this probability was too small so in belief that the alone code not temporarily changed the overarching plot of the game it felt that the demon gods must have a backup message with a certain costar gods and lord's would revive according to the predetermined trajectory such thoughts were too far-reaching what's how inconsidered now was how to improve the completion of the main quest the next mid-boss is in the day forest map it will take a day to get there sao chun rode on sea os back and set off in the right direction however and the travel far when suddenly the game system issued a prompt system prompt your four-dimensional attributes plus one point a box going on sao chun was taken about there was no reason for this as and default monsters or level that why did his four-dimensional attributes increase by one point called it be a bug that was impossible i couldn't understand just as a west pandering another repeat prompt appear system prompt your four-dimensional attributes plus one point two system prompts exactly ten seconds apart now sao chun was completely astonished called it be that the ground to the point where even working and bleeding makes me stronger incredible of course this was just a subconscious remark in fact the setting of the world of the original at a strict numerical foundation and it was absolutely impossible for anything inexplicable to happen at that moment the third system prompt appear server announcement due to unknown reasons the original will update the version 2.0 in 10 minutes upgrade

understand what intrigues sao chen the most is the 7 system the free mode what kind of feature called it be anyway the system status that during the alph or update enters an invincibility buff state so sao chen lastly decides to stop in the middle of the road instead of going elsewhere to prevent any accidents even store xiao in the system space so on 10 minutes past in a flash sao chen's vision went dark and ten among all the features only the player forum was still accessible surprising so this is what free mode is like it's incredible finally critical hits have appeared go knows how difficult it was for me as an archer without them speculations about the update content come in and discuss monson pets are now available also one post after another flooded in and sao chen glanced at them finding no substantial content this was the first autonomous update in original and while there were rough guesses based on the update content list no one called accurately predict the specifics

the most about this update before the update players were in a system limited intelligent mode with the biggest limitation being that the h skills release and actions were fixed under was also a delay in skill release however the opening of the free mode does not limit actions or the delay time this meant that sao chen's attack frequency will be eager moreover skills like the silence as cold execute a 360 degree attack without that angles as long as the speed was fast and now amazing sao chen couldn't help but feel eager to try it out preparing to find the fury level monsters to practice on i had a feeling that this update would bring in tremendous improvements just as a summon xiao a suddenly a dead voice came from being deemed chen jie ebb looking for you for so long the emergence of the game's new features made sao chen very happy but the voice being deemed made his mood less pleasant even start telling him who was it that spoke such words in a dead male voice sounding almost like a resentful woman sao chen's face stiffened as a turn around and the next moment his pupils suddenly can track the before aims to the massive humanoid creature towering six meters tall it was

chengue so intense that she dared not get too close hiding a thousand meters away to live stream in fact it wasn't a use the conversation she had quietly crept over during the few seconds of battle between sao cheng and the lord of the beast therefore most of the battle process was witnessed by the viewers in the live stream wow it's actually the villania it was originally admiring the lofty spirit of the girl with the hydrogen balloon but it didn't expect to see such an exciting battle what a strong attack range so king please get a little closer it's too far to see clearly dozens of viewers gradually flooded into the live stream room and not a single newcomer was willing to live the numbers were few but the viewer was extremely excited and the variety of comments poured in likes no flakes who is a ochent and is undoubtedly the number one player in the entire server and as always appeared in the sight of all players with an invincible stance not long ago even accomplished the fate of singer handedly challenging and enter a main city causing blood moon city to enter a close state who would want to live when such a strong player is fighting guy clever boss especially when the opponent is the mysterious fallen angel who forced sao cheng to activate a 60 second invincibility tactic against the boss with just a projection in blood moon city such a battle is bound to attract attention so taking advantage of the moment when sao chen and the lord of the beast temporarily post the viewers in the live stream began to spread the world 1 passing it to 10 10 passing it

lasted only a brief 20 seconds and the battle resume there is in west simple during those 20 seconds the passive hatch per recovery from his equipment at restore sao chen sealt back to 100% and the lord of the beast for some unknown reason actually chose to he be up the advantage of flying and landed on the ground the last flying boss sao chen encountered was the demon king 12 in the cloud dream mars but he had to his flying advantage because sao chen used his life to set him giving himself a chance what made this lord of the beast he be up arrogance sao chen glanced at the lord of the abyss battle panel and noticed that his hp had also returned to 100% causing his age leads to twitch such a crazy recovery speed a level 180 music boss all attributes must have completely surpassed mine right with a fan can plan sao chen had already decided to retreat there was no way to stay in full fire power mode a canon ideal a maximum of 5% hp damage within 10 seconds at first glance it seemed quite impressive but 80% call down does not mean no call down at all and the scarcity of active skills meant that sao chen often a torilla yo normal attacks to make up for it moreover the lord of the beast the beast was not a sitting there sao chen's movements were quick but so were his many of his skills were died and any of the opponent's casual attacks as long as they hit him would cause his hp to drop significantly with the current display of recovery speed and considering the unknown skills emic pcs forget it he can't win anyway it's a bit unrealistic to challenge a level 180 musical boss at this stage sao chen made up his main predator pull out the random teleportation scroll to leave at any moment absolutely unwilling to let any of his equipment dra however before a living sao chen wanted to unleash his full power 11 mortos he used how far a cold push his limits dragon form impact dragon form bomb ultimate bomb the skills freshly cooled down were used without his attention

million in one second damn this is too exaggerated the senior you still say you're not cheating he in hell what about you guys this was actually the first time sao chen showcased his strongest output in front of the players leaving them all in all as the same goes without comparison there is no heart at this stage the highest output of mainstream players even with full-time buffs was only 2 to 3 000 sao chen's output was directly a thousand times bigger than theirs witnessing this scene all the viewers not only fell should but also gradually experienced a sense of inferiority how could they not feel inferior in the face of such a huge contrast they estimated that in their lifetime even if they poured out their last drop of sweat they would never catch up to that scene on the battlefield the confrontation between sao chen and the beast lord reached its final moment after being hit by desolation sa sand were destroying sword the beast lord's expression darkened instantly very well i haven't tested such heavy injurias in a long time you have successfully angered me now face my raza zonas the words fell the beast lord quickly what his magic wonder large area of pitch black clouds suddenly appeared in the sky and a vortex emerged at the center of the clouds directly above hea ochenshed you are a day more the live you die you will be sere moreover simply killing you is far to chip go and repent in the exile space the lord of the beast sedham and isly the next moment apure black dot appeared at the center of the vortex clearly visible against the backdrop of dark clouds the black dot gradually expanded turning into a massive gap the overwhelming power caused the heavens sanders to change color a tremendous subcution force ma de sao chen's body involuntarily drift toward the gap battle information the lord of the beast has released the forbidden spell dark space in the first phase you lose a 5% hp per second forbidden spell the prompt from the battle information along with the words of the lord of the beast ma de sao chen realized that this was not an ordinary attack message under the forbidden spell skill of this dark space perhaps that would be the best for an ordinary person it would be impossible to resist but fortunately sao chen was well prepared system prompt to you can find the use of random teleportation scroll yes if not now then when ain't that cold nte winning a one-on-one fight right now but what did that sign go don't underestimate the juice in poverty he became a month to develop and let's see who wins and who losses what sao chen didn't expect was that the bold nte need a month nearly a week had passed and his combat power had already crashed the lord of the beast but that's a story for later let's not get into that for now under the forbidden spell dark space would be next time we may be a ye ye make you die sao chen what his ha lightly and his entire figure instantly vanished leaving the lord of the beast standing there with a still expression the girl with the hydrogen balloon became a popular because she live streamed the battle between sao chen and the lord of the beast this life is true video was very short lasting less than a minute but the topics it showcased were incredibly strong 30 million damage per second a level 180 music boss this allowed sao chen to demonstrate his true combat ability in front of the general player base setting aside the external attention sao chen began to assess his surroundings after using the random teleportation scroll the range was limited to the current factions territory so it was still waiting in the domain of the demon race what appeared before sao chen was an endless expanse of ice the cold wing was biting and everywhere was a witte desolate scene according to the game systems built in map this was the northernmost area of the demon race's territory the extreme core dicefield sawing glance at the coordinates had learned from the sky demonet moon down from a in the entire extreme core is a field there is only one missing boss but it's too far from my location it will take at least five days to reach this place was far too close to the north with very few living creatures around this had some negative impact on his progress in continuing the main storyline however time was ample so sao chen was staying ahead but the biggest problem before him was how to avoid the next pursuit by the lord of the beast after the previous battle sao chen had to admit that his strengths was far inferior to the lord of the beast they were simply not on the same level now that a used the only random teleportation scroll if it were to be found by the lord of the beast again the situation would be direct as the master of the entire demon faction sao chen held no illusions about whether a cold before staying in the demon race's territory is too dangerous if he were to be killed by the lord of the beast and drapsome equipment it would be augerless moreover if he were to be controlled and unable to die it would be even more tragic say if only a david more time to develop sao chen said silently contemplating his strategy the best course of action for now was to temporarily abandon the third ring of the main storyline and return to the human race's territory to high wanting until his strengths was comparable to that of the lord of the beast before returning to the demon race's territory to room battle to giao chen was confident at no guarantee of how long this process would actually take more over the mind quest would definitely be the lad yous thinking about this madde giao chen feel a bit and willing what can it on auto quickly increase my strengths giao chen silently checked his inventory hoping for something helpful numerous legendary

the human mars had in the edit and some enchanting materials which had been sitting idle in his backpack now that the game had been updated they called views but the improvement could likely be minimal and the good have to return to the human race to find an npc to use them similarly for mounts and pets basically have to return to the human mind city to obtain them truly released one chance the chances of getting them in the wild where to lose or what was last sao chen can track the items in his backpack and suddenly his eyes lit up item ancient ruins entrance ticket this dungeon entrance ticket dropped from the demon king doors and since it required lv 80 to enter it had been sitting in the corner of his backpack now that they had found it sao chen felt a glimmer of open an ancient dungeon it must be something extraordinary sao chen murmured to himself from the background story of the primordial the fortest event was a war of gods that swept across the entire continent 3 000 years ago about 3000 years clearly called the big head ancient at most it called big head antiquity therefore ancient must refer to an even more distant era iope it can find a way to quickly increase my strength in there otherwise for safety reasons it will have to temporarily lift the demon camp sao chen made up his mind to explore this ancient room first after all it was already a lv 79

it with force in the next moment everything before his eyes blur and the found himself in a decelitring system prompt you have era i at the continent of ara destroyed after the ancient god war 100 000 years ago ancient god war the destroyed continent ara south chen westakeneva the name of this continent fell very familiar to him what exactly is it south chen pander deeply finally i remember before the real world was destroyed i applaud an old single player game out of boredom which sintobi kallet taxi milk powder and warriors and its background story was the continent of ara this game being computer operated had no advantages against the many full-scale online games if it weren't for saocheng feeling pity for it and giving it a try it could probably be kallet the most miserable game in history because from start to finish saocheng found that it was the only player however because it lost interest after clearing it saocheng decisively quit the game and now hearing about the continent of ara and the original made in ponde is it a coincidence or is there some mysterious connection saocheng from a used then a pleasant female voice suddenly came warrior long team no see clearly it was a ruin so how could there be someone moreover this female voice sounded so familiar saocheng herriedly turned his head and saw a girl in a green dress standing before him this girl had the distinctly pointed ears of the phrase delicate features resembling a princess from a panting and was currently guessing at saocheng with dreamy eyes celia saocheng instinctively blurted out he said filled with astonishment this girl was the game guide from the game toxic milk powder and warriors the elf girl who ran through the entire game storyline saocheng still remembered that during his travels celia donce said will you come back make sure to remember me okay it will always what for you her voice and expression were so charming that they left a deep impression on saocheng and they felt a sense of reluctance a that time if celia and t been a paper character evolved the other way that time saocheng talked his departure was a final farewell but never expected to see celia again now in the original what do is this man called it be that the background story of the original is about the continent of arat from 100 000 years ago at this moment celia spoke thousand night warrior seeing you safe and sound he can finally rest easy celia has talked of you for a hundred thousand years and in this moment i am truly so happy celia's eyes skin ted with joy resembling to crescent moons clearly she actually knew saocheng the unexpected situation left saocheng somewhere dry mouth and the hered liasque what exactly happened can you tell me about it sure celia pouted her lips seeming a bit disappointed that saocheng did the first show concern for her but she still followed his instructions and began to narrate countless years ago the great creator god carozo created the planet terra and later the people of terra hochen already had some memory of the background story of the arab continent and celia's narration didn't differ much from his recollection only adding some details legendas it that countless years ago the creator god opened a planet in the universe calle terra the terra civilization was born on this planet and later the civilization somehow created 12 ancient gods tc 12 ancient gods learned that the essence of terra called criata 13 so they demanded that the terra civilization can over this essence but how could the people of terra agree thus a great war broke out this battle was known as the war of the ancient gods subsequently the planet terra split into regions such as the celestial realm the demon realm and the void nation collectively known as the arab continent after countless years of war the divine war erupted once again ultimately the ancient gods becoming that the earth shattered and the entire arab continent turned into ruins with a living beings and the ben the ancient gods perishing the creator god began in his strengths so of the use of the laws of time to restart the entire timeline of the continent everything was about to start the new however the creator god carosuar was not omniscient and omnipotent this restart required a necessary condition which was the need for a contractor realizing this he used his last bit of power to resurrect celia as the decimosegunda puzzle celia peces the power to know everything so carosuar has kept her to help guard the broken arat cantenent and what for the contractor's appearance this what lasted celia 400 000 years until sao chen seraibe after finishing her brief narration celia took out an ancient a golden scroll and handed it to sao chen thousand night warrior this is the contract as long as you sing your name on the contract the timeline of the arab continent will be reopened celia looked a sao chen eagerly hoping a good degree system prompt do you agree to the contract note agreeing will lead to unpredictable changes the systems timely demand her mother sao chen gc tabi after thinking for a moment as signing a name is simple but what benefits do you get from restarting the arab continent although i didn't know why the game poisoned milk powder and warriors which had a player level cap of only lv 90 would appear in the world background of primordial this change seemed to bring only benefits and no drawbacks for sao chen after all i was the only one who experienced poisoned milk powder and warriors from its release to its remove this meant that in the entire primordial world in the development of the platan cold gang kitea few advantages what puzzle sao chen however was that the arab continent was clearly at a lower level than the primordial world what kind of changes would the restart bring to the entire world the systems prompt made in worry that this changes may develop in a negative direction therefore a bolden ted oanity in that had no benefits on the other hand celia tilted her head revealing a strange expression benefits as the contractor who opens the arab continent you will become a lord of the arab continent a lord is it as imagine sao chen seartster but still mantana can demeaner and continue to ask how many lords can the arab continent have and what rights do the lords possesses silia explained ea charia can have at most one lord such as the stone emir is no fiel and you as the contractor will become the lord of the dungeon possessing the rights to utilize the entire areas equipment story the followers of dungeon professionals recruit adventures setup regional trial nests and so on and one more thing after becoming the lord of the dungeon you can freely use all the professions within the entire dungeon equipment story professionals that is the followers of npcs switching between major professions at will sao chen west and this benefit was simply to agree it was equivalent to being a planner as for the professions as a former pleasure experience sao chen understood that the dungeon had basic professions like demon sportsman magic cleric assassin fighter and guzling hair h basic profession at four advanced branches after awakening and the second transfer they had a very professional strengths compared to the current world of original although there were no hidden professions the professional strengths would be significantly eager and after becoming the lord of this dungeon edin te plant a work in isolation with the ability to recruit adventurers it would definitely promote the major professions therefore sao chen west truly move all right y egrito this contract sao chen immediately signed his name the next moment the dark golden contract scroll transformed into a beam of golden light and instantly vanished the surrounding ruins began to gradually revive used then silia suddenly swailles laili oh he forgot to mention one thing signing the contract only grants you the qualification to become the lord of the dungeon in reality to truly become the lord you need to undergo a trial what sao chen west taken aback looking at silia with a hint of reproach why didn't you say that earlier silia plafelista out her tongue if he had said it earlier you make not have agree he don't want to what another hundred thousand years sao chen west and it didn't realize that for him it was just an opportunity but for silia it was a what of a hundred thousand years a hundred thousand years a coin te imagine how silia didn't you're alone for that long regardless it must have been an incredibly long what sao chen's expressions soften all right you won't blame you this team hearing this silia stepped forward and talk sao chen's right hand that and said thank you brave warrior of the thousand knights let's not talk about that tell me what conditions are in a death to become the lord of the dungeon sao chen as que a qualified dungeon lord needs to undergo many trials to become a junior

unleashed ultimate bomb boom the cave beneath his feet shook a few times the next moment alten slaughter go and demon sword puppets fell down it was a one-sided defeat unfortunately perhaps because it was a quest dung geon this monsters did not drop any equipment or items sao chen was somewhat curious about how the equipment from poison milk powder and warriors will change in the original but now a cold only temporarily suppress his curiosity no ruse and he'll be the chance to find out later after defeating all the monsters present adora peered out of scenery in front of sao chen i remember that the wall in cave had a total of six levels and the first level was the easiest so it didn't get khaki and woke straten the scene flashed and the background was still the same cave however unlike

exit to see of ordinary musical level basis of the same level i'll talk and expect it and can still handle it sao chen from it starting from this level he decided not to activate precious buff state skills such as a lead sword there are tears of the stars etc as a bold and the viable to clear the level in just a few seconds however even so it only took a little more effort as the battle team extended sao chen's various passive skills that is stacked upon his attack power increased accordingly this is the typical example of becoming stronger the more you fight the damage from the monster apopis and the aerial pantom however was quite limited the h attack called only take away 2 to 300 000 hp even the charge ultimate move barely broke a million but in free mode sao chen's movement speed was very fast and the since of this charge ultimate moves were too obvious except for the first one which euset totes the damage the rest did not hit him so on the monster apopis and the aerial pantom fell this level took a total of 40 seconds the difficulty of the the 4th and 5th levels was not much different from the 3rd level it is worth mentioning that the sword shadow of the monster apopis appeared again in tc 2 levels at the same time the boss of the 5th level lv 88 skeleton cane ancient epic actually picked up the demon sword man and sword merge that one the attributes were

the restart of the barat continent storyline most players in the server began to speculate about the future direction of the game many streams also rode the wave of popularity for a moment then tire world of original west basing with discussion however this had nothing to do without whom for the team being because after clearing the wall in cave on king difficulty reappear it in the ancient ruins fassing the adorable celia and no thoughts at that focusing entirely on exploring the new profession a pan looking a ways instantly overjoyed dung geon lord is actually of the ancient musical tier which means that leaching senior dung geon lord is equivalent to the strengths of an ancient musical quality boss this is much stronger than a beginner war god template for a beginner war god is an ordinary mid-level oncey sets the beginner title its ultimate growth efficiency and cap are merely that of an ordinary mid-level however the ancient mid-level as can be seen from the boss attributes

dung geon npcs warehouse for items below lv 60 can recruit 500 adventures can freely change professions among little black me a terrifying panel with a minimum of 33 million and a maximum of nearly 50 million strength and other attributes have at least a bell although the base attributes only increased by 100% after the hope change from a mathematical perspective some attributes have far more than this bonus is the difference between 100 by 300% and 200 by 300% use the 100 pulgadas from no it's the multiplication is out of 300 for example the strength attribute originally south chain strength was only around 5 million with a base attribute of about 1.8 million there is being entirely from equipment and skills but after 1.8 million became 3.6 million under various bonuses it's you to to 17 6 million terrifying even now if so ing where to face the beast the mongot a good be confident that the bold and the fall being in a sort time in fact amicable take him down in mongot after being excited for a while so interlucked at the new permissions that appeared after becoming a beginner dung geon lore custom mall can select 10 npc followers warehouse for items below lv60 can recruit 500 adventures each of tc for permissions made so chance is widening a mass man therefore at this moment new functions appeared in his system interface there is no need to elaborate on the custom mall all the customs from toxic milk powder and warriors appear in the mall with each custom having a story quantity of 99 pieces which sao chan can claim for free each custom can slightly enhance attributes collecting a full set grand seven more percentage bonus is although it's not much it looks cool being a stylish man is great in addition to customs there were more items in the mall such as the pandora's box remis assistance and so on which made the sound draw unfortunately as a beginner dung geon lore had no permissions and everything displayed was great only by labeling up to intermediate good new permissions beyond the the qt to recerex 10 npcs was also easy to understand it simply meant finding 10 npcs in the dung geon resurrecting them and having them as followers sao chan called slowly pick from the npc list so there was no rules for that the lv60 warehouse meant that sao chan called freely clam all equipment below lv60 from the toxic milk powder 5 hundred adventures represented that sao chan called recruit 500 little brothers but what surprised him the most was the last lying a code freely switched to any profession in the dung geon demon sportsman gunslinger fighter cleric assassin mage as long as sao chan wanted a code switch between tc professions that will immediately sao chan switched to gunslinger system notification you have switched to the gunslinger profession system notification you have transformed into the awakened gunslinger note your weapon the ruler's sword has transformed into a revolver and the skills you possess can now be used with the revolver why switched to gunslinger the answer was simple cool the gunslinger is an awakened profession of the roaming gunslinger logically speaking with sao chan's level a code have transformed into the second awakened profession wing of the sky however perhaps beka was currently a beginner dung geon lord with insufficient permission seri mandat the gunslinger stage but this was already an opto surprise sao chan first after switching professions evolved to be restricted by the profession which would prevent the use of mine and secondary weapons instead they would change to the corresponding appearance for example the ruler sword transformed into the appearance of a revolver the night shield became an auxiliary stone hanging at sao chan's was second after switching professions his skill 3 interface displayed to rose one side sawed various skills of the beginner war god such as dragon impact ultimate bomb and so on the other side displayed the new corresponding skills that appeared after becoming a gunslinger such as the revolver had sought and spray fear the output of the gunslinger skills was much bigger than that of the beginner war god the at revolver increases critical damage and penetration silver bullet at bullet attributes to attacks revolver master increases base attack power and improves critical hit chances spray fear all around area output 491% attack power per bullet at level 1 increasing by 49,9% per level mobile shooting 30 bullets 450% attack per bullet at level 1 increasing by 45.7% per level francis slaughter a first awakening skill multiple strikes 37.0.77% total skill output the music level equipment increased skill level effects to lv 22 triggering a skill a the significant increase after looking at the skill list saw chan was pitless for a long time so strong in the face of this skills my beginner war god skills are simply a little brother the ones strongest output so often it is surprising like and even compared to a small skill of the gunslinger profession for example lv 23 spray fear one bullets 1588.8 attack and feathery bullet hits a single targeted bullet stem it at least around 20 000 a 200 fold skill output matchy greater than the 120 fold sword of annihilation which seemed to have disappeared besides spray fear there were even stronger output skills like double angle spin and frenzy slaughter it was simply incredibly powerful after looking at it saw chan admitted that inflated with the current panel plus the super strong output skills all right if the lv 180 music levis lord dare stopir before me if he don't take him down in a mini evolved and deserve my invincible attributes and the surprises don't stop there system notification you have a transition to a new class berserker note your weapon the sword of domination as transformed into a heavy cannon and the skills you pcs can now be released to cinde heavy cannon system notification you have a transition to a new class mechanical war go note your weapon the sword of domination as transformed into an automatic rifle and the skills you pcs can now be released to cinde automatic rifle system notification you have a transition to a new class mind empire system notification you have a transition to a new class soul sign system notification you have a transition to a new class god slayer a total of 53 classes and saw chan can switch classes at will in just one second after switching classes all the newly appeared skills in the skill list can be released this means for example after sao chan uses the gun god skill frenzy slaughter it can immediately switch to swords a internal list extreme demon soul technique storm style realizing this sao chan was overjoyed the awakening skills of each class have similar outputs out of the 53 classes all except 4 the maje branch creator have awakening skills this means that even without activating the cold on reduction state sao chan can seamlessly output using awakening skills it's terrifying after seeing this sao chan was scared himself there was only one thought in his mind and thought in his mind he saw chan amin vincere after silently marveling at this if i nearly come down and turn to look at celia beside him how can he advance to intermediate and advanced lord with such an incredible boost as a junior lord what would it be like at the intermediate and advanced levels so chan was eager to know the message however celia poured cold water on him it's not possible for now celia struck showing a regretful expression the canteen and to farah as used to start it and there is no way for you lord senia to pass other trials or light then how long will it take so chan aske that depends on your level of effort celia smile the timeline for the restart of the continent of arad does not start from the very beginning of the world terra that progresses from low to a gradual increasing for example at the beginning only the elven defense line appear and the trial dungeons that emerged were the simplest like laurent and the depths of laurent etc next there will be the middle middle area westria dungeons like the thunder ruins etc and to increase the progress you lord siangia need to recruit many adventures to collectively enhance your strengths got it so chan wait his way he had been thinking too optimistically indeed becoming a dungeon lord man stacking on the responsibility of restarting the continent of arad ray but it was more than willing to bear this responsibility because the privileges of a dungeon lord were simply too enticing without further add to you still me where to start so chan looked at celia let me think oh got it celia seem to be recalling something her eyes suddenly brightened and she pulled out a stone from nowhere this is an item given to me by the creator god carries and as long as you place it on the continent you can get started so chan talk it and look item core of the arad continent description special use can be applied to the restart plan of the arad continent find the region to autonomously increase progress okay understood it definitely wouldn't be useful right now so chan placed the core of the arad continent in his backpack even after leaving the ancient ruins the ground beneath the feet was still waiting the realm of the demon race chan had no intention of binding the location here such an opportunity was to or air if it were to bind it it would have to be from yanja town his own territory wasn't it more appealing thinking of this chan turned to celia answered i'm planning to live here are you coming with me or what celia an npc let's out chan unsure of how to handle her so i decided to let her make her own choice of course i'm going to live with you celia showed sao chan a glare pretending to be angry as she questioned if i wanted for you for a hundred thousand years are you really going to leave me sao chan wipe the sweat from his brow who will have a talk that an npc from a single-player game once a plot called actually appear in the world of origin the opportunities in life are truly marvelous on the frigidice planes sao chan and celia's figures appeared out of cine wow it's so cold here celia hugged her shoulders sibering she was still wearing a sword scare because she had died before and due to the minimal power can zumba y curosa torreserek her celia had no strength at all is said from being immortal eternally useful she was merely a guy four quests sao chan posed for a moment and used his dung lord privileges to pull out a set of christmas costumes from the dressing show the red flash coat looked festive on celia during the time you've lost your strengths and you protect you sao chan promised earnestly celia nadi happily mmm after that sao chan summoned xiao eyan with celia in his arms jumped onto xiao eisba ten e set off in the direction of the human race on the map with his current strengths within the demon brazes territory a code basically ignore all bases except for the lv 180 of his lord even when facing the abyss lord sao chan was completely confident therefore the third fast of the mind quest posed almost no difficulty for him after all there were still 139 days left for the quest which was more than an optime the current mind task was to buy in the core of the arat cantenent a chenietown and find a way to accelerate the progress of restarting the arat cantenent there by indirectly enhancing his own strengths so after a brief moment of talk sao chan decided to temporarily release the third phase of the mind quest besides ea already lost interest in the rewards of this mind quest musical quality trashure chest what a joke after seeing the equipment warehouse for dungeons below lv 60 chao chan had lost interest in ordinary musical equipment item el as ultimate blade quality ancient epic slat blade equipment requirement lv 60 slash demoness boardman slash warrior physical attack 117000 magical attack 131 000 strengths 2000 agility 2000 trade 1 all skills below lv 85 plus lv 3 trade 2 when attacking there is a 5% chance to increase your own attack power by 15% for 60 seconds item

quality equipment had in the changing the world of origin attributes that are even superior to the same of ordinary me quality items of the same level with the only drawback being that it has fewer built-in skills if it weren't for south chance equipment being alevable lv 77 a good inventory plus all 5 pieces of armor on the left of course no matter how powerful it is it still palcing can parecen to dlv 180 mid quality sword of the ruler so it has no intention of changing the one on the right however dlv 60 ancient epic quality equipment is already this outstanding what if successfully advances to an intermediate or advanced dungeon lord and guns access to higher level equipment ball therefore so chen has lost interest in ordinary me quality equipment the mind quest can be put on all for now the priority is to tackle the dungeon first with his mind made up sao chen to auxilia and quickly spread towards the human territory on the back of little black after becoming a junior dungeon lord sao chen's agility attribute sky equity his movement speed increased significantly as well little blacks bonuses are calculated based on its own movement speed so they move it quickly alpha they later they crossed the extreme cold disciplines it's worth mentioning that they took out the only demon lord in this area along the way the process was simple almost a one hit kill leaving sao chen sam with unsatisfier after leaving the extreme cold disciplines they entered the map calle de upper desert following that were the dead forest the hundred thousand mountains and the cloud dream mars sao chen drew a strat line taking down every demon creature encounter along the way just as a was about to cross out of the dead forest suddenly a figure blocked his pass it was the lv 180 mid quality boss the lord of the abyss mm it didn't expect to run into you so soon again you must say you're lucky is quite poor the lord of the abyss is milke that message you set to escape last time with quite precious but you wanna see if you can run away this time you's thinking about how it confidently unleashed a forbidden spell last time only to return empty-handed feel the lord of the abyss with immense killing intent towards sao chen if word got out that a creature much weaker than him at successfully escaped boldened that via disgrace therefore this time it would not be overconfident and was prepared for a quick resolution coincidentally sao chen had the same plan my luck is poor no you're mistaken it's your luck that's poor sao chen instructed little black to take celia to a safe spot nearby then turn it to the lord of the abyss with a beaming smile want to kill me you're not the same as before a little brother with that it pulled out a revolver and fired a lv 22 had shot first boss the bullet flew so fast that the lord of the abyss didn't have timeto the act and was hit right between the eyes critical hit minus 11 million 990 000 a terrifying number popped up the lord of the abyss g without any passive buffs used to bear skill it broke the 10 million mark directly terrifying this n was witnessed by a demon girl player hidden in the sadows who live streamed the girl hydrogen balloon felt a bit travel after previously live streaming the brief battle between the thousand night demon king and the lv 180 mid quality boss here streamed adding the head gun viral and she received a total of 90 gold coins and tips which made her extremely happy even talked the thousand night demon king at left later her unique cynic player status kept the viewer counting her streamed about 10 000 however despite the large number of viewers the tips were too few on average she didn't even receive 10k per coins per hour at this rate how am i suppose to end gold coins stroke live streaming hydrogen balloon talked feeling frustrated in a state of dispersion no longer for attention to the salty fish viewers in the life stream she was also ready to leave the dead forest and go somewhere else to enjoy the scenery however during the process of living she suddenly discovered that she had encountered the demon king chenya battling the lv 180 musical boss what a coincidence the girl hydrogen balloon quickly and the light streamed at the battlefield the scene that unfolded some cause the uge aprora close the entire world region south chance you the gains the lord of the the views and the viewers in the life stream into a frenzy wow it's the demon king and again battling this single boss the streamers like is used to good in just a few days to encounter the dianya twice amazing by the way is this really the dianya is the warrior what is it holding a revolver oh my god we didn't even notice this situation as you for 11 990 000 amazing things over 10 000 viewers began to doubt they're on ice ever since the south chance appeared in the public eye it always been a warrior a a don't say chance to the destroyer class making all players in the server understand how powerful a hidden classic was one of the top 10 guilds in the server the overlord guild a the venturne against the minan attempt to seize the destroyer class transfers crawl moreover three days ago south chance class was still a junior wargo this was displayed on all the leaderboards but now what were they seeing this man who always represented the pinnacle of the warrior class in the server at suddenly transformed into an anger of gunslinger moreover a casual skill hit dlv 180 musical boss and delta terrifying output of 11 990 000 instantly all the viewers in hydrogen by john's live stream code no longer remain calm is this the class of the dungeon lord terrifying socking incomprensible one by one the viewers in sock began to call their friends and family the number of viewers in the life stream started to increase at an incredible speed on the other side the battle between sao chen and the lord of the beast had already entered a heated fast the output of the skill had shot was in the terrifying but dlv 180 musical boss the lord of the beast satan did not have weak defenses a simple skill called not the all such damage therefore this was under the premise that sao chen had activated buffs like elite sword their elite sword die their revolver silver bullet and others in advance 11 990 000 was equivalent to the final output of silence last when alba's worsta quite impressive had shot this used a small skill if a small skill can the all such a good output then the gunslingers be skills and even awakening skills must be of the charts sao chun himself felt a secret thrill his air tracing with excitement in contrast the lord of the beast the beast was one of the adventure eclazis in the arad continent but it had long lost all traces after the destruction of the arad continent a hundred thousand years ago in the current background of the original it belonged to the era of the demon god swiss almost no connection to firearms or technology even some incredible creations like the giant enhancement machines standing in the human royal city were merely creations of the celestial clan and this was the ina ability of the celestial clan it was a technology that a very significant figure of the celestial clan called master so when sao chan a human pulled out a revolver the lord of the beast was left to found the because this was a situation

problem was not used that they wanted to kill sao chen but whether sao chen was in the mood to lay him go after the magic shield disappeared with his current 11 hp a cold and the withstand ever a second fortunately as one of the strongest bases currently has quite a few life-saving skills with a wave of his one he was instantly enveloped in a blood red light shield battle information the lord

musical boss is indeed formidable but what would is a mere 30 seconds of invincibility with the ability to switch between 53 different classes my skills are in a state of unlimited firepower coupled with the cold only dacson from the primary war god class even awakening skills can be unleashed without interruption sao chen scoffed quietly today a good slide the lord of the beast what sao chen said was final no one called chen that the lord of the beast was doomed in the life-stream room of the gel namet hydrogen balloon at this moment the number of viewers had already surpassed 1 million the million viewers who had witnessed sao chen series of skills were all without exception boiling over like a pot about to overflow what class is the dianje really there are firearms machinery warriors and armed combat cities even a magic wand the variety of weapons the dianje uses is this the incredible aspect of musical quality equipment is the person upstairs stupid this is clearly related to the dianese class the primary dung geon lord is simply unbelievable strong if my combat power is 1 point then the dianjas combat power is 1 million points this man is still asterefying acb he has major class awakening skills at their outstanding effects for example the great gun satayite ray was a massive with a beam of light that almost pierced rogaben and there's flickering with

attack guy voice fist manifested a gigantic steel fist out of sin air sending the lord of the abyss fly his dooms the storm the war gods war god kick elementals meteoric annihilation 1 awakening skill after another rabid the surroundings of sao chen and the lord of the abyss beyon recognition all of this left the viewers in the life stream room utterly stand bewildered they didn't understand the reason at the same time the so-kinteriors was overwhelming moreover the skill sao chun and lit covered different classes so the weapons transformed into corresponding long swords fire arms stern staffs magic ones and so on it was simply incomprensible and now because the lord of the abyss adaptively activated invincibility sao chun who had posed his offensive was actually maintaining the awakening state of the bayana battle go class transform into bayana a towering figure of 5 meters stood suspended in midair in his hand a terrifying looking king long jangyue blood seemed like a dating carnate all of this left the players completely bewildered were they really playing the same game as sao chun on the forum as the ceasefire period ended the scene of sao chun battling the lord of the abyss again began to flat the screen the so-king and magnificent skills the unbelievable class transformations left all the unlockers um found the the topic was of the charts hearing that the battle was still ongoing the life stream room of the demon girl hydrangea balloon instantly became the most laively life stream room in the entire server without exception during the fast when sao chun posed the number of viewers entering the life stream room directly surpassed 100 million countless people were excitedly discussing he also looked forward to the next battle between sao chun and the lord of the abyss on the battlefield the lord of the abyss having endured various awaken skills no longer darest to underestimate sao chun's strengths now that the 30 seconds of invincibility has begun the horn of counter-attack sounds abyssal magi elfide eye of destruction the lord of the abyss wings the staff in his hand quickly unleashing skills various attacks are thrown at sao chun as if they cost nothing minus 1 y 31 million minus 1.67 million minus 1 y 15 million evap sao chun's head uge blood red numbers pop up however the damage has been reduced significantly compared to a few days ago in front of his current 34.66 million hp and recovery speed it hardly hurts at all this is not only be cause as advanced from a junior war got to a dungeon lord but also due to the damage reduction status gone from transforming into bayana the damage is low and so chun can also do the skills or use the skill and learn from the chun can to do the best of evade this is an unexpected surprise after becoming a junior dunggion lord with two skills three existing simultaneously sao chun can not only unleash skills from his current class but also do is not affect the release of junior war got skills epsis double the class skills simply put under the bayana battle got class sao chun can unleash both bayana battle got skills and junior war got skills the same applies when transforming into other classes therefore overall sao chun's hp crisis very slowly and they stole as it to activate the invincibility stay of his musical equipment then to be cautious he activates the domain of stellar power and sao chun's attribute surge the output of the lord of the beast is completely a joke in front of him it can only be described into words scrapping so on the lord of the beast realizes this from him the ordinary skills no longer pose any threat to him what a has it in just a few days what kind of fortuitous encounters as it become a disformidable the lord of the abyss are trembles attack and defense are all crushed a real ice is that a snow longer a match for this immortal human in front of him if it bear in t for his various life saving trump cards a gold have been slant lonago however the current situation has not chun because the 30 seconds of invincibility from absolute defense is about to end once the invincibility team is over a will surely face another storm-like attack from the opponent the lord of the beast has no choice about torre leace another life saving ability battle information the lord of the beast has the skill that miracle be covering 20% of his hp every second for 30 seconds and reducing additional damage taken by 50% this skill has ample healing gun significant damage reduction effects no wonder is a lv 180 music boss has so many trump cards it's still not easy to take him down watch unsaillently reflects if other players outside and he saw they good sure this go the lv 180 music boss the lord of the beast although not as strong as the lv 200 final the mongot is not far off it will take 10 000 players above lv 180 all equipped with at least golden quality gear to take down the lv 200 final the mongot therefore to defeat the lord of the beast at least 8 000 players are in the end now a single-handedly donate a lv 80 satisfying combat power and is still not satisfied are you trying to reach the heavens the battle continues clearly there is no way to instantly kill the lord of the beast now so sao chun simply pauses his output and begins to test his endurance man how come one say day are not persistent right sao chun quickly started and transformed into a minceker in an instant the minceker and a walking class of the basic profession paladin is one of the two healing classes among the 53 not only do is it possess numerous powerful buff skills but it's healing the output as also it new eggs after completing the class change he out in big and twin guy the lord of the beast in a standing fight mode you use a skill you use a big amorto last it use other invincible skills like that has las hp drops the news the ala beat the strong attack skill that comes with the sword of the menace and also replenishes 30 of the output to his own hp for a moment but it is where at a stalemate meanwhile the viewers in the live stream gradually go to set to south chance abnormality from the initial so can

dwarves who were a yet wish the demon tribe expressed their ignorance to see sao chen in the future however to see with grace against sao chen like the emperor and by hill fell silent sao chen's strengths already surpassed all players in the server now transitioning from a junior warlord to an even more formidable junior lord left them all in despair they realized that throughout their lives they might never catch up to sao chen's passing on the battlefield time passed second by second the lord of the ebis ended the maintenance of dark miracle and immediately used his two life-saving trump cards the moon gods protection and the ebis resonance sao chen had experienced the effects of the moon gods protection before and on the lord of the ebis this skill lasted for a full 60 seconds ebis resonance reduced the final damage taken by the lord of the ebis by 99% for 60 seconds when the latter's duration ended the lord of the ebis did not use any other life saving skills out of tricks are a week yao chen's file yao chen was right the lord of the ebis was in the head out of tricks almost all of his life saving cards at ben used that now he was starting to think about escaping there was no choices yao chen was used to terrifying his output couldn't compare his tankiness was also far from and out the lord of the ebis initial confidence in a guaranteed kill gradually turned into self-doubt ultimately reaching a state filled with fear right now i am not in a state of total victory can he maintained big combat power so he haven't actually lost the lord of the ebis satan comforted himself with self-deception and prepared to flee what the talk that some memory as the master of the ebis within the ebis territory had a combat power enhancement effect and the mysterious magic formations in the ebis territory greatly boosted his strengths the speaker volume and raise next time we may it will make you pay the price before a living the lord of the ebis called nte helped but throw out a harsh remark with his flying ability i believe the scaping sold nte be a big problem however did they ask sao chen if they agree to escape lv 22 frenzied slaughter lv 22 extreme the monster technique stone style two skills were instantly unleashed they completely enveloped the ebis lord's domain within the attack range minus 3 and 34 million minus 3 and 34 million minus 4 and 17 million countless damage values erupted from above the ebis lord's head i get gilletty attribute allowed sao chen's attack speed to reach an unbelievable level we see a chest strike displaying a red critical hit if now all of sao chen's passive skills were fully stacked and his attack had surpassed 100 million even if the ebis lord was at full hp evolved and the viable to withstand it let alone in this current state of low ealbis lord flying upwards at the speed instantly at that remaining hp cleared in the end didn't even have a team for a final word before losing a life since lv 180 music el boss the ebis lord has fallen in the life-stream room of the gill with the hydrogen balloon countless viewers had long anticipated this scene so there was no surprise however when the fact truly occurred the steel coasts are ugester across the entire server dam the lv 180 music el boss was taken down so easily it didn't even take 10 minutes that the chenya is terrifying are there any basis in the original that can match him the answer is no i'm just curious what is the profession of the great demon king chenya and why do you have so many skills a battle that was a complete crush the great demon king chenya is invincible in the eyes of the players the lv 180 music el boss in the original belong to the top tier of bases there were probably no more than 10 that were stronger a boss of this level according to the current player development would likely take at least five years to passively defeat yet the reality was that in less than five months since the server opened it was taken down by isa chenina one on one five this was not some exploit or tricky thanks to the timely live broadcast of the hydrogen balloon dentire battle process was visible everywhere on the forum players who watched the process understood deeply this battle from start to finish was a complete crashing victory the various incredible skills displayed by isa chen during the fight alone with the transitions between profession and equipment were truly so keen so chen now without a doubt was the embodiment of invincibility in the original initially so meto players felt jealousy towards so chen thinking was just a lucky guy who relied on chance of believing they would eventually surpass him however now any player still holding such shots was used to be full system notification you have a

The Lord of the Beds dropped only a piece of equipment. With. Nothing Else. This Musical Quality One has decent attributes but can only be used by the Mage Class. However, as a Junior Dungeon Lord, Sao Chen can actually use most class equipment as. Lona Sechang is his class. All equipment like Bow's and Priest's tabs are excluded as their are no. Corresponding Class is in the Arab Continent. However, the attributes of this one are a match. Worst than the Dominator Source or Sao Chen is not interested at that. Ancient Musical Quality Equipment. Of the Sama Level is far superior to Ordinary Musical Quality Equipment. Moreover, the Enhancement. Effects of Equipment can only exist on the Enhance Equipment. The plus 10 enhancement attributes of the. Dominator Sword do not transfer to other equipment. Just an Ordinary Musical Trash Equipment. The deity plus the Dominator Sword will definitely be because a job stronger ancient equipment. Sao Chen matter to himself and then prepare to live. As for how to deal with the one. With the effect of lowering the equipment requirement level. It won't be long before many players are awaiting for the. Equipment. At that time, Sao Chen will use he be to whoever he finds pleasing. Or a cold CG. Anyway, we said unge on warehouse. It won't take care about equipment at all. Don't be full. By the fact that it currently only has a warehouse for levels below LV60. Once his class. Advanced to intermediate Lord or advanced Lord in the future. Eager permissions will definitely be in line. So Sao Chen don't take care at all about this one. Sao Chen summon back Xiao Wei. The leap don't to Xiao Wei's. Back ready to live. Just then. A cute demon girl suddenly appeared in front of him. Daddy Yanja. Can I go with you? Sao Chen was taking back. Ah. Who are you? The one who. Master declares to greet Sao Chen was the demon girl named Hydrogen Balloon. She originally. Didn't tell her to come. After all. Sao Chen was a give up. With a transcendent status in the entire server. While she was just a casual player. Enjoy the scenery. Moreover, Sao Chen sim not very friendly. Friendly towards demon players. As evidenced by the previous Bloodmon City incident. The demon players. Sao Chen was taking down the Bloodmon City Lord in many NPCs be cause of a quest. So they both respected and feared him. Hydrogen Balloon felt the same way. But under the encouragement of. The viewers in the live stream. She impulsively rushed out from her hiding spot. Now. Facing Sao. Chance. Question. Hydrogen Balloon's face turned it brick. Re. I. I am a poor demon player. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. Sao Chen has kept curiously. Hydrogen Balloon glanced at the live stream and said, 130 million. So many people? Sao Chen was a bit skeptical. Al top there were 2 billion players in the original, the number of players who activated live streaming called MTV Small. To have so many viewers in one live stream was simply unexpected. Hydrogen Balloon's name was Keatonis and matched one of her characteristics well. A. Such a young age, her impressive figure was already Keaton mature. Very fitting. Do. Players nowadays really enjoy watching streams this much? Hydrogen Balloon's sharely said, when you were fighting the boss, it happened to come across it and live streamed it, which is why there are so many viewers. Actually, they are all your fans. After a pause, as if she talked of something, she added, by the way, the live stream received over 3,000 gold coins and tips, ye ye he be to you, daddy Chen Yang. As soon as she finished speaking, she sent a trade request to Sao Chen. However, Sao Chen refused. You kept it. Al top over 3,000 gold coins was quite a lot, Sao Chen did take it. Noto. Mentioned, this abys all magic stuff called fetch an immeasurable price at auction. We said no. Promotion ultimate, it called this LB worth 10 million. The fact that Hydrogen Balloon live stream herself was a stroke of fa. Sao Chen. Didn't mind. However, it didn't expect. Hydrogen Balloon to be so insistent, shaking her head like a rat ledro. No, this is all tips from the viewers for you, he can't accept it. He said he don't want it, so he don't want it. Sao Chen said sternly. This little girl, are you teaching me how to do things? Hydrogen Balloon's face suddenly turned pale. Fearing. To anger Sao Chen, so she quickly said, all right, ye ye follow the changes orders. Mh. Sensible. Sao Chen's failed and na-di, preparing to say good-ye, if there is nothing. Else, ye ye be. Living. Hydrogen Balloon has accepted for a moment, greeted her teeth and her itly said, daddy yanja. Where are you going? Can I go with you? Even a lazy player wants to cling to the estron. Having encountered the two biggest players in the original in succession, this was a divine opportunity. Hydrogen Balloon felt that if she let this chance slip away, she would be unworthy of such luck. I can't agree to that, but you need to go to the human territory next, do you want to come alone? Sao Chen. So with a surprise. Expression. Just as human players would be targeted by NPCs in the human territory, the human players would also be targeted in the main city of humans. And in the mind having. This little. Beauty accompanied him along the way, but still kindly reminded her. It's fine, I'm. Originally a lazy type of player. Hydrogen Balloon quickly wiped her hand. Mmm, that's okay. At worst, ye ye used to run for you to stay in yanja town. That's my territory. Come on up. Sao Chen. But Xiao is back. Signaling. Thank you, daddy yanja. Hydrogen. Bayou on's face. Little quiz joy as she jam tonto Xiao is back. The viewers in the live stream suddenly felt embyos. I didn't expect the great demon king yanja to be so gente. The little stream is so lucky. From now. On, she ye be clinging to daddy yanja's legs so embyos. Daddy yanja, you wanna have your babies. Hey, look. There is a guelon. The months ba. Yeah, yeah, and Cesar Beauty. Wow. So beautiful. Who is she? Al alone, one of the label Sao Chenad in the eyes of external. Players with his dominance. 130 million viewers never expected in to be so culture done. Easy going. It's one thing to not be angry about the Hydrogen Balloon live streaming ter battle, but to not even want the gold coins for tipsy sanoter. Now, they didn't even put for tanic conditions and just agree to the Hydrogen Balloon's request to accompany them. Such a strong individual. Who bolden te have a good impression? I'm in love. However, the audience's attention quickly shifted. Away from this matter. Because on se how is back the figure of Celia Peer. To be fair. Celia's image absolutely aligns with the aesthetic of the vast majority of players. Beautiful. Exquisite. And full of charm. Her the blue eyes instantly evokes thoughts of a beautiful night. Sky. So stunning. At this moment in Senia Town, a few female players couldn't help but show. A wary expression. These female players were frosty snow. Phoenix light dance. Hunes rain. Hunes flower. And little fairy. Each of them was a rare beauty. Ever since they had contact with Sao. Chen. They had harbour. Good feelings for him. Even hinting at competition in private. But what? Did they see now? The Chenia that they had been thinking about had actually gotten an other woman? L.E. Meanwhile, the girl hydrogen balloon on side was also stand for several seconds. It was until Celia looked at her in confusion that she finally snapped back to reality. Why you? Hello? The hydrogen balloon's face turned and break red as she's a illy ser. Ian. The hydrogen balloon. Are you also a warrior? Celia ask. Ah. What warrior? The hydrogen balloon look completely bewildered. Then you are in the Celia set with a smile, shaking her head until. Addy. You have the potential to become a warrior. Want to give it a try? What? Ah. Hydrogen balloon was even more confused, but Celia turned her gasto Sao Chen. Lord. Can we recruit her as a warrior for the Dungeon? She seems to have a great potential. Recruit? Sao Chen was taken back for a moment, and after a while, a look of realization crossed his face. Restarting the timeline of the Arab continent and building a Dungeon, this was Celia's wish. The socallet recruitment meant that Sao Chen, as a junior lord, called recruit 500. Adventures. Looks like Celia is quite eager. As for the hydrogen balloon, her. Great potential is probably used her immortal trat as a player that called Celia's eye. Sao Chen silently. Analyzed. After all, she called Ntesi any potential. In the hydrogen balloon. Celia's understanding of this world is still to one side. Sao Chen talked that after seeing more players. Celia would understand that, by her standards, perhaps every player is a warrior. Looking at the hydrogen balloon's bewildered expression, Sao Chen's fail. This demon girl was indeed lucky. Not only had she encountered a good-natured version of himself, but she also got Celia's. Recognition. The 500 recruitment slots were actually quite precious. The reason being that TC. 500 players called change to powerful Dungeon professions and receive various tasks. Equipment, and more. Originally, TC slots were reserved for the players of the Hun in Tianta. Guild, but since Celia had spoken up, Sao Chen didn't intend to refuse her face. Most. Importantly, at this current level, Sao Chen called do anything wanted without caring about wasting a slot. At this moment, the hydrogen balloon quietly aske, senied a di, what exactly? Do es Celia me an? Sao Chen didn't answer, but instead aske, do you want to experience the skills? I be used? Mage, warrior, assassin, gunslinger, cleric, guardian, you can choose any. The hydrogen balloon was tan, can he also become a dungeon lord profession? You're thinking too much. What he meant was one of those? Sao Chen wiped his sweat and said helplessly. That's enough, that's great. He also wanted to have a hidden profession. The hydrogen balloon says, why didn't dance? She began to dance. With excitement at this moment, many viewers in the life stream were reacting as if they are just beaten into a lemon. The streamers like today is used to good getting a chance to change to a hidden class. Yet, me time, jealous is hydrogen balloon us in a palaif time of luck in used one day. Report to the Dichenia. He also wanted to change to a hidden class. There were also to see who scoffed at Cheneia's words whom helping someone change to a hidden class what has chambles boasts. From a juacia person. Just kept blowing your trampy. Even if it's true, giving such an opportunity to a random player, bolden that feel and fair to friends and family? Is this really the number one player in the whole server? How laughable? We's fame comes can't trovesy. Standing up. Si and just high, a colden that effort to make even the slightest mistah. Many believe the West bragging or ada. Misai a complex, and they spoke with a sarcastic tone. Most of these people were players who harbored in a mass city towards juacia. The human days, elves, and celestial beings were primarily made up of juacia people and northern Russians, while the mainstream players of the demon, or, and war. Racies were represented by Americans who held a great against juacia. The collapse of the real world did not erase the greatest between nations, it merely transferred them to the original. I'll talk many were. Reluctant to offense and ye due to his sigge status, they still didn't mind being sarcastic in the life. Estrean. However, these players were far fewer than Sianis fans until comments were quickly drowned out. In fact, there was no need for the fans to work hard to counter them, as Sianya Wilson slapped them in the face. Sianya knew that high legend balloon was still live streaming, and had reminded himself of this. But it didn't care. After all, his goal in returning to the human race was to change the territory into the revival starting. Point of adungeon, which was bound to overturn players' impressions. In, the original, so there was nothing. To high. You know the process of my battle with the Lord of the Beast. Think carefully about what class. You want to change to, and then tell me, Sianya said to hydrogen balloon. But, you don't know. What many of the skills belong to which class. Hydrogen balloon scratched his head, feeling embarrassed. Sianya talked for a moment and realized she was right. So, Adi, then you tell me what. Skills you value. This was much simpler for hydrogen balloon to understand. You want to change to that transformation skill. It looks so cool. It's the one that can float in middle while holding a handspeed. Sianya talked for a moment and understood. You read talking about transforming to Bayana. Right? That's a branch class of the magie. And it has great growth potential. Bayana, the god of combat, as a balance. Output among all classes. Not only do it sit a be considerable damage output but it's tankiness is also. Decent, and the ewaken skill. Transforming to Bayana is an explosive skill. One must say. The young hydrogen balloon has a good eye. Among the many ewaken skills, she immediately spotted one that. Stood out. Hearing this hydrogen balloon tilted her head and escaped curiously. Daddy, Chania, I'm an assassin. Can he also change to a magie class? No problem. Chania replied. Affirmatively. In the professions of the Arab continent, the assassin is actually called the night messenger. The night messenger can only change to the corresponding classes of Monsado star Ravri, and the overlord, sir, and letterward. And can't change to Bayana, the god of combat. However, the professions in the original seem to belong to a modified version where the first class change is not. Restricted by the initial profession. Assassins can change to magic classes or event to the. The Monsword master class and Xenia was very certain about this. Are you sure this is the class you want? And you want to change your mind? Si and just get one last time. Yes, I'm sure. Hydrogen balloon added bigger as it. Alright, just a moment. I'll call out the class change mentor. First, Sao Chen called and the handle the player class changes himself, but as a junior lord, a code reseret. Yes, NPCs. Anyway, the mentors for each profession would definitely be the first batch to be revived. After browsing the list, Sao Chen quickly confirm his target. System prompt, do you. Want to resurrect NPCs a Alan? Note, consumes one resurrection opportunity. Sao Chen decisively click confirm. The next moment. A dark golden magical. Portal suddenly appeared out of scenery in front of him. Everything related to magic is here with me. A voice came from. Within. Antenas altry. Silver-haired woman with a grass-filled figure and a. Lazy. Magnetic voice slowly emerged from being the door. It was Saiyan. The. Mentor of the. Adventure images of the Arab continent. Eh. I'm not dead? Is this a dream or reality? Saiyan skinted her eyes. Bebeling a confused. Expression. A panseeing Celia. Her. Sepra is turned into delight. Princess Celia. We made it again. Lontimen o si. President. Saiyan. Celia gritted with. A smile. Celia is very happy to see you again. So amir Saiyan also smile. Alright. Let's not chat too much for now. This next. Tome is the newly. Appointed Dungeon Lord. Is the one who help you revive. Celia pointed a. Sao Chenan introduced him to Saiyan. Lord. This is Saiyan. The President. Of the Magi. Guild. Willing to heed your commands. Saiyan said respectfully. In the Arab continent. The Lords. Of various regions are among the top tier of power. And the Dungeon Lords are the leaders among them. Saiyan was willing to uva the commands. Of the Dungeon Lord. Just like a hundred thousand years. Hago hello. Saiyan. Sao Chen's a heeled and nadi. Greeting her. Tempo inti to the hydrogen. Belun who was stealing a daze from Saiyan's sudden appearance. He want her to change to a battle magi. Is that all right? As soon as he finished speaking. Saiyan's gases is the hydrogen balloon. After a. Moment. She slightly nadi. No problem. You know your command. However. He must first tell you. Something. With my current power. He can only allow adventurers to change directly to mages. Without accepting trial tasks a few times. So. If there are other adventurers who want to change. To the magi profession. It's best to accept the corresponding trial tasks. Sao Chen scratched. His head. Of course. This team can be considered an exception. I remember that in the game. Toxic Milk Powder. And warriors players. At the complete corresponding class. Change tasks to successfully. Change classes. This was also the case in the primordial. He had used to overlook it and. Didn't think of this point for a moment. Otherwise. He would have returned to young town in a few days to. Restart the Arab continent plan. And let the hydrogen balloon change classes. However. It was quite. Sincery of Selan to open a back door for him. Meanwhile. Selan looked at the hydrogen. Belunan gently as ke. Adventure the hydrogen balloon. Do you wish to change to a battle magi? Yes. Yes. The hydrogen balloon. Noddy the girly like a cheek pecking atrice. Her. Ensociastic demeanor. Madeselia beside her. Chackel and cover her. Mouse. As you wish. As soon as the words fell. A beam of light appeared out of nowhere in the sky. Enveloping the hydrogen. Belun. Within it. As a demon. The hydrogen balloon. Absomed demonic features. Such as. Satis and a fan black mist surrounding her. Her. It was also a set of black and red. Light armor. However. Three seconds later. As the beam of light disappeared. The image of the girl hydrogen. Belun underwent a tremendous transformation. Desartes that were onced there at banish time. The black mist called no longer before. The black and red light armor. On her body transformed into a. Long. Bricked red dress. Reminiscent of a medieval coat magi. Her. Her. Turned into red twin. Tals. Coupled with her. Juice fell age. Her overall appearance was strikingly similar to the magi. Loli from toxic milk powder in warriors. Wow. This outfit is so beautiful. Is this. Really me? The hydrogen balloon. With a face full of happiness. Explored the long dress. Feeling us. If she were dreaming. The viewers in the live stream also erupted with comments. Damn. Daddy chanier really let the hydrogen balloon change to a hidden class. Awesome. How does it feel to? Be slapped in the face. Hatters. If you re-brand list. You already feel this way a lot more in the future. This outfit is so pretty. I love it. You really. A bit. Streamy. Using cuteness tactics. Damn. I'm following. Dog streamy. Don't you stink about yourself. Quickly ask daddy and jay fathers. Can. Also change to hidden classes. Right. Right. Hairy and dusk. Or we a je bit you are. The hydrogen balloon. Now a battle magie. Was simply to ocute. Duty knows no race. Almost. Every viewer was captivated. Men were transfixed. And women were in views and jealous. Used. Her appearance made countless. Players yearn to change to the battle magie class. And a saochem pull. Out a set of summer cool outfit from the dressing shop. The atmosphere in the life stream instantly became. Explosive. Do it really have to wear this? The hydrogen balloon took the outfit saochem handy. Hair. Examine the. And her face turned brick. There was no helping it. It was used to. Embarrassing. This outfit was a bikini. In. The original. There is a taylor. Profession. But no taylor can create such a villain getire. The game rules do not allow it. Hmm. I wonder where daddy. Yangi got this outfit. After the embarrassment. The hydrogen balloon secretly. Slander. In the. Men are real big pigs folks. They used lofty. Flashy things. Why. Thinking this. The hydrogen balloon instinctively strattened her body. The two ample curves wear. About the bars the core 3. However. The hydrogen balloon didn't think too much. She was. Definitely going to wear this outfit. Not only because it was that it's in just order but also because it's the outfit. It's self-added tribute bonus. Summer cool outfit advanced. Cetric wired level LV. 34 dimensional attributes plus 300 points dot attack speed slash movement speed. Plus 10 HP 5 MP 5 critical hit rate 3 so tempting wearing. Outfits in the game is the as complicated as in the real world the hydrogen balloon simply click the. Wear option and instantly transform now she was left with only two pieces of class if she. Was a medieval court maje before it. Now she was a fairy. It was simply exhilarating. Sao Chen added insatisfaction. Not expecting such an explosive effect from a sudden idea. No. But this outfit looks great. Pleasing to the eye. Let's keep it this way from now on. The dressing show. Add outfits for all professions and the quantity. Was countless. Each part of 999. Plus vitamin D. So giving one to the hydrogen balloon was no big deal. The hydrogen balloon. Blushing. Shily. Replied. Okay. Daddy change. The outfits attributes. Wearing the appealing but it was also genuinely revealing. Wearing it was truly embarrassing. Damn. 3 years minimum. Highest that penalty. 666. Daddy and I really know how to. Play. I admit this outfit is impressive. Passer by players. Are paying attention. Donated 10 gold coins. Hoping the streamer will dance. Oh. No good man. Daddy and I really. Likes this kind of thing. The. Live stream. Come and sporting like a heavy snowfall. Explosive. After dancing the. Summer chill set. Hydrogen balloon's appearance. Resembling a. Hydrogen balloon made the atmosphere in the live stream. Nothing sort of explosive. Male players were. Incredibly exciting. Female players. However. Looked like they'd be beaten into a lemon. Many of them. Disdantly curling tail lips and climbing tail figures were much better than hydrogen balloons. At this. Moment. Everyone seemed to have a. By unspoken agreement. Forgotten the important detail of hydrogen balloon. Changing hair class to bat lemage. The bikini fashion lowly said the entire life stream abuse. And frost also and others watching the life stream were equal. Stand. Exchanging bewildered glances. Chef Yang actually likes this tie. Ah. I miss who'd head him. I can't believe Chef Yang. Is this king. Of person. Speaking of which. This outfit is kitten is. If he had the. Chance. He'd like to try it on. Ah. Don't misunderstand. It's used for the experience. Mm. E. Think you little brat are a-dreaming. The older ones like Frostauce and Fonchingu called only envy. But little fairy and hun's flower. Being around hydrogen by John's age. Were all. Eager to try it. Drawing ears from the crowd. Who don't know what you're rethinking? Chefs and your bolden te like you to a wet vein. Theirs brats. As they talk this. They couldn't help but feel a little wary. A man likes and your ways. Simply too charming. After spending some time together. Almost every female player around. I'm a developed feelings for him. However. Do it to the vast status difference. They and test pouken a. But their souls are converged on and decide. To be Southchance's girlfriend. This was. Clearly evident in how they dressed him. Initially. Everyone call it and get that and get. But that's home. Point. Everyone. Without prior. Discussion. Change that to chief. Great God. And so on. Ah. In an attempt to transition from a familiar relationship. To a romantic one. Lying the groundwork. And the more. Mature group. Like Frostoswee. Couldn't help but feel a little anxious now. Because from the looks of it. Southchun. Seems to have a distinct preference for lowlies. And they had long since left the realm of young girls. However. On second. The young high. The young. The young. With her to magnificent great mountains. Cold and they be considered a pure low leader. They still had a chance. But we need to act fast. With. More and more beauties around chef. Yanya. Who knows. And me suddenly get a girlfriend one day. At this moment. Whether it was a mature Frost. Talkswee and fengking was crew. Or the useful and vibrant little fairy in hun's flower. They all made up their minds. Next. They have to find a way to stay by Yanya's side. And block out to see flirting. Bees and butterflies from getting closer. In the forest of the earth. Because of the sudden hit of the. Castume hydrogen. By John's face had been flashed. And about the day had formed in her mind. Cold it be that day. Great demon king Yanya. Seeing how useful. Beautiful. And invincible. She was. Cold and the hell. But be moved. Sold she except in ten. Even if it was the great demon king Yanya's side. A beto considered it carefully for a. A no. But she wanted for a long time. Only to see south and greeting. The newly appeared. Selan and preparing to live. High region by John's eyes widened. Her face filled with. Disbelief. Was this plain hard to get. Or was she overthinking it. After a few seconds of while. So. High region balloon finally couldn't help but speak. Chef Yanya. You re so amazing. What king. Of girlfriend are you planning to find in the future. A girlfriend. Eh. South and so with a south fair. Expression. Primordial. As humanity's second world. At very complete functions. If the. Intimacy was efficient. They called totally XO. In the future. They meet even viable to. Have babies. As a virile young man. It was impossible for such and not to have such souls. Eh. A derigenly plan to develop something we's thinking. But they were to familiar. Makinig. Awkward. Others kept calling him that. Which gabima twisted. Incestuous feeling so. A. Kept putting it off. Now that he grogen beluna does care. Erilia to he be it's o meto. At this. Moment. The female viewers in the live stream. Also. El terbrez. Waiting for South-chan. Sanse. Frost. Auxue. Frenkingu. The sisters Hunsran. And others. Familiar with South-chan. Also. Focus intently on the live screen. Dominant woman. Lowly. Talented woman. Delicate girl. Clancy girl. Which type was chef. Chinges preference. And the reverie on a cigar gas. South-chan. Finally. Spoke. Only two points. First. The appearance must be beautiful. Second. The temper must. Be gentle and tolerant. Hygrey. Hydrogen balloon. Cold and take help. But present. That's an idea. What do you think of? Me? Am I pretty and oh? You? Sowing west turtle. Sizing up. Hydrogen balloon. But. Tenekan lippers his lips. Woman. You sold a self-awareness. Let's talk about it in a few more years. Hydrogen balloon. The live stream audience instantly burst into laughter. This dog streamer. Even once to seduce that's an idea. You're dreaming. Bajaja. The dog streamer really sold a. Some self-awareness. You're too young. Frostaswee and the others also. Cold and take help but relax the tensioning. They're at. Saochen's answer made them realize that in the short term. Hydrogen balloon balloon. They're viable to. Successfully hacen. However. They also began to wonder what Saochen meant by it. Seto standards. Especially the latter one. All in the temper. With a no tolerance to a camera that people. This. And. Cold and take be what they were thinking. Coldly. Seeningly realizing something. Frostaswee's face. Cold and take help but. Change. Still thinking about three waves and four concubines. Do I think this is ancient times? As soon as her words fell. She saw that the people around her didn't echo. Her sentiments. They. Seem to be contemplating how they would choose if such a situation truly occur. Would they accept or. Would they angrily leave? The women talked for a moment. And gradually. They answered became a clear in their acts. Elsewhere. After being disertened by Saochen. Hydrogen balloon finally gave up her extravagant op-off. Taking things further and instead began to study her skills and panel after her new class change. She was immediately. Stunned by what she saw. Wow. My four-dimensional attributes have a chant. My intelligence. Is it? The new skills. Their attack power is abnormal. A series of exclamations. Sparked the curiosity of the live stream audience. But the dog stream is saying? Hurry up and open your personal panel for us to see. Yes. Yes. Quickly open the personal panel. As. If hearing the audiences in their soaps.

Now, seeing the battle mag skills with a cheap percentages, everyone was why. I'd nearly draw in a staggering 1320% for the LVS Shining. Pattern. Well, you need 5 skills. You used to keep up with one of the high legend balloons. And. Amontes Skills. There are buffs, attacks, and defenses glow. The most crucial part is that after. Changing to a battle mag. The high legend balloons original assassin skills still exist. In the skill. List a mag that can stills are a just kerje. All of this not only stand the high legend balloon. Herself but also left and tire life stream audience with their eyes wide open. Wow, this is. Invincible. This class is truly. Terrifying. 1, 2, 3, 4. 19. There are a full 19 skills for the mag. I'm impressed, what about you? The. Dog stream is really lucky. Daddy and ya, he want to change to a battle mag. To. Begging for it. Sop sop sop. The audience members seem to transform into lemon spirits. Feeling sore about the high legend. By your own good fortune. At the same time, they were fervently adding to saochen sopes. Even if the chances. Were slim. How wonderful would it be if they could also become the lucky ones to change to a hidden class? They meet even wake up smiling from a dream. The high legend balloon herself was left speechless for alone. Time after looking at the panel. She never expected that as a casual player. She would have such a marvelous opportunity. This key list was simply astonishing. The high legend balloon turned to sao. Chambi said her. Her gas anabelt to haid her gratet. Thank you, daddy and ya, for helping me change to. Such a powerful. Hidden class. This great favor, it will never forget. From now on, ee. The high legend balloon will be your most loyal little follower. Whatever you ask me to do, it will do it no questions. Aske. Saochen sails lately. No need to say da. It's just a small matter. No. To you it may seem like a trivial matter, but to me, it is a significant change in destiny. The high legend balloon. Said her nicely. Saochen nodded lightly, feeling quite satisfied with the high legend balloons. Perceptiveness. As the second word for humanity, if nothing unexpected happens, a. Humans will continue to live here in the future. Therefore, players with eager strengths can be assured that the. Leaves will be smoother. The high legend balloons. A.T. did not disappoint Saochen. However, Saochen did not intend to keep her in a state of endless gratitude. Don't think too much about it. If he say it's a small matter, then it's a small matter. To you, it may seem like a particularly precious hidden class lad, but to tell you, it currently have 500 of these slads, oh, what. Now it's 499. That may answer can let 499 players change the classes like. Mage, Sarpsa, Otter, Priest, and so on. In the future, there will be even more slads. As soon as a finished speaking, the high legend balloons mouse dropped open in sock her face blank. The. Audience in the life stream was also left to found the. Silence. At this moment, the atmosphere in. The life stream was as quiet as the. Everyone beg and to doubt their ears, wondering if they were. Hearing things. 499 hidden class lads. A class has terrified English tronades. The high legend balloon still at 499 more. Moreover, many audience members recall. That the magic class. Was not the only option. Used recently, Sianja transformed into many different. Classes while battling the LV 180 music boss. For instance, most people like the. Sapsa, Otter. This elegant, cool, and flashy class with incredibly eager output. A class da. At previously been unique in the world of original. Now, did they also have the chance to change to a. Sapsa, Otter. How am I saying was da. After a long while, someone finally sent a message in the. Cha. Guys, did you hear da. Right. Do is the great demon king Sianja said there are still. 499 spots. It only was the only one hearing things. Turns out it was the dream. Realizing that what Sianja said was true. The barrage exploded. Ni ni ni ni ni. Is it now? Daddy. Sianja. Please give me a spot. I'm a demon race player. No more talking. I'm heading to the dead forest now. Daddy Sianja what for me? I'm an orc race player. Is the great Sianja going back to the human race? Orc. I'm rushing to the human race right now. For the sake of becoming a cool gunslinger. I'm. Alini won't become a paladin. A single stone stirred up a thousand waps. Be cause of. Sianja's words. All players in the server erupt. The terror of the battle. Not a skill was. Evident to every viewer in the life stream. This was no different from a hidden hub transfer spot for them. And Sianja actually had 499 of them. No one doubted Sianja's words. And in an instant. It attracted the attention of all players in the server. Meanwhile. The helium balloon finally is not. Out of the so can. A pan hitting Sianja suddenly had a brick idea. Daddy Sianja. Yabe a good. Friend. Can you give her a spot? No. Sianja flatly refused. Why not? There. Are 499 spots. Please give one to my friend. The helium balloon looked at Sianja with a. Pitiful expression. It seemed that her friend was in that closet of her. However. Sianja demand. Unmoved. I'm not doing charity. Just because I was scared meto. He. Tese 499 spots. E. Will definitely take care of my GID members. Don't think too much. Olai. The helium balloon looked a bit. Disappointed. But didn't say anything more. Sao Chen's reasoning was sound. Why so the Hibia precious hidden. Hope transfer spot to a friend of someone everly new. She had been overwhelmed by a series of. Surprises which led her to make such a rash request. Now. Seeing the other person somewhat displaced. Expression. The helium balloon dared not say more. The viewers in the live stream. Listening. To Sao Chen's words felt both disappointed and in views. Damn it. It's an other benefit for the Hulin. Tian Tan Guild. The players of the Hulin Tian Tan Guild seem to be too happy. Right. What was that sign again? In the head choice is greater than effort. The thing you regret most in my life is not. Joining the Hulin Tian Tan Guild the moment you met the requirements. You all stop being sore lemons. Is that normal for the Diyanja to take care of GID members? Meanwhile. The members of the Hulin Tian. Tan Guild were all extremely excited. In the GID channel. Chairs. Began to ira. The Diyanja is used to a good. Always taking care of us a little fish place. No doubt about it. Once a. Father. Always a father. From now on my only Diyanja. Presidenta dies. Osev. Mighty and powerful. Looking forward to it. Maybe one of those 499 spots is for me. He won't play as a Gunslinger. At this moment. The Helium Balloon discovered a serious problem. Daddy. Senja. The battle magie profession is indeed very powerful. But where do I get the equipment? Where can I get armor? Leather armor slash class armor and weapons? He can't use not wear equipment. Forever. Right? After transitioning from es as into battle magie. All the equipment on the Helium. Balloon was now unable to be worn due to the profession mismatch. Realizing this, the Helium Balloon. Panic. Onces third intently at Sao Chen, hoping for his answer. U.M. I. Forgot to mention that. Sao Chen talked for a moment and said, no rush, it took a quest when it returned. To Yanja town, it will create a Dungeon. To have tantas equipment there won't be a lack of sources for. Equipment. Really? That's great. The Helium Balloon felt relieved now. The place. Creating Dungeons was unprecedented and seemed unbelievable. But Yanja's that was no ordinary. Player. Equal completely understand things that exceeded common sense. Moreover, there was no need to deceive oneself. After all, they were still live streaming. And, it was absolutely impossible. To speak nonsense. Otherwise, boldened that be lying in front of billions of viewers. Impossible. Absolutely impossible. At that moment, Sao Chen talked for a moment and suddenly pulled out a. Waspear from the Lord's Warehouse. Forget it. Going into Dungeon with nothing but my bare hands would probably. Be quite difficult. So let me give you a equality waspear as a foundation. Additionally. Everyone who changes to a hidden class with me in the future will receive a equality mine weapon as a reward. Blue quality. Equivalent to Brands Equipment. Right? Item. Fine. Iron Warspear. Quality. X-Lab. Warspear Equipment Requirement. LV30 Slash Magical Attack Power. 440 Magical Attack Power. 314 Strengths. 120 Intelligency. 120 Critical Hit Chance. 4%. In the original, the equipment quality ranges from low toy gas follows. Normal. Brands. Silver. Gold. Dark Gold. Legendary. Epic. Musical. However, how can discover. That the equipment quality in the Dungeon Warehouse was divided into. Blank. Y. Bre. Artifact. Ancient Legend. Ancient Epic. Ancient Me. Y. Quality equipment only at the prefix. Ancient Addy. With no significant changes. Meanwhile, new quality debychens appeared for to see below. Legendary. Saochena. The authority in the Dungeon Warehouse to freely claim all equipment. Below LV60. As for equipment of artifact quality and the bad, there was only one of each. Ver quality at 100 pieces. I. And Blank were al 999 mas, therefore. Giving away a equality waspare didn't the bader Saochena tal. Anyway. Tome. Blankan. I. Equipment are about trash. I. Make this well reward someone else. Saochena. To himself. On the. Other side. The balloon was so moved by his actions that tears well up in its eyes as it deeply. About while receiving the waspare. Thank you. Thank you. Sian Ye da. The viewers in the live. Estream troc the equipment attribute display mode where I'll stand as they saw the attributes of the fine. Iron waspare. This. This is the main weapon of equality. I can't believe it. The attributes. Are used explosive? Damn. It's even better than my LV30 top tier silver. Poison dagger. Sian Ye degrade. The monkeen. Do you have a som? Misunderstanding about brand's equipment? Incredible. I'm impressed. Today is truly a lucky day for this dog's treamer. DLV30 fine. Iron waspare. In terms of attributes. Was actually several times better than the top tier silver mine weapon. Of the same level. It called even rival gold quality. It's worth noting that when hochen. First step tan DLV32. Holy silver stuff in the bis level difficulty. Spider cave. It only a. Plus 110 points of magical attack and 35 points of intelligence. Even DLV. 33 gold quality. Explosive stuff at a base magical attack power of only 490 points. With an addition el 160 points of intelligence. And DLV33 fine iron. Waspare was hardly inferior to the explosive stuff. Did you guys notice? The great demon. King Senja said that this equipment can drop from Dungeons. Damn. He really didn't notice until you. Mentioned it. It's very likely to be true. Brothers. I'm off to develop in Senja Town. Together. Together. At that moment. All the viewers in the live stream focused their attention on Yanja. Town. Almost no one called Remanimo's channel in different and there's such powerful attribute equipment. A week later. Sao Chen successfully returned to Yanja Town. As soon as entered. The village. It was greeted by the chairs of the surrounding guild members. Good news. Good news. President. That is bad. It's been a few days. And the Yanja has become even more handsome. So en vieve. President. How long will you stay in the guild this time? Each member looked at Sao Chen with. Anticipation. It had been almost a month since the set of to the demon clan and during this long time. Although they called gathered information about him from various channels. It was never as real as personal. Conta. The guild members really wanted Sao Chun to stay in the guild honestly and lead its development. The vice president. Hunsran. Along with the guild's management team. Also came forward. President. Sianye. How long can you stay in the guild this time? Hunsran asked first. Sao Chun talked for a moment. He don't know. But he's the middle of the guild. It's unlikely to belong here. Because I haven't completed my mind quest yet. I have. To go back to the demon clan. There is. For coming back this team is just because there are things and must do. Hmm. We can probably guess that. Hunsran said with a smile. The little fairies around also saw it smiles. After all. There. Advenan an announcement and Sao Chen had explained in the hydrogen balloon and bestrean. They all understood that. Sao Chen had returned to complete an unoutask. Well. As long as you understand. Let's not delay. Yey. Start now. As long as. A finished speaking. How you can talk out the item. Ara. Can't enter. From his backpack and click to use it. System prompt. Do it to your use of the item. Ara. Can't enter. The Arab can't enter in timeline. Plan as being activity. And senior. Town as being linam. 12. Defense line. System prompt. The first Dungeon Lord has appeared. And you can enter. Through the. Dungeon entrance. With difficulty levels of easy. Adventure. Hero. And king. System prompt. You have a trigger. The Lord quest. Build the Dungeon. Can't. Clearing the Dungeon Lord in elven defense. Line will unlock the Dungeon. Depths of Lauren. Clearing the depths of Lauren will unlock the area. Edenmer. Unlock. The Dungeon Dark Forest. And clearing the Dark Forest will unlock the Dungeon. Depths of Dark Forest. And so on. Quest deadline. None. Quest reward for a Dungeon. Unlock. Al current basis. Attributes will increase by 1%. 100%. They get the level of the Allah. Dungeon. They get the reward. Do. Note 1. Only the adventures you recruit will count towards completing. The quest progress. Note 2. Only clearing the king level difficulty will count towards completing the. Quest progress. This quest is not bad. The percentage increase in basic attributes. The rewards are a. Sao Chang was instantly delighted. This Lord quest belongs to the long term. Type. According to the quest rewards for every new Dungeon that appears. His basic attributes. Good increase by at least 1% and up to 100%. Cumulatively. It's quite. Insane. However. The only downside is that Sao Chang personally clearing the Dungeons. Do. Is not count towards. The progress. Only when his abort needs. Recluded from the 500 slots. Clear them. Can it be. Converted into rewards. Dismeans Sao Chang will have to put in some effort to train his abort needs to. Complete the quest progress early and accept and the quest rewards sooner. I was originally planning to. Be lazy. But this quest is forcing me to pull out all the stops. Sao Chang matter to himself. Having a Dungeon warehouse made it. To easy for into cultivate place. Moreover. The mainstream. Players. Levels at general. Exceeded LV40. And. In another month or two. They call the. Rich LV50 for the second class change. In this way. The LV180 musical quality. Equipment. It is one. That Sao Chang done from the. This demon god would finally have a place to be used. When the team comes to call the beta magic. Whose combat power is second only. To his own across the. Entire server. Bolden. That be a piece of cake. The number of Dungeons that can be cleared will likely increase. Significantly. What do is a mere musical level equipment count for? You can't catch a wolf. Without letting go of the chill. Sao Chang already had a candidate in mind. The best one can only be. Used by images. And without a doubt. Sao Chang plant to he be to fengking who to use. Of course. It bolden te be for free. Because even if it were free. According to fengking who's character. She. Bolden te agree to accept it. However. What price would need to be. But would have to be discussed later. Alongside the build ungeon quest. There were also two other side quests. That's out. Can examine. Closely. You have triggered the side quest. Recruit adventurers content. As a lord. How can you. Like a board needs. Please start recruiting as soon as possible. Available recruitment slots. Unsas 500. Reward. And addition. El 5.000. Recruitment slots. Quest duration. None and out. The number of adventurers is closely related to your strengths. For each walking adventurer. Under your name. You. Will receive a 0.001% attribute bonus. You have triggered the side quest. Qualification for class advancement. Quest content. 1. Recruita total of 100.000 adventurers. 2. Clear the extreme. Alter. Quest reward. Qualification certificate for. Advancement. Quest duration. None and out. The extreme alter appears after the LV90. Dungeon is. Open. Both of these quests belong to the long term type. But comparatively. The first one gives benefits. A bit faster. In terms of rewards. All to get a recruited adventure. All increases is the four. Dimensionally tributes by 0.001%. Based on the content of the latter quest. There may be subsequent tasks that enhance the recruitment. Ledger slots. Therefore. Equal let it do be. Time. The bonus is from this task. Are quite considerable. 1.0. 0.01%. 1.0. 1.0. 1.0. 1.0. 10.000. Is 10%. Anna 100. 0.0. Is 100%. Quite impressive. Moreover. Who says Sao Chen's goal is just to. Recruit 100.000. And Calita Day. The emergence of the Arab continent is a revolutionary. Change for the entire background of origin at this stage. History begins to turn at this moment. In the future. Perhaps all. 2 billion players on the server will become adventures recruited by. Sao Chun. Who knows. As for the third task. The qualification for intermediate lore. Advancement. Another task that can be completed in a short time. Sao Chun said slightly. E. Clearly remember that the extreme altar called the enter the. L.U.B. 65. But now the task tells. In the appeals after L.U.B. 90. Which shows how much the game has been modified. Just like when it cleared the wall in. Cabe back 10. After reviewing the task. Sao Chun immediately got to work. First. N.E.D. To. Field de 499. Available slots under his name. This kind of thing soul definitely prioritize. His own members. But adding in suangas. We and others. Is also fine. After all. They are all the quantities. And Sao Chun takes better care of them. Than the relatively unfamiliar guild members. So. Sao Chun asked for. The opinions of Suang Auxu and Feng King Wu. And after receiving affirmative answers. E. Vega. To. Announcing the guild channel. Guild channel. President. Can get the top 489 contributors of the. Guild who want to change hubs gather at the guild headquarters now. The fact that Sao Chun a. 499 hidden hubs slots was already well known. However. Because they had previously stated. In the live broadcast room of the hydrogen balloon. That this slots were for his own guild. O.C. The player's call. Only in being. This decision also instill a strong sense of. Pre-day in the arts. Of the 10.000. Members of the Hulin Tiansa Guild. Look. This is the benefit of our Hulin Tiansa Guild. Envios. Gilles. Drolin. GG. Sorry. The guild is full. Now that everiones. Guild leader. Dadas finally returned and started. Allocating slots. How can the guild members not be. Excited? However. What most players feel regretful about. Is that only the top 489. Members on the guild contribution list. Are included in this plan. Guild channel. Little fairy boy guild. Leader. That is my tea. We finally wanted for you. Guild channel. Wholy and I are so happy. I'm. Exactly the last one at 489. Guild channel. Little follower guild leader da. Iberaib that the. Guild headquarters. Where are you? Guild channel. I'll throw them banana guild leader da. After this batch of. Benefits is distributed. Will there be another batch? Guild channel. The invincible pool me. Wow wow I'm used. 200 contribution points. Sort of making the top 489. So disappointed. The guild. Channel become an easy duet to saw Chen's instructions. Event talk members called only speak once every five. Minutes. The messages were still frequent. Saw Chen felt a bit of a headache watching the members run. After 489 asking if there would be another opportunity and the vintage I eat the truth. Guild channel. Thousand nights everyone. Don't worry. Everyone has a chance. The C489 are used the first. Batch of slots. On the field there will be new slots and the next batch will have 5 mil and more after. The. Guild channel. Little follower guild leader da. Is mighty. Guild channel. Little. Dumplin guild leader da. Is awesome. Guild channel. Old granny guild leader da. Is dominating. Saw Chen's words reassured the guild members who didn't take a slot this team. Looking at the many members. Gathering at the guild headquarters. Ready to accept their hope changes. The envy interiors diminished. Significantly. After all. According to guild leader da. Everyone has a chance. The only. Difference is being early or late. It don't matter if it takes 10 days or half a month. Saw Chen has. Always been a man of his word and no one doubted whether he was deceiving them. So everyone look. For part to the day they called also change hopes. On the other side. Saw Chen began to proceed according to. The plan. With so many players. It's impossible for all of them to change the mages. Right. And to. Change the other. Professions. We must first resurrect the NPC mentors of those professions. Therefore. Among the remaining 9 slots. We must prioritize resurrecting the mentors of each profession. Saw Chen talked to himself. The junior don't get on Lord only as the authority for the slots. Having already. Resurrected Saolin. One has been used. Living never remaining. He had his own plans for TC9. Slats. System prom. Do you want to resurrect? The Zapsaoter mentor NPC Kelly? Do you want to resurrect? The fighter mentor NPC Feng Hun? Do you want to resurrect? The Ghost Sportsman? Mentor NPC GSD? Do you want to resurrect? The Holy Caster mentor NPC Galantis? Do you want to resurrect? The Night Messenger mentor NPC Minete? Do you want to resurrect? The Guardian mentor NPC Janice? Usin 6 slots for the mentors of the 6 basic professions. 3 slots riman. A familiar scene appeared as a magic door materialize. In front of Saw Chen. And 6 NPCs walked out one by one. Respected Dungeon Lord Sausen. Knights. Hello. Hello Toyuto. Saw Chen greeted the newly appeared NPCs and tembeganto. Ponder who to use the riman in 3 slots on. Now the game has a stamina system. Big wiring. Players to eat and sleep daily to recover stamina. So it's best to get someone good at cooking. Let me. Think. It's all be here. Sofia from the Moonlight Tavern. Saw Chen's isolated. At this. Stage. It's player has a stamina limit of 200. Points. If they engage in intense. Dungeon or monster farming. This amount of stamina would only last half a day at most. So. Every. Player needs to have a better daily meal store stamina. And Sofia. The owner of the Moonlight Tavern. Clearly has a unique advantage in cooking and brewing. Moreover. Sofia is also. An incredibly strong merchant with a rich inventory. Ensuring that players can buy some of the. Items they need from her. Consider it a benefit. System prompt do you want to recere. NPC Sofia? Yes. In the next moment. Sofias Grasfeld figure. Slowly appeared from the magic portal. Only two slots riman. Saw Chun talked for a moment and. Resurrected the NPCs. Claharan fire her. He had once been kicked obsessed with opening jars. In the game. Toxic milk powder and warriors. Finding good equipment was exhilarating gun. Cole kept him happy for a whole day. Finding trash. However. Was disappointing. How could such an interesting thing not be experienced by the players? System prompt. You have to recere. NPCs. Clah. Hardo. System prompt. You have to recere. NPCs. Fire hardo. Add this. Point. Al 10 NPCs. Resurrection slots where us. E. NPCs actually have panels. Saw Chun was a price. To see the option for a personal panel appear on the side of Galantis. Thanks in. GSD. Minete. And others also add this option. Saw Chun opened the. NPC. Galantis level. LV80 HP. 1 200 000 attack power. 200. 0 0 0 defense power. 1 68 000 strength. 38 000. Agility. 38 000 stamina. 116 000 intelligence. 1 16. 0 0 0 equipment. Non skills. Mastery of all priests. Series professions. Remax player. Yanja seborrne. Galantis panel look like this. And the others were similar. At least. Their levels were the same. Used one level lower than Saw Chun himself. This combat. Power is quite good. If they had equipment. They would definitely be stronger. And they represent. Decent combat strengths. Who knows when they meet a pill on the battlefield. After browsing through Galde. NPC information. Saw Chun added in satisfaction. HNPC belonged to a boss level. Template in the original. Which was quite powerful. Moreover. From the Dungeon Masters. Authority explanation. Learned that the resurrected NPCs levels. Would not exceed Saw Chun's. If his own level increased further. The levels of his seborrne's gold. Also rise significantly. However. Now that it was a bubble. V80. The experience required. To level up. Was too much. So that was not. Urgent for the team being. After coming to this realization. Saw Chun instructed the major profession. Mentor NPCs. To stand at the entrance. Of the Supreme Guild headquarters. Ready to receive a players coming forte. Hope transfer tasks. One by one. Team passed bit by bit. And so on. Al 499. Members. Including Swang Auxue. Had received their hope transfer tasks. No full goal pass up. Such an opportunity. After receiving the hope transfer tasks. Tese 499 members. Were all very excited. However. Once they carefully read the task descriptions. They all. Rebuild a look of confusion in unison. By the way. My task to transfer to soul soul. Requires me to clear the Dungeon Dark Thunder Ruins at the King. Level. What is this Dark Thunder? Ruins Dungeon? To transfer to mechanic. In it to defeat Flam Brocaica. Even ever even heard of. This Dungeon name. My task is the Dragon Man Tower. And I'm used as bewilder. At the entrance of. The Guild Headquarters. Once everyone confirmed that they all had no idea how to complete their hope transfer. Tasks. The place it up did in chaos. Al profession. Transfer tasks simply require. Clearing Tridum Geons. First Dark Thunder Ruins. Second. Flam Brocaica. Third. Dragon Man Tower. However. No one had ever heard of this Tridum Geons. Therefore. They had no. Idea how to complete them. Confused. After discussing with the people around him. They quickly turn their attention to Sao Chen. President. That. Where can we find these three Dungeons? Someone asked at first. Upon hearing this. Sao Chen scratched his head. I almost forgot to tell you. The. Dungeons are open secondially from Loutoi. Only after clearing the previous Dungeon at the King level. Difficulty can the next Dungeon be unlocked. In other words. Everyone can unlock new Dungeons by. Clearing one Dungeon after an Ote. The Dark Thunder Ruins. Blassing Gralaka. And Dragon Man. Tower required for class change will appear at the Dungeon entrance after clearing about 7 to 10 Dungeons. This situation was detailing the lore. Task of. Building the underground city. Therefore. Sao Chen directly informed everyone of this feature. Oh. So that's how it is. You scared me. I. Almost out. We couldn't complete it. No more talking. I'm going to run the Dungeon. Now. Brothers. The lowest level Dungeon Loren can't tell me. Because 4. Who wants to join? The brother above. Adme. Good brother. We have to run the Dungeon together. After hearing Sao Chen's explanation. Each member fell. Really? Although it was a bit beyond their expectations. But state common for the president that Sao Chen. To surprise them? So. Everyone quickly accepted it. One by one. They call it their friends and. Began to advance from the LV1 Dungeon. Loren. The low level Dungeon was easy to progress through. The LV1 Dungeon. Loren. At this stage was truly insignificant. So. Players. Clear. It. However. What caught everyone of guard was that this team. Their was actually a regional. Announcement. Regional. Announcement. Human Days. Players. Little follower. Little tsundera. Little junior. Little mom. First clear. The LV1 Dungeon. Loren. King. Difficulty. Receiving a. First clear reward of 100 free attribute points as reputation and 100.000 experience. Regional. Announcement. Trick and security. Cold mechanical voices left all players in the Human Days. Camp Dungeon. What's going on? LV1 Dungeon. In the original. There are. Actually Dungeon's this. Low level. That's so funny. I'm so jealous of that reward. They ought to see the world was anywhere. So they couldn't figure out the specifics of this system. Announcement. Bah. In Yangetown. No. It was the LVN defense line. It immediately caused a massive earthquake. Ammon applies. Holy crap. There is actually a. First clear reward. So good. So good. This is still the lowest level Dungeon. According to President Da. There are countless more. To come. Brothers. Stop talking and charge. I. Liao Yan. Will go out today. To see who won the first clear reward. Here I am. And to ama. All the guild members were excited. Eventos suppliers who had received the class change. That's called. Not to help but feel tempted. All today. Were temporarily not to sign the quote. And in 10 it. To run this low level Dungeon's. The first clear reward. Was used to enticing. Not only did it increase attributes. But the announcement was also like an. Advertisement for the entire human race. In gaming. How many players are indifferent to fame. Unfortune. The answer is almost known. It's estimated that no more than 5%. Therefore. All players beg and to rush forward. To progress through the Dungeons. This code inside. Without chance expectations. 5 minutes later. DLV3 Dungeon. Lord and death skin. Level. Was first cleared by a team of members. Sao Chen also received a timely system prompt. System prompt. The Lord task will in the underground city. Progress increased by. 1%. Rewarding a. 1%. Basic attribute bonus. System prompt. The Denmark region is now open. And the. Brailling Forest Dungeon areas appear. System notification. The Dungeons Loren and EPSO. Loren can be accessed. Troc the entrance at the River University Dungeon. Three notifications. Appear. The first was the reward for the quest. And the middle one was a reminder of the newly. Opened area. Although Chienjetown had been in the end. To elben defense line. It was nearly a change of. Name. In reality. The construction of Chienjetown had not changed at all. However. After. It was in Antwerp Tenmer. The entire village underwent a tremendous transformation. If. The village were divided into 8 parts. Then the eastern section would be the elben defense line area. The. Remaining 7 parts were officially in Antwerp Tenmer. The central area of the village. Which was originally an open space. And now transformed into the Dungeon entrance. The forest of ground. This change not only surprised. So Chen. But all the players active in Sianjatao. Were also why it died in. Estanishment. Is this the new Dungeon that the president mentioned? Amazing. Amazing. I'm. Impressed. Catching the pulling of such a big project. The president is so incredible. Damn. At this rate of development. Is expect that one day. The neighboring city will turn into our Sianjatao. First Dungeon to appear at the forest of ground entrance. West. The LV5 Dungeon. Dark Forest. Undoubtedly. Even at the king level. This Dungeon called barely last 10 minutes. Under the frenzy of. Númerous players before it being cleared for the first team. In fact. If it weren't for the requirement. Start from the easy level. For a newly opened Dungeon. This team called a beben cut down by at least. Following that. The second difficulty level. The LV8 Dungeon. Depths of the Dark Forest West. Clearly used 8 minutes. For the first king difficulty completion. This team. The players who. Achieved the first completion. Were no longer than familiar slacks to South Chen. Instead. We. We regional announcement. Human days. Players who run. Huns flower. Little fairy. And a co. Have a clear DLV8 Dungeon. Depths of the Dark Forest. King difficulty. For the first team. Receiving a first completion. Reward of 200 free attribute points. As reputation. And 200.000. Experience. Google. The big shots have made. They move. We can't get the first kill now. The vice president is mighty and imposing. By the way. Why is this in yet that máquina move? If. Did. Bolden the first kill be all his? Of course. It's because. And ya that don't want to. Compete with us. Guild channel. And ya dual play. I'm not interested. The king guild. Channel was basing with discussions. And South Chen helplessly reply. If it weren't for the Lord Quest Bill. Underground City. Specifically stating that. His completion as a Lord. Bolden the count as a quest reward. Will they use to. Buy and watch. A good. A be jumped in Lonago. However. His words sounded very. Convincing to everyone. A world announcement from president. That starts at 10.000 tribute. Points. How cold they care about this little thing. Understandable. All right. What we be been striving for. Is already insignificant. In front of president. That side. We real playing the same game. Entering at the same team. Why is the gap between people. So luckily. You had good foresight. And clank. The president. That early on brothers. Stop chatting. Since the president. Is the making. A mobile. Let's you speak. How is the family. By the vice president. Exactly the vice president. Is a healing class. We have a chance. The players understood. How chance. Perfectly. And immediately. Began in sociastically. Challenging the four members. The AMLED. By I. Hunsran. Interview. When facing. Such a low level. Don't get on. Every one skill levels. Where about the same. To se qualify. To join. Disabling realm. Are all exceptional individuals. Either possessing. Incredibly powerful. Group buff. Skills or being. Formidable. Hidden classes. Them selves. Aside from Saochun. No one. As truly. Submitted to anyone else. At this moment. Lu just ran. Being a healing class. Is clearly. A burden. In such a difficult environment. So everyone is filled. With fighting spirit. They all. Want to prove their strengths. By over. Sado in Lu just ran. However. While their intentions are noble. They are. Destined to be disappointed. 10 minutes later. DLV 9. Dungeon. Sanders ruins. Was clear. First by Lu just ran.

Led by Lu just ran or the members of the Fongming guild led by. Swangai. Oswe. D. Two teams were clearing Dungeon satan. Stanishing speed. Even the third recognized of the am. Led by. Brother Gongsi. Consisting of TGU. Eternal. Great Gile. Anestharlet radiance called Ntesna. A single one. Brother Gongsi and the others were clearly dissatisfied with this. But there was nothing. They called the. After all. Tear tema two tanks. A Gile. Anan assassin. Witch mad at. Efficiency in clearing lower level Dungeon somewhat lacking. In the human region channel. Human region. Anouncement players. Lu just ran. Lu just flower. First clear. DLV 9 Dungeon sanders ruins. 15. Difficulty. Receiving first clear rewards. Human region. Anouncement player. Lu just ran first clear.

The spam was overwhelming. Players in the human region. Except for to say in Edinburgh. Were all bewildered. Not understanding what was happening. It's all be. Noted that the last team there was such a rapid spam. Was when saw in creativity. However. Lu just ran and Swangeos was famous far from Saukins. By more than 100.000 miles. In fact. Most people have never even heard of Swangeos was. One of the top 10 guilds. Let alone Lu just ran. That's. The two leading teams spamming the chat. Uninformed players utterly confused. What's going on? Who are a TZ8 people? Wow. Is spamming the chat really this cheap now? Impressive. Impressive. Evento. Guidon. Understand the specifics. Use shouting 666. Season of. By the way. Where did. Al TZNU dongeons come from? Are you also usually awkward players? This is clearly the work of the. Great Demon King Kyanji. Ah. I remember now. The Great Demon King Kyanji mentioned. It in the hydrogen balloon. I was trying. Yes. Yes. I remember too. The events happening in. The Sablin Realm Guild called Nteby kept secret. And Sao Chen had no intention of hiding them. So soon. Informed players spread the news of all the players in the village. Lucin to clear dunggons. Talk forums. Like. Streams. And other channels. As a result. Players across the server were stuck. What? It. Was really the Great Demon King Kyanji who did this? With so many dunggons. There are actually more to come. Do I tell that man there will be endless dunggons to clear? What? Even if it's not the first clear. The rewards for completing dunggons are still pretty good. Damn. I'm tempted. I'm on my way. The continuous emergence of new dunggons. What do is it man? Leveling up. No longer having to. Tirelessly run out to the wild every day. Searching for leveling spots to grind. All you need to do is. Gather a few friends in the literally mine city and run some dunggons. Even if you can't clear them. It don't matter. As long as you can experience to level up. And most importantly. The dunggons in Denmark now do. Not limit the number of entries per day. Moreover. The rewards for clearing them are a quite. Generous. This mad the players who were in the no field. They are trusting with excitement. If this pase. Continues. There is a chance we can retire in Sinjato. Once this tot cross. There mines. The impulsive players called. No longer can't enter. Impatience and decisively spent one gold coin on the. Teleportation fitogobicity. Then a rush towards Denmark. Even the two gold coin entry. Tax per month was a pamphlet. But necessary expense for them. However. Be cause of a moment. Get set action. Later players found themselves. And able to enter Denmark. Be cause of a wasteful. You have. To know. That's a chance. Set the limit. 300,000 people. It's clear how popular. Edinburgh has become. However. Saochen didn't pay much attention to all this. Since the leading the. Time to achieve the first kill of the king. Level difficulty in the darks. And the ruins in June. The map had expanded again. The west coast. Was open. Dungeon entrance. The sky city area. Is now open instantly. The terrain next. To don't merender. Went a tremendous change. Clearly. In a barren desert. Suddenly a large lake appeared. A massive lake about 10 acres. In si. Se appeared out of nowhere. On the barren gobby. And this change. Was so sudden. That players quickly. Noticed it. What the hell. That's going on. Look quickly. The source of the change. Is emerging from. Chenietown. This must be the work. Of the demon king of Chenie. It's. Can actually. Change the terrain. Incredible. Simply unbelievable. This area. Is actually bending. To. West coast. Damn. Do you think. You don't know. This is a lake. One by one. Players were. Stan. By the side. Many speculated. That this change. West coast. By is out. Chen. And they'd offer. Ingrueven stronger. After all. The sudden appearance. Of a massive lake. In the gobby. Was truly unexpected. It's hard to imagine. What kind of man. Called the chip. Such a fair. Mysterious. Powerful. Unbelievable. Players from the outside. The world. Couldn't help. But click. Their tongue. Isn't a mass. Meanwhile. Many. Players in the edema. Region. Also. World-shocked expressions. Damn. Daddy. Chania. Is. Amazing. So amazing. Incredible. After the shock. Come excitement. And exhilaration. Having such a terrifying. Boss. Above them. Was also a matter of. Pleadeth for them. And all players. Chared in the. Glory. The west coast. Asapir. The newly opened area. Can probably. Come. That another 300. 000 people. So tune. Calculated silently. The current situation. Was. Very good news for him. The larger the territory. The more players. Cold. Reside there. Which will greatly improve. His efficiency. In recruiting. Subordinates. In the future. And this. Was used. The opening. Of the west. Coast. There were still. The east coast. Dark city. The vine capital. Virtual ancestor kingdom. Heavenly rail. And so on to come. So tune. I'm sure. I don't know what the final map of the Arab continent. Would look like. However. It is certain that if this trend continues. Perhaps Gobi city will soon be. Swallowed by it's air. And since the activation of the core of the Arab continent. Les dan 3. Ors have passed. And in terms of rewards. So tune. Is overjoyed. So far. The number of clear. Dungeon says it's 8. Starting from the first. Lauren. Rewards have been continuously given. Based on the progress. Of the lord quest build. Dungeon. 1%. 1%. 1%. 2%. 8. Dungeon sabe. Brought a total of 10%. Increase to sao chen's base. Attributes. His current attributes are ID. Chenji level. LV 80. 1 y 21 billion.

Result of sitting back and doing almost nothing. While significantly boosting attributes as mad as a. Chun feel incredibly comfortable. There are still many Dungeons left. And at this rate. Clearing a note. 10 Dungeons solved. No problem. Moreover. They get the difficulty of the Dungeons. The. Greater the rewards. A pan task completion. Now we be transformed from a single player. Grand player to a. Lazy type who gets stronger. Used by lying around. Not bad. The side quest recruit adventurers. Is also a good task for enhancing. Sao Chun's combat power. It runs concurrently with the. Lord quest build the Dungeon. And they do not affect the shooter. Unfortunately. According to the. Recruitment standards. Nearly clearing the Dungeon 2. Is not count as a successful recruitment. Only after. Successfully changing to a class. Within the Dungeon 2. It count as a successful recruitment. Now. Who is rain. Frosty snow. And others have already started. Totten intertasks. It won't be. Long before a wave of Braxor's era ips. At that time. A total of 500 players can increase. Sao chance attributes by 0.5%. I'll talk this number seems insignificant. Completing the side quest. Recruit adventures. Will grant an addition. El 5.000 slots. Feeling TC5. 0.000 slots. Means a 5% increase. Quite considerable. Just a Sao Chun toe. Son. After clearing the Dungeons. Flamgraca and Darks and the Ruins. Many players successfully chant. Clases. Frosty snow chant. To a Pantom Cry. Phoenix light dance.

You need to think of a way. To help everyone. Just as Sao Chen. Was silently. Pandering what kind of. Method would be appropriate. A lucky member of the guild. Suddenly dropped a weapon.

And his earth shattered during its forging. The blood of shattered mind is one of the top artifacts. For players at low levels. Placed in the original. Not only do es it have a significant increase in. Attributes far exceeding the golden quality equipment of the same level. But its additional threats ensure it. Can eman a main piece of equipment until level 50. The threat that reduces total HP is incredibly. Overpower. When facing basis. We see defense and fake all the guild members. Curious it all. A glance and to see who finished reading all the attributes were instantly stand. What is this an. Artifact mind weapon at LV20. Damn reducing total HP. Tats. Terrifying right dog. Definitely a dog.

Blue gear in my hands. And can't help but. Cry. In the guild channel. Dozens of messages were being sent every second. Fortunately. The equipment can be searched. In the chat channel. So the latter members can also see the attributes. So. There is shattering soul. Blood in the catalog. One by one. The members who were slow. Toriela is where I'll check.

After many players. They began. Their campoucher. They immediately. Became full of. Fighting spirit. Ready to grind. Throw the Demones. Because they believe. They also had a chance. The LV20 Dragon Man Tower. Right. Okay. Since there is no limit. On the number of times. They can enter the Demones. From now on. They would use. Grind. Tailstammon every day. If lack was. But. They would use. Work harder. One day. They took. Would have. Tantar on artifact. The tributes of. They were terrifying. And with a sense. Of showing off. So. Some guild members. Talk screenshots.

You started in full. To the fear. Makin. And maybe even more popular. Unfortunately. The area. Was limited. And couldn't take. Come. That too many players. Therefore. Many who came. Seeking. Fame.

To the early stage. Artifacts of the game. In the. Not bad. In the dungeons. Warehouse. There is one item. In stock. But after all. It's of artifact quality. There is another piece of. Equipment.

But with a eager probability. Of 3%. And the HP reduction. Increased. O 30%. This piece of equipment. Was something. So chuna. Once a dig. Opes for. After all. Considering his current. Attack speed.

L. excited the phases flashed as they debate into dungeons bigger to climb the rewards when this promotional event reached the outside world it naturally causes the bobo so in bios so jealous i'm still grinding in the normal level spider cave at this rate the gap between us and hontian will become more and more exaggerated it clearly had a chance to join hontian back then but he has set it for a few minutes and the opportunity slipped away now he used one to say regret it so much excuse me daddy and ya when will the hontia gild level up what about the nearby fongming gild are a jury cruting google used one to enter it and mirror the west coast to grain the oxide players are going crazy there are already countless dungeons to grain and many hidden hope qualifications making the ice red with jealousy and now so chun has privately dug into his own packets using equality equipment as gild benefits a truly grand gesture so king rewards for the entire server we salt these reasons how can anyone disease it's used to envy at this moment hontian is not only recognized as the number one guild on the server but its benefits also surpass all others to all outside the players hontian is the typical example of a better guild at the entrance to the west coast dungeon hontran little ferry and others around it sou chan chattering about something master master why are we excluded from the event yeah senia we also want the reward of ancient epic equipment and the wanting in the future of ancient to the west coast to the east coast to the east coast to the east coast we realize with your hontian gild can you at least consider us in this event the group felt somewhat wrong about south chance even why should they be excluded so and gawksui and fengking wouldn't know what to say at least hontian is within the scope of the event there fengming gild has nothing to do is it at all after thinking for a moment so and gawksui couldn't help but say even if the event does nothing to do is our fengming gild sold into the subsequent slats for hidden ho transfers be shared with us we shall take care of our allies otherwise a lot of us in fengming gild will want to jump ship after saying this so and gawksui were a bitter expression as the sign goes there is no harm without comparison being active in the same area as the hontian gild certainly has its advantages but looking at the inventory in the guild warehouse it was simply a world of difference the foaming guild's warehouse was almost unbearable to look at this led many members within the guild to express their desire to switch guilds more than once and such sentiments become the norm if it better and therefore hulintian sea always been at full capacity this situation would have already become a reality now that's how chanat return the gap in benefits between the two guilds was growing larger leaving swanggao so a feeling somewhat wrong where were the promised allies how infuriating couldn't they show a little care clearly the fengming guild was almost becoming your young subordinate guild she was not the type to be alleged this was used the atmosphere affecting her causing her to speak impulsively as outchun fast one agree be face after another it was about to say something when a system prompt sounded in his ear system prompt you have completed the task recruit adventures reward 5 000 recruitment slots triggering task second recruitment task content as adungeon lord how can you lack support needs please recruit a total of 500 adventures task progress 0500 task deadline none task reward 50000 news slots note the number of adventures is closely related to your strengths for a chewalk and adventure and their journey you receive a 0.001 attribute bonus data be 500 people completed it already so fast heo chang was somewhat surprised be cause only by completing the hope change task and becoming a profession in the dungeon called the task conditions be considered fulfilled now it was clear that all 500 members had completed their hope changes the speed was unexpectedly quick for sao chanat the reward of recruitment slots instantly made him happy first looked at swan jazwi don't say and don't take care of you now you have 5 000 slots so you have you a thousand thank you swan jazwi initially saw the look of astonishment but quickly became ecstatic with 1 000 slots there was finally an explanation for the members within the guild and she didn't have to worry about them rebelling again on the other side sao chanat instructed members rank 500 to 4 500 according to their guild contributions to go to various professional mentor npcs to accept hope change that's then turned at his gasto huns ran and the others this time it didn't tell that you participated in the guild event for a reason master what reason the little fairy girl was the most anxious speaking up first the others also looked at sao chan we see her anticipation sao chanat mysteriously answering while pulling out equality equipment from the dungeon warehouse to tell you the truth one of the privileges of my profession is closely related to the progress of various dungeons every time a dungeon is opened my attributes will increase significantly therefore i need you to quickly clear the various king level difficulty dungeons to speed up the progress take this equipment and use it to level a person as possible the equipment sao chanat pulled out was at least of ancient legendary quality level 35 oreba with the main weapons basically being of ancient epic level although only at one of each item in his dungeon warehouse there were so many types that giving them away didn't the head at all after all once he upgraded to an intermediate or even advanced dungeon lord a good and lack of vinegar levels and qualities of equipment so it was very generous each member including swang auxwe received 10 pieces this left everyone stand the attributes of ancient legendary items were slightly better than to say of the same level epic items only a few points che of the same level music items when a day ever since a chi attribute equipment everyone was trembling with excitement if ancient legendary items made them this excited how much more so for the even eager attribute ancient epic items so incredible as everyone carefully browse drug they even began to doubt they're on ice my goodness this ancient epic level cross last user from the basic attributes is already comparable to a lv 77 music quality main weapon and the special skills are so powerful that it makes me question my life who is flower called in the hell but this claims she adduced transition to a sword soul reaching lv 45 so saw in hand it heard in hand three tear blood my main weapon is also very strong the tributes are terrifying the other equipment is impressive though it's over it's over seeing this set of gear i feel like i can never rip a the favor of the great young in this lifetime thanks to my master's cultivation even if i have to work like a coward horse in my next life i must rip a my master's kindness meto even ever truly respected anyone but now i used want to say young jeda from now on it will be your most loyal daughter hun's rain hun's flower and the others were flashed with excitement among them the ones most grateful to sao chen were hengzi the abroter eternal big milk and echo hengzi joined after the establishment of hun lintiancia and was fortunate to be accepted as a disciple by sao chen having a relationship no less than that of hun's flower the abroter and the eternal big milk trio do it to their initial encounter with sao chen in newbie villa 777 ultimately reached their current it's overall 99 of the recent day cold growth or their current level was due to sao chen's guidance how could they not be moved even grateful sao chen's failed finally and what his hand in the entire original and only know a few of you so there is no need to say these things again let's get to the dungeon the best way to rip a me is to quickly increase the dungeon's progress yes understood hun's rain and the others responded loudly then they turned around and began to tackle the king level difficulty lord's palace after changing their equipment everiones attributes nearly increased and fall alto dlv 35 lord's palace at king level difficulty was quite it instantly became a piece of cake before them they had already completed the normal adventure and hero levels so they directly went for the king level difficulty just ten minutes later the system announcement there are two expected human region announcement players hun's rain hun's flower a be clear the lv 35 dungeon lord's palace king difficulty for the first team receiving the first clear reward the first kill was clam by hun's regnstein sao chen was not surprised by this situation hun's ran as transition to a paladin and the group buff is very strong hun's flower as transition to a sword soul and the output is of the charts a cow and hun's flower are roaming gunners and their output is also fierce with similar equipment the speed of clearing depends on the class configuration the class configuration in hun's regnstein was excellent one support and three damage the alerts many underestimated the support skills of a paladin but they were wrong having a good paladin in the team can increase the overall output by at least 80 percent therefore saw chunad anticipated this wisdom on cement appearing the next moment at the entrance of the east coast the entrance to the titan beast ungeon also appear system notification new area open this coast boom after a tremor that shook the ground the lake on the west coast instantly expanded and fall the area increased from 10 acres to 100 acres the newly opened area called the camera 200 000 players for free activities sao chen was already mentally prepared for this so it was not shocked the speed of development is so fast now every team a new area is open it changes a part of the map yes the mid-data tons a dark city and the snowy mountains are open it will affect gobi city it's team to give sao xiao a heads up so she can be mentally prepared sao chen talked about it and immediately contacted sao xiao since the last team is she came to young yet out to observe players on the orders of the human emperor so asia xiao had not left this was the first team sao chen at sing her since she returned to the human race as soon as they met so asia xiao immediately ask what's going on why has there been such a big change here also how did my disciple become an elementalist so asia xiao was not a player and no way of knowing the reasons for the changes from various channels so she was extremely shocked at this moment the changes in sian jet town were evident to anyone with a functioning brain and su xiao xiao was no exception originally a man a little village after a series of changes its territory had suddenly expanded many times over with several significant changes in terran just looking at the areas of the west coast and this coast what was once a desolate gobi landscape but suddenly transformed into a vast expanse of lacks in use one day this was something so xiao xiao simply called not comprehend sao chen talked for a moment and decided to share some information with horror have you heard of the arat cantenant so xiao look puzzle what is the arat cantenant even ever heard of it this cantenant beneath our feet is clearly cahed calitria de calitria cantenant was cahed the arat cantenant a hundred thousand years ago sao chem bluntly stated a hundred thousand years ago so xiao trembled alo ver anasque the historical records of the major races can only be transbacto alito lo ver twenty thousand years ago how do you know about events from a hundred thousand years ago and naturally have a maya on channels of information in any case don't delve deeply into this if you don't believe me you can go back to the imperial city and ask the historians about it you don't want to discuss this right now so xiao xiao was only at level 130 which placed here in the upper mid-middle tiramon al dn pcs of the human race so her knowledge was limited regarding the events on the arat cantenant a hundred thousand years ago sao chem felt that perhaps only the top echelons of the human race make no something as lona sucia oxiao returned to the imperial city and relad the information about the arat cantenant it was likely that top tier npcs would come to contact horror therefore he westo la citó explain further seeing that sao chem did not want to elaborate sucia oxiao helplessly stop her inquiries all right then what do you need to see me for sao chem pandered for a moment and said you based in the current situation my village is starting to expand rapidly this kind of expansion is beyond my control according to my calculations it will likely reach gobi city no more than three days so he wanted to inform you in advance so the groups of the human empire can be mentally prepared sao chem did not beat around the bush and directly started his original purpose his words were in dead without exaggeration the current expansion of the area was truly in an encounter level stay himself did not know how much territory dark city in the stand is no feel good actually by once all the instances of the celestial beast were clear therefore i wanted to inform so is sao sao in advance hoping the npc group s would be mentally prepared the initial revelation about the arat cantenant was merely to increase credibility all right it will report this matter so asao saw replied after a moment of silence sao chem naddi okay if there is nothing else yeyee take my life what you still haven't told me how my disciple be came out elementalist so asao saw seeing sao chem about to live quickly can plant my good disciple just as you was starting to appreciate her as been ruined by you no way you have to come and say me with a new disciple or you will go seek advice from that's only fine yeyee keep an eye out sao chem west pitless so siaoxiao if i remember correctly originally looked down on feng king gu but now that the disciple had transferred to siaolan it was suddenly anxious it can only be said that in the arts of npcs the immortal is truly appealing thanks to sao chance bigger support the tributes of lu justran and others caire equity after the east coast area open the six dungeons of the celestial beast lv 36 outer temple lv 38 trayent forest lv 40 purgatory lv 42 first spine lv 44 seconds pain and lv 46 celestial forbidden land were quickly cleared off the first four according to the rewards from the lord quest build the underground city including the lv 35 lord's palace a total of five dungeons increased sao chance base tributes by 16 the first four gap 3% eh and the fifth gap 4% quite impressive it is worth mentioning that starting from the outer temple there required number of players to enter eh dungeon west no longer limited to 4 bad began to increase from 10 by the team they started tackling dlv 44 seconds by in dungeon it had been turned into a 30 player dungeon however the increasing the number of players indicated that the difficulty of the dungeon had also risen sao chen watched lu justran and others they are apt to clear the dungeon stroke the observation system and felt that if nothing unexpected happened they would likely clear it by the next day if it weren't for the lack of stamina sao chen talked that clearing it to the bolden they be a problem unfortunately it was bound by his stamina currently the king level difficulty is much easier for lu just reina and his group you just wonder when the base level difficulty will be on the doy have to what until he advanced to an intermediate dungeon lord sao chen matter to himself the various dungeons in the poison milk powder are the base level difficulties that were even more challenging than the king level for some reason they have not appeared until now therefore sao chen could only speculate that perhaps after advancing in his profession and gaining more resurrection and pc privileges the base level difficulty would finally emerge of course there was no need to think about this now when the time comes it will appear just as a change was saving a class that can inspire the gains imandentire whole intention and fengming guild was quietly unfolding far away in swambo city several main cities away swambo city at the headquarters of the proud guild in the conference room present were many members of the proud guild's right teams as well as the precedents of various top guilds in swambo city and the top 10 guild candidates the president of the tiancia guild president emperors got swept around all present as slowly said and call it everyone here today manly to discuss two series issues so you get straight to the point first how to deal with the huling tiancia and fengming guilds at least to interact their momentum and even discuss how to bring about the downfall second how to deal with the demon king and ya and take him with the one by as soon as emperors words fell the atmosphere in the entire conference room exploded everyone present except for a few who previously discussed with emperor began to doubt their own ears this this is the very practical right who is the demon king and ya and ya and ya and ya and ya and ya and ya as the number one player in the entire server everyone must have seen the live broadcast of the lv 180 musical boss battle again theme right loom by impossible exactly the number of players has lost its meaning in front of him even if we combine all the players from our guilds we can do it dealing with huling tiancia and fengming guild is equally as difficult as reaching the sky most of the people present called no longer see still hui zianje is the unparalleled powerhouse who defeated a lv 180 musical boss in a head-on battle with in 5 minutes the undisputed number 1 player in the game with combat power far exceeding that of mainstream players reaching an incredible high to think they could take him down what an unrealistic notion the leaders of the top guilds present were all here out of respect for the emperor having fought alongside the aoc guild in various virtual games forming a supportive relationship however upon hearing the emperor's words they couldn't help but erupting outre are you looking for the a dumb don't drag me into this even they ranking members with it the aoc guild looked at the emperor with incredulous expressions auxol joan de mai tank of the right team bluntly study president he understand that being targeted by yanja is a humiliation that our entire guild cannot escape and he harbour immense hatred for yanja having talked of revenge countless days and nights but now is not the right team don't you think this decision needs to be reconsider all joan's words were kit attackful but the underlying meaning was that the emperor had lost his mind is yanja the demon king is it to the alwis have you forgotten how our members were slaughtered before leading to the disillusion of our mind guild now you won to seek revenge without keeping a low profile have you lost your senses president there is plenty of time ahead we've been can't remember what the ancient said a gentleman's we've been is never told at the let's develop our strengths quietly and when we are confident we cannot bolden that that be wonderful all joan earnestly advice most people present nothing in agreement they share the same sentiment that objectives mentioned by the emperor at little tono passability the first was as difficult as reaching the sky i'll talk the holding guild only at 10 000 members each member was our talent and with chenya support the overall strengths of the guild far surpassed that of the main forces of other guilds as for the fengming guild being one of the top 10 guilds its original foundation was not weaker than that of the aoc guild now that the aoc guild had fallen from the perspective of surface strengths there was hardly any hope of victory if a war broke out everyone looked at the emperor waiting for his response in the silence the emperor spoke he understand everything you said but there is one point he disagree with and that is the team is now in my view the team has already matured and is urgent at least when it comes to dealing with yanja this issue has been perfectly resolved as on as a finished speaking the ten six chance glances in this belief emperor please explain why the team is urgent a top guild leader from swanbu city as kept first everyone nodded in unison silently waiting for the emperor's explanation the emperor did not all back shaking his head and saying you must have seen the development momentum of the hunting guild idare say if we delay any longer no matter how hard we try we want a viable to surpass them in fact the gap will only widen at this moment the only way to prevent the gap from widening is to forcefully occupy young tom's territory and take control of all the dungeons ownership only then can we avoid falling vain and after seizing the territory we can allocate these resources to ourselves the crowd fails island the emperor's words were in the head not wrong they had all witnessed the development of yanja town the numerous nuri open dungeons the equality equipment data the merget and the terrifying number of powerful hidden classes all of it made them incredibly eager in the head under normal circumstances one could only watch as the other party left them far vain if they could sister resources the talk sparta flame in everiones mines they seem to see an incredibly dazzling pasto the heavens the benefits are undoubtedly clear but the key now is how can we deal with yanja and all the players from the two guilds please explain empire president another guild leader has kept calmly everyone felt as if a bucket of cold water had been for the verte heads and all their fantasies were instantly shattered yes the pasto the heavens was in the dazzling but someone had already clambered and that person was someone they couldn't figure out how to they always know matter how hard they try if they wanted to seize the resources they feel that to eliminate this obstacle but how cold they do that thinking of this everyone couldn't help but turn their gas back to the emperor it brought this matter up surely at a way right after all they had used her team confidently say that dealing with yanja was no problem prideful emperor looked around realizing the atmosphere had reached its peak so it didn't kept them in suspense this matter is actually thanks to yanja let me introduce you to a player from the dark lord guild of the demon race madman the emperor pointed to a demon player everyone couldn't help but look over only to discover that amidst the crowd of human players there was actually a demon player hidden looking at his appearance it seemed to be caucasian however what did this have to do is the dark lord many scratched their heads not understanding why and it's true demon player was receiving the emperor's attention hello everyone young madman a player from the dark lord at the emperor's gesture madman began to explain a few things what the emperor president said about this being thanks to yanja is actually very true do you all remember the lv 180 musical boss the lord of the it is it was the one that yanja talked down a week ago it is actually the master of ordemon npcs and as the ability to resurrect software being divided a harbors immense hatred for chenya and by chance you encountered him that you received a quest you won't take going to too much detail about this specific quest at this point madman's file it cannot tell you that the reward you received is the skill life exchange life exchange active skill target a target lv 100 and below player only after using this skill both will perish together coldom time 1 as madman introduced his skill most people present were stand what are players below lv 100 would surely gain the face of this skill this meant that even the great demon king chenye was no exception everyone was seeing such an incredible skill for the first team i'll talk the demon player madman would also die alongside the target pan using the skill for an ordinary player to exchange blows with someone like the great demon king chenye who was the number one pulgada dentile server was simply two advantages the cold on time was only one or meaning that as long as the teaming was precise and oh they called in short chain is the at once every year this was simply a killing weapon taylor made for an invincible player like yanja everyone was charged fast with this skill goodian is immortal body finally is chatter however the can once were not blinded by this skill and remain very clear-headed one guild leader said calmly the exchange tactic isn't that good but what significance does it all even if yanja is incredibly unlucky every team he dies he will definitely drop a piece of equipment but just look at the guild warehouse so who'll in tientang how many times do we need to take him down before he completely runs out of it quality gear and with a one or cold on that's an optimal for sa 800 come back and 14 oh guild who can bear such heavy losses upon hearing this everyone fell silent the president added a brilliant point by the way he used received news that senji has promised to he rewards to motivate the guild players and the management of hu lin tientangas completely revamped the equipment with his support clearly trying to rely on dropping equipment to bring him down is nothing but a pipe dream the mood among the crowd grew heavy what this person said was indeed correct what is the goal of killing kyan ji is dead to drop the equipment on him causing his strength to plummet until a hit rock button however used thinking about his numerous equality items made everyone silently check their heads even if we design a way to turn him into a red name and we some like money to drop a piece of equipment every time we kill him it would still take at least over 200 times to ensure he has no equality gear left to wear right this is indeed a bit of a dream because kyan ji is certainly not a fool when he has no gear he can just go kill some basis and get a few first kills right with his strengths equality equipment is practically endless what is the point of the exchange tactic can we withstand the future streaks in italy action from him the leaders of several major guilds began to carefully consider the pros and cons at this moment i'll see the huang slowly spoke up you have to admit you do have a point but have you consider what benefits we can gain in this process the equipment drop from xiang ji can be won by us when we have equality gear won't the or combat power skill ok the individual got between us and xiang ji will likely never right oh and one more thing you forgot to mention the madman's life exchange skill makes the priest resurrection ineffective this has been repeatedly verify the ones where signited the thoughts of most people yes we are applies the equipment dropped by xiang ji can be used by us at all with this mutual rise and fall the ga will inevitably become smaller and we make not even need the exchange tactic we call directly charging and taking down the one's final explanation made everyone realize that the probability of this happening was practically a done ideal use thinking about being able to where the numerous equality items draw by can't be made everyone's eyes turn red with excitement damn it he will a oi did he is the used the number one player in the game but there to be afraid of he also agree with this plan don't know what the same general's have any special privilege he how tiansya also have a chance to be the number one player in the game ah how can such a shocking event that there's the entire server not include me also count me in everyone started banging the table excitedly shouting the enormous benefits laid out before them came by in with the ones that plan made it impossible for anyone to resist attempt action however it was still the president who spoke first and come down so the problem with qian ji is sal what about hong lintian tang and fong min hill upon hearing this everyone's expressions froze hong lintian tang is another story with 10.000 members they are exceed several tiers of mainstream players and the elite teams of various guilds probably can't compare fong min guild is even one of the top 10 guilds in the entire server under its name there are at least 50 branches which means the number of members exceeds 500 000 the total number of members from all the guilds present only adds up to a little over 1 or 200 000 this numerical advantage do is not actually can't set for the disadvantage in strength levels if our breaks out it will be a tough battle careful consideration is needed looking at the expressions of those are present the emperor no it was timetote this is a easy action there is no need to worry the first wave will not be us attacking action ourselves everyone so with a look of astonishment what do you mean do we have a helpers that's right the emperor no longer elba sign camly or helpers are the demon plans guild dark lord and the or clans guild frenzied battle tc2 guilds can support us with massive funds issue bounties and mobilize players across the server to take down the members of the guilds ruling the world in poenis crywis that one sentenced withers chattering dark lord and frenzied battle are both recognized as one of the top 10 guilds indentured server with the foundations with the financial support of tc2 guilds and by publicly issuing bounties on the forums it is likely that the independent players looking for rewards will rust to hand down the members of ruling the world in poenis crywis that medicals plan this is a grand undertaking everyone looked at the emperor who sat proudly at the top and couldn't help but feel a renewed respect for him no wonder we sons one of the top 10 guild leaders this level of cunning truly matter them not directly underestimate him all right if there are no objections we will start our operation in three days three days of preparation team is more than no the emperor slowly looked at everyone seated below nodded in satisfaction as they agree with the plan settle a surge of ambition rose within him xiang ji oh xiang ji if you wanna blame someone blame your arrogance back then this garage e the emperor will definitely rip on the other side today's later south chen was unaware that a large group of players outside the swamboo city were plotting against him at this moment they is coast was saving with members of ruling the world and when he is cry as well as independent players are working hard on dungeons grind on work hard this area all my subordinates reserves south chen was very satisfied with the current situation it's all be noted that one of the conditions for his promotion task was to gather 100 000 players the more players in the denmar area the better however there was one thing that traveled him a bit the hunran group actually started talking plan that the difficulty of the king level dungeons is too low it's also my fault for being too generous giving out so much equipment for training if it better for wanting to quickly advance the dungeon progress and improve my basic attributes how cold they have encountered such good fortune they are so grateful so chen matter to himself the reason was simple after equipping themselves with ancient legends and ancient epics the strengths of the hunran group served and they became somewhat inflated in the regos in just one day they had cleared all four king level difficulty maps the lv 36 temple outskirts lv 38 trayent forest lv 40 purgatory and lv 42 first spine now they were slowly advancing trop dv 44 seconds pain warrior level difficulty and it boldened the villain before they also cleared the king level difficulty of the second spine this caused envy among all members of both guilds who expressed their gratitude to the south for planning the internal activities of the guild why excluding the management team it is worth mentioning that the lv 44 seconds pain can come that 50 people with only a few being from the management team there is a reference of the hunran group who were also excluded from the activities after the progress moved so quickly the group in june began to feel somewhat dissatisfied with their average level of lv 45 tackling this mre king level dungeons was a bit too easy lacking the thrill of breaking into the lv 40 minotaur king nightmare level dungeons this madden saochen anabel to help but secretly kemplan what a bunch of masochists although king level dungeons were much easier kemper to the lv 40 nightmare level minotaur king dungeons the quality of the equipment draped was by in omeans inferior and in fact it seemed to be slightly better simpler dungeons yielding bigger quality equipment tc people were actually still not satisfied truly overindulged while saochen was grambling a sudden system prompt caught his attention task recruit again completed reward 50 000 recruitment slats you have triggered a new task did recruitment task content recruit 50 000 adventures again and have them all changed to their first hope task reward 500 000 slats dot the previous second recruitment task was very simple with 500 slats it was not for everyone to fight over in usual or it was a la lequette the day past and everyone had completed their hope change task becoming first hope classes at this moment the task completion surprisingly granted saochen 500 000 new slats the reward is actually 10 times you wonder if this recruitment task series as an upper limit if not that would be great 500 000 slats in the sounded like a lot but compared to all the players in edinmer in the west and east coasts it was still a bit lacking however as long as saochen recruited 100 000 a call fulfill one of the conditions for hope advancement so eva stana harry what delighted in west the triggering of the second task system prompt you have triggered the task of each challenge task content after having 5 500 professional adventures under your name as the lord you sold provided your support needs with more challenging tasks thus opening the obvious difficulties from lv20 dragon man tower task reward 1 increase your own base attributes by 20% task reward 2 it's a board need member who clears an evis dung heom for the first team limited to 11 per dung heom only for the first clearing team will receive a base tribute increase of 2% to 200% task reward 3 and lack item type shop permissions the new task was the opening of a bis level dung heoms the rewards were truly astonishing for geochem clearing dlv20 dragon man tower dung heom for the first team will grant a 20 base tribute reward the ultimate as a subsequent dung heom was cleared there will be continuous cumulative rewards used like the lord task build the underground city more importantly it was the unlocking of item type shop permissions this made hea ochen ecstatic the item type shop had always been something a cavity although he hadn't unlocked the permissions before a e code admire the items quietly advanced outfit synthesizer golden equipment synthesizer celia's lucky hitbox revival coin the monkey's contract overlords contract plus 10 equipment enhancement voucher there were too many types and the h1 had significant effects so chen atlombent empty it took the meat and lack the item shop permissions after hope advanced button expectedly a new task appeared now unfortunately this task still required him to take action personally only the adventure is a recruited cold receiver rewards a pantail first clear say after becoming a junior dung heom lord it seems the dung heom runs are a destined to be out of my rich am i just going to keep lying down and winning like this so chung silently rolled his eyes whether it's the best challenger quest or the build a dung heom quest basically the rewards have nothing to do with him i don't care about the first completion rewards which makes him feel quite a board he opens that zone some decent opponents will appear to him some gaming experience so chen didn't expect that zone his dream would come true but that's a story for later so let's know mention it for now guild channel send everyone pay attention the bs level 20 dragon man tower dung heom is now open players who want to challenge it can enter additionally used like opening a map after clearing the dragon man tower in the bs the level 22 puppet got the way will open in a bs level and so on so chen's words caused a uge uproaring dentire guild channel what the hell it didn't expect or guild leader to quietly pull off such a big move a level 20 a bs difficulty dung heom or a verage level is nearly 40 it sold t be too much of a problem right brothers let's charging and get the first kill beats chattering glad the giri come one by one the guild members were like they have been injected with adrenaline in fact it's not their fault after all they had never experienced the brutal beating of an a bs level dung heon and didn't know its terror
