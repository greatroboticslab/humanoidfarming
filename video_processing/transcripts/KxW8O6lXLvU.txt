Education
 When planning your garden, remember this, beans, greens, fruits and roots. Beans are plants like green beans, peas and peanuts. These can help add nitrogen back to the soil. Next, in that same bed, I would plant things in the greens category. Plants like lettuce, spinach, cabbage and broccoli, all things that like added nitrogen. I would follow the greens with plants in the fruits category. These are plants like tomatoes, peppers, squash and melons. We also include potatoes in this category. They're in the same family as tomatoes and similar pests and diseases will affect them. And last will be my roots. Plants like carrots, radishes, beets, onions and garlic.
