Conservation agriculture for efficient water use

 Water is necessary to grow the food we eat. But water shortages and inefficient water use around the world put food security at risk. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center is working to improve water efficiency for agriculture through cropping systems such as conservation agriculture and sustainable intensification. So here we investigate conservation agriculture and compare it with the traditional system. In this petal test, water is poured on soil from a conventional agriculture system and conservation agriculture to measure how much water the soil can absorb for later use before it begins to run off. Conservation agriculture reduces soil erosion and water runoff and improves crop yields while making agriculture more environmentally sustainable through the three principles of zero tillage, covering soil surfaces with crop residue, and use of crop rotations. Soil used in conventional agriculture could only absorb 19 seconds of water, while soil under conservation agriculture absorbed over 2 minutes and 30 seconds of water. Under drought conditions, conservation agriculture can use water much more efficiently, meaning that farmers can harvest 3 to 4 tons more maize per hectare compared to conventional agriculture. Water is one of the most important resources for plants. Conserving water and using it more efficiently means a more food-secure future for all.
