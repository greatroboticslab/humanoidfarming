Organic vs. Conventional Farming: Demystifying Farming Methods and How Food Gets to Us

Education
 Hey guys Charles barber here and today I want to demystify some things and really educate you guys as consumers like I've educated myself as a product formulator and consumer myself on how food gets to us and all the different ways that it can get to us and certain farming methods that are used and Certain names that society is given these farming methods and so that as when you go to the store you can kind of see these terms used whether it's organic or conventional or sustainable or wild harvested or heirloom or all these things like what do they mean and I just want to go into all that today So that you can be the most educated consumer there is and since we are in the information age I know you guys are thirsty for this knowledge just like I was when I first started my health journey And this is real critical information So we're just gonna get started right from the beginning, but before we get started I want to go over so the main topics that we're gonna go over and what we're gonna cover we're gonna cover conventional farming we're gonna cover organic farming And that's basically the the rut of what we know as as consumers We know like industrial farming or conventional farming and then we know what known as organic farming and That's typically it right. Well, I want to let you guys know that's not just it There's actually some other ways to produce food that are starting to get some traction and starting to build and it's part of the reason why I Started crucial for farms But I really want to educate you guys on these other methods because they are becoming more prominent And they actually are the staple to the products that we source at crucial for so really cool stuff So that's gonna include things like regenerative farming biodynamic farming a Korean natural farming closed loop farming That's all gonna kind of be lumped in one category outside of organic and conventional And the reason why those so many of those terms are lumped together is because a lot of these things are new old ancient farming techniques merged with new techniques So we're just lumping them all together And then the underneath that's gonna be what's called wild simulated, which is different obviously than all three of those groups and then last but not least we're gonna look at what's called a wild crafted or wild harvested so you guys can Know what the heck does that mean? So let's get started with conventional because it's that something we all know about And it's very interesting because it hasn't started to happening and since the industrial age So my little is call it industrial farming pretty much is what it is And when we look at this whole kind of idea of conventional farming the whole idea is that you know There's people starving and we need to produce all this food So we kind of left the traditional model which was more of the organic model back in the day where we had a bunch of small farmers And we started producing massive amounts of food for the population And this was kind of the conventional model on the whole philosophy behind it The problem is that it started to really break down the soil fertility and we actually started losing soil fertility Using this conventional method from things like tilling and not using cover crops to no mulching So we started to lose our topsoil And that's something that's really important to understand because we don't want to lose topsoil topsoil is the most Primo soil that we can we can utilize in farming because it's going to contain a lot of the organic matter that we need So that the plants can be healthy so that we can be healthy So conventional farming really doesn't taking this into account So a lot of times what they're doing with conventional farming is they're producing massive amounts of products They're usually doing a typical till method where they till up the topsoil And then what's in a huge big area and that's typically done in what's called a mono culture Or mono crop and what that means guys is that it's just one thing So one thing of corn You know In the back in the day there was never such thing as a corn farmer or soybean farmer a farmer was a farmer he had chickens pigs he had everything Watermelons tomatoes onions That's what a farmer was and most of us when we think of farming I think that's what we think of too Is we think of a farmer is having like all these animals around but I want to just clarify it conventional farming isn't like that You know, it's typically one crop a mono crop in a big field and they till up that topsoil Which exposes all that to bacteria which can can kill off the good and bad Bacteria, so it's controversial to say that's good. I don't believe it's good Because it doesn't create soil fertility, which is the biggest reason why we want to make sure we're purchasing food from sustainable farming methods that build soil fertility So that we can have soil fertility in later generations because if we consume food That's not grown in a way that's sustainable and regenerates the land Then we are part of the problem by purchasing it So the thing that you also want to understand with conventional farming is a lot of times the plants are force-fed what's called Fertilizers, but these fertilizers might be a little bit different than what farmer Joe used back in the day These fertilizers are typically salt based fertilizers and one thing that you want to understand with that is that a lot of these these fertilizers are coming from Coltar derivatives or they're coming from Hydro carbons, so they're coming from oil their petrochemicals, right? So they're kind of feeding that whole infrastructure But the whole idea and though and what they're doing other than where they come from is that they kind of force feed the plants It almost be like you injecting an IV of nutrients in your body You'd get those nutrients inside of you But you wouldn't use the natural metabolic pathways that that you have naturally to utilize those nutrients So you're kind of bypassing that if you will And so what ends up happening is the plants become weaker and weaker and we start to see things like GMOs genetically modified organisms being produced just so we don't have to spray as many of these harmful not fertilizers, but actually pesticides and herbicides and fungicides which are more chemicals on Top of the fact that the fertilizers were using that even though they're salt based their chemical base as well. They're not Organic they don't have an organic carbon molecule attached to them So they're not considered organic and they're salt based and so due to the plant not getting able able to utilize those nutrients Efficiently through its own metabolic pathways through its root systems through bacteria through fungi What happens is the plants become susceptible to disease? Herbs can overgrow Pests can come in Fungus can come in insects can come in and so now we have to spray Insecticide now we have to spray Pesticides now we have to spray all these chemicals suicide on our food on top of this unsustainable method of producing a massive amount of one thing which just doesn't make logical sense The fact that we're using fertilized Fertilizers that are salt based and chemical based doesn't make much sense But again all this feeds that industrial complex that that was basically born in the 50s Which is as long as we've been doing conventional farming so conventional farming is very truly Unconventional to me and it's the weird thing but at the end of the day, it's it's what's there what's available to us as the masses And I look I know I'm opinionated here, but obviously Because what I do but I really want to kind of educate you as to what those facts are to and not be so biased Because at the end of the day you have to make the decision for yourself So again, just kind of wrapping up conventional farming Unsustainable farm practices that lose soil fertility. I mean, that's not a bias statement. That's what happens That's why they have to crop rotate or they out farm a place and have to go somewhere else Also water quality water quality is not really regulated. So you have a lot of like fracked water. I like to call it It's just dirty water that used in irrigation You're also using Genetics of plants that aren't true to what the research indicates and I'm gonna get into that more later But the idea is we're seeing a lot of hybridized plants being grown using conventional methods of plants that have been bred to produce a certain resistance to a pest These are like GMO genetically modified organisms or the genes have actually been modified So that we don't have to spray as much chemical And they're actually putting the chemical in the gene so when the insect bites the plant it dies So it's basically the same thing. It's just inside the genes of the plant now And so these are kind of again the big ideas with conventional farming The other thing that you want to look out for again is just the overall aspect of Lack of again soil fertility It's huge. I know I've said it like three times already But it's just really something you want to keep it into your and put in your mind's eye Well that in a nutshell wraps up conventional farming. You've got Chemical fertilizers, you've got then chemicals you spray for your pests Fungicide herbicide larvicide suicide stuff Insects pest management if you will You're typically tilling up the soil and you're tilling up a huge mega field of soil Which isn't that pretty counterproductive and then you're only growing like one thing So unlike nature when you go to a forest, you know, you see tons of different diversity everywhere I mean you see life just booming, but obviously with the monocrop method That's part of why nature is wanting to come in and eradicate all of that one thing to create homeostasis imbalance And that's why conventional farmers have such a hard time dealing with pests and dealing with all these things because They're really literally fighting nature Alright, well that's conventional farming So underneath that is organic farm and a lot of us are familiar with organic farming and a lot of us know that that's the best way to get food But it's not But I do want to explore some of the things that organic farming does that obviously conventional farming is it So first and foremost with organic farming, you're not seeing massive massive farms like you are in the conventional level You're still seeing large farms. Okay, and that can be questionable whether they're good or not But you're not seeing on a massive scale like conventional farming You're also you're still seeing a lot of the tilling method But some farmers don't till some farmers in the organic method do cover crops or they'll do mulch Or they'll just bring in you know a top layer of carbon to help Soil retention and help use less water Which is sustainable which also Lee which also helps build soil fertility So with organic we're automatically seeing some farmers building soil fertility We're seeing that they're using sustainable methods that are allowing them to use less water And typically with organic farmers they don't use the same quality of irrigated water as conventional farmers said they're a little bit more regulated in that world And so they're using a little bit higher quality water sometimes but not all the times So it's kind of hit or miss you really have to know where your food came comes from if it's just stamp USDA organic You've kind of know that farm Verse you know if it's a mass-produced farm it's something that you're seeing in Whole Foods that you see in California But then also see on the East Coast more than likely that's a pretty large organic farm that maybe not be using some of these sustainable methods But at least with the organic farmers they're not using salt based fertilizers So that's another thing that's really cool So they're using organic fertilizers things that you put into the soil or you put on the plants that the bacteria eat That's the whole kind of concept with organic. It's kind of like the concept of organic chemistry You're using life as it is and using what's been given to the plants and utilizing their natural metabolic pathways through bacteria and fungi So you're really focusing on nurturing them versus just the plant because we understand that we nurture this the bacteria and fungi But then then they'll feed the plant and there's actually certain bacteria known as micro horizon But your bacteria that live on the root rhiza means root micro small life So it's kind of interesting that conventional farmers kind of just neglect that even though it's basic biochem It's kind of interesting But with the organic farming, you know farmers are acknowledging this and they have to because they can't spray these chemicals So they're automatically using organic fertilizers, which you know obviously have to be purchased outside the farm and brought in which can cause You know organic farming to cost more money We're seeing more I what's called IPM integrated pest management So IPM is going to be something that's more where they're not spraying herbicides pesticides There are some certified organic sprays you can spray that are questionable to me They're still certified organic, but they're to me they're they're still harmful, you know I always question like why is a plant and why is nature trying to take out that plant in the first place? And it's kind of the same with us like why do we get sick and get cancer? And it's typically because we have something going on with inside of us It's kind of the same with the plants the more you connect plants and farming and work with plant medicines You really start to invoke their intelligence and you start to understand them And just like you start to understand yourself more and so naturally they're wanting to you know utilize their natural pathways But again if you know in farm in organic farming you do see a lot of integrated pest management organic pest management organic pesticides But you know it could be something like neem oil or something like that It doesn't necessarily be something harmful some are kind of questionable But some are not but the whole idea here again is that they're using organic pesticides herbicides larvicides insecticides instead of chemical based ones fueling the basically the oil industry Petrochemical cartel if you will So you're pulling away from that however It does become more expensive along with having to purchase the fertilizers having to purchase these Pests these I these organic pesticides are these organic IPM and great integrated pest management Now some farmers are getting real smart and they're starting to use true IPM integrated pest management In a way it doesn't utilize chemical sprays, but utilizes other Predator mites or insects So if you have like aphids they'll let let out ladybugs right and they'll purchase ladybugs which can be expensive but they're using insects to fight the infection which is really cool because You can watch this if you've ever seen aphids on a plant and they release all these ladybugs the ladybugs will literally come and they'll start eating the pest You know and stuff and so they're predatory mites and everyone loves ladybugs, right? So that is like the more natural way to go is using the IPM with the insects But obviously it's still considered organic the the sprays the organic sprays can be somewhat better Another thing to you want to take in consideration with organic is that you're typically not gonna get too much hybridized varieties You will get some they will get swept in there, but you're typically not gonna see that so much You'll see a little bit of what's heirloom which is used exclusively and the other farming method that I'm going to mention but you start to see a little bit more what's called heirloom genetics and the whole difference with you know GMOs and hybridized and heirloom is that When first thing we want to understand is you know when we modify things we're changing things as to where they truly were And when we hybridize things we're obviously doing that as well But with heirloom we're typically seeing these old old ancient varieties that have just they're tried and true They stand it out the test of time right and they're here and there and they're doing their deal and those have been less Messed hampered with and and experimented with if you will and so for me That's something that I really wanted to focus on because at the end of the day All these different ways that things are getting modified and hybridized They've never been proven to be beneficial for us at all It's always just been this concept of we do these things so we can produce more produce more produce more in this unsustainable way So it's kind of like in my opinion and kind of like pissing in the wind It's like okay, so we can produce all this food now, but now the food is less nutritious Which is exactly what's happening? I mean we've lost like 12% of our I think it's 18% of our zinc levels 12% of our calcium levels I mean the list goes on and on food is becoming weaker and weaker and weaker Because of the way we're farming and even the organic food doesn't have the nutrient density Obviously the conventional doesn't but even the organic varieties are losing their densities And I think a lot of that's because of the lack of use of regenerative farming which is what we're going to talk about next Look at that creates more soil fertility So just wrapping up organics you're seeing that we're using you know organic fertilizers, which is great You're seeing some sustainable methods of like composting and worm binning and things like this, which is also great But across the board is probably not being used a hundred percent, but for the most part we'll say it is So fertilizers integrated ever seeing more integrated pest management So we're seeing lack of chemical sprays to help with fungicides herbicides larvicides We're seeing that Some soil fertility is being built. We're seeing some sustainable methods But however, there's a lot of inputs that are being brought into the farm So a farmer has to purchase these and so that's what's causing the cost to go up Also, there's not a lot of machinery that's available It's conducive to organic methodologies as well. So a lot of this machinery that we see with conventional farming Which is kind of arbitrary as well as to Has there's been a lot of funding been put behind it, but not as much in the organic world But we're seeing more and more and it's growing it's getting better and better every day. So I mean it's a win-win right at the end of the day So that pretty much sums up organic Now the water obviously is a little bit better as well, so Just so you understand that You know organic is gonna be your best bet as far as a broad scale goes You know it truly is because you're working naturally with the natural metabolism of the earth and the ecosystem to a degree granted if you buy You know lava sand from some other you know all across different part of the country and then bring it all the way over here That's not really sustainable and that's not really echo economical and echo. You know, it doesn't really make the most sense unless you know You have to and for the farmers that are going out from conventional to organic they they just that's their mentality So that's kind of why they they kind of have to go that route. So it it is what it is But I want to let you guys know about a few other methods that have really shaped my future as to my mission in life and part of what we're doing here at crucial for far So the third method I want to talk about today is a method that really Impacted my life heavily and reason why I wanted to start crucial And it's something that's real important to me and something I want to share with you guys because it's taken me over 10 years of research to really come to grips with this knowledge Understand this knowledge use this knowledge And understand the implications of what this knowledge and and these techniques can actually do and again It's known as a regenerative or biodynamic or closed loop farming method The idea here is that you're creating copious amounts of soil fertility by using all the different inputs from the land that you're on to go back into your soul to create that fertility And that's kind of where that closed loop idea comes from but the reason why You're creating so much fertility is because you're using things some your local ecosystem A lot of farmers even in the biodynamic use a lot of things called compost teas or they'll spray beneficial microbes on their garden But with this regenerative closed loop model instead of purchasing those microbes from another ecosystem You actually cultivate the indigenous microorganisms from your environment and what's so important about this is in this model You're actually able to utilize everything that's from around you so you're able to save lots of money right then and there So I'm able to produce organic food for a fraction of the cost of conventional or even organic food Because my inputs my fertilizers are actually being grown on the land And as far as bacteria catalysts, I'm actually able to harness and culture those from the land that I'm on and so therefore I'm able to actually bring those and put those back into the soil where I'm trying to grow you know certain vegetables or Whatever crop I'm trying to grow herbs, whatever And so this is a phenomenal model that can really change the way that We've been farming and it's a phenomenal model because it can actually save the food system as a whole And then that can actually feed us all as well Because a big part of regenerative farming biodynamic farming is the idea that you're not creating these big farms like with organic Traditional or even conventional you're creating small farms And if we look at the population since the industrial age since the 50s 70% of the population were farming back then now less than 2% of the population are farming So with the regenerative model that we've created at crucial for farms our idea is to actually kind of franchise this farm model So it's just easy for people to be able to get involved But understand that, you know, yeah, you're not going to be a multi gazillionaire on your one small farm But you will be able to create a phenomenal living for yourself You'll be able to create probably the healthiest living that you could ever have Being able to raise kids on a farm which I know a lot of us Envy in which we could have had that I know I should could I had that more for myself But obviously working towards that for my current kids now and that's a big part of it But the whole idea is quality of life that you get that you won't get anywhere else Also, you can make a pretty good amount of money with this farming method because you're again. You're not purchasing your fertilizers You're not purchasing the things that you would use as pesticides You're not purchasing things that you would use to bring a soil Microbes into into your into your garden or into your onto your land You're just producing those things naturally from around your land And there's certain techniques and ways and knowledge that you do that and that's that's the techniques, you know That's the knowledge behind all that stuff It's how to do all that But the big idea with all that is you're using these natural Organisms which then when you bring them into your body They naturally help you become healthier So a big part of why I feel like we get sick is we eat food from all around the world or all around the nation and A big part of like our staple foods is that they need to become they need to come local like we do need some We source a lot of exotic and wild foods But those are foods that you can't find anywhere not even in the United States and these are more medicinal foods So they're more supplemental foods than they are like staple foods But our staple foods need to come from our local environment and the reason why again I'm gonna say it again. It's because of those microbes that are indigenous to the environment If we can cultivate those and grow those on our food Then when we eat though that food, we're naturally going to be getting those microbes with within us And by by doing that we're able actually able to make our immune system healthier for the certain virus or bacteria that gets Infitrated into our ecosystem So again a lot of us get can get sick at times Some of us can get sick at times through our lives a big part of staying healthy and never getting sick It's just the fact that we are eating from our local local environment and that local environment will have those those natural microbes on it And those natural microbes will naturally be able will be able to put those into our body and then those will protect us And those are the because those are the ones that are out competing all the other microbes in our environment and they're all beneficial as well, too So this is a really cool concept, right? Because you're able to actually create more soil fertility You're actually able to get It had done at a fraction of the cost it's it's sustainable You know anyone can do it don't the you know, it's not hard to get they're everywhere And it's just it's just smarter when you really think about it. I'm gonna pull this video in here for you guys just one second Yeah, so sorry someone's kind of getting my face there So yeah, so this is a this is really intriguing idea, right? So you're able to with this closed loop model regenerative model create the sole fertility you need you're able to utilize Everything from the land that you need to grow fertile crops Which then is going to create more again fertility in the soil, but it's a closed loop cycle And and we're also finding that these foods taste better. They have more nutrient density inside of them So we're actually gaining what we lost doing this model and it's just a it's gonna be the future of farming I believe that this is my one of my main callings is to bring this information forth and then actually utilize this stuff And that's what we're doing here at crucial for farms is actually bringing this technology in So that pretty much sums up closed loop regenerative farming the whole idea again is that you're you're producing Extremely nutrient dense food with a fraction of the cost you're utilizing everything sustainably from around you You're not purchasing things from here and there and bringing all these crazy things in you're just kind of working with what made mother nature is giving you And so yeah, that's that's pretty much it. You're you're not You're always using heirloom varieties too by the way out when we talk about the genetics typically always I've never seen anyone that's a regenerative farmer biodynamic farmer use any method other than finding what they call heirloom genetics To use for their crops and and so with organic farming do you see some still hybridized? But with this regenerative biodynamic model, it's kind of like we only want heirlooms, you know We only want what's originally been here and what's been tried and true So it's really cool really cool stuff And I'm gonna be shooting more and more videos about this if you've seen some of my farm videos You've seen some me doing some of these techniques you've seen some of the greenhouses that we built Some of the beds that we put together and you can check those out on our Instagram if you ever want to get a little sneak peek on How I'm creating soil fertility and that there are different methods that we use because there's all types of different methods like Ugo culture bed mulching not tilling up the soil because that's another thing that doesn't happen You don't till the soul you'd lay mulch in which obviously helps with water So that means you don't the water as much so it makes more sustainable sense there as well So it's just all around it's just the smartest way to farm and it's going to save our food model It's gonna allow us to feed all of us because one thing that people say is that you know Oh, well, we got to feed all these people because we're overpopulated That's hard for me to believe because if you really think about it If you drive north south east or west out of any heavily populated area, maybe three or four hours You're typically in the middle of nowhere. So I think that the information is kind of I think it's the way we're farming that's the issue Because if we our community started a farm and more people started to become farmers and we obviously would have smaller farms scattered around everywhere That's gonna make more ecological sense because we're not gonna have to truck that food everywhere We're gonna be able to grab it right there pick it those indigenous microbes gonna go into our diet That's gonna make us healthier So it just makes logical sense all the way around to do that and I truly believe there's a lot of people that do want to be farmers I mean farming, you know, they say oh, it's the hardest work ever Well now with all the information that we have the knowledge we had the tools that we have the resources available to us It's not as hard. I know a lot of us aren't spring chickens anymore, but I'm still pretty much as pretty chicken But at the end of the day, it's not as hard as you think and when you become strictly extremely organized You can hire spring chickens and do the manual labor if you need to and there's a lot of value in that Especially for kids like I know for me growing up learning how to work hard was a big part of my work ethic For now, you know, just being able to push it, you know Like this weekend. I made chocolate all weekend, you know worked all week and then made chocolate all weekend I also made John getting ready to launch videos on that But it's not really work to me because I love it So it's just finding those people that love to do farming love to do these things and getting them to be able to do those things And now everyone's dreams are fulfilled. So it just makes sense Our fourth method that I want to go into is called wild simulated And this is one of the most powerful ways to get medicinal foods and herbs because typically most things aren't wild simulated unless they're like herbs or or Or Yeah, they're mainly herbs cacao or cacao is what simulated let me just explain what this means So a wild simulated is you go to where the wild variety has been thriving where it's just been Rocking and then you start to co-plant in there and just co-plant with those plants and bring all those plants together so that you're able to Just emphasize what's already happening. You're not watering. You're not bringing in fertilizers. You're not really managing anything You're just co-planting with that natural environment in that ecosystem where the wild varieties from so you're able to get the wild genetics But you're able to do it in sustainable way And at the end of the day, this is going to be the key to getting wild genetics is wild simulated farming and our ginseng is done This way or cacao is done this way our mock is done this way. We have about seven or eight other crops that we actually Farm this way and bring these over to you guys and and so it's it's really powerful because it's the most Opulent way that you're gonna be able to get these wild genetics in a sustainable farm form And if you can ever get that that's gonna be like the top the top top top even above Biodynamic regenerative farmed say ginseng you would want to go with wild simulated ginseng Which is what we offer at crucial for so above and it's so and again like with wild simulated you're not dealing with you know Like crop rotations you're not dealing with mulching. You're not dealing with fertilizing. You're not dealing with pest issues You're not dealing with that. You're just letting nature run its course Whatever pests take over whatever plans they take over. It's what they do. They take over those plants You just let it go and that's just the way it is You just let nature work work its magic and nature left alone. It's in perfect balance. So let it do its thing It's a fall tear quote again. So another Concept to kind of understand with wild simulating is you're getting these genetics that aren't perverted that the research indicates So I mentioned this earlier So when you research an herb like ginseng and you see all these benefits of it That's gonna be coming from the wild cultivar So naturally if you want to receive all those benefits and that's a Genetics that you're gonna have to go out and seek in order for you to even begin to think that you're going to actually experience what those benefits say Over the internet on Google, right? And I experienced this the hard way with chocolate because 99% of all chocolate is Typically not the heirloom wild simulated variety that we have the jungle grown stuff that we have. This is high elevation It's got rainwater spring water most chocolates not done this way, right? So most chocolate even though it's organic It's been hybridized, right? So example of organic farming still hybridized But they relocate a lot of these farms for these hybridized cacao down a lower sea level and they grow them underneath the canopy So there's a whole bunch of plants on top creating shade and the cow grows underneath And that's not how cacao traditionally really wants to grow It really wants to grow out and have a direct exposure just like our wild jungle cacao is and so it just creates a totally different product And so at the end of the day, you're gonna be able to get the best quality product you can from us because that's what we're looking for at the peak and 70% of our Jeanette 70% of our products are either wild simulated Or just wild just wild harvested which is the next one that I'll go into which wild harvested or Ecologically harvested or wild crafted is typically there's no simulation going on yet I feel like a lot of these things will have the wild simulated going on once you know the Supply or the demand picks up and then they need more supply Because you're you're never gonna be able to just go out and harvest wild herbs forever And so these are things you have to think about Wild harvested you're not even co-planting if you're just going to these areas where these foods have been found herbs mushrooms Algae's not in the sea algae but mushrooms and herbs and flowers and all these really cool products that you see that we offer and They're wild and they're just growing naturally in these environments and we're able to harvest those and obviously pick them sustainably when they're in season and Then process those with all the different ways we process things which is another video I'm gonna go into because it's really important once you get the idea of how food can be grown and how it can be processed Then you understand that okay, well, how is this food now been picked and been preserved before it gets to me as a consumer because that's another big piece of This puzzle that you need to educate yourself on because you know unless you've got someone like myself Shooting a video telling you most people aren't gonna want to tell you and that's the same with conventional. I was like well, how do I tell something's wild or wild simulated or Biodynamic regenerative farmed organic or conventional Charles and I'll tell you if there's nothing on there about it. It's conventional Everything else we're gonna they're gonna let you know we're all gonna let it be known right if someone's regenerative farming They're gonna be proud of that and they're gonna know that they're doing something different than conventional so they're gonna It'll be on the package. So if they don't tell you then it is it's the bottom of the barrel, right? And if they're educating you and telling you oh, we source everything locally from farms organic practices, you know grass natural raised beef You know organic veggies Then you know because they're telling you and that's the beautiful thing, you know because people were fighting for labeling like we want to know Well, I think that the way that we fight for labeling as a society and it's business owners. You're producing products It's just label what it's not, you know, because we obviously can't get our government to regulate what it is No one wants to put oh, this is made from GMO fed chicken because people won't want to buy it And they've they've come out and said that like people won't buy it if we say is GMO Of course they won't that should tell you something you should do something different, right? But we can put non GMO on our products and there's a whole certification for that. So there are solutions out there We've created them but back to wild genetics again wild genetics are going to be what the research indicates And that's going to be 78% of what we produce over at crucial for and this is something that you're when you look about Getting the most bang for your buck. These are the genetics that you want These are gonna be what the research indicates So when you see something and you think it might work for you or think it's something that you should have for yourself While it's gonna be the best while simulated is gonna be under that biodynamically regenerative farms that are gonna be underneath that Organic underneath that and then conventional which is way over there somewhere else But no crucial for that our number one standard is wild to wild simulated.
