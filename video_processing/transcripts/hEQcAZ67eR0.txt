 To anyone brand new to fishing and unsure of where to start, here are my top three tips. And stick around for the last one because it's the most important in my opinion. Tip number one, downsize your lures. Lots of these popular commercial lures are generally too big for your average fish in that small pond down the street. Now I've had my fair share of dinks on big lures, but you'll for sure increase your chances if you just use something smaller and subtler. Tip number two, cover water. Unless you're fishing a river in which fish are constantly passing through like a highway, I would change spots if you don't have anything in 20 minutes of casting. Yes, there could be a stubborn fish just waiting for the right presentation to bite, but in my experience it's much more valuable to change spots. Tip number three, which is the most important one in my opinion. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Your goal is to catch fish, not save face. So if you're not catching and the guy next to you is, ask them if they can help you out. You'd be surprised at how nice people are sometimes. And if you're lucky, they might even share with you what they're using. Drop a follow if you want to see more videos like this.
