Raw Travel Short Cut - Living on The Summertown Farm

Nonprofits & Activism
 I'd heard of the farm in Summertown, Tennessee as a kid, but I had no idea these folks were living the ideals of nonviolence, community, and giving back that, thanks to travel, I'd someday come to embrace. I was curious about what it takes to become a member and live on the farm today. Author, speaker, and longtime resident Douglas Stevenson clued me in to how it works. If someone wants to become a member here, it's actually a several-year process. Ordinarily, people come and visit, spend a few days here. Sometimes we have weekend retreats and events where people can come in and see more people and meet and find out what it really feels like. And if that calls to them, then they become a resident. And so that's a status where you're living on the land and we have a year or so while we see, can you make it economically? Do you keep your vibes together or do you lose it from time to time? Are you honest in your interactions? Do you pay your bills? You know, we get to know you and you get to know us and you find out we're not perfect either. But, you know, we try to have some standards, particularly in how you treat each other. Maybe you have a falling out with somebody. There's some techniques we use to help figure out and work those things out, really what we would call working it out. So after you become a resident, then you move into becoming a provisional member. In which case, once you're a provisional member, you can build a home here and start really settling in and establishing your life. But it's still more of that getting to know you process until at some point you run for membership and it takes 75% of the people to vote someone in as a member. And then you would become a permanent member, meaning you can come and go, leave your house here and have it maintained by, you know, stay within the community while you might have to go take care of your parents or something like that or go traveling. But it's, you know, it is a several year process because, because the land is all held in common, a bank is not going to give you financing to build a house because they can't repossess it and sell it on the open market. So if you change your mind and you've put $100,000, $200,000, $300,000 into building a home here, we're not going to buy you out. You know, and you can only sell your house to another member or provisional member. There's not that many coming in, 10, 15 a year, people like that. And then they'd have to have cash to buy you out. It's, you know, there's strengths and weaknesses to that system in that a bank can't repossess your home, but it is more challenging to sell your home and it's not going to have the same value that it might have on the open market. Ideally, someone would write to us through our welcome center and we have campgrounds. Again, I always recommend someone come when there's an event happening because otherwise it can be kind of quiet. You know, we have 1,700 acres here and there's only a couple hundred of us, so it absorbs us pretty well. We usually have a monthly open market that's like a flea market and a farmer's market, arts and crafts fair. There's always music going on here. Typically, we would have a weekly potluck. And then sometimes there's fundraising dinners with music or activities, speakers, lectures. And so when you come and there's activities, you just get that much more out of the visit. It's not always easy living or without downsides, but for Douglas and the other folks living on the farm, it seems well worth it. That's often there's not only karma is waiting to be put together in 2014 than set Today's Act
