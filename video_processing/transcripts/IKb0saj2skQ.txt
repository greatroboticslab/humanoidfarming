 Planting dates have an interaction with relative maturities in corn and that's something that we should be watching for. If we know that we will be planting early in the year we have a higher chance and we can have high yield results by selecting a longer relative maturity 110, 115 we have been consistent there. If we are planting middle of May or later we can practice a little bit more of precaution and by practicing a little bit more of precaution is considering adjusting that relative maturity into a shorter hybrid, shorter maturity hybrid to make sure that that crop will have enough growing season to reach physiological point, physiological maturity before freezing temperatures come in the fall.
