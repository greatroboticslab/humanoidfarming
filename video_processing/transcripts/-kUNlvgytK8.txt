 Freedom! Freedom! One third of the world's energy is used in food production, yet one third of the world's food is lost or wasted. For the last century, farmers have stretched the top line and prioritized increasing volumes. Freedom! We're an organic farm, we don't use any fertilizer or pesticides. The way that we're grazing our animals is actually enhancing our soils and enhancing the environment. These grasses are eaten by the animals, they are moved on daily, which replicates what nature did thousands of years ago. We are mainly focused at the moment on increasing production to satisfy a growing demand, while we still experience significant losses. The focus should be on reducing those losses, making the food supply chain more efficient. At Krover, we developed the world's first robotic device, able to swim through grains and monitor their condition, to help grain store keepers maintain the quality of their stock. At Trellis, we predict supply and demand behaviour to really resolve inefficiencies and deliver opportunities to optimize food production. This helps ag food enterprises to preserve resources, increase sustainability while also increasing profit. Sustainability isn't an end state, it's constantly changing and evolving. We've got to make farming financially sustainable, but we've got to do that in the context of maintaining and improving the landscape and the environment in which farming takes place. one.
