 Instead of planting your crops outside, you should tuck them down in a cave. Now I know crops need light and sunshine and all that, but that's actually the point. That's to be able to plant your crop farm underneath a redstone lamp like this. Then when it's time to harvest, all you gotta do is flip a lever on that switch and all of the crops will be harvested in an instant. At which point you can turn back on the light, plant all your crops and get ready to do the same again next week.
