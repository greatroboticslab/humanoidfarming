 So, you're in your grocery store hunting for the ripest tasting tomatoes you can find. If you're in the produce aisle, you're in the wrong place. The only truly vine ripened tomatoes you'll find in the supermarket are in tins and jars. Tomato sauce, tomato paste. These use fully ripe, full flavored tomatoes. See, it's all about logistics. Take this field right here. These tomatoes are being grown for Prego farmer's market sauces. In just a few hours, they'll go from the field to the cannery, which is just about a mile from here. Fresh market tomatoes have to get to stores all around the country. If they're picked ripe, they'll simply rot before they get there. So they're picked hard and green before they reach maximum sweetness. Now, I had a choice. I could go to Florida, where most of the fresh green tomatoes grow, or come here to California, where 95% of America's processing tomatoes grow. Well, you know from our red pepper episode that it's a whole lot harder to bring a crop to peak ripeness. Each day that goes by, the farmer is within a hair's breadth away from losing everything. So I thought, hey, I want to tell that story. Let's go find out what we're eating, shall we? Welcome to Dixon, California, home to fifth generation farmer Dustin Timothy and his dad, Ron, who started growing tomatoes here in the 1970s. I don't think I was very helpful until I was in my 20s. You know, I know I didn't grow up until I was like 28. So I don't know why I expected him to grow up any sooner. But he did. And I'm very proud of him now. This part of Northern California is known for a Mediterranean-style climate. Warm, dry days make very happy tomatoes. Not that tomatoes come from the Mediterranean. Nope. Tomatoes are native to the Andes. The Aztecs introduced the tomato to Spanish explorers. They adapted the name to their language and took the tomate home to the European continent. But they were not a smashing success. No one knew what to do with them. And lots of people thought they were poisonous. Ultimately, it was the cooks of Southern Italy, a former colony of Spain, who really embraced the tomato. Imagine Italian food without tomatoes. No pizza. No pasta sauce. What a sad world that would be. Worldwide, there are over 20,000 varieties of tomato, loosely classified by their shape and size. And they are loaded with vitamins C and K, folate and potassium. We Americans get more vitamins from tomatoes than from any other fruit or veg we put in our mouths. And it's not because we're pounding the salad. It's because we love our spaghetti sauce and our ketchup and our pizza. You say blood courses through our veins. I say it's tomato cellos. potentially broader. 9 out of 10 tomatoes we grow in this country are processing tomatoes. That means we eat a lot of them. These plum-style tomatoes have fewer seeds, dense flesh, and little water. Just what you want for a full-bodied, full-flavored sauce. Unlike the tomatoes I grow in my garden, these tomatoes have been bred to all ripen at the same time on the vine. So Dustin can harvest an entire field of ripe tomatoes all at once. This thing's enormous. Ready? Yeah. That's a lot easier than picking by hand. This is just one plant. There's 8,712 of these per acre. That's a lot of tomatoes. More or less. The harvest begins in late July. By late September, it's practically a round-the-clock operation. Every day. And every night. Ripe tomatoes wait for no man. Once they're red, Dustin has a two-week window to get them cut. You'd think it's pretty straightforward. He has a thousand acres. He planted over two months in the spring. Forty acres a day. He just harvests the first ones he planted and follows the sequence, right? No. This is farming. It's never straightforward. It's more like a Rubik's Cube with a myriad moving parts. You can't work on one side and forget the others. He's got weather. If it rains, these tomatoes could rot on the vine. He's got equipment breakdowns. These machines run two 10-hour shifts every day. Things will break. He's got Prego's own production deadlines. I'll tell you, Dustin is a Rubik's Cube champion. It's 8 o'clock at night, but these guys won't quit for another couple hours. As a farmer, you only get maybe 40 to 45 chances because you've got 40 to 45 years in your career. You can't make too many mistakes. While a harvest is relentlessly grueling, it's also a celebration, a culmination of a season's worth of blood, sweat and tears. That season began in March with baby transplants grown in the greenhouse, planted one by one in the soil. Tomato plants are sensitive creatures. If it's too cool in May, they won't grow as vigorously. Too hot in June, then the flowers won't survive. Each flower represents a tomato. If the heat wilts your flowers, you get no tomatoes. As the fruit starts to grow, Dustin is preoccupied with water. He gets his water from wells that are up to 60 years old. If they fail him, his crop dies. Game over. Only this, of course, is not a game. It's his livelihood. Dustin's entire salary for the year is tied up in a set of circumstances he largely can't control. But he's not totally helpless. Dustin's installed irrigation below the earth's surface. His costs are high, but he gets to farm more ground more efficiently. I've experienced a 30% reduction in water use. Yeah, it's pretty significant. Two or three weeks before harvest, Dustin cuts the water. This drying out period concentrates the flesh, making it denser, meatier. But how does Dustin know just when the tomatoes are ready to be harvested? What you're looking for is development of the seed and the gel. Okay. This is a very immature tomato. It isn't going to be ready for at least three weeks. You've got some fruit like this, looks similar to that. Okay. But see that blush? Oh my god, it's red. Right. It's probably only 10 days away from being this red. So it actually turns red from the inside out. Correct. I didn't realize that. That's some serious tomato whispering right there. Now, you might have noticed that these vines are not supported by trellises. Trellis tomatoes need to be handpicked by an army of harvesters. Processing tomatoes are grown on the ground, so they can be cut in one fell swoop. By this bad boy. Dustin can harvest 50 tons of tomatoes per acre. Here's how. In a matter of seconds, the harvester cuts the whole plant, passes it up to a shaker, the tomatoes drop off, and the greens shoot out. The fruit runs quickly through a color scanner that kicks out any unripe ones. And just to be on the safe side, there's a human pair of eyes too. Today, that's me. Dustin fills up to 24 tomato trailers a day. That's over 1.2 million pounds of tomatoes each day for two months straight. Dustin's gardener is a natural plant. The colossal bounty that this land produces is mind-blowing. To give the soil a chance to rest and recover, Dustin rotates crops across his farm. Next to his tomatoes are sunflower fields, a less demanding crop that allows the soil time to build back its strength. Dustin's gardener is a natural plant for three months straight to a land. Processing tomatoes. Does that word processing sound scary? Like big, brutal factories with smoking chimneys? Well, fresh market tomatoes sounds like sunshine and sunflowers. The truth is, processing is just a process. It's dicing or crushing or pureeing, and it's heating to kill off bacteria. Basically, it's the old-fashioned canning process on a much, much larger scale. Now what happens to those processed tomatoes afterwards makes all the difference. Are they then overloaded with salts and sugars and stabilizers? A good rule of thumb, read that ingredients list. You should recognize all the ingredients, and tomatoes should be top of the list. We're totally using these. Who's the weird guy making the great catches in the background? The biggest perk of being a tomato griller? Tomato fights. We've had some legendary tomato fights in my day. Have you? Yeah, not since I'm getting older and more responsible though. I can't even tell you the details. . We'll find out. Okay. .
