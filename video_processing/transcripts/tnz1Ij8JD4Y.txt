 You might have heard that planting legumes like peas and beans fixes nitrogen into the soil. Well, that's not entirely true. See these nodules on the roots? They are home to an amazing bacteria called rhizobia. And rhizobia takes nitrogen in the air and converts it into a plant-available nitrogen. And this process is called nitrogen fixing. However, if you let the peas go to seeds, most of the nitrogen actually gets used up by the peas to produce its seeds, which is the pea pods. And that is why if you actually want to fix nitrogen into the soil, you need to terminate these peas before they go to seeds.
