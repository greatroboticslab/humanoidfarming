 Why do the Chinese throw their eggs in the water and waste them? Actually, when ducks are reared in Chinese ponds, they are fed algae that grow in the mud. This method of raising ducks in the mud is low cost. When the ducks lay eggs, the eggs are collected and checked using machines. The bad eggs are separated, and the good eggs are sold. And the bad eggs that are thrown in the water are used as fish feed.
