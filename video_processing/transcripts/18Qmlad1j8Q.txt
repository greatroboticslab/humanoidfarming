 hello guys welcome back to my channel so today i want to show you what we did in our farm we actually serviced our somo this is very important if you have a farm where your somo is running all the time you know because you use water daily and everyday use water like in your farm for your fish farming for your poultry farming even if you have crops that you're planting you also need water constantly so we noticed that the somo wasn't like effective the way it used to be and um we've been actually doing some minor servicing here and there before now and we also noticed my boys noticed that water come is coming out from where the somo is and then the water also coming out from the pump wasn't as clean as it used to be so this can pose a risk to to my farm product and then it's not something i want so when we noticed it i asked for those that can service the somo and they came to the farm they brought their equipment as you can see and they did um thorough servicing i think they brought out the somo and the services they cleaned it they they you know and just did their thing they serviced the whole thing and after that what we did next was to wash the tank because when we were washing the tank though i didn't do a video of when we were washing the tank i wasn't in the farm that day we noticed that there are a lot of debris inside the tank and this is not good for the fishes is not so good for the um chicken so we also um wash the whole tank so we can get clean water so after that the all the water coming in now it's very clean and it's good so servicing your somo is good and apart from giving you clean water it will help you have and make your pump run effectively you know without issues because sometimes before you know when there's the pump starts having issues and you don't respond to it quickly it can make you it can spoil the somo you can just pack it up so that is not what you want because buying somo right now is also very expensive so the one you have you have to maintain it very very important so that is what we're doing in the farm we have to service and then so our somo can run effectively i used i think it was like 30 000 30 to 32 000 that we paid the people they brought their equipment they came to the farm and then they did all that they know how to do and at the end of it the whole thing was um successful and it went away you can see how the water came out that is like flushing the somo i think so flushing the somo yes flushing the water the somo so every debris and whatever all the nonsense in there can just easily come out so this is what we do i have not done this since we opened we started this our farm in this site we have not actually serviced the somo and that has been a long time i'm talking about way back six to seven years and i don't think it's good so i just have to like spend the money to do it because it's what gives you money that you use money to service so guys that is what we did in our farm and after this we washed the tank thoroughly thorough washing of the tank we have about um two tanks one supply to we have three tanks to supply to the fish pond and one supply to the poultry to the poultry farm so three of them was thoroughly washed and then after that we started pumping our water and everything went well so after we did all that you know in my last video i said i'm going to do a video of how we stock our chicken unfortunately the day the chicken came it rained heavily so i couldn't do any video but as usual you just get your chicken you stock your chicken and they start eating like as in this video there are two weeks already there are two weeks you can see their sizes from day old there are two weeks and they are eating very very well they are doing okay they are very smart you can see them very smart eating and they're drinking very well and i believe washing this the washing of the tank will also help also um they now have good water i believe so too they now have good water so this is all we did we stocked 500 pieces and this time around the prices went down the price was very very okay okay i bought for i bought for 30 something thousand there which is i can't get the exact figure but it's like 32 33 000 i bought for 33 000 and as usual i'm stocking 500 and that is what we have in here as of two weeks as of two three weeks when we weigh them i'm going to put the video of when we weigh the chicken some of them are weighing one point some are weighing a 1.2 kg sorry 1.2 and just like that so i believe by time there are four five weeks should be getting 2 kg and this is also good i'm going to do experiment on local feed and um for everything what i mean the local feed i mean i'm going to like produce a little feed of mine and i'm going to do a experiment with like 10 pieces of chicken to see how this experiment is going to be i just want to see the outcome and to also compare um the price which is better is it the foreign feed or the local feed so i'm going to do that i'm going to do a video of all that okay guys so this is all i have for you today i want to appreciate you for watching and um thank you thank you thank when i do that experiment i'm going to post it so you can see it thanks for watching guys bye you
