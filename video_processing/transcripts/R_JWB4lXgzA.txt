Welcome back to the 113 Grow Show. There she is. Today's video, we're coming back with another outdoor season 2 grow update. I don't really know what fucking episode this is. This video is sponsored by Jadine. I just got done filming the updates on the two autos. We're going to go ahead and look at each and every bean we got. The three reverse beans, all of our little fucking babies, this weird reveg cob that's actually kind of putting in work. Digging that. Looks like it's going to start growing some regular leaves again, which is good. We're back into the regular reveg. So we're going to keep letting this one do its thing before we come and give this one massive defoliation. I'm thinking we do a little bit of work on these today. I do have Abimov here, so we can kind of both tackle one of these. Do a little time lapse on that. But this fucking special K is looking really solid. We've been not watering this one as much because it is in this grow peaceful bucket and it does have... I mean, look how wet it is still, dude. Like, this one probably still doesn't need to be watered, honestly. I mean, maybe a sea hare, but it's so wet still. So wet. But it's just growing good and it's because we haven't been watering. So we're going to leave that one alone, maybe. I'm going to have to talk with the old executive producer over here. See what the fuck we're thinking on watering these. But the old hella jelly looking amazing. Super strong. What is this right here? The cherry pie? I think so because it's the biggest. Looking really, really solid by Weed Seeds Express. It needs to be fucking transplanted. So actually, Abby, we do have a pot that's ready to go from that Orion F1. It's already amended everything. We can even go ahead and top dress if we really wanted to. I think we should at least get one transplant going. And the amnesia is looking really solid. It could probably go a couple more days. Give us some time to get another pot together. But the two LCG times runs from Turpentine are looking really solid as well. They're not really showing sex yet. So we can't tell if they're males or not. But we're going to have to fucking stay posted on these ones. The old fucking reverse beans. This, I think this is the pancakes. I could be wrong here. Yeah, no, this is the pancakes. Looking really, really solid. And I think these two, just because of placement, isn't really getting the best lighting situation right now. So they are flowering. This is Donuts 2 and Jelly Donuts. But honestly, I'm just going to let them do their deal. If we can get some decent something something, I doubt it. I doubt we're going to have that time for them to really sit there and nug. Because these are all going to go back into the tent. Like I say, every single time, they're going to get reversed. We're going to try to get some seeds of our own. Some fucking PBM times pancake would be really fucking sick. Some purple berry pancake. I think so, you know. I don't know. But all we have to do now, pimps, we're going to go through, kind of break our soil up a little bit like they did with this one. I like to go ahead and break all those new rocks down so that when we go ahead and water every single time, there is nutrients getting broken down. It's not just the same shit. Plus, it helps suck up the soil that much faster. You don't have to sit here and water forever. It makes it nice. But I'm going to go ahead and prop the old camera up right now, pimps. Let's go ahead and get to some fucking work. Or do you think we should go ahead and do a defoliation before we water? All right. Probably should do that. Jadine, you don't move. You stay there, Jadine. All right, pimps. We're probably just going to do a little bit of a smaller lollipop. Just get rid of some of this lower fan leaves and just some of this foliage that's not going to turn out to anything. Just because it's taken up a lot of the water, you know. It's having to water a lot more of the plant than it probably what it needs to. So, we're going to go ahead, do a little defoliation, get that out of Abimoff's way. I'm going to set this shit up. Let's make it happen. All right. Well, we just went ahead and did a little fucking defoliation. Got some more air living up in this thing. This one's, you know, super thirsty. So, it looks a lot more airy than it actually is because it's all super wilted. But we went ahead and broke down all the soil while we did it. These are all the leaves we took off, which is pretty crazy. We got it nice and lollipopped on both sides just because it makes it nice and easy to water. And it doesn't need to be focusing on that lower growth down there. So, we're going to go ahead and do a nice water. Probably give it like six to eight liters depending on how much this one's going to need all of it. All the eight, maybe even ten. I'm going to go ahead and do something with these fucking leaves. And then we're going to go ahead and kind of just start watering everything. I'm just going to go ahead and break down the soil in this one, water that. We are going to go ahead and transplant that cherry pie into that bucket. So, we will go ahead and do that. I think we're just going to go ahead and get everything watered so that these will be all ready to go. And we only have to worry about one more pot. So, I think we're going to have to do another fucking time lapse. I know you guys absolutely hate those. But we're going to go ahead and get some shit done. Prop you guys up one more time. Make it happen, pimps. All right, pimps. While Abby's watering the rest of these little beans over here, I went ahead and broke down all the soil so it'll be nice and quick for her. I'm going to go ahead and knock out this transplant right here. We're going to go ahead and do a little tiny defoliation just to make ourselves some room. We're going to go ahead and stick it in this pot. Yeah, this thing did germinate, but a bird came and ate this one too. Just like the other four little tiny ones. So, very unfortunate. Nothing we can do about it but be pissed. I'm going to go ahead and just maybe scoop some of this dirt out. It's kind of hard to do this one-handed. I'm not going to lie. Here. Maybe a little something like this. I think so, yo. All right, pimps. I'm going to prop you guys up, but I'm not going to do the full time lapse. I'm just going to throw you guys down somewhere. All right. It's looking all right. Let's go ahead and defoliate some shit here. It looks all right. Let's go ahead and remove that. We'll go ahead and transplant. It shouldn't be too bad. We should... Yeah, here we go. Oh, roots are looking amazing. She is going right on down. A little bit of dirt. I guess all the dirt. Give me the dirt. I'm thinking so, pimps. It was that easy. Right on in. Just going to let some fun begin. She's going to love this new home. I'm pumped. She's pumped. You guys are pumped. Another bean. Transplanted. Fuck her INF1. Cherry pie. She's ready. Let's go ahead. Get a different angle. Or should I put this bad bitch on? Just like that, pimps, we got another one down in its final home. Hopefully this one will take off. We should have used probably a bigger pot, but it is what it is. It is what the fuck it is. I'm not tripping about it. We should put the hella jelly in the good one. That's kind of what I'm thinking. We'll have to see what the fuck. But we're going to water these ones down. They're all looking super solid. I've been kind of liking leaving some water in there, especially during summertime. We probably can water this one once more, honestly. Okay. The cob. Soaked it up. That's what I'm saying. But it's already looking better. Like, it's perking up its leaves a little bit. Just getting rid of some of those other yellowing leaves that I don't like the look of. I mean, fuck. We can sit here and just go for hours, bro. I'm telling you. Fucking telling you. But it's not going to be perfect. You know what I'm saying. Fuck yeah. Give her some top water. That's where all the nutrients is. Some water. Top water. Run that whole thing on through. Just be careful it doesn't spill through the holes, you know. Give her some pep. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, fuck yeah. You're good. She's running it through. That's when all the nutrients break down. That's why these vegetables over here boom so gnarly because we went ahead and just left hell of water in the bottom. But like these, these ladies should go ahead and be really, really good by the next time I show you guys a nice update. Same with these. Well, fuck all of them, dude. I don't know. I'm pumped.
