 Hello folks, my name is Eric and welcome to another episode. In this episode we are going to discuss about smart farming. Yes, more efficient, sustainable and profitable. Before discussing about this topic, let's give you the update about this climate smart agriculture. Do you remember that this is the farming that we did in the previous episodes? So I promise you to give the update. Remember? So for people who doesn't know, this is climate smart agriculture. So all plants you are seeing there, they started here. We dug the hole for five centimeters. In this hole we can plant three seeds. And you can see we leave a smorgue of five centimeters. We put our first seed, second and the third one. And then we cover with manure and then we mix with the soil. And when rain accumulates, the moisture will stay for very long time. And this is the essence of climate smart in dry areas, area with low rainfall. Climate is the way forward to area of low land and increase agricultural productivity, adapting, building, re-dryments of agriculture and forest security. Climate is the way forward to the soil. So, you put one manure, like one kg or one sped of manure per one hole. And then you mix up with the soil and then you're going to plant your seeds. So once you plant your seeds, so this is a new approach of addressing common challenge of forest security and climate change. So this is the seed that we planted. So climate smart agriculture is the climate change solution. Be aware guys, some technology are better than others. In these dry areas, you can see this plant using this is the result of climate smart agriculture. The area where they didn't use this technology, they have low and they very poor performance because of raw rainfall. But this, there is new technology that I'm going to teach you about smart farming. This, you are seeing, we plant the same day with another sunflower that I'm going to show you in a few seconds to come. So you can see some technology are better than others, but always something is better than nothing. So we planted on the same day. So you can see this. This sunflower thing we planted on the same day. We planted this on the 7th of December last year. But the rains comes around 20. But because of this technology that I'm going to tell you, you can see this sunflower, they're already blooming. So they're about to give the seeds while other sunflower, they are not even yet to open up. So you can see guys, that's why I'm saying some technology are better than others. So the people who use, who just grow, just traditionally, they will get low yield. And the people who use climate smart agriculture, that the one I showed you, the one we dig the hole, they will get good yield. But these people who are using this smart farming, where they use more efficient and more sustainable and more profitable. So what is smart farming? So I can say smart farming is the modern approach to agriculture production that uses a diversity technology to optimize the use of input such as seeds, water, fertilizer and a pesticide. For our case, we use this drip irrigation. So drip irrigation is one type of food. It's one tools for smart farming because it uses water more efficient, more sustainable and more profitable. So the goal of smart farming is to increase the yield and the profit while reducing the waste and a negative impact to the environment. So this smart farming, I can say is an innovative approach to agriculture that uses technology to improve the productivity and sustainability of food production. So you can see how we can farm smart, where we can use different tools for our case. We use this irrigation as the tools that it help us to use water more efficient, sustainable and profitable. And also we can use other tools like weather information, which will help us about planting time. You can see planting time, the one with climate smart agriculture. And also we can use irrigation, vertigation. And also this is where the information we can use to control pests and disease and other aspect of farming. So this come to the end of this episode. So, guys, thank you guys for watching. See you in another episode. Bye. Bye.
