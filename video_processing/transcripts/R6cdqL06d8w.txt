Howto & Style
 Hi, this is Natalie from Proven Winners Color Choice. I'm standing next to the beautiful Invincibel Spirit II Hydrangea. And as beautiful as this Hydrangea is, it really isn't that demanding when it comes to care. Today I'm going to give you some quick tips on how to fertilize your Hydrangeas. With most Hydrangea shrubs, you should fertilize in early spring, when the plants are just leafing out. An easy way to give plants an early season boost is to add a shovel or two of compost around the base of plants. The simplest solution is to apply a granular or slow-release fertilizer formulated for woody plants, like a rose fertilizer, once a year. It can be used one time in the spring and you're all set. A 10-10-10 fertilizer will also work just as well if applied twice, once in the spring and once in early summer. An important thing to remember is don't fertilize after late July or early August. Fertilizing late in the season can push new growth, which may not harden off by the time cold temperatures hit. This increases the potential for winter damage. You don't need to fertilize your Hydrangeas every year. In fact, sometimes that can result in lots of leaves and not very many blooms. It's a myth that Hydrangeas require acidic soil, so we don't recommend a fertilizer for acid-loving plants without a pH test. If you do that, it can push the pH levels to a dangerous or at least an unfavorable level for your Hydrangea. You can buy a soil sample test online at your local garden center or you can go to your local Extension office. Many of them offer soil testing. A soil test ensures you're giving your plant specifically what it needs to thrive. And it also helps minimize pollution and it'll save you time, energy and money.
