Science & Technology
 Solar crystal panels are arranged to maximize sunlight capture. When sunlight strikes the panels, photons excite electrons in the crystalline structure, generating direct current, DC, electricity. An inverter converts this DC electricity into alternating current, AC electricity, suitable for powering electrical devices and systems. AI algorithms analyze data from sensors monitoring environmental conditions within the vertical farm. The AI monitors temperature, humidity, light levels, and nutrient levels within the vertical farm. When deviations from optimal parameters are detected, the AI automatically adjusts settings. Automated adjustments maintain ideal growing conditions, ensuring efficient resource use and maximize plant health. AI controlled irrigation systems deliver precise amounts of water and nutrients directly to plant roots, minimizing waste. Automated harvesting systems efficiently collect produce when plants reach maturity. The entire process, from energy generation to crop harvesting, is optimized by AI, demonstrating a closed loop sustainable agricultural system. AI optimizes energy generation, water usage, and crop yield within the vertical farm.
