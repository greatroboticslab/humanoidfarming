 Hi everyone it's Shane from Hanlon's for another maintenance Monday. Today we're going to talk about PM 360. As harvest comes to a close and I know there's lots of guys that are still harvesting and things that'll be getting harvested for at least another month and a half but we've got some guys that are finishing up as far as their second cut of Timothy or their third cut of alfalfa all of the grain for the most part has been swathed. So just a reminder as you're finishing up some of those tasks and even if you've still got stuff to do get a get a piece of paper or if you like to make lists on your phone and start making a list of things that you know are wrong with your machine. If you're done already and you want to have your machine checked over give Michael or Nolan a call because this is normally an up and down time of the year so a lot of times for the next two or three weeks to a month they can kind of accommodate it pick up your machine run it through the shop and get it back to you that it can go into the shed before winter even hits. So if you've got some stuff that needs to be checked over and you're finished and you're finished give them a shout otherwise make those lists whether you're having us do the stuff or not it just comes in so handy that when you actually go to fix it you pull out that list and it jogs your memory and and you've got something to go by and you don't run into the same problems that you had this year when you start next year. So just make sure that you do that hopefully that helps you out. Thanks for watching.
