 James Caplis of the Department of Agriculture described to Agri-Land what farmers can expect in a cross-compliance inspection under SMR 10. Who, what, where and when is a good rule to follow when it comes to plant protection product records. Who applied the product, what was applied and what equipment was used. Where was it applied and stored and why was it applied. Under the SMR 10 cross- compliance inspections farmers can expect to be asked for records of what products they use, where they use them, at what rates, when they applied them, who applied them and through which application equipment they were applied or whether it was tested or whether it's under five years old. They will also be asked to provide evidence of IPM having taken place so that's ensuring that they consider all risk factors before choosing to use a chemical product. The most common thing that we're seeing is maximum individual dose exceedance, maximum total dose exceedance and using products in the incorrect application equipment. So they're not approved for use and certain products may not be approved for use through knapsack sprayers or may not be approved through broom sprayers or vice versa. Farmers who do not use the appropriate equipment to apply certain products will be penalised. There are only one set of products approved for use through weed wipers or weed lickers in the country and that's products containing glyphosate, professional products containing glyphosate. So we're finding an inspection that certain users in certain parts of the country are using non-approved products such as MCPA through weed lickers and weed wipers and this is totally against the rules and basic payment sanctions and fixed payment orders will issue when we detect these these occurrences. formula Hoş back okay with indoctuer pok salon nobleERE issue mu uh
