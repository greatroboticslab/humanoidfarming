 Hi there this is Anki Dube. So let's begin with the chapter number 5 that is agriculture and types of farming. Now watch this in this particular chapter. See agriculture is a very important activity for people around the world. It's how we get our food. A long time ago people used to hunt and gather food but as time went on they learned to grow plants and raise animals on purpose. This made it possible for them to stay in one place instead of moving around all the time. The earliest farms were in places like West Asia where people started growing wheat and barley about 8000 years ago. In Mexico they grew maize about 6500 years ago and in China they started cultivating rice around 5000 years ago. In ancient Egypt they used the Nile rivers water to grow a lot of food. Agriculture is one of the oldest ways people make a living and it's called a primary activity. It so yeah it's called as primary activity. See from towns and cities it has been really important for human society for a very long time. Today it involves things like preparing the soil taking care of animals and growing crops to feed and support people. So agriculture has been a big part of how we have developed and built our civilizations. Okay now moving to the next what are the different types of agriculture. See first is subsistence agriculture. Now what do you mean by subsistence agriculture? See first your job is to find the meaning of subsistence. Okay so subsistence agriculture is when people grow food mainly to feed themselves and their families. They don't grow a lot extra to sell. It's like having a small garden or farm to make sure you have enough to eat. People who practice subsistence agriculture usually use simple tools and techniques. They rely on their own hard work and what nature provides to grow their food. It's a way of farming that's focused on survival and providing for basic needs. Okay this was all about subsistence agriculture. Next is shifting cultivation of slash and burn. Now what do you mean by this? See shifting cultivation also known as slash and burn agriculture. It is a traditional farming method in which farmers clear a patch of land by cutting down and burning the vegetation. Okay moving to the next that is again let me just elaborate this shifting cultivation of slash and burn. Okay so shifting cultivation also known as slash and burn farming. It is a traditional way of farming. Now how it works? See cut and burn. Now watch this. Farmers clear a small area of forest by cutting down trees and burning the vegetation. This provides fertile ash that enriches the soil. Next is planting crops. After burning they plant crops like rice, maize or vegetables in the cleared area. Harvest and move. Next is they grow crops for a few years until the soil's nutrients decreases. Then they move to a new area and repeat the process. Natural regeneration. The old cleared area is left to regrow naturally. Over time the forest comes back and the cycle can begin again. It's called shifting because farmers shift to new areas once the soil isn't as fertile. This method has been used for generations by some ignitious communities. However it's important to note that due to increased population and other factors this practices can sometimes lead to environmental challenges like deforestation. Okay moving to the next. Next is intensive subsistence agriculture. Now what do you mean by this? intensive subsistence agriculture means it is when farmers work really hard on a small plot of land to grow as much food as possible. They use techniques like planting more crops in a year using fertilizers and irrigating adding water. Irrigating means that is adding water to help the plants grow better. It's like giving the plants a lot of attention and care to get the most out of a small area or space. This type of farming is common in places where there's not a lot of extra land available. Okay so this was all about intensive subsistence agriculture. Moving to the next is commercial agriculture. Now what do you mean by this? See commercial itself says its meaning. Now commercial agriculture is when farming is done mainly to sell the crops or products for profit instead of just growing enough to feed themselves. Farmers in commercial agriculture grow large amounts of crops or raised animals to sell in markets. They use advanced techniques machinery and often work on bigger farms. This type of farming is like a business where the goal is to make money from what they grow. Okay next is commercial grain cultivation. Now what this? See commercial grain cultivation refers to the farming practices growing grain crops primarily for the purpose of selling them in the market for profit rather than for personal subsistence. For example wheat barley and maize. Okay so yeah moving to the next point that is plantation agriculture. Now what do you mean by this? See plantation agriculture is a type of farming where a large area is devoted to growing a single crop like tea, coffee, sugar or rubber. It's like a big organized farm focused on one specific plant. Usually there's a lot of labor involved and crops are grown for sale on a large scale. This type of farming is often associated with tropical regions. Okay next is mixed farming. Now what do you mean by this? See mixed farming is when a farmer grows different types of crops and raises various animals on the same farm. It's like having a little bit of everything. Some crops like wheat or vegetables along with animals like cows or chickens. This way the farmer farmer can have a variety of products to meet different needs like food, milk and even materials like wool. It's a balanced approach of farming. Okay next is dairy farming. Now what do you mean by this? See it's the word itself is its meaning like dairy farming is an agriculture practice focused on the production of milk and dairy products. Next is horticulture. Horticulture means cultivation of fruits. Now it is a type of farming focused on growing fruits, vegetables and ornamental plants. It's like having a garden where you grow things you can eat or enjoy looking at. Horticulture is different from regular farming because it's more about taking care of specific types of plants rather than large scale crop production. It's often done in smaller well tended areas. Okay now next is kettle farming. Now what do you mean by this? See kettle farming also known as kettle ranching or kettle raising is an agricultural practice that involves the breeding, raising and management of cattle primarily for the production of meat and dairy products. In kettle farming farmers typically maintain herds of cattle including beef cattle raised for meat and dairy kettles like raised for milk. Okay so moving to the next slide that is cooperative farming. Now watch this. See cooperative farming is when a group of farmers work together as a team. They pool their resources like land, tools and labor to farm collectively. This way they can share the benefits and risk of farming. They make decisions together and often divide the profits based on each farmer's contribution. It's still it's like a group effort to make farming more efficient and fair for everyone involved. Moving to the next that is collective farming. Now see one was cooperative farming next is collective farming. Now just see collective farming is when a group of farmers work together and share resources like land, tools and labor to grow crops collectively. Okay they pool their efforts to manage a larger area of land they could individually. The produce is often shared among the members or sold collectively. It's like a team of farmers working together for a common goal rather than working separately on their own plots of land. So I think so if I talk about both this they all are indirectly seen. Okay moving to the next is Mediterranean agriculture. Now what do you mean by this see Mediterranean agriculture is a type of farming found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This climate has hot dry summers and mild wet winters. In this kind of farming people grow crops like olives, grapes, citrus fruits and wheat. These plants are well suited to the climate. Farmers use techniques like terracing to make the most of hilly or rocky terrain. It's a way of farming then it's a way of farming that fits the specific weather condition of the Mediterranean area. Okay moving to the next that is viticulture. Now what do you mean by this see it is a practice of growing grapes for various purposes like making wine grape juice or even raisins. It's like having a special kind of farm just for grapes. Now what do you mean by reasons if this word questions arise please find the meaning. It's your job to find the meaning. Okay now people who do viticulture are called viticulturists. They take care of grape wines making sure that they get the right amount of water sunlight and nutrients. This way the grapes grow well and can be used to make different products. Moving to the next that is factors influencing the agriculture activities. Now what do you think what are the different factors which influence the agriculture activities. See if I talk about this climate is one of the most important factors influencing agriculture. It's all about the weather in a particular area over a long period of time. Different crops need different kinds of weather to grow well. For example some crops like rice, not a rice of course need a lot of water and warm temperatures. So they grow best in places with a warm rainy climate. Other crops like wheat can handle cooler weather. So they are better in places with colder winters. Farmers choose what to grow based on climate where they leave. They need to make sure the weather is right for their crops so they can have a good harvest. Going to the next is relief. Now what do you mean by relief? See relief in the context of agriculture refers to the physical features or landscape of an area. It includes things like mountains, hills, valleys and plains. These features affect the farming because they determine the type of soil drainage and accessibility of an area. For example flat plains with good soil are generally easier for farming while steep mountains might be harder to cultivate of course. So relief also affects how water flows across the land which is important for irrigation and drainage in agriculture. So relief plays a big role in deciding what crops can be grown and how farming is done on a particular area. Okay moving to the next that is soil. See soil is a natural bed for plants. Okay it provides them with support, nutrients and a place for their roots to grow. Different types of soil have different qualities like how well they hold water or nutrients. This affects what can be grown in a certain area. So for agriculture So if the soil isn't right it can be harder to grow crops successfully. Okay moving to the next is human made factors. Now there are different factors. Okay so what are the human made factors which influence you know agriculture activities. So if I talk about this see human made factors influencing agriculture activities are things that people have created or changed that affect how farming is done. These includes technology. Now tools and machines like tractors, floors and irrigating systems makes farming more efficient and productive. Next is infrastructure. See this includes things like roads, bridges and storage facilities. Good infrastructure helps farmers transport and store their products. Next is government policies. Now laws and regulations set by the government can impact agriculture. For example subsidies or taxes can affect what crops to grow or what crops should be grown. Okay now next is access to the markets. How easily farmers can sell their products depends on factors like transportation networks and marketplaces. Education and knowledge. See training and information on modern farming techniques can help farmers make better decisions. Next is land ownership and rights. the way land is owned and who has rights to it can affect how it's used for agriculture. Okay so these human made factors can either support or hinder agriculture depending on how they are managed and utilized. Okay so yeah this was all about in this chapter we'll be meeting soul in the next video till that very great sign keep smiling
