Howto & Style
 When planting out your strawberry plants, ensure that you give them plenty of space because this will help prevent grey mould and powdery mildew. The more airflow that you have, the better. When the fruit starts to form, mulch underneath the plants with some straw and that will help prevent the fruit from rotting as it touches the ground. Ensure you net your strawberries because if you don't net your strawberries, the birds are going to see those little red jewels that are glistening in the sun and they're going to have your fruit away. Collect your own runners. You can increase your own crops and you can also use these to replace three-year-old plants because at three-year-olds, the fruit harvest tends to decline.
