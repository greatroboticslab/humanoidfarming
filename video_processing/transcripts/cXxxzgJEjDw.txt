 This jar test will tell you what type of soil you have in your garden. Just think of it as your magic genie. Knowing what type of soil you have will allow you to make adjustments so you can provide the plants the soil they need in order to thrive. This is native soil that I dug up for my property. I'm just going to take a handful and add it to the jar. In order to break up the soil into its three different components, sand, silt, and clay, I'm going to add one teaspoon of dish detergent. Then we're going to fill up our jar mostly with water, leaving a little space for air. And we're going to put the lid on and shake it up. At this point, we're going to let it sit for about two days. And at the end, we'll see what happens. Eventually everything will settle. And then you can measure to determine the ratios of each of sand, silt, and clay. The ideal ratio is equal parts of each. And once you know where you're off balance, you can add what you need in order for your plants to thrive.
