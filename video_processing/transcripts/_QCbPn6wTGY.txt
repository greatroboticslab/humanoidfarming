 To become the ultimate farming connoisseur and truly grasp the power of the earth, you've got to get those vintage story crops planted just right. In vintage story, soil comes in a few flavors. Barren, low fertility, medium fertility, high fertility and the granddaddy of them all, the ultra-rich terra preta. Now, if you look closer, you'll see that each soil type has a few interesting parameters that we need to pay attention to. Nutrient levels and the crop grows speed. Nutrient level is the core feature that this soil offers, while the growth speed tells you how fast your carrots will pop up. And it actually depends on the nutrients levels and the moisture. The soil doesn't really care whether you sow onions or turnips, the deal is to keep planting those alternately. Now, check out the seed bag and you'll see what minerals your crop needs. So, onions will need phosphorus and your turnips really like nitrogen. Plant your onions in a chunk of terra preta and it will chow down on phosphorus from your soil daily until it sprouts. Do it again and it will guzzle up even more nutrients to the point of a slow growth crawl. So, here is the deal. Either get into the hassle of fertilizers to boost that soil chunk so it can recover or just switch up the crop. In the real farming world, this is called crop rotation. It's when you grow various goodies on the same patch to keep it from getting bored of the same old veggies. Plant turnips after onions and while the new gen munches on the fresh minerals, the old bodies get a chance to rejuvenate. This way, you might not even need any fertilizers at all. The boomers and the vintage store Wikipedia suggest making four squares. Three for the crops and one left there. No, just wait for the crops to grow and then rotate them clockwise. But if you decide to dabble in fertilizers, then they should be doled out strategically depending on your crop. Vintage store gives us four types of fertilizers. Bone mill made by grinding bones in a mill. Potash that can spawn in hollite rocks and is mined like a general ore. Salt peter, a handy scrape from cave walls. And finally, compost, which you can make by sealing rod in a barrel for 20 days. Each of these babies brings different perks. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, but maybe you can sub potash by a more common salt peter. But beware that potash is really OP because it gives a permanent extra 15% boost to your potassium or just the K-later mineral, okay? There is no use in pouring all the fertilizers in one patch if you are only growing turnips there. Because for the turnips, it's better to go with the compost or at least salt peter. True, you could also toss in a bone mill, but it only gives like a 3% boost to turnips. And yet fertilizers can stack up to 150%, but going that high doesn't really speed up the growth. It only affects how loaded the soil is with the necessary nutrients for the crops to grow. Well, I mean, if your nutrient levels do in fact drop, then of course it's gonna affect the speed. So just make sure they don't by using fertilizers or rotating the crops. The Minecraft vets know that water in a square keeps your soil nice and hydrated. In Vintage Story, it's extremely important because you won't need to water the patches often. And if you do forget to water your beans, at least they won't wither. Water gives the soil a 75% moisture boost. If it's scorching hot, you're dead. I mean, your crops are dead. But if it's cold, you can build a greenhouse. You can pretty much play around with the construction, but just make sure that 50% of the roof is transparent. So glass or packed ice works well for the roof. And the walls can be made from anything. The recommended dimensions of the greenhouse are 7x7 blocks in width and height. But players pointed out that you can easily double that size. But be careful, if your greenhouse is too big, it might not count as a greenhouse anymore and won't give your tomatoes the 5% degree warmth. Better check the next day to see if it worked. Usually, it doesn't show the plus 5 immediately and may take around 4 in-game hours. And even then, it can work randomly for each block. But if you've got everything right, it will work just fine and will become a lifesaver in winter. Alright guys, that seems to be it for now and I'll catch you in the next one.
