 okay you guys we got a crazy true story for you today and as you can see in the title you already know what it's going to be about i'll link a couple of the articles down in the description box below and i'll also be giving my opinion on what caused the crop circles at the end of this video and we want to know what you guys think too after watching this so stick around until the end and let's get started back in august 2005 something happened that is still unexplained to this day a huge crop circle was found in one of our fields which just happens to be right next to a river and an indian burial ground the crop circle was first spotted by my uncle john who was mowing on an incline nearby at first he couldn't even tell if it was a crop circle from where he was but he knew something just didn't look right and when he went down to the spot that didn't look right he was shocked to discover that it was a ginormous crop circle sitting there my uncle john immediately called my grandpa who owns the field to let him know john also knew a guy who owned a plane and he asked him to fly over the crop circle to see the view from above then a huge plot twist happened when john and the pilot went up there they discovered not just one circle but two the second circle was a lot smaller in size but was located just not that far away from the big main circle that was initially discovered following this new discovery grandpa called our local sheriff's department to report vandalism when the police came out to check for any traces of human activity or debris left behind they could find nothing in fact when grandpa went out to the second circle with the police for the very first time they noted that the only footprints that were out there were their footprints the ground was so soft at that time that there would have been something left behind of whoever did it but there was nothing except for their own prints and then seeking further answers my grandma contacted the iccra which is known as the independent crop circle researchers association from there experts across the country flew in to analyze the crop circles our local paper even wrote an article about it but grandpa requested the location to be withheld that way there weren't random people coming out looking for the crop circles however word quickly spread and people nearby heard about the news and started coming out there trying to look at the crop circles once the researchers started analyzing the crop circles up and down there were a few key notes that they gathered one of them being that the first bigger circle measured 78 by 74 feet in diameter whereas the smaller circle was 24 by 20 feet also both circles flattened plants were in rare radical lay pattern there were two layers to the circle's floor the first layer was in an s shape flattened toward the center and the outer edge of the large circle alternated counterclockwise and clockwise the second layer was flattened from the center out to the edges in this picture right here of the smaller circle the corn stalks were laid in four different directions also that they noted there were large bare spots in the center of both circles that researchers noted look similar to a human eye and this is kind of crazy but researchers also also noticed that there was a unusual sound coming from the field it seemed to be coming from the two circles and it sounded like a low mechanical humming sound in fact one of the researchers later that night was filming the formation with his infrared video camera and as he panned across the main circle looking toward the small circle in the same direction that they heard the sound he said that he recorded an audible interference pattern every time he panned across that same area and what's really bizarre too is that four separate people reported seeing unusual lights in the sky in the area where the formation was found both right before and right after it was discovered like in one instance there was a person who reported at 4 30 in the morning two unusually bright white balls of light with beams of light shining toward the ground in the area toward where the circles were located although they couldn't see the circles from their location so they didn't know that anything was even there three different witnesses also described seeing brilliant fire engine red brighter than fireworks balls of light larger than any stars or planets but smaller than the full moon and the appearance of these lights caused two of these witnesses to almost drive off the road these witnesses were completely separate people not connected at all who came at different times to report this same eyewitness event one witness said that they watched the lights for some time and then it went out the lights were gone for a short time and it appeared again and it had moved to a slightly different area then they watched it for some time and then the light faded down again was gone for a short period of time and then came back in a third location but all three locations were in the same area of where the two circles were when it came down to it the researchers all agreed on one thing there was no way that these crop circles were man-made and this is just a random side note but my cousin sister and i decided that we wanted to go down in the middle of the big circle in the middle of the night and watch the movie signs with aluminum foil hats because we were teenagers at the time and we thought we were cool but when we went down there with our fully charged laptop the computer wouldn't turn on at all it was like the battery was dead even though it was fully charged and was working fine before that now they each had their own theory as to what caused the crop circles but of course no one knows for sure i'll give you my opinion though again this is my opinion i believe in god the father and jesus christ is our savior therefore i know that there is more to this world than what the human eye can see there is good and there is evil and there's a spiritual realm which is hard to comprehend with our human flesh i believe that these crop circles were a part of that phenomenon and i don't believe that it was a coincidence that they were right next to an indian burial ground i want to know what you guys think down in the comment section below what do you guys think caused these circles do you know of anything similar that's happened in your area let us know down below and make sure to like this unique video that we have for you today and of course
