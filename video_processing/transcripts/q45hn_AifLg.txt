 Hi, I'm Brian Spencer, Hay & Forge Marketing Manager for Case IH North America. Today I want to discuss our modular cutter bar system found in our disc mower conditioners, our disc mowers, and our disc heads for our self-propelled wind rowers. A modular system has several advantages for us. It provides us durability, reliability, and serviceability. We don't have any free-flowing oil between each disc because they sit on a module. By not having free-flowing oil, should you have a failure, that failure is contained inside the module. Take the module out, take it home to the workbench, put new bearings and seals in it, you're good to go. It limits downtime, provides easy serviceability, and durability, and reliability. Another feature of our modular system is our shock hub. Each module is protected by a shock hub. Should you encounter a non-compressible object in the field, a rock, a post, or something like that, the shock hub takes the abuse. It's designed to shear and protect the module. It's quickly changed by removing just a few bolts. It's a five-minute fix, limits downtime again. That's some of the features and benefits of our modular cutter bar.
