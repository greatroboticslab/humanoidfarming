  "text": "okay go to the next one the aquaculture industry we usually talk about fish but it actually includes anything that you can grow in the water or in a water environment but I'm typically going to talk about fish here and even at that we have a broad perspective to go through we I should preface this whole thing by saying I'm from Wisconsin and I typically deal with the northern central tier of states so what I have to do with managing water and efforts and so forth is probably going to be quite different than East Coast West Coast or the southern states but up in the northern tier we have access to cold water cool water warm water fish we can have fish and plant combinations like aquaponic situations we have people that just have plants growing a hydroponics with no fish if we do an outdoor culture we've got a lot of variety there the whole pond may give me you can have net pens cages floating raceways on tide on side teen culture we have flow through systems that are indoor and we have recirculating aquaculture systems which are called Ras you know use Ras quite frequently so I have to repeat it but that's a system that's indoors that recycles all the water and never wastes it to the outdoors and we also get into saltwater systems like right now we're starting to get into shrimp so just to break down what we are growing oh and then the other thing I wanted to mention about 90% of the aquaculture in Wisconsin that we consider aquaculture is actually baitfish and then there's the next 9% is growing trout and the last 9% is all the other species the last 1% and so I'm just going to go through what we actually culture for food fish and that will apply to bait fish if they're doing culture an intense culture so forth so we have non-indigenous cold water species that were working with Atlantic salmon arctic char our new rainbow trout is the standby that's not an indigenous species but it it seems like it cuz it's so cosmopolitan then we get into what we call cool water wall I saw a guy perch saw a guy is actually a hybrid walleye Sagar and it looks the same as a walleye so I'm just going to put one picture up but those are cool water fish and then the next slide will show and both these are indigenous and then the indigenous fish and this picture is your bluegill which is pretty cosmopolitan but if we want to go indoors to a real warm water species we start with tilapia which is normal aquaponics and we have shrimp there's there's a rule of that I always use in managing fish culture what we have to realize is that we're actually doing two resources one is your biological organism that we're managing and that's what we're thinking of managing and then the other one is the big one is the water so any successful aquaculture is really an exercise in wastewater treatment and as long as you can provide good water quality your fish or any other organism you're working with will be happy and you will have a successful operation so when we consider the cool and warm water species in the northern tier States we can we can raise them but we're really limited by maybe three to four months that they at the tops walleye maybe a little longer if we go to cold water species while we were talking about trout and some onit's we're either using artesian or well water yeah and obviously they're cold water so they they're growing season is quite a bit longer and for indoor systems we're generally working with temperatures that are 65 to 80 degrees usually on the higher end and that's in an Ras system the recirculating aquaculture system and by and some of these species are definitely warm water they cannot be grown outdoors the types of waste that we get we generally will get a solid waste from the and that's our pcs and we're it's very obvious if you raise fish in aquarium you'll see that but an additional waste comes from our operations if we're feeding food which we always go for on the grow but that food if we over feed that is an excess solid waste and that could be more more biological oxygen that could be more demanding than defeated then the fish feces itself and we also have dissolved waste coming from the fish usually from the gills and that's on nitrogenous waste ammonia and that has to be taken care of and then if we go back indoors to an RAS system we have to treat both the solid waste and the dissolved waste typically an RAF system is self-contained but we as we're pulling the waste out of it we might have to make up about 10 percent of the total volume of the RAS but all these wastes are oxygen can to consuming entities and they have to be that that waste has to be solved so let's go to the treatment of waste in the outer systems fort on the treatment is going to be aeration there's almost nothing else you can do and if you're in a pond whether it's a cage or in a pond proper aeration is going to be mandatory especially when we get to the warmer temperatures of July and August and the farther south you go the more that becomes a bigger problem sometimes if you're using floating Raceway static raceways or on-site tanks the flow is sufficient to eliminate the need for oxygenation but it has to be there as a standby the indoor systems we have some flow through systems but generally not most of them are closed-loop systems and they require a more sophisticated waste treatment system you know you start with solids removal and then you have a second step for the dissolved solid and gaseous waste which would be basically converting ammonia to nitrate and that's a biological process you know a little bit about the complications of that later so I put a couple pictures in for those that I mean I think you know most of what I've been talking about except these slides are of what I have does by pondside teen culture the ones on the left are the low profile and I use those for spawning eggs feet training fry and fingerling size grading but then the next year when I go I have the bigger tanks for the grow-out and basically you're starting with like these are for perch and if I'm starting with a four inch perch I'll go to the grow out in four months so that's that's the setup for that and notice that here's the girl tanks and then this is a this is actually a solid collection tank so that's one of the things I do so there's no solids collection here but there's no solid waste accumulating there either and this is a little odd for our part of the country but this is a shrimp tank set up a lot of them this is about 80 degrees and this is just a large full barn and this the one on the right is a small aquaponics you have the fish tank a little degassing tanks for ammonia treatment and then you have that's converted to nitrates what is used by the plants and that's a very small unit being on high school or maybe your basement so not nothing real big there's obviously they're very large systems when they get into aquaponics okay so let's talk about the physical parameters and what are the most important parameters to look for the one that drives everything I talked a lot about oxygen INRI oxygenation and the one thing about oxygen is that it's all temperature related oxygen saturation is the highest at low temperatures and you lose saturation the higher the temperatures are that's why we have so much problem holding oxygen in July in August then there we have to put a lot of aeration in in a system and conversely in the winter we don't may not aerate at all the rate of waste treatment occurs much faster with warm temperatures again as the warmer temperatures occur then we get oxygen eaten up a lot faster because the waste treatment occurs faster oxygen consumption by fish and the wasted justin is significant lowering cool temperatures which would be winter which is most of the time up here and the cool spring and fall is cool so very little oxygen demand or I should say extensive oxygen demand in the middle of summer but not so in the rest of the time indoor systems generally they're really warm but sometimes they go with a cold water fish and it's important to know this is critical right here the rate of converting ammonia to nitrate which is what you have to do an indoor system will be dependent upon your biological treatment system very much reduced in coal temperature so for working with warm temperatures it works pretty good but you have to be cognizant of the fact that it doesn't work if at all when it's very cold okay for solids removal typically we're actually I'm able to remove solids from an outdoor pond until after a growing season or if we have to take a pond down there's one other thing I forgot to add in here a lot of ponds you can do wheat harvesting and that's that's a reduction in solids but there you're you're really doing that to pull out the nutrients and actually if you let that overwinter all those plants are going to decompose in your pond and actually be a deficit for oxygen so that's a solid removal where that comes in some outdoor situations as I said before you can remove solids as as are generated like in raceways and flow channels and specifically in in ponds I taste which is what I do in general we we don't have many permits wastewater permits typically the federal requirements prevail they're pretty much best management practice for the aquaculture industry however the largest discharges may be subject to wastewater discharge permits I think we only have one or two of them in the state of Wisconsin so that shows you how infrequent a permit is everybody's supposed to be under the best management practices most states will follow the federal loo lead with respect to permits and if you do have a permit it's going to be based on solids biochemical oxygen demand an ammonia and now most recently we're seeing new restrictions on phosphorous and he's a very low level but they're based on Basin whole Basin waste Lord watershed loading and so it may be a problem at hundred miles away but it starts at your place so phosphorous is the new kid on the block here",
