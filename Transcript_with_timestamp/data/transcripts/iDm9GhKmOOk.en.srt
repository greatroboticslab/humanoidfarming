[Music]

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,240
we have been

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,960
raised up doing farming though it looked

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,080
like

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,400
some kind of punishment so it never

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,400
in my mind that i could do agriculture

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,800
plural to urban migration is very common

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,519
especially with the youth

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,519
that is because of lack of employment

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,719
after moving to the city and setting up

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,920
a business

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:41,680
and it collapsed which forced me to

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,680
go back home that's when

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,640
i can see it was very stressful

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,280
i lost all my money and i came back at

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,800
zero

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,440
that's why my idea for moving to canada

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,960
came

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,359
i wanted to fly away we have

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,879
mighty said that certain countries are

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,199
better than ours

22
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,040
and we think that if we go to that

23
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,119
country we can make it big

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,119
but right now i've come to learn that

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,880
most of the people who goes

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,840
abroad they don't really make a lot of

27
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,560
money

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,799
because once they come back they still

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,640
go back to square one

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,439
right now i've come to learn that

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,479
agriculture has the potential to create

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,119
many jobs because currently in africa we

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,320
still have

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,799
an opportunity to come up with business

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,680
agribusinesses

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,920
which can sustain our economy and

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,320
improve our life rail

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,280
i think the reason why agriculture

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,799
is not attracting youth is low adoption

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,360
of technology

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,880
if technology is brought into

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,200
agriculture

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,439
it will bring high youth and more income

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,399
lane fed agriculture on the other hand

45
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,600
is very

46
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,399
yes disease but due to

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,439
thick seasons most of the produce go to

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,520
waste

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,520
but with the technology like this one

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,640
thanks to how they gave me the drip

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,760
system

52
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,599
now i can able to produce events in dry

53
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,239
seasons when the prices are good

54
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,760
when i'm working my field it feels good

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,080
to see the green crops

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,160
growing you are their caretaker it's

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,160
very good when you are seeing

58
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:37,840
crops from driving healthy

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:37,840
it feels good

60
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,120
you
