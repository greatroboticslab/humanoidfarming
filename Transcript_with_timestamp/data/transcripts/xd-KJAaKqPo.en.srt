hello learners welcome to our

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,370
environmental science in a secondary

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,530
course of an RS in our previous program

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,050
we have already discussed about modern

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:20,350
agriculture which includes process of

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:23,230
processing food feed - an agriculture

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:26,349
vation of the certain plants and raising

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,090
of domesticated animal so today there is

11
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:29,800
a great demand to promote sustainable

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,539
agriculture there is less than twenty

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,650
one concept of sustainable agriculture

14
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:37,150
of module six first level development

00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:39,300
MLM cook tacos cognitive involved in

16
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,010
science welcome to you in this program

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,469
look at the figure as we know that

18
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:47,770
primitive humans discovered agriculture

19
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:50,050
about 12,000 years ago primitive hunters

20
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:53,620
and gatherers move to pace near rivers

21
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:56,379
once humans knew that watering plant is

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,949
necessary to grow plants look at the

23
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:02,289
left side figure hunting and godrick

24
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:05,170
primitive humans learn to become farmers

25
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:07,900
such human settlements begin forming

26
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:10,570
gradually more human settled away from

27
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,270
rivers and water they're going crops

28
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,909
with water from wells to bills and other

29
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:19,180
means of withdrawing groundwater

30
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:22,659
however result of farming depending

31
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:25,090
largely on rains during monsoon right

side figure shows a farmer playing rain

33
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:32,890
God now come to the objective of the

34
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:35,920
program are relate changing human needs

35
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:38,680
with overuse of environment need for

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,020
enhancing quality of environment define

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,079
sustainable agriculture and justify its

38
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,439
need describe concept and methods of

39
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,990
sustainable agriculture explain about

40
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,000
organic farming and its benefits

41
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,790
describe the methods of preparing one we

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,329
composed explained bio fertilizer and

43
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:01,750
they are used in agriculture explain

44
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:05,229
integrated pest management and Jean GMOs

45
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:08,130
and its related issues now come to

46
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:10,660
humanist and over you know environment

47
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:13,900
human population are growing rapidly

48
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,970
throughout the world almost half of the

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,450
population live in densely populated

50
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:22,900
urban areas rural population migrate

51
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:27,220
to open areas in search of job food

52
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:30,060
housing and a better lifestyle and also

53
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,849
impact on agriculture as well as

54
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,670
environment now come to the need for

55
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:39,010
enhanced quality of environment this

56
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,280
huge population puts a tremendous

57
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,620
pressure on resources the high rate of

58
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,040
consumption of resources and highways

59
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:52,239
rate as expansion of cities Copeland's

60
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,430
forests wetland and wild habitat destroy

61
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,910
so there is a great need to improve the

62
00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:00,730
situation so that humans can enjoy a

63
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:04,120
quality environment we do deserve a

64
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:08,290
healthy environment to survive and lead

65
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:11,709
a good life now come to the advent of

66
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:14,980
modern agriculture after world war ii

67
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,849
food and fiber were raised by new

68
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,630
technology

69
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:22,569
thus begin modern agriculture use of new

70
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:25,079
machines and implements for agriculture

71
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,220
use of fertilizers and pesticides

72
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,880
expansion of irrigation facilities

73
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:33,790
result in enough food for fast-growing

74
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,630
population now come to the impact of

75
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:39,280
modern agriculture on environment

76
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:43,030
population increased more food needed

77
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,440
more farm used agriculture grow more

78
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:49,269
food but many adverse effects on

79
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,430
environment and unemployment of farm

80
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,880
labourers come to the impact on

81
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:58,510
environment deforestation to get land

82
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:03,060

84
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,980
contamination polluted water

85
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:12,329
unemployment of farm laborers migrating

86
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:16,329
from villages to cities resulting in

87
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:19,810
urbanization and its problems next slide

88
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:23,740
shows different tools and implements and

89
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:26,200
expansion of irrigation facilities now

90
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,280
come to the sustainable agriculture to

91
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,500
saw through gun of last two decades

92
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,220
remote not modern agriculture but

93
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,010
sustained

94
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,420
culture to save the environment for

95
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,990
future generations

96
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:43,630
next question arises what is sustainable

97
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,900
agriculture and sustainable agriculture

98
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:49,210
for whom sustainable agriculture or

99
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,580
systemic farming attempts to produce

100
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:55,330
sufficient food exhausting soil

101
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,760
fertility and damaging environment it is

102
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:01,180
to be least toxic komlin and least

103
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,690
energy intensive in operation and get

104
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,610
maintain productivity and profitability

105
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:09,820
grow sufficient food and retain soil

106
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:14,770
quality for many subsequent generation

107
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:19,060
to grow food now how does sustainable

108
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:21,720
agriculture achieve so answer is it can

109
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,190
be achieved by various ways that is

110
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,900
protect and preserve environmental

111
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,810
quality use natural resources

112
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:32,260
judiciously decrease dependence on

113
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:35,370
non-renewable energy resources provide

114
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:38,950
consumers with affordable high-quality

115
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,710
foodstuff support profitable agriculture

116
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:45,310
production enhance quality of life of

117
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:49,750
farmers and rural population last for

118
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:52,470
many generations now come to the methods

119
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,510
of sustainable agriculture that will be

120
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,760
mixed cropping or diverse coughing crop

121
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,280
rotation multiple cropping while

122
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,010
planning these approaches one has to be

123
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,950
kept in mind local geography and

124
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:10,169
topography nature and condition of soil

125
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:15,960
so local climate and local inputs and

126
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:18,990
farmers goal now we will discuss

127
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,030
objectives of sustainable agriculture

128
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,669
cultivation practices to increase

129
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:26,229
biological and economic stability

130
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:28,960
selection of improved varieties to suit

131
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:31,750
the need soil management by proper

132
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,300
method of tillage many farmers in India

133
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,940
and other developing countries follow

134
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,430
the traditional practices of mixed

135
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:44,110
cropping or diverse cropping and crop

136
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:46,810
rotation first ability mixed cropping or

137
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,720
diverse copying is an old practices

138
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,510
India in this method two or more crops

139
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,740
are grown on the same piece of land and

140
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:58,960
at the same time this removes the

141
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:02,050
insecurities of total crop failure when

142
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,380
more than one crop is grown at least one

143
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,750
pill survived if not all of the two

144
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,000
crops grown together one is a long

145
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,570
duration crop and other a short duration

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,240
cob nutrients required by the two crops

147
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,840
is different time of maturity is

148
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,330
different

149
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:23,220
generally leguminous crop is grown with

150
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:26,080
a main crop so nitrogen gets fixed and

151
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:30,220
there is no need for fertilizer

152
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,320
it saves costs other plants for mixed

153
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,260
cropping can be Polly varietal

154
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:41,610
punctuation that is several varieties of

155
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:46,330
same crop grown together now next is

156
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:49,030
intercropping different crops that is

157
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,970
banach leguminous crop which fixes

158
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:55,300
nitrogen other carbohydrate crop which

159
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:58,210
uses soil nitrogen plants maturing at

160
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:01,300
different times are grown together needs

161
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:04,390
different so less inputs needed natural

162
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:07,990
predators control pace so new pesticides

163
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:12,479
needed compared to monoculture yield per

164
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:15,250
hectare much more now what is

165
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:18,160
monoculture it is a cultivation of

166
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:20,710
single crop on large scale which gives

167
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,700
large eat but for a short period of time

168
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:27,190
it is expensive as lots of fertilizers

169
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:30,190
and pesticides are needed

170
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:34,500
so not only monoculture is economically

171
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:38,320
unsound but also environmentally harmful

172
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:42,010
next is crop rotation growing different

173
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,610
crops in succession regularly in the

174
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:48,209
same field result control insects and

175
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,550
diseases increase soil fertility

176
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:55,740
decreases soil erosion monoculture of

177
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:59,070
high yield single crop exhaust totally

178
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,430
one certain minerals yield remain

179
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,800
utilization

180
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:06,339
this result in nutrient imbalance of the

181
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,270
soil and increases certain pastes and

182
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:12,510
diseases sewing a leguminous crop as a

183
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:16,060
rotational crop is very useful because

184
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:18,700
legumes enhance nitrogen label in the

185
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:22,300
soil due to their ability to fix

186
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:25,690
atmospheric nitrogen reduces that need

187
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:28,149
for chemical nitrogen fertilizer thereby

188
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:32,080
cutting the cost and saving the soil

189
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:34,720
from the harmful effects of using high

190
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,459
yielding varieties along with the

191
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,620
application of large amount of

192
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:43,660
fertilizers pesticides and water it is

193
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,060
possible to grow two or sometimes three

194
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,750
different crops in succession on the

195
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,820
same length with inner ear is known as

196
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,940
multiple cropping this practice can go

197
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:58,810
on for some time but the length can not

198
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:02,130
maintain high eat in a long run crop

199
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:05,140
rotation takes in two among the factors

200
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:08,110
first leguminous crops should be clone

201
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:11,380
after non leguminous crop crop requires

202
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:13,540
less water should be clone after one

203
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:18,279
that requires more water

204
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:22,270
third crops requiring less meat meal

205
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:26,800
should be shown after one that require

206
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:30,430
more menus important crop patterns of

207
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:34,480
propagation as shown in this slide first

208
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:37,690

210
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:44,410
sugarcane beet and more food paddy beet

211
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,930
and move mixed cropping when coupled

212
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,709
with livestock rearing has many

213
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:54,490
advantages some land area can be used or

214
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:57,850
crop of grown on one label and steeper

215
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:01,390
slope if pasture and leguminous forages

216
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:06,010
crops are rotated soil quality is

217
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:08,140
enhanced livestock menu makes while for

218
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,360
time in

219
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,420

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:23,230
farmers against price fluctuation farm

223
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,840
labor gets utilized more effectively now

224
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:28,390
come to the soil management a healthy

225
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,940
soil is a key component of sustainable

226
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:33,040
agriculture that is healthy soil along

227
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,800
with water and nutrient produces healthy

228
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,400
crop plants that are less susceptible to

229
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:42,310
pests and diseases accordingly soil must

230
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,550
be protected and nurtured to ensure

231
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,740
long-term productivity and stability

232
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:50,280
methods of protection include using

233
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:53,860
cover crops shampoos reducing tillage

234
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:56,860
conserving soil moisture by dead mulches

235
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,980
this increases water hold capacity of

236
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,230
the soil significant improvement in crop

237
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,170
production has been achieved by using

238
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:10,240
the conventional method of selection and

239
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:13,650
plant breeding now objectives of

240
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:16,720
varietal improvement improvement are

241
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:20,530
development of high yielding varieties

242
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,560
of crop plants food crops develop for

243
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:26,890
better and higher nutritional quality

244
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,260
like protein quality in pulses making

245
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,300
quality in wheat preserving quality in

246
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,300
fruits and vegetables soil quality in

247
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,820

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,340
of crop varieties resistance to disease

249
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:42,040
and paste improving varieties for

250
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:47,380
resistance against heat cold frost

251
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:50,290
draught and water logging now come to

252
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,650
the bio fertilizer and its uses in

253
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:56,200
agriculture while fertilizer are

254
00:12:53,650 --> 00:13:00,070
substitutes for chemical fertilizers

255
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,440
such as NPK they are used in reduces

256
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:05,230
energy expenditure required to

257
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,050
manufacture fertilizers they do not

258
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:11,590
cause pollution microorganisms like

259
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:14,800
bacteria algae and fungi fix atmospheric

260
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:17,740
nitrogen debt can be solubilized

261
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,560
phosphorus decomposed organic material

262
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,120
or oxidized sulfur in soil

263
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,780
enhance

264
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:31,060
growth and yield of crops improve soil

265
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:33,610
fertility some of the important types of

266
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,940
biofertilizers which can be considered

267
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:41,140
for agro based industries are Rhizobium

268
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:45,730
as ito bacterium zola blue-green algae

269
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:49,150
etcetera first Rhizobium it is a

270
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:53,770
symbiotic bacteria and form do not use

271
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:57,490
in leguminous plants and live there they

272
00:13:53,770 --> 00:14:00,450
can fix atmospheric nitrogen up to 200

273
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:03,190
kilo gram nitrogen per hectare per year

274
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:05,790
surplus nitrogen remains in soil and

275
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:10,330
enhanced soil quality

276
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:14,650
next is Agito bacteria these are aerobic

277
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:17,080
fix living nitrogen fixing bacteria grow

278
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:19,510
around foods of cereals and fixed

279
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,630
nitrogen reduce growth promoting

280
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:28,380
hormones which helps in enhancing growth

281
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:30,850
and yield of plants next is a spiral um

282
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,340
aerobic fix living nitrogen fixing

283
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:36,780
bacteria associate symbiotic bacteria

284
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:40,360
live on wood surface of host plant and

285
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:43,830
increase crop yield supplying growth

286
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:48,670
hormones and vitamins commonly used in

287
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:53,770
commercial inoculation next is blue gill

288
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:57,370
algae no stock and anabaena are common

289
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:59,620
blue green algae or cyanobacteria free

290
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:03,450
living and photosynthetic they fixed

291
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:09,370
nitrogen use in flooded rice fields as

292
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:13,380
nitrogen biofertilizers next is a Zola

293
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:17,680
it is a water fun inside which grows

294
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:21,340
nitrogen fixing VG anabaena ozuna and

295
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,840
nabina combine is used as fertilizer in

296
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,780
all over the world

297
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,990
it grows in summer makes is phosphorous

298
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:33,580
solubilizing biofertilizers phosphorus

299
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:35,830
is needed for plant root also for not

300
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,380
dual formation Rhizobium

301
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:41,800
certain microbes solubilize phosphorus

302
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:47,430
and make it available for plants to

303
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:51,880
absorb now we will discuss my cruiser

304
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:55,300
fungi that occur on roots of forest

305
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,220
trees and crop plants in soil low in

306
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,680
available nutrients there is an

307
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:04,390
increased absorption of nutrients by

308
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:07,200
plants infected by mike rizzo the fungus

309
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:10,570
has the ability to dissolve and absorb

310
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:15,100
phosphorus that plant roots cannot

311
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:18,880
readily absorb now come to the organic

312
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:22,530
farming and its benefit organic matter

313
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:26,200
is bought living organisms are made of

314
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:28,990
hence organic farming in agriculture

315
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:32,950
relying on crop rotation crop residue

316
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:36,700
animal menu like you in menu organic

317
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:39,400
waste and biofertilizers mechanical

318
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:42,040
control cultivation mineral bearing

319
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:45,670
crops biological pest and weed control

320
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,640
in other parts organic farming does not

321
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:51,580
use any chemicals or artificial

322
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,400
substance for agriculture agricultural

323
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,640
product for organic farming are green

324
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:02,050
dairy products poultry products cotton

325
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:04,570
and jute fibres flowers etc thus organic

326
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:07,750
farming creates a sustainable lifestyle

327
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:12,250
for generations to come now come to the

328
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:14,440
method of organic farming nourishing

329
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:17,470
microbes in soil to provide its

330
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:20,860
nutrients soil organic matter gives the

331
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:23,680
soil good structure and water holding

332
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:26,470
capacity organic farmers grow these

333
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:29,290
microbes and add compost and biological

334
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:32,440
based soil nutrients so that plants

335
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:37,030
grown in organic farm our disease and

336
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:39,160
pest resistant organic farmers use crop

337
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:42,280
rotation to in ditch soil continuously

338
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:45,310
and keep up a paste prefer specific

339
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:49,750
crops to keep pests away predators are

340
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:54,700
used meeting is disrupted and tress

341
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:58,780
and barriers are used now come to the

342
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:01,179
benefits of organic farming it can be

343
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:04,030
learnt easily by farmer reduce

344
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:07,450
production cost as expensive fertilizers

345
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:10,620
and pesticides not used did you say soil

346
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,150
erosion up to 50% increase crop eat

347
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:16,210
fivefold in lowland

348
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:19,510
organic farms can support wildlife as

349
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:23,530
the animal can roam in pastures and

350
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:28,929
grace entire ecosystem along with

351
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:31,960
groundwater is improved varies benefits

352
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:35,860
as the cattle are fed organic field and

353
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,580
grazes on organic fields these kettles

354
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,950
are more healthy and kept tasty milk

355
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:45,330
soil remains healthy with living

356
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:48,730
microbes that provide the soil with

357
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:51,280
micronutrients soil gets inexhaustible

358
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:55,630
nutrients for many generations of crops

359
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:58,659
roll in the organic field quality of

360
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:01,390
products enhanced as they are free from

361
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:04,870
harmful chemicals artificial flavors

362
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:07,980
colors and preservatives now come to the

363
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:11,530
advantages of intense farming and

364
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,679
organic formula in short advantage of

365
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:17,799
intensive farming are bigger eats from

366
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:20,280
land available fewer Parker's native use

367
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:24,100
of hormone increases meat production

368
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:27,100
large numbers of animals kept in ideal

369
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:30,789
conditions produced a sleeper fewer

370
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:34,000
blemishes on crops and organic farming

371
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:36,299
soil structure is better less harmful to

372
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,030
environment no harmful chemicals

373
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:44,590
healthier more birds insects and animals

374
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:45,159
lead happier lives now come to the Burma

375
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,520
compost

376
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:51,940
Burma compost can be prepared at the

377
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,640
back yard of your home in one corner to

378
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:57,549
your school field or may be public park

379
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,700
which will produce manure as well as

380
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:03,100
clean up the environment from garbage

381
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,640

00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:06,400
when they find the paste label to be

418
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,130
high enough they first used biological

419
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,040
methods and cultivation practices to

420
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:15,429

to interest off rich countries before we

539
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:55,800
wrap up we would like to recap the main

540
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,800
points that is what you have learnt

541
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:02,560
sustainable agriculture systems are

542
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:04,780
those that are least toxic and least

543
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,630
energy consuming yet maintain

544
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:09,100
productivity and profitability

545
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:12,160
agricultural practices like crop

546
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:15,520
rotation intercropping polyculture and

547
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:18,610
proper soil management with mulches and

548
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,500
cover crops to maintain soil moisture

549
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:24,250
are integral part of sustainable

550
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:27,250
agriculture bio fertilizer are the plant

551
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:30,040
nutrients for of biological origin like

552
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:33,720
algae bacteria fungi which have no

553
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:36,670
harmful effect on soil and environment

554
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,950
organic farming is a type of agriculture

555
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:42,040
which avoids synthetic inorganic

556
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:45,820
fertilizers pesticides growth regulators

557
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:49,300
and livestock feed additives organically

558
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:51,970
grow and feed food products are free

559
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,780
from harmful chemicals or typical

560
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:58,480
flavors and preservation reiatives

561
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:01,060
vermicompost can be prepared at the back

562
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,730
yard of your home in one corner of your

563
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:06,430
school field or maybe in public park

564
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:09,730
which will produce many or as well as

565
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:13,450
clean up the environment from garbage

566
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:16,300
accumulation integrated pest management

567
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:19,690
is a grand idea to control pests and

568
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:21,970
diseases this increases production takes

569
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,370
the environment from pollution and

570
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:27,190
harmful effect of pesticides and save

571
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:30,130
money which is usually spent on buying

572
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:33,430
