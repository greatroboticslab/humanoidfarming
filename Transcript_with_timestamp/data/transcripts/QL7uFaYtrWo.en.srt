hey what's up everybody I'm Chef Mikey

9
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,500
welcome back to Chef's Harvest Farm I am

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,080
a former executive chef turned Urban

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,960
Farmer and today I'm going to show you

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,560
how I built the ultimate no-till Garden

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,140
I'll go over the strategies of how I

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,140
built this I I started just growing food

15
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,380
for myself and my wife basically we

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,020
wanted to eat organic vegetables and uh

17
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,000
I started shopping at the farmers market

18
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,640
and then I learned that there's this

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,680
whole other level of food that you can't

20
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,439
buy in a grocery store so I wanted to

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,780
grow my own high quality food when I

22
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,060
started growing food I just started with

23
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,799
a little raised bed box garden that I

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,939
filled with soil that I bought from Home

25
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,640
Depot

26
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,180
and then that grew into a

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,000
a lot of them I had like 25 of these

28
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,460
little boxes that I built kind of back

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,159
here at one point those are all gone now

30
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,079
it's not an efficient way to grow food

31
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,579
trying to weed eat in between them and

32
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,799
mow around them it just doesn't work

33
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,020
well the reason I got into this style of

34
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,759
Agriculture and growing food and the way

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,160
I learned about it and why I grow

36
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,340
no-till is because I knew nothing about

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,900
growing food my mom was selling tea at a

38
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,819
farmer's market in Scarborough Maine

39
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,140
which is the town where I'm from and I

40
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,940
grew up there

41
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,340
and she said well there's this new

42
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,500
farmer in town and you should follow him

43
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,140
on Instagram and his name's Daniel Mays

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,739
and he runs frith farm so I followed him

45
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:32,700
on Instagram and he was promoting

46
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,620
these no-till methods of growing food so

47
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,420
basically they don't use a tractor or

48
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,180
anything or I don't use a tractor I

49
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,580
don't own a tiller or a tractor but I

50
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,920
might own a tractor soon just to use to

51
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,220
make compost and move it basically I

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,780
don't want it for working in the field

53
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,599
um

54
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,900
so anyways this guy was promoting these

55
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,720
no-till methods of growing food

56
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,300
where he was using big giant tarps to

57
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,940
tarp the ground and that's how I killed

58
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:06,120
the pasture here or the backyard the

59
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,180
grass I just tarped it the first time I

60
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,900
put a tarp down it was in October

61
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,940
and then it it gets cold so the heat is

62
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,560
what really kills it but even doing it

63
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,720
that time of year I just left the tarp

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,420
there all winter I'm in Knoxville

65
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,700
Tennessee Zone Seven we have relatively

66
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,860
mild Winters typically but it can get

67
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,239
really cold so when I pulled the tarp

68
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,640
back in the middle of the winter the

69
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,760
grass was mostly Dead with some like uh

70
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,519
weeds growing out so I dug those little

71
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,800
weeds growing out up with a fork it was

72
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,019
mostly onion grass and I don't know the

73
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,540
other kind what it's called I'll show

74
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,099
you it's this stuff this is like the

75
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,440
worst weed that I have I think it's

76
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,180
called Bermuda grass maybe or something

77
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,540
I could be completely wrong I don't know

78
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,299
but it's like that rhizomis stuff that

79
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,580
sucks so the silage tarps don't kill

80
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,040
that I mean I had it tarped for like a

81
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,019
year so the whole garden whenever I find

82
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,659
that I go in with a fork and I dug it

83
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,940
out so then I'd build the beds I'd get

84
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:09,780
like a pickup truckload full of compost

85
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:12,239
and I measure out 30 inch beds and 14

86
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,000
inch walk ways and tie it up with a

87
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,859
string from one end to the other while I

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,660
measure it out

89
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:20,820
and build the beds like that and then I

90
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,440
covered them still with a silage tarp to

91
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,660
just kill any more weeds that are going

92
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,820
to grow up

93
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,860
so then that spring I peeled back the

94
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,780
silage tarp and I moved it over to the

95
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,580
next part of the yard and I started

96
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,620
killing that part

97
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,840
and all this while I had a full-time job

98
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,120
so I'm doing this on the weekends

99
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,740
basically

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,380
and then the next part of the garden

101
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,780
just stays tarped for about a year

102
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,300
well then I built those beds in the same

103
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,820
method but then I just cover crop the

104
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,639
whole thing immediately to Winter rye

105
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,800
grass in like October of that year so

106
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:59,160
then the following spring the rye grass

107
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,400
is about six feet tall

108
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,680
I crimped it using a pallet I just like

109
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,800
threw a pallet on top of it that matted

110
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,440
it down I dragged the silage tarp back

111
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,380
over it for about two weeks because now

112
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,900
it's like April May starting to get hot

113
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:19,280
in Tennessee so it cooks that up pretty

114
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:22,259
quickly and just leaves a flat grass mat

115
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,600
and then this next plot that I have the

116
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:27,120
footage of that's this year after I

117
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,340
built this Market Garden and I had a ton

118
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,199
going on I'm super busy I'm like well I

119
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,300
still have all this yard so I just

120
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,220
pulled the tarp over there and I just

121
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,039
let the tarp sit there for a year then

122
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,680
the grass is just completely dead then

123
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,780
it was mid-october I was already

124
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,360
planning to do this obviously I planned

125
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,100
this whole thing two years planning you

126
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,800
can't just wake up one morning and say

127
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,220
hey I'm gonna use this method on this

128
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,919
YouTube video that I saw today like

129
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,080
you need to plan ahead

130
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,880
so I plan two years in advance had the

131
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,180
tarp sitting there for a year

132
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:08,180
I pulled that tarp back

133
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,180
and it's just red clay basically

134
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,320
and it starts pouring rain out and I got

135
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,539
a five gallon bucket filled with rye

136
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,460
grass seed and I just go out there in a

137
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,580
rainstorm and I just start shaking and

138
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:23,340
rye grass seed I put 40 pounds of rye

139
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,919
grass seed right on top of the soil I

140
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:29,039
just broadcasted it well sure enough

141
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,479
the rye grass sprouted

142
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,120
and

143
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,639
the rye grass grew up this tall

144
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,280
and I crimped it and I built beds right

145
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,900
on top of it and the wood chips so it's

146
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,199
just like a flat

147
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:46,139
sheet of mulch but the roots are still

148
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,020
in the ground feeding the microorganisms

149
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,419
they have a symbiotic relationship with

150
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,419
the plants that I've planted now into

151
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:57,300
that Garden then I layered the compost

152
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:59,759
in 30 inch beds about six to eight

153
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,460
inches deep right on top of that

154
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,639
and then I built walkways out of wood

155
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:09,120
chips right on top of that

156
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,740
Okay so uh it's been pouring rain out

157
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,819
for the last two days I don't really

158
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:17,580
know if that's good or bad to do this

159
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:19,560
um but my thought of doing it while it's

160
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,740
soaking wet is because I'm gonna crimp

161
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,440
this down and then pull the silage tarps

162
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,120
over it to kill it

163
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,979
um and then it's gonna be like a mulch

164
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,960
grown in place the roots are still going

165
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,759
to be attached

166
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,199
um and when I peel that tarp back it's

167
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,440
just going to be like

168
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,180
um straw everywhere basically like a big

169
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,000
amount of straw and then I'm gonna plant

170
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,280
right into that so I'm gonna go like

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,099
around the edges and crimp the edges in

172
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,979
first and then I'm gonna go and crimp it

173
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,660
all and all facing One Direction so I

174
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:53,759
can just pull the tarp over it so I'm

175
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,560
going to go down to one end and back and

176
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,199
then down and back and I'll speed that

177
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,780
up while I do it

178
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,580
this is my tool basically right these

179
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,340
things by string and I'm just going to

180
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,280
go up and crimp it down

181
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,900
and just keep going like that to crimp

182
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,440
it all the way to the ground and that's

183
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,440
the first step

184
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:23,840
