1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,120
what if I told you that using cardboard

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,759
in the garden is a terrible idea it

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,279
doesn't kill weeds effectively it

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,480
doesn't feed the soil and it does

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,759
absolutely nothing to improve your soil

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,639
Health after years of trial and error

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,000
I've developed a system that not only

8
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:18,359
eliminates weeds but builds living

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,840
thriving soil without a single piece of

10
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,160
cardboard My Method uses cover crops as

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,039
a natural sheet mulch with roots still

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,880
in the ground creating a weed-free

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,119
garden while boosting biodiversity

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,520
improving soil structure and drainage

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,079
while Scavenging for nutrients bringing

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,120
them to the soil surface locking them in

17
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,239
and making them plant available for

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,640
healthier plants and bigger harvests

19
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,079
with no fertilizer cardboard just

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,800
Smothers the ground but cover crops feed

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,000
the soil their Roots break up compaction

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,079
support soil microbes and add organic

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,280
matter where it matters the most below

24
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,559
the soil surface in this video I'll show

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,680
you exactly how to build the ultimate no

26
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,640
dig Garden using cover crops as a sheet

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,160
Mulch and why cardboard belongs in your

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,080
Rec cycling bin and not in your garden

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,119
hey what's up everybody welcome back to

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,520
Chef's Harvest Farm if you're new here

31
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,240
I'm Chef Mikey I'm a former executive

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,520
chef turned Urban Farmer and I turned my

33
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,400
backyard gardening hobby into a thriving

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,240
no till Farm where I grow food

35
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,280
sustainably for local chefs and

36
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,079
restaurants here in Knoxville Tennessee

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,960
over the years I've tested just about

38
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:24,799
every gardening method out there made

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,360
mistakes fought the weeds and figured

40
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,439
out what actually worked over the past 8

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,960
years I've developed a cover crop system

42
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,920
that improves improves crop Health

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,240
eliminates weeds and builds healthier

44
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,040
soil without chemicals or cardboard but

45
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,200
it didn't start this way when I first

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,600
began gardening in my backyard the soil

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,560
is nothing more than hard compacted clay

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,520
like concrete that's why I started with

49
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,640
typical raised beds thinking nothing

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,560
would grow in my native soil but after

51
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,320
years of trial and error I developed a

52
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,880
system that transformed this into

53
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,079
Healthy Living soil and I'm confident it

54
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,920
can improve almost any soil no matter

55
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,159
how bad it is so how does it work it all

56
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,280
starts with one simple shift stop

57
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,119
thinking about how to feed your plants

58
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,880
and start thinking about how to feed the

59
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,319
soil I farm using nature as the model in

60
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,840
a forest nobody's fertilizing the trees

61
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,400
yet they Thrive leaves fall creating a

62
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,480
natural mulch the soil is never exposed

63
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,920
which is why you never see erosion

64
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,959
animals add nutrients plants break down

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,080
and nothing is ever removed it's a

66
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,280
self-sustaining system you never see an

67
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,519
entire Forest wiped out by pest because

68
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,080
there's balance where predators and prey

69
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,280
exist in harmony in contrast when we

70
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,239
only grow vegetables we create a buffet

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,080
for pests with nothing to keep them in

72
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,200
check that's why I use multi-species

73
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,040
cover crops they don't just improve the

74
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,519
soil they create an ecosystem

75
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,360
underground and above more plant

76
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,040
diversity means more microbial diversity

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,480
healthier soil fewer pests and stronger

78
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,560
crops with higher yields it's Nature's

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,040
Way of keeping things balanced and at

80
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,360
work I mimic this process using cover

81
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,000
crops and compost the result healthy

82
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,360
living soil that grows thriving crops

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,720
without synthetic fertilizers constant

84
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,200
maintenance are fighting against nature

85
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,560
Step One is preparing your garden PLT

86
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,200
and this is where most people get it

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,440
wrong why because they're impatient the

88
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,319
key here is letting time do the work

89
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,239
this isn't the fastest way to build a

90
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,280
garden but in my opinion it's the most

91
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,480
effective I start by laying down a

92
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,239
silage tarp and not any tarp it has to

93
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,799
be either a silage tarp or greenhouse

94
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,040
plastic and here's why these tarps are

95
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,200
UV treated to withstand the harsh rays

96
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,000
of the Sun and they're nonwoven which

97
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,200
means that they trap in heat and

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,360
moisture which is exactly what you want

99
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,640
the tarps I buy are 105 ft long and 24

100
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,879
ft wide I cut them in half to create

101
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,840
garden plots that are just over 50 ft

102
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:50,400
long this keeps all my garden beds

103
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,400
uniform at 50 ft now the size of your

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,959
garden isn't what's important what

105
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,200
really matters is that all of your

106
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,079
garden beds are the same size that could

107
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,040
be 50 ft 100 ft or whatever works for

108
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,480
you in your cont context but here's a

109
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,799
tip I wouldn't recommend buying a tarp

110
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,400
any larger than that they're extremely

111
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,879
large heavy and hard to move even when

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,920
they're cut in half but why does a bed

113
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,280
size matter so much in a moment I'll

114
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,600
explain exactly why this simple detail

115
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,239
can make or break your garden success

116
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,759
now these tarps are most effective In

117
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,759
The Heat Of Summer but I've even

118
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,440
starting Gardens using this method in

119
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,360
the middle of the winter if you want to

120
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,039
speed things up methods like flame

121
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,960
weeding before you tarp can help too but

122
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,800
here's the real secret to making this

123
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,960
work and it's a part that most people

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,919
Overlook it has to be wet under the tart

125
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,919
set up some sprinklers run them for an

126
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,120
hour before you tarp the plot this

127
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,840
creates a steamy environment that breaks

128
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,039
down plant material fast plus it tricks

129
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,400
weed seeds into germinating only to

130
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:51,560
suffocate because there's no sunlight no

131
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,919
oxygen and they're under extreme heat if

132
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,199
it's too dry under the tarp you'll pull

133
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,520
it back months later thinking the job is

134
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,360
done only to find stubborn weeds waiting

135
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,280
to take over now how long should you

136
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,400
tarp I highly recommend tarping for up

137
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,080
to a year for the best result but if

138
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,320
you're in a hurry you can get decent

139
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,240
results with as little as 90 Days In the

140
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,680
Heat of the summer if you want to speed

141
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,000
everything up even more use greenhouse

142
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,960
plastic instead of a silage tarp in the

143
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,880
middle of summer you can get results in

144
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,400
as little as 30 days but if you can I

145
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,840
still recommend tarping for about a year

146
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,520
trust me you'll thank me later once you

147
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,479
pull the tarp back don't make the

148
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,400
mistake of thinking the job's done if

149
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:33,479
you you see weeds like Bermuda grass

150
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,039
don't ignore them the tarp won't always

151
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,800
kill them completely I'll go in and dig

152
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,880
those weeds out that the tarp didn't

153
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,919
kill roots and all otherwise all that

154
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,479
hard work will be wasted step two is

155
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,800
planting the cover crop I broadcast the

156
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,080
seed directly on top of the soil when I

157
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,680
first started I use winter Rye which is

158
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,360
a great choice if you're just starting

159
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,960
out but there's a couple key things you

160
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,400
need to know to get it right first

161
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,319
timing is everything winter ride must be

162
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,319
planted by mid- October oober in my

163
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,440
climate and here's the catch you won't

164
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,000
be able to plant anything in those beds

165
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,319
until May of the following year why

166
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,479
because winter Ry can't be terminated

167
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,560
easily until late April or early may you

168
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,479
have to wait for it to form a seed head

169
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,680
but here's the critical part you need to

170
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,560
terminate it before it forms viable

171
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,160
seeds this is called the milk stage

172
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,280
because if you squeeze the seed head

173
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,479
you'll likely see a milky substance

174
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,919
inside this means the plant is at the

175
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,639
end of its life cycle and ready to die

176
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,840
but if you wait too long and it drops

177
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,560
seeds you'll be fighting winter Ry seeds

178
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,199
forever and trust me you don't want that

179
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,520
headache if you want something a little

180
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,039
bit easier to manage peas and oats are a

181
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,000
great option if planted by mid-september

182
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,919
they can winterkill naturally no

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,080
termination required but this timing is

184
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,599
key for the winter kill if it's not

185
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,759
fully mature by the time winter hit it

186
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,720
will not winter kill and you'll have to

187
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,720
terminate it using other methods in the

188
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,840
spring we'll dive into termination

189
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,879
methods in a moment but over time I've

190
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,879
learned that diversity in cover crops is

191
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,960
where the real magic happens now I use

192
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:10,199
13 species cover crop mixes inoculated

193
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,120
with mic rise and nitrogen fixing

194
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,720
bacteria to create the most biodiversity

195
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,240
possible the challenge with

196
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,080
multi-species cover crop mixes that they

197
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,039
all mature at different rates so if you

198
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,560
don't manage them properly some will

199
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,400
drop seeds and become weeds it took me

200
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,639
years of trial and error to get this

201
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,680
right once I've chosen my cover crop I

202
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,720
simply broadcast the seed right on on

203
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,599
top of the soil I like to time this

204
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,639
right before a good rain or even during

205
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,479
a rain I heavily overseed using nearly a

206
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,759
50 lb bag of seed on a plot that's only

207
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:44,680
about an eighth of an acre that's enough

208
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,360
seed to cover a full acre if drilled why

209
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,319
so much because when you broadcast seeds

210
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,400
some won't germinate some will get eaten

211
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,840
by birds and rodents and some will wash

212
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,759
away by the rain plus I want it as dense

213
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,199
as possible to block out sunlight

214
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,319
smother weeds and add maximum organic

215
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,479
matter and nitrogen to the soil if

216
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,960
needed I set up sprinklers to ensure

217
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,240
good germination and healthy

218
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,159
establishment then I just let time do

219
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,400
the work as the cover crop grows their

220
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:12,720
Roots scavenge for nutrients deep in the

221
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,479
soil pulling them to the soil surface

222
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,639
they attract diverse microorganisms each

223
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,840
playing a role in the soil ecosystem

224
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,039
creating a symbiotic relationship with

225
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,639
plant roots and fostering micro risal

226
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:26,400
fungi connections this helps plants

227
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,319
uptake nutrients and water more

228
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,240
efficiently making your garden more

229
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,240
resilient it's like building a living

230
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,360
support system underground once the

231
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,159
cover crop reaches maturity it's time to

232
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,159
terminate it I use a simple tool a toost

233
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,039
tied to a rope to crimp the cover crop

234
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,560
down tied to a rope and I'm just going

235
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,440
to take it up I'm going to go like this

236
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,040
I'm just going to step on it and I'm

237
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,360
just going to keep moving all the way

238
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,279
down and crimp the whole thing right

239
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,320
down to the ground and I'm going to

240
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,800
start on like the edges I'm going to go

241
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,880
down the edge and crimp it in and then

242
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll go down this Edge and crimp it in

243
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,560
and I'm going to leave the sprinklers in

244
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,200
place and crimp the whole thing going in

245
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,560
One Direction so I'm going to go down

246
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,839
one way and then I'm going to walk back

247
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,560
and then I'm going to go back down and

248
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,360
crimp it and I'm going to walk back and

249
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,240
then I'm going crimp it back so it's all

250
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,360
face in One Direction so that this way

251
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,600
when we pull the tarps over we pull the

252
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,079
tarps Over It All in One Direction and

253
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,120
it doesn't get snagged on anything but

254
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:25,040
here's a tip always crimp it in the same

255
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,320
direction that'll make the next step a

256
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,160
whole lot easier after crimping I pull

257
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,640
the tart back over the plot for two to

258
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,560
three weeks this ensures everything is

259
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,600
terminated and all the weeds that are

260
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,760
trying to come back are smothered out

261
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,040
but before I tarp again it's super

262
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,200
important to run the irrigation to

263
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,000
create that steamy effect just like we

264
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,320
did earlier this helps break down the

265
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,480
cover crop material into a nutrient-rich

266
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,640
sheet Mulch and it will force any weed

267
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,079
seeds to germinate under the tarp which

268
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,360
guarantees a weed-free start after a few

269
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,360
weeks we pull the tar back to reveal a

270
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,440
beautiful sheet mulch with the roots

271
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,920
still attached fostering a thriving soil

272
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,760
ecosystem but before we plant our cash

273
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,880
crops there's a couple more critical

274
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,040
steps so to recap we've prepped our

275
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,320
garden plot by tarping and eliminating

276
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,519
weeds planted a dense cover crop to

277
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,600
build soil health and let time do the

278
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,440
heavy lifting then we crimped the cover

279
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,600
crop tarped it again to create a

280
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,240
nutrient-rich sheet Mulch and now we've

281
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,279
got a living thriving soil ecosystem

282
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,000
ready for the next step now that we have

283
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,839
our sheet mulch With Our Roots still

284
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,320
attached it's time to measure and build

285
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,000
the garden bit before we start building

286
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,560
building out the garden bids I want to

287
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
quickly tell you about something that's

288
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,279
been a total GameChanger for my farm

289
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,839
finances I actually get paid to grow

290
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,200
cover crops through USDA Grant and my

291
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,639
secret weapon for securing those funds

292
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,880
is Farm raise they help farmers manage

293
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,120
bookkeeping for their schedule F keep

294
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,480
track of farm finances and most

295
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,560
importantly they alert you to USDA

296
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,519
funding opportunities and help guide you

297
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,839
through the process if you've ever felt

298
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,760
overwhelmed by Farm grants or didn't

299
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,839
even know where to start Farm ra makes

300
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,200
it simple and if you need extra help

301
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,959
they can even connect you with

302
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,920
experienced Grant Riders right now you

303
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,320
can get 20% off farm raay with my code

304
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,079
Chef

305
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,680
M20 don't wait you could be missing out

306
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:17,200
on free money that's sitting there

307
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,000
waiting for you right now I make all my

308
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,680
garden beds exactly the same size 30 in

309
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,639
wide 50 ft long with 18in walkways this

310
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,880
isn't just about Aesthetics it's about

311
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,600
efficiency I keep every single bed the

312
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,040
same size at both of my Farms why

313
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,480
because it makes everything 100%

314
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,120
interchangeable my drip lines insect

315
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,560
Nets silage tarps shade cloths and frost

316
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,720
blankets are all exactly the same size

317
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,800
no guessing no hunting around for the

318
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,560
right piece I can just grab whatever I

319
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,920
need and it fits perfectly every time no

320
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,120
wasted time looking for the right piece

321
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,920
now the exact size of your garden beds

322
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,279
isn't what's important what matters is

323
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,320
that they're all the same size once you

324
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,480
realize how much time this saves you'll

325
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,399
never go back to Mark the beds I use

326
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,279
Simple Wood staks from the construction

327
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,200
aisle at Home Depot or Lowe's then I

328
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,399
grab a yard stick measure out my beds

329
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,920
and walkways and for perfectly straight

330
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,360
lines I tie tomato twine from one steak

331
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,440
to another outlining the garden beds and

332
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,720
walkways like a grid this might seem

333
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,920
like an extra step but straight uniform

334
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,519
beds make every part of farming easier

335
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,880
from planting to harvesting to

336
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,040
irrigation and let's face it the real

337
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,199
reason y'all watch my videos is because

338
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,040
the garden looks clean organized and

339
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:32,320
aesthetically pleasing once the beds are

340
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,880
marked I fill them with about 6 in of

341
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,560
fresh manure-based compost here's the

342
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,560
thing not all compost is created equal

343
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,040
you've got to do the research ask

344
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,120
questions do trials before adding large

345
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,480
amounts of compost to your garden some

346
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,120
compost has little and no nutritional

347
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,360
value and worse it can be contaminated

348
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,880
with herbicides or pathogens one of my

349
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,959
guys delivered 20 yards of compost and

350
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,600
so I'm going to show you how I'm going

351
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,560
to test it for persistent herbicide

352
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,480
potential so I'm going to fill a few of

353
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,320
these up with uh with compost I'm going

354
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,880
to take it home with me all right so I'm

355
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:10,839
back in my grow room I got my little

356
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,800
things of compost here and then I've got

357
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:16,680
sugar peas and then I've got some beans

358
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,320
too so I've just got the little pots

359
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:23,480
that I filled up over there and then my

360
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,440
compost one two hook them down into the

361
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,519
compost a little bit and then I'm going

362
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,160
to go water them in if they grow all

363
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,639
good we're good to go and if not then

364
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,279
and will be concerned but I've never had

365
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,240
it happen that that it wasn't good I

366
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,880
just uh I'm sharing best practices with

367
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,000
you and then so this is just like a heat

368
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,639
mat and a grow light right up there and

369
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,440
then we'll check back in a few days and

370
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:50,120
see what they look like all right y'all

371
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,320
so I'm back in the grow room here it's a

372
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,560
few weeks later this is what you want it

373
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,399
to look like and if they like grew kind

374
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:02,399
of distorted or like wonky kind like

375
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,480
misshaped leaves crinkly or like just

376
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,120
stunted and really didn't grow well at

377
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,839
all then you would be concerned so this

378
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,839
is the best test that you can do to test

379
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,600
your compost for herbicide contamination

380
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,920
I'm looking all good so we're going to

381
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,279
go and use this compost or actually we

382
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,720
already did this compost feeds the soil

383
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,480
and acts as a nutrient-rich mulch

384
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,199
keeping my garden beds practically

385
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,680
weed-free All Season yes it's a lot of

386
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:31,440
work to get to this point but the payoff

387
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,920
never weeding or fertilizing your garden

388
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,000
is priceless the compost adds biological

389
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,160
diversity to the soil ecosystem feeding

390
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,680
the beneficial microbes and creating a

391
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,160
thriving environment underground this

392
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,040
method feeds your soil boosts plant

393
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,240
health and keeps weeds in check all

394
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,160
season long and there's no need to worry

395
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,079
about erosion because your soil Is

396
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,360
Anchored In by the cover crops root

397
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:57,519
system holding everything in place the

398
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,720
dead plant material sits on top of the

399
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,160
soil acting as a natural protective

400
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,920
barrier on top of that it's covered with

401
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,120
a thick layer of compost shielding it

402
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,759
from the harsh effects of the sun wind

403
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,040
and rain it's a living system designed

404
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,800
to mimic the forest just like we talked

405
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,480
about earlier using nature as the model

406
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,519
Nature's been growing plants for

407
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,360
millions of years without cardboard

408
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,399
synthetic fertilizers or human

409
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,360
intervention now for the walkways I

410
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,639
usually put down wood chips right away

411
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,480
to suppress weeds and retain moisture

412
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,560
but in this particular plot we left the

413
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,600
cover crop residue as the walkway for

414
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,279
the summer because we direct seated

415
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,759
winter squash here why because winter

416
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,839
squash Vines out and covers the ground

417
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,800
choking out any weeds that might try to

418
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,040
come back there was no need to walk in

419
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,680
the roads no extra maintenance and as

420
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,399
you can see we had a great yield of

421
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,600
winter squash without adding any

422
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,480
additional fertilizer after harvesting

423
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,880
the squash we tarp the plot again to

424
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,680
suppress any leftover weeds added more

425
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,000
compost and filled the walkways with

426
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,639
wood chips now it's ready for garlic and

427
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,800
soon no dig potatoes if this blew your

428
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,600
mind or if you've got questions drop a

429
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,199
comment below I'd love to hear what

430
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,199
you're thinking and what works in your

431
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:10,480
garden thanks for watching grommies

432
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:12,720
remember to always work with nature not

433
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,639
against it and I'll see you in the next

434
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,639
one
