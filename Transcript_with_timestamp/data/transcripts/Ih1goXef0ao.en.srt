00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,480
success in poultry farming is not just

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,360
about feeding chickens it's about

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,279
strategy discipline and

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,199
preparation many farmers struggle not

6
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:21,800
due to lack of resources but due to poor

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,439
planning and reactive

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,039
decisionmaking a strong foundation and

9
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,480
the right mindset set apart thriving

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,719
Farms from failing ones challenging will

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,520
come diseases fluctuating prices

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,039
unpredictable weather but instead of

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,640
blaming bad luck the wise farmer takes

14
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:46,640
control as epic tetus said it's not what

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,680
happens to you but how you react to it

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,239
that

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,520
matters in farming knowledge and

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,800
preparation are your greatest tools in

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,239
the following lessons you will learn how

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,879
to optimize feeding prevent disease and

21
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:05,840
manage your farm with

22
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:07,640
confidence before we begin take a moment

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,759
to assess your

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,479
farm identify one key

25
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,960
challenge keep it in mind as we go

26
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:21,320
through each lesson and take action

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:25,320
master your farm and success will

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,280
follow lesson one the foundation of

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,560
success chicken Coupe and living

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,479
environment a strong Foundation

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,320
determines success whether in farming or

32
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,799
life a well structured Coupe is not just

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,040
a shelter it's the difference between a

34
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,600
thriving flock and endless struggles

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,960
with disease and low

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,119
productivity if your chicken Coupe is

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,119
damp exposed to strong winds or

38
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,560
overcrowded what will happen your

39
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:57,479
chickens will become stressed their

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,200
immune systems will weaken and their

41
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,000
productivity will drop

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,600
this is not a matter of luck it's a

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
direct result of how well you prepare

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,200
their

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,800
environment many farmers make the

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,000
mistake of focusing on feeding medicine

47
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,280
while neglecting the coupe yet the coupe

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,400
is the first line of defense against

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,959
disease and poor growth a poorly

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,800
designed Coupe leads to overcrowding

51
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,879
stress and disease

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,440
outbreaks in contrast a well-planned

53
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:33,440
environment ensures Healthy Growth gr

54
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:37,080
better egg production and fewer

55
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,200
losses focus on three main factors

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,720
ventilation prevents respiratory

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,000
diseases and keeps the air fresh Space

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,400
Management avoids pecking issues and

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,159
stress from

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,840
overcrowding hygiene reduces the risk of

61
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,519
infections by keeping bedding dry and

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,800
clean a farmer who neglects these

63
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,360
elements will spend more on medicine and

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,360
Replacements but the wise farmer like

65
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,000
the stoic takes proactive steps to

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,760
prevent disasters before they

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,720
happen imagine two farmers John and

68
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,480
Mark John believes that chickens can

69
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,920
adapt to anything and builds a flimsy

70
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,560
cramped Coupe within months his chickens

71
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,120
develop diseases and he constantly

72
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,840
struggles with high mortality rates mark

73
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,720
on the other hand applies practical

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,560
wisdom he invests time in designing a

75
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,120
co-op with proper ventilation spacing

76
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:41,200
and hygiene his flock grows strong his

77
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,640
cost remain low and his productivity

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,760
increases while JN blames bad luck Mark

79
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,400
enjoys the rewards of his preparation

80
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,360
now here's your challenge inspect your

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,840
Coupe today ask yourself does it smell

82
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:01,040
bad is there enough airf flow is it too

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,720
crowded are the floors dry

84
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,840
if you find at least one issue commit to

85
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,120
fixing it this week a small Improvement

86
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,519
now will prevent bigger problems

87
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,400
later your success in chicken farming

88
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:21,840
begins with the actions you take

89
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,840
today let's move forward with wisdom and

90
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,520
preparation lesson two mastering

91
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:31,360
nutrition feeding for maximum growth and

92
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,039
health a a well-fed chicken is a

93
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,759
productive chicken nutrition is the key

94
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,080
to strong immune systems rapid growth

95
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,520
and high egg

96
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,160
production many farmers assume that

97
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,800
throwing any grain or leftovers to their

98
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,639
chickens is enough but the truth is a

99
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,080
well-planned diet separates successful

100
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:55,240
Farmers from struggling ones if your

101
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,919
chickens are not gaining weight or

102
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,639
producing enough eggs the problem is

103
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,080
likely in their diet

104
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,840
many farmers waste money on expensive

105
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,280
feeds without understanding what their

106
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,600
chickens truly need others cut costs by

107
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,919
using lowquality food leading to

108
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,759
malnutrition weak immune systems and

109
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,639
higher mortality rates feeding is not

110
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,160
just about filling their stomachs it's

111
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,600
about giving them the right balance of

112
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:31,240
protein vitamins and minerals to

113
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,160
optimize their health health and

114
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,360
productivity the right diet consists of

115
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,680
three key elements protein for muscle

116
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,199
development and egg production

117
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,080
energy-rich grains to maintain body

118
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,600
functions and vitamins and minerals to

119
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,400
strengthen

120
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,880
immunity ignoring any of these will

121
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,520
result in Weak and unproductive

122
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,000
chickens a farmer who understands

123
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,360
nutrition can reduce costs by using

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,039
local ingredients while maintaining High

125
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,960
efficiency meanwhile a farmer who

126
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,240
blindly follows commercial feed

127
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,160
recommendations without knowledge will

128
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:15,280
always struggle with unpredictable

129
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,599
results imagine two farmers Alex and Tom

130
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,919
Alex buys commercial feed without

131
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,360
question believing that more expensive

132
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,639
feed equals better results however he

133
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,120
constantly struggles with inconsistent

134
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:31,840
growth and high costs Tom on the other

135
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,400
hand studies poultry nutrition and

136
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,680
formulates his own feed using corn

137
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,759
soybeans fish meal and natural

138
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,560
supplements his chickens grow faster lay

139
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,280
more eggs and his expenses are

140
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,560
lower while Alex complains about high

141
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,919
feed prices Tom thrives because he

142
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,520
understands his flocks nutritional

143
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,919
needs now here's your challenge review

144
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,599
your feeding plan

145
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,319
today are you Rel rying solely on

146
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:06,199
Commercial feed are your chickens

147
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,840
getting enough protein are you wasting

148
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,599
money on unnecessary

149
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,199
supplements make one small change to

150
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:18,440
improve their diet this week the key to

151
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,360
success is knowledge not blind

152
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,000
spending take control of your nutrition

153
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,639
strategy and you'll see real results in

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,319
your flocks performance and

155
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,879
profitability lesson three

156
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,879
preventing

157
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:38,400
disease The Art of Keeping your flock

158
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:41,080
healthy a healthy flock is a profitable

159
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,919
flock disease prevention is not just

160
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,240
about reacting when chickens get sick

161
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,319
it's about creating a system that keeps

162
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,599
illness away in the first place many

163
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,720
farmers rely too much on

164
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,159
medication but the strongest Farmers

165
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,319
understand that true success comes from

166
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:03,159
prevention not treatment

167
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,720
if you've ever lost chickens to disease

168
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:08,720
you know how devastating it can

169
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,879
be many farmers wait until they see

170
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,159
symptoms before acting but by then the

171
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,440
damage is already done the best defense

172
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:18,479
is a good

173
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,960
offense strong

174
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,039
biocurity proper vaccination and strict

175
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,240
hygiene measures can mean the difference

176
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:30,080
between a thriving farm and one

177
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,399
struggling with constant losses

178
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,880
disease prevention rests on three key

179
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:39,080
pillars biocurity to prevent outside

180
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,200
infections from entering your

181
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,320
farm vaccination to protect against

182
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,600
common poultry diseases and hygiene to

183
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,640
keep living conditions clean and

184
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,839
stressfree a careless farmer who ignores

185
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,040
these principles will face constant

186
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,000
outbreaks high costs and

187
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,720
frustration but a disciplined farmer

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,320
like the stoic takes control by

189
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,800
establishing strict preventative

190
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,440
measures ensuring the health and

191
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,279
stability of their

192
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:17,040
flock consider two farmers David and

193
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:19,120
Eric David doesn't believe in prevention

194

picking breeds based on Trends or

230
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,120
availability rather than their actual

231
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,040
farming

232
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:10,399
goals if your chickens are not growing

238
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,920
another some breeds require more care

239
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,079
While others are Hardy and low

240
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,320
maintenance understanding this can save

241
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,800

Daniel Chris picks a breed because he

257
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,240
saw another farmer succeed with it but

258
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,560
he doesn't consider his different

259
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,680
climate and feeding

260
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:30,560
capacity his chickens grow slowly and

261
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:34,160
require constant medical attention

262
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,760
Daniel however studies different breeds

his production stays high and his farm

267
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,160
prospers while Chris blames bad luck

healthy Birds it's about managing

284
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,639
finances wisely many farmers Focus only

285
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:50,000
on production but fail to track their

286
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,839
expenses leading to financial losses

287
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,199
even when their flocks are

costs and maximize profits is what

290
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,680
separates struggling Farmers from those

291
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,759
who succeed

292
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:08,000
longterm if you find yourself constantly

293
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,120
spending more than expected or

294
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,440
struggling to make a profit the issue is

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,839
financial

297
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,759

298
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:25,000
unnecessary feed medicine or equipment

299
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:26,240
without properly calculating their

300
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,399
return on

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,199
investment a farm that ignores Financial

302
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,279
discipline will always be at risk no

303
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:37,199
matter how good the chickens

304
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:40,720
are effective financial management

305
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,600

306
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:47,639
tracking every expense and setting clear

307
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,959
limits cost control minimizing waste and

00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,440
unnecessary spending and profit

309
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,920
optimization finding ways to increase

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,560
expenses a farmer who blindly spends

312
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,600
without planning will always struggle

313
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,320
while a disciplined farmer like the

314
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,800
stoic treats his farm like a business

315

just feed their Birds they understand

406
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,760
them chickens have natural behaviors

407
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,760
that if properly managed can lead to

408
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,080
Better Health higher productivity and

losses however many farmers Overlook

411
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,280
these behaviors leading to unnecessary

412
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,880

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,520
if your chickens are frequently fighting

415
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,159
laying fewer eggs or seem overly

416
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:10,200

417
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,480
diet or housing it could be how their

422
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,840
psychology is just as important as

425
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:34,760
revolves around three key principles

426
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,280
space ensuring each bird has enough room

427
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,320
to move and establish its place in the

428
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,760
flock social

429
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,240
structure understanding pecking order

430
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,600
and minimizing aggression and

431
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,400
environmental

432
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,960

and stimulation to keep chickens active

434
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,600
and

435
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,799
healthy farmers who ignore these

436
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,600
elements will constantly struggle with

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,919
struggle however successful farmers do

532
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,360
not fear adversity they prepare for it

533
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:42,679
and learn to

534
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:44,799
adapt the key to long-term success is

alone many farmers give up too soon

539
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,640
because they expect things to always go

540
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:01,360
smoothly the truth is farming is UN

541
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,760
predictable and those who succeed are

542
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,200
the ones who build strategies to handle

543
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,360
problems before they

544
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,000

on new challenges and market conditions

551
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,640
and long-term thinking investing in

552
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,360
sustainable practices rather than
