00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,040
today i'm going to demonstrate a simple

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,040
way to plug the end of a header pipe

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,760
plug in the end of a lay flat header

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,280
pipe is quick easy and necessary for the

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,120
irrigation setup

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,280
there are various sizes of late flat

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,199
header pipe to choose from for this

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,520
reason be sure to double check that your

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,320
connector fitting and plug are the same

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,240
diameter as the pipe you are using we

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,640
are using a two inch pipe and two inch

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,279
fittings sometimes it is possible to

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,359
find a one piece plug but we have found

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,200
them hard to find locally so in this

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,760
video we are using a couple different

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,840
fittings to make a plug

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,160
we wrap teflon tape around the white

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,079
threaded cap screwed it into the gray

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,440
bar fitting and tighten it with a pipe

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
wrench

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,840
once you have the cap ready place the

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,079
clamp on the lathe pipe

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,160
next put the barb cap inside the end of

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,480
the pipe this part can be a little

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,879
tricky so gently twist and push the

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,800
connector in until the pipe is snug

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,879
against the connector fitting

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,680
another option is to put a full grade

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,360
lubricant like vaseline or vegetable oil

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,159
on the outside of the connector so it

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,320
slides on the pipe more easily

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,560
push the clamp to the top of the fitting

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,400
and using a flat head screwdriver

34
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,159
tighten the clamp now you are ready to

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,159
attach the drip tape to the header pipe

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,040
