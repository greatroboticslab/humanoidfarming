  "text": "um hello guys uh i'm back again uh dylan and uh today uh i'm gonna be showing you my refined forming system uh this is much simpler it uses normal pistons instead of sticky pistons the layout is a lot simpler not as complex i even made it underground and the redstone isn't as complicated so first i'm going to show you the floodgates the floodgates are normal pistons that are activated to hold the water back a single source block of water and they're hooked up to a single red stone trail by this lever basically the lever hits off the first repeater and then splits off to the first piston and then it comes up hits another repeater and goes all the way to the other piston around that corner now to show you it how it works also i made it uh three wide rather than two so you can get more wheat uh you can get 90 uh fit 90 wheat on here 90 wheat 90 plants on here whatever you want to call it i don't know what you want to call it but basically when you turn this off uh floodgates open and you can walk along here to collect the items rather than walking in the water and um basically that's it uh you could also use this for mushroom farms uh you know whatever you want so i hope that was helpful and um goodbye",
