  "text": "guys what's going on today we are going to talk about five different tread patterns for tractor tires this is a good variety here of different patterns we're going to tell you all about what you would use them for what the patterns are called price points where to get them construction all that kind of thing so stick around oh yeah and if you haven't done so yet hit that subscribe button right underneath the video make sure you read through the description it's right down there as well you're going to have links to where you can buy all these tires at get discount codes all sorts of good stuff for you tractor owners out there and don't forget to check out the other videos on my channel you might like them let's go ahead and get the terminology out of the way let you know what these tires are called here because that'll help you'll see these terms used all over the internet if you're tractor shopping or in forums or different websites that kind of thing so right here you have the r1 ag style tire agricultural style tire you can see it's a v-shaped bar pattern here there's going to be different variations of it but the general tread pattern is going to be what you see here kind of a v that goes back very similar to what you see on all the old style and current style but farming machinery okay what's out there in the fields doing the work that kind of thing it's a very traditional style of tread pattern and it's been around virtually as long as tractors have been around well at least with rubber tires on them maybe maybe steel tires too this one here is an r4 industrial style of tread pattern okay so it's going to be a thicker bar it does share some resemblance over here with the r1 but it's going to be a thicker flatter wider bar all right and so we'll get into what the applications are in the differences in a little bit but that's going to be the difference that you see here again there's multiple variations of this depending on the tire manufacturer and maybe there's little hybrids or you know specific applications that would require something that's a little bit of a different machine or even in the construction world too but r4 industrial this one here is called an r3 tire all right so it's a turf tire there's going to be a lot of variations of these as well you're going to have golf course tires flotation tires but turf as you might expect is going to be great for your lawns you'll see these on a lot of garden tractors as well or lawn mowers that kind of thing but turf tire right here r3 next up this one right here is going to be called the hdap it doesn't really have an r uh delineation that i know of but hdap stands for heavy duty all-purpose tire you can kind of see here it's a bit of a hybrid if you look across here a stab tire and the next one actually on my tractor over here this is going to be the carlisle versaturf again it doesn't really have an r delineation on there but as a name might suggest turf you're going to see it does share some similarities with this style of tire right here as well so the big hitter is going to be the application what these excel and what they do bad and that kind of thing but let's get to pricing first we can get that out of the way of course these are all the same size tire here they're a 26 12 12 made for the sub compacts made for large garden tractors like the john deere x700 series your kubota bx the list kind of goes on it's a very popular size here for a lot of machines so if we're talking the same size tire which this is a really good example here same price same price same price in price more money okay so you're going to have all your traditional styles and you're going to have a more advanced style the versa turf over here being the more money all right and we're going to get into that as well however i have links for all of these where you can buy these tires whether it's on amazon if you want tires and wheels miller tire as well is a great company links below to where you can get more information on there get discounts as well but if you're looking for a tire in this size links are down there okay so now let's figure out why this tire over here the versa turf is going to cost more than all these other tires right here it's still a bunch of rubber right it doesn't look like there's more material there's really not anything super special about it if you're just looking at it right the difference is going to be underneath the construction of it these are going to be bias right here one two three four these are all bias construction which is a an old school way of doing it okay or a cheaper way of doing it as well and this is going to be a newer technology it's going to be a radial design which michelin i think kind of came up with a long time ago but this is going to be fairly new to the tractor world are the radial tires so you're going to see those that terminology thrown around a lot in trailer tires and vehicle tires that kind of thing but in the tractor world it's fairly new so if we take a look here at the general construction of these tires you're going to have a radial tire here the versaturf versus a bias tire so a bias tire has strands the elements that make this up are going to go all the way from the bead on one side all the way around to the bead on the other side they may come across at a diagonal 30 degree 45 degrees somewhere in that ballpark but over here on the radial you're going to have different strands different elements that make this up and so your contact surface that's up here is going to have a completely separate existence from what's over on the side walls and what that means is that when you hit bumps and you go up and down and the tire absorbs load and then flexes and reshapes you're going to have more contact surface with the radial tire because this is all one piece so as it kind of ebbs and flows and it's almost like a balloon you're going to lose contact surface it's going to increase you're going to have a bumpier ride you're going to lose traction at uh at different moments as well over here on the radial you're going to have more of a little bit of a cushion or a shock absorption so it's going to be a more comfortable ride with a radial tire but it's also going to maintain better contact with the ground which is great for traction is great for getting power to the ground and it's going to just perform better in those kinds of scenarios so some of the benefits that come along with that additional cost are going to be a more comfortable ride because it will absorb those shocks as you go over it you're going to have better traction more power to the ground because of that additional traction and then longer tread life as well let's go ahead and rank these bad boys on a scale from one to five from best to worst i'm going to put the information below let's cover lawns let's cover paved surfaces let's cover snow and ice and let's cover dirt and mud all right first thing really quick i want to touch on these versatiles here if you have a larger tractor such as a 2 series 3 series 4 series that kind of thing there or equivalent kubota mahindra whatever it doesn't matter just a larger tractor besides the subcompact right now you can't get the versaturf however there are a couple others that are out there i just had them put on my 4066r it's going to be the goodyear r14 okay it's going to be a radial tire again it's going to be very similar you're going to see a lot of similarities to this tire pattern right here i just put them on i just took my r4s off the other one you're going to see out there is going to be called a galaxy pro r3 plus i believe it's called okay so it's going to be an r3 which is this tread pattern here but plus so a little bit on steroids again and it's galaxies take basically on a radial like this as well so radial construction a bit of a hybrid there just another option out there for you to consider so you may have a hard time remembering all this so i will put a reference down below in the description of the video too let's go ahead and start out with lawn now if you think of a lawn application you want something to be gentle right you don't want anything aggressive on there so it's not going to be too hard to imagine that the turf tire here the r3 is gonna be number one in my book now a very close second or third you know it's almost a tie for second place but i'm gonna give it to the to the radial here the uh the versaturf radial here followed up by the hdap then we're gonna go r4 and then we're gonna go r1 now a few notes here the r1 is going to be bad on your lawn if you enjoy a nice lawn if you have a nice lawn if you don't want it to get ripped up do not get an r1 tire and think that you're going to be just mowing your lawn and everything's going to be hunky-dory this here is designed for traction it is not designed to be gentle on the lawn you're going to have rust you're going to have ripped up areas when you're turning all that kind of stuff the r4 is probably the most popular tire out there right now for both subcompacts and compacts it's going to be just fine for mowing lawns anything that you drive on your lawn if it's going to be wet and soggy and damp any of these tires here will cause damage okay it doesn't really matter how light or heavy your machine is just don't drive on it when it's wet and soggy so these two right here will both give you a little bit of a problem if you are doing circles around trees in the same spot over and over they're a little bit more aggressive right just a little bit not too much more than this but that's why i'm giving this a nod and these are second and third okay next up let's talk about snow and ice what is the best tread pattern here for those conditions can you guess what it is the best tread pattern far and away the reason i ended up putting them on my 4066r for this year as well is gonna be this versaturf style of tire right here again on the larger four r series tractors i end up going with a goodyear r14 but basically the same very similar tread pattern to that a radial construction as well i'm telling you these were amazing just amazing in the in the winter for the snow and the ice around here last year you know these tires right here not so much all right so let's go ahead and rank these really quick but we're going to go one two three four and then five these are the absolute worst right here the r4 tires they're just terrible i've gotten stuck on the side of my driveway before have been able to not make it up hills but you're going to kind of see a little bit of a similarity amongst these three right so quite similar in their tread design turfs believe it or not are quite good and i would take them any day over the r4 tires in fact i would take even the r1 eggs over here these are going to be okay not super great um but they're not going to be bad the r1s so before the versaturfs were around i ran hdap tires on my john deere x7 series tractors absolutely loved them i long wondered why they didn't offer these from the factory for the john deere 1 series the kubota bx that kind of thing because i think it's such a versatile tread pattern so i'm really thrilled they came out with this versatiff tire i give it the edge over the hdac because it is that radial construction as well one of the biggest problems people have when they're in snow whether they're pushing it whether they're driving through it whether they're plowing it whatever they're doing is traction that is your engine your tractor your machine it's got enough power to do the job all right you might have the right tool in front to do the job the weak link is most often that traction that point of contact to the ground so tires and that kind of application are absolutely critical and while of course traction is important in all applications i feel like in snow and ice it's really really put to the test and it separates the really good ones from the really bad ones let's go ahead and talk about pavement here really quick i want to include this pavement being you know whether it's asphalt you know concrete you know if you're in your shop if you're on your driveway if you're in a big going down the road if your main purpose is going to be traveling on a road a lot or on a hard surface that's where it's going to kind of live that's what this is really meant for so this is going to be number five right here your r1 ag tire this will be the absolute worst for those paved surfaces for the roads for concrete that kind of thing really beyond that i'm going to go ahead and shuffle these three right here in the middle no particular order and then i'm going to give the radial here the edge for the absolute best tire that you can get for paved surfaces the reason the r1 here is really bad is not that it doesn't have traction doesn't grip that kind of thing but it is a little bit bumpy of a ride just based on the construction of it and it's also going to wear very very quickly on those paved surfaces it's just it's a very aggressive tire and when you're turning and twisting and turn and just moving around on paved surfaces a lot it's going to wear super quickly and wear these out and it's just not going to be very practical you get into the r4s these are going to be great same thing with the turf same thing with the hdap on your paved surfaces going to maintain really good traction they're going to wear very well you're not going to wear through them quickly they're going to last a very long time the reason i give the radial over here the edge is because of the fact that again it's a radial alright so you're going to have a more comfortable ride when you're on those hard surfaces there where if you do come across bumps you know dips in the road whatever the case is that you run into it's going to take some of that shock out of there maintain better traction across your whole operating experience okay so dirt and mud they kind of go hand in hand they kind of don't you know whether it's dry whether it's a wet soupy mess we're going to go ahead and break this down best to worst the best tire that you can get for dirt for mud are going to be the r1 ag style of tread pattern here they are just an absolute beast that's just what they were made to thrive in you think about again go back to farming you know you see the tractor out in the field they're planting all the corn harvesting the corn whatever it might be they're going to have this style right on there because you never know what the conditions are going to be but you know it's going to be mud it's going to be dirt let's go ahead and rank these really quick you're going to have the r1 being the best the versaturf being the second best the hdap being the third best r4 fourth best and then unfortunately your traditional turf tire is going to follow up last now this is a little bit different but i did have a skid steer recently with these tires you got to check out that video i got it buried in mud out of my hunting lease it was quite humorous there but these tires right here they just they just have a lot of limitations okay now keep in mind a skid steer is a very very heavy piece of equipment it'll sink like a rock and that's exactly what it did you know these versaturfs over here had the self-cleaning cleats on here again similar to the goodyear r14 or the galaxy pro they're going to have just a good hybrid setup on there the h-steps again have a lot of areas for grip they're not going to clean out as well as this versaturf is over here i just am not a huge fan of the r4s it's unfortunate they're on so many tractors in the subcompact and compact world but of course you wouldn't expect a turf tire like this to perform very well in dirt or mud now on dry hard dirt if you're just going into the woods down the trail it's going to be just fine all right but if we're getting into those muddy situations this is where it's really going to fill up fast the cleats are they're not going to clean out and you're just going to be sitting there spinning your wheels so a good question that you might ask yourself is why is the r4 tread pattern so extremely popular okay and i think it's a combination of reasons right because tractors are used in a lot of different applications you might use it for mowing your lawn you might use it for push and snow you might use it in the woods you know all the above on paved surfaces so the r4 is really the all-purpose tire in my opinion yes this is heavy duty all-purpose hd ap that's what it stands for but it's not really viewed as a tractor or a heavy equipment tire so you get folks that see this tire this is what they expect to be on a tractor anymore it's become so popular in the last 15 years or so that probably 80 or more of the tractors out there are rocking an r4 tread pattern but they really don't excel at a whole lot except for not failing at most things you know they're gonna give you really good uh where life you know you can go hundreds if not thousands of hours front tires are always gonna wear quicker than back tires are you know you're turning you're putting more load with a loader that kind of thing on there they're just gonna wear out they're smaller you know just everything but the rear tires especially you can go a thousand maybe even more than that depending on the applications that you're using it for but i want you guys to see this from a different perspective here that you don't have to be stuck with the tires that come on your machine all right you have the ability to change them out to keep a second set of wheels and tires on hand too so if you have a spring and summer setup and a fall and winter setup or you have a month worth of projects that you want to do in the woods so you want to put a more aggressive tire on there and then switch back to a different tread pattern for the rest of the year you can really mix that up just don't stranglehold yourself and think you have to stick with just the tires that are on your machine right now and now i know that does come as a cost but it's something to kind of plan for right when you look at a machine you shouldn't only be thinking well i get the tractor and then that's it tractors are just the the basic tool all right you can outfit them in so many different ways on the back end on the front end and of course even the wheels and tires well you got to take a good look there side by side by side by side by side i think that's it of all the different tread patterns that are out there it certainly doesn't encompass everything that's on the market but it's a pretty good variety and it kind of gives you a little bit more insight hopefully on where each style of tread pattern will excel i'd be very curious very interested and i think the other viewers would as well if you would leave a comment below with your own experience of these tires i know we all have different experiences this is just my two cents on the situation i've used all these tires in different situations applications over the years so it's kind of my own take on it i get a lot of tractors in here hundreds of tractors in here with different tread patterns on them as well so i can see kind of how they last over time too just gives me a really unique perspective to be able to share that information with you if you haven't done so yet hit that subscribe button right underneath the video make sure you read through that description as well okay links to where you can get all these tires and other really cool tractor products and check out the other videos on my channel until next time stay safe we'll see you soon now really quickly if you are interested in getting more of that lateral that side to side stability one of the options you can look into on the 26 12 12 so the tires that are this size all of them that we're seeing in this video here are going to be a wheel adapter for dual wheels where you can fit it right inside there just like this take a look okay it comes with all the hardware you need where you'll just bolt it right through long bolts right through that one right to your other tire here and get a lot of additional stability there side to side you can use a dual wheel adapter just like this to get a lot more stability on hills okay side to side can be very dangerous can be very concerning for a lot of folks out there so whether it's wheel spacers dual wheels you know there is a potential there to shorten the lifespan of the rear axle of your machine but really that's a decision that you need to make as the operator right if you're going to choose safety if you have really dangerous situations there where you need to accomplish your work you can either add spacers or you can add dual wheels get that safety measure there and just take the risk use common sense regardless if you want to get this dual wheel adapter kit you can do so at millertire.com link below you get five percent off with discount code gwt",
