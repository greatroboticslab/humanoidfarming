00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,790
Kesava peels are byproducts of cassava

2
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:14,879
processing recognized as a potential

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,520
feed resource but wasted constituting a

4
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:20,130
major environmental nuisance within and

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,000
around processing centers due to drying

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,070
constraints traditionally drying is done

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,530
on bare floor over a period of two to

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,170
three days in the dry season to get a

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,730
marketable product peels dried in this

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,160
manner are not marketed at their

11
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,649
potential prices due to quality concerns

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,309
relating to contamination by aflatoxins

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:44,460
as well as poor storability due to

14
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,739
improper drying as a result farmers and

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,839
the feed industry do not have access to

16
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:55,609
processed peels of desired quality in

17
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:58,170
sufficient quantities in 2015 CGIAR

18
00:00:55,609 --> 00:01:00,659
scientists working in its research

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,209
programs on roots tubers and bananas

20
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:05,460
humid tropics and livestock and fish

21
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:07,890
developed an innovative processing

22
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,670
method that reduces drying time to six

23
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,009
to eight hours

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,020
yielding high-quality products that

25
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:16,049
could be used to feed ruminants and mono

26
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,539
gastrics there is every indication that

27
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,250
processed peels of high quality are in

28
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:23,159
great demand from the feed industry as

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,590
such this provides an opportunity to

30
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,020
mitigate feed scarcity while cassava

31
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,200
peel processors who adopt the innovation

32
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,270
are able to generate additional income

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,159
there is thus a potential to convert

34
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,500
millions of tons of an environmental

35
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,840
problem into a valuable resource for

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,359
food production and in doing so also

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,399
create a new industry that offers new

38
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,810
income and employment to participants in

39
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,729
cassava processing 80% of whom are women

40
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:53,030
this video explains how to achieve the

41
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,039
best results from this innovation

42
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:59,100
cassava peels use for processing should

43
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:01,439
be free from contamination stumps large

44
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,299
woody tubers soil and other foreign

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,969
materials must be removed from peels

46
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,869
before grating to protect the rasp ER

47
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,550
from damage

48
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:12,530
fresh cassava peels should always be

49
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,050
used as stored peels begin to ferment

50
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:17,510
and become soggy and slippery which

51
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,880
makes them difficult to grate once

52
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,190
sorted the peels are grated to reduce

53
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:28,400
the particle size to facilitate deep

54
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:30,590
watering and drying peels are harder to

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,480
grate than tubers so they have to be

56
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:44,030
grated three times to achieve the

57
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:46,670
desired size grated peels must then be

58
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:50,090
packed in plastic woven bags in small

59
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,190
quantities of 8 to 12 kilograms the bags

60
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,290
are then folded halfway and neatly

61
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,019
stacked one above the other in a metal

62
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,640
frame for pressing a desirable stacking

63
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:02,030
height leaves sufficient room for

64
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,280
inserting a hydraulic jack wooden planks

65
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,260
which ensure the uniform distribution of

66
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,860
pressure are used to separate the

67
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,000
stacked bags and the hydraulic jack

68
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,730
application of pressure through the jack

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,040
results in rapid water loss dewatering

70
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,959
results in water loss of almost 50

71
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,989
percent by weight of the starting

72
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,989
material

73
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:25,770
press bags are then allowed to stand

74
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,050
overnight to ferment the result is an

75
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,960
intermediate product the cassava peel

76
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:36,870
cake with a 38 to 42 percent moisture

77
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:39,960
content wet cassava peeled cake can be

78
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,540
fed as is to cattle sheep goats and pigs

79
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,520
it can be stored for seven days without

80
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,980
spoiling and thus could be transported

81
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:52,130
and marketed over long distances within

82
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:54,390
that period to produce dried mash

83
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:56,670
intermediate cassava peel cake is

84
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,070
loosened by grating to improve the

85
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,240
granularity of the material and improve

86
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,240
its flow through a sieve

87
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:13,140
sealing separates the loosened cake into

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,269
a fine fraction lower in fiber higher

89
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,549
and energy content from a coarse

90
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:20,130
fraction higher and fibre lower in

91
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:28,320
energy content resulting in fine and

92
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:31,080
coarse mash process mash is then dried

93
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,300
six to eight hours by spreading on

94
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,669
commonly available surfaces for example

95
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,780
concrete slabs and plastic or metal

96
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:42,560
sheeting on rainy days the saved

97
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:45,810
material can be toasted in a metal pan

98
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,729
once dried or toasted the material

99
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,250
should be between 10 to 12 percent

100
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:51,840
moisture and can be bagged and stored

101
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,139
for a period of four to six months

102
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:59,789
without any spoilage flash drying is

103
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:01,440
also an option in the industrial case it

104
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:03,600
is important to remember that all

105
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,330
machines and processing areas must be

106
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,800
kept clean hygienic conditions are

107
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,660
imperative to prevent fungal

108
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,660
contamination and ensure quality

109
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,910
three major high-quality cassava peeled

110
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,640
products are created by this process wet

111
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,800
cassava cake for cattle sheep goat and

112
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,100
pig feed that has a shelf life of one

113
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,730
week dried fine mash which is suitable

114
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:32,430
for poultry pigs and fish dried coarse

115
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:35,760
mash also for cattle sheep goats and

116
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,310
pigs the dried high-quality cassava peel

117
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:43,800
mash products have a long shelf life of

118
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:45,570
between four and six months processors

119
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,610
can choose an appropriate drying option

120
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,870
depending on weather conditions and the

121
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,870
facilities available to them
