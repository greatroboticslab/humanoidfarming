  "text": "if a plant has enough water minerals and energy it will grow right well sort of but there is more to it like why do plants bend towards the light and not just grow straight and why is it that the stem grows up but the roots grow down it isn't as if the plant has eyes to tell it where the sun is you should already know about tropisms so phototropism and geotropism but if you have forgotten watch our video called plant hormones tropisms first but how does it actually do this having been made in the tips of the stems and roots auxin is moved in solution by diffusion to older parts of the plant in the stem the auxin causes the cells to change in elasticity more elastic cells absorb more water and can grow longer strangely though stems and roots respond differently to high concentrations of auxin whilst the stem cells grow more the root cells actually grow less so auxins make plants grow but why do they bend towards the light how do they know to do this when they don't have eyes the bending happens because the light hits on one side more and breaks down the auxins on that side of the stem so then growth slows down on the light side the faster growth on the dark side causes the shoots and leaves to turn towards the light which is ideal for the plant for photosynthesis auxin is produced in the tips of growing shoots if the tips are cut off then no auxin can be produced and so no plant growth if the tips are covered whilst auxin is still produced light cannot break it down and so phototropism cannot occur the plant just grows straight up and does not bend towards the light pretty straightforward so far now let's switch it up a bit auxins have the opposite effect on root cells in roots auxins cause less growth the shaded side of roots contain more auxin and so they grow less this enables the light side of the roots to grow more and bend away from the light and if that wasn't weird enough we have the opposite happening with auxins to gravity too in a horizontal route the bottom side contains more auxin and grows less so the root bends downwards in the direction of gravity so positive geotropism but of course the stem responds differently in a horizontal stem again the bottom side contains more auxins because it is less directly hit by sunlight but because auxins cause growth in stems the bottom side grows more causing the stem to bend upwards against the direction of gravity so negative geotropism but i'm giving auxins too much credit they don't work alone they have a partner in crime cytokinins you don't need to know anything about these hormones other than the fact that they work alongside auxins there is another plant hormone however that you do need to be aware of gibberellins once the seed germinates the roots and shoots start to grow but for this the seed needs energy luckily the seed releases a hormone called gibberellin which causes the starch in the seed to turn into sugars and provides the seed with energy to grow as well as causing shoot growth gibberillins can also stimulate flowering and the production of fruit in some plants and they also work with auxins to cause stem elongation so now we know all about how plant hormones work have a think about how they could be used we will discover some uses in our video on how we use plant hormones",
