  "text": "[Music] agriculture is the most fundamental and ancient activity that propelled human civilization as we know it today before agriculture yeah there were people there were modern humans but they formed groups of hunters and gatherers and they didn't build cities they didn't build empires so agriculture is perceived by many as a very conservative activity however it has been over the time characterized by a rate of innovation that was necessary in order to be able to feed the populations and of course the rate of population was statistically speaking exactly equal with the amount of calories that agriculture could produce at a given time because if you had more people and not enough calories there would be starvation and death this kind of cycle of overshooting population that will then go back to the sustainable level has characterized human civilization for thousands of years tens of thousands of years and it was invisible to most unless they were the one starving now we have a globally interconnected world and we know when there is a food crisis somewhere and hopefully we intervene we help we prevent famine and starvation to kill people actually agriculture now is powerful enough in its ability to create the output edible calories that when there is famine it is not due to lack of food it is due to insufficient logistics or active prevention of the population being fed by civil war and conflict or corruption however the way that agriculture arrived to the point where it is today must change the impact of agriculture on the environment must be ameliorated must be enlightened the pressure that humanity puts on the environment is not compatible with our future i uh was lucky to participate in the opening meeting of a new think tank the think tank farm to fork that was born to catalyze the rate of innovation and the rate of technology adoption in agriculture especially following the european union a common agriculture policy that is being put in place in highlighting sustainability and highlighting biodiversity and actually very explicitly putting in place incentives and objectives to reach this in the way that every kind of activity in agriculture and food production is going to be influenced by it over the course of the next five years the policies that the european union puts in place matter worldwide because of how big a market it uh represents both in terms of how it produces food to be consumed inside or for export or its import of food from from outside and the size of the market also makes it so that the producers of technologies and components in europe or outside of the europe that serve the european market are um able to to leverage that size in order to achieve uh both their financial goals as well as to be able to develop new products new services that otherwise wouldn't be available so just a few examples of the things that that we are seeing that are not only on the horizon but are already in agricultural practice today the ability to plow at a depth that is much shallower than before in order not to disturb uh and not to diminish the fertility of the field the simultaneous laying of tubes underground at a depth that is deeper than than the plowing depth uh in order to irrigate the field uh with the right quantities of water enriched with the kind of nutrients that the particular plant needs exactly where it is needed because of both satellite-based and drone-based monitoring of plant growth through data analysis and integration based on multi-spectral imaging the opportunity is really enormous already the existing practices can improve farm productivity double digits 10 20 and more while um diminishing drastically uh the use of water uh the um uh weight uh the pressure of food production on the fertility of terrain and of course um quite substantially diminishing also the use of chemicals that that are the traditional fertilizers or pesticides which contributed importantly in our ability to increase the level of food production we have today but where uh they are now being labeled or recognized as uh undesirable uh beyond a certain necessary level the next stages of agricultural revolution again will come from technology imagine vertical farming that can be above ground or below ground that is proportional to the volume of uh the uh farm rather than the area of the field available the availability of plant-based meat substitutes that are being adopted and appreciated by consumers already or actually a cultivated meat of animal origin obtained by cell cultures rather than growing an entire traditional animal these are just two examples uh but also advanced techniques like uh crispr in our ability to intervene and improve the basic crops and and the basic ingredients of our food chain there are uh obstacles uh for example in italy today you cannot apply uh pesticides via drones uh which practice would be able to diminish the quality put out quite radically because flying a drone even if applied small camp quantity is very precisely because it flies a meter or two meters above ground is equated to blasting the crops with traditional spraying from planes and that is prohibited and as a consequence the use of drones is also prohibited or other examples where the regulations are not um aligning the incentives in actually delivering the desired outcome large quantities of healthy food in great variety with as little environmental pressure as possible across not only europe but the world and then of course the most radical of food production practices are going to be on the moon and the mars and the asteroid belt environments where well you cannot grow corn or feed a cow with the corn that you grew you cannot waste water you cannot have almost any of the things that we are accustomed to have on earth the total not only radical but total sustainability practices that moon colonies and mars colonies are going to have will be not only advanced but very valuable and earth agriculture is going to be profoundly influenced by those practices that mars will be happy to sell to earth and consult and advise on their implementation in the best possible way the agricultural sector uh something that i am not very familiar with uh except eating food and for me it was a pleasure to start this collaboration with the think tank farm to fork and i am looking forward to the next meeting i am looking forward to interact both with the providers of these exciting interesting existing already being deployed agricultural technologies as well as uh with the the farmers that are the heart and and really the the passion that they put in uh their work of uh what they produce and we eat thank you very much and see you in the next episode of the context [Music]",
