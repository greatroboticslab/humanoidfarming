1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,120
the snow pusher or the snow plow which

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,960
one's better

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,560
which one do you need guys how we doing

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,160
welcome to good works tractors today

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,120
we're talking about a topic that is

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,639
something i'm asked

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,559
all the time especially this time of

8
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,160
year the snow pusher versus the snow

9
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,120
plow let's go over those strengths and

10
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,160
weaknesses yes

11
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,080
each of them have strengths and

12
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,439
weaknesses we'll give you price points

13
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,880
what they're good for construction

14
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,400
design all that good stuff

15
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,920
if you'd be so kind i'd love to get a

16
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,439
thumbs up from you and if you haven't

this one here if you're in the market

21
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
for a tractor an attachment an accessory

22
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,640
or maybe a whole package

23
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,000
check out that description below all

24
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,920
sorts of helpful links down there or

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,840
head on over to goodworkstractors.com

26
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,760
let's get to it let's talk about price

27
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,200
for a minute here in most situations

28
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,200
the snow pusher is going to end up being

29
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,120
a little bit cheaper than a snow plow

30
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,039
however that can vary and i do actually

31
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,440
have a very price competitive snow plow

32
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,079
here

33
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,079
from tar river it's available in 60 72

34
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,079
84 and 96 inch sizes

35
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,600
or widths there for compact tractors

36
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,640
this one that you see here on a kubota

37
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,800
l6060

38
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,399
is gonna be an 84 inch variant you can

39
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,760
also get a 96 inch for this machine

40
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,519
that'll be a good fit for it as well

41
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,920
over here on the 4066r you're going to

42
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,320
see an hla 2500 series

43
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,560
72 inch wide snow pusher some options to

44
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,920
consider that will affect pricing

45
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,759
on the snow pusher there's not going to

46
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,960
be any hydraulic options so nothing to

47
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,880
worry about there

48
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,560
on a snow plow however you can get that

49
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,560
set up with a manual angle

50
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,320
or an optional hydraulic angle for an

51
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,759
additional cost that is also going to

52
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,439
require additional hydraulic

53
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,400
capabilities on your tractor as well so

54
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,000
keep that in mind

55
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,680
the cost can really start to add up if

56
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
your tractor isn't already equipped with

57
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,799
those additional hydraulics

58
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,000
on a snow pusher some considerations to

59
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,520
take into mind are going to be something

60
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,439
like a back drag right here you can get

61
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,040
it with or without the back drag

62
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,360
and if you're going to get a back drag

63
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,200
you can add on a replaceable edge if you

64
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,520
want to make it a replaceable steel

65
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,640
rubber uhmw you have a lot of options

66
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,960
there to consider but

67
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,240
keep that in mind with or without and

68
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,360
then your edges as well are going to

69
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,680
drive the cost

70
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,399
now i love these tar river snow plows

71
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,399
they are

72
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,399
well built i did a comparison last year

73
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,159
comparing a tar river snow plow versus

74
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,719
the frontier snow plow for example

75
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,240
and the amount of steel that is in the

76
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,680
structure back here that's behind the

77
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,679
actual pushing blade itself

78
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,280
is just incredible there's way more

79
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,319
material here than what's on a lot of

80
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,560
other snow plows

81
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,920
and when you're plowing along you want

82
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
to have the weight to get the momentum

83
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,319
going

84
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
and you also want to have that rigidity

85
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,360
that structure there that strength

86
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,040
to allow you to go through whatever you

87
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,160
need to do to get the job done if we

88
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,640
take a closer look right here you're

89
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,959
going to see

90
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,800
two beefy trip springs one on either

91
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,720
side here that are just very substantial

92
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,640
in case you do hit a lip or an edge

93
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,480
and you need to have that release right

94
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,760
there that's what that's going to be for

95
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,680
you'll also see you have a skid shoe

96
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,440
down here with shims that are adjustable

97
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,040
one on the other side as well you're

98
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,560
also going to have mounts one right here

99
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,319
and one tucked underneath here to add on

100
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,599
a hydraulic cylinder if you want to

101
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,680
it comes standard in the piece of

102
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,120
equipment now i love these hla snow

103
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,040
pushers as well for a lot of reasons

104
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,480
i've gone into a lot of depth about it

105
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,599
they really stand apart from what else

106
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,360
is on the market today

107
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,200
including the huge background that's on

108
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,040
here this big black piece of steel right

109
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,920
here actually entirely closes off the

110
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,080
top of the

111
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,760
snow pusher on the smaller models once

112
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,360
you get to a 2500 series

113
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,360
you're still going to have roughly a 13

114
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,640
inch piece of steel right here that is

115
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,159
way more substantial than the

116
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,440
competition which is typically a three

117
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,360
or four inch piece of steel

118
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,680
to grab and accumulate all that snow in

119
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,519
there on the inside you're going to see

120
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,040
there's no cross braces in here at all

121
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,000
you have a double panel sidewall

122
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,720
construction

123
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,879
that also welds right into a radius back

124
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,879
on here so that radius back helps

125
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,560
propel the snow forward keep it rolling

126
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,560
forward so it doesn't stick there

127
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,080
nothing wants to get trapped more of the

128
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,879
snow is going to be released with this

129
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,480
design

130
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,239
some other great features included are

131
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,599
going to be adjustable skid shoes so you

132
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,360
can adjust them up and down if you want

133
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,760
to get just above that plowing surface

134
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,159
and not

135
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,400
scrape your gravel off the driveway you

136
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,000
can also add on a replaceable cutting

137
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,760
edge if you want to to the back

138
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,760
drag and of course the frame that

139
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,519
attaches to your tractor whether it's a

140
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,959
john deere quick attach it could be a

141
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,599
skid steer quick attach it could be a

142
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,519
global

143
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,280
we can even get custom mounts if you

144
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,879
even have a pinned on bucket all of

145
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
those frames are going to be bolted onto

146
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,680
the back of the snow pusher that way

147
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,280
if you end up with a different piece of

148
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,040
equipment down the road you don't have

149
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,439
to buy an entirely new snow pusher

150
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,280
just get a new frame bolt it up and away

151
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,080
you go so let's talk about requirements

152
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,760
what's needed

153
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,360
for you besides having the piece of

154
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,280
equipment here whether it's the plow

155
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
or the pusher well with a snow pusher it

156
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,560
really doesn't get any

157
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
easier because all you have to do is

158
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,400
hook it up take your bucket off all

159
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,919
right

160
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,080
take your bucket off or your forks or

161
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,600
your grapple connect

162
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,000
to the front end of your loader the snow

163
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,000
pusher and away you go over here

164
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,680
on the snow plow you do the same thing

165
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,360
all right if you have a manual angle

166
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,479
take your bucket off your forks all you

167
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,520
do is hook it up if you're going to have

168
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,280
a manual angle

169
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,520
again at that point you are going to

170
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,280
have to hop off the tractor anytime you

171
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,720
want to adjust the angle this way

172
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,720
adjust it that way you got to pull a

173
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,320
couple pins out you know rotate it

174
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,960
around put the pins back in and lock it

175
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,400
in place

176
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,160
however if you do have the optional

177
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,759
hydraulic angling kit that you can

178
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,520
add onto this system right here you can

179
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,240
plug it in if you have the hydraulics on

180
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
your tractor

181
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,800
and then you can operate everything

182
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
right up there from your operator

183
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,759
station

184
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,840
for me though i love simplicity and that

185
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,880
ranks really high on my priority list

186
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,520
and so that's where i

187
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,440
really appreciate the simplicity of the

188
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,000
hla snow pusher or snow pushers in

189
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,600
general

190
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,440
there's nothing else to worry about no

191
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,160
angling anything no hydraulics no

192
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,400
electric

193
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,840
you just put it on there and away you go

194
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,800
let's talk about how this equipment

195
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,440
carries the load

196
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,280
so over on a snow pusher as you're

197
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,960
collecting and accumulating snow

198
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,720
it's basically doing it in an even

199
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,880
amount you know dispersing it all

200
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,000
throughout here and capturing it

201
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,440
you know wherever it falls but it's just

202
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,240
going to accumulate in there and trap in

203
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,759
there evenly

204
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,360
now if you think about a snow plow

205
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,840
whether it's a big old one or a small

206
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,440
one

207
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,199
you have your plow angled you're never

208
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,240
really using your plow perfectly

209
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,720
straight on so

210
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,160
the load is constantly sweeping to one

211
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,080
side and when you have your load

212
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,680
sticking out as far as it is like this

213
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,120
it's going to be a lot more difficult to

214
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,039
try to steer your machine when you have

215
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,000
a load especially on lighter machines on

216
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,520
smaller machines your

217
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,280
your subcompacts and your smaller

218
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,440
compacts that don't have a lot of weight

219
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,280
when that snow is constantly pushing to

220
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,680
one side and you're having to combat

221
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
that

222
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,800
by steering this way and the front end

223
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,319
of your tractor is

224
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,160
sometimes wanting to lift up because of

225
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,919
the amount of snow is pushing so you're

226
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,759
already a little bit limited on traction

227
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,240
to begin with and you're compounding

228
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,400
that

229
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,000
by having that off center load and one

230
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,120
other thing to keep in consideration is

231
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,800
the fact that

232
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,120
you know your plow phase here on the

233
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,759
pusher is sitting closer to the loader

234
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
arm so

235
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,199
it's closer to your machine it's going

236
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,880
to allow you to maintain better control

237
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,440
as you can see over on the plow right

238
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,800
here your plow face is significantly

239
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,479
further away from your

240
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,000
the base of your loader arms here so

241
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,440
what that does is it makes it a little

242
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,319
bit harder to control a little bit

243
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,080
harder to steer

244
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,440
and get leverage with your machine now

245
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,600
keep in mind we're talking about

246
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,280
loader mounted plows you can get frame

247
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,199
mounted plows for certain machines

248
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,039
but for me that defeats the entire

249
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,560
purpose while you have a loader on there

250
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,080
most of us that have loaders on our

251
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,080
tractors need to be able to use them

252
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,759
year round and so if you get a frame

253
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,599
mounted plow that means you have to

254
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,199
remove your loader and then install all

255
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,280
the hardware and the quick attach system

256
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,360
and everything else to use the plow

257
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,720
so getting something for your loader is

258
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,400
going to be a lot more effective for

259
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,080
most of us that we have to use

260
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,919
a grapple in the wintertime or a bale

261
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,759
sphere or a bucket or pallet forks or

262
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,039
something else along those lines

263
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,720
let's talk about the types of snowfall

264
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,160
that these attachments can handle and

265
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,479
that's going to be pretty easy pretty

266
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,919
much

267
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,680
everything that you can throw at it

268
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,960
whether it's a small amount just an inch

269
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,400
or two that you want to clean up so it

270
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,880
doesn't turn into an icy mess

271
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,280
or if you have 12 18 inches i know some

272
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,039
of you guys just got 30 or 40 inches

273
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,160
any piece of snow removal equipment is

274
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,720
going to struggle with that so you're

275
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,400
just making do if you get a monster

276
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,680
mega storm you know that's 30 or 40

277
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,000
inches of snow you're just doing what

278
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,599
you can

279
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,039
to keep up it doesn't matter if it's the

280
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,080
light fluffy stuff it could be the wet

281
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,360
heavy stuff

282
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,639
these hunks of steel right here are

283
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,680
going to take that snow and move it

284
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,120
wherever you want to

285
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,720
one of the great features about this

286
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,400
backdrag is the fact that if you have a

287
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,160
big building like this or it could be a

288
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,639
garage or it could be a retaining wall

289
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
even

290
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,840
some place where you can't push snow

291
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,319
whether it's a pusher or a plow

292
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,840
you can go up to that surface there rock

293
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,120
this whole piece of equipment forward

294
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,520
like you're going to dump your bucket

295
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,520
out

296
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,120
and then this right here becomes your

297
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,319
scraping edge or your plow edge and you

298
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,800
can go up to that

299
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,360
that wall or that face and pull the snow

300
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,960
away

301
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,639
it's going to be all trapped inside this

302
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,080
box there so it's very easy to do and

303
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,000
very efficient to do

304
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,759
one of the big questions i'm asked is i

305
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,280
have a long drive what do you recommend

306
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,400
or i have a big parking lot or i have a

307
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,080
big landing area

308
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,280
or maybe i have both what do you

309
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,479
recommend as the right piece of

310
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,160
equipment for me

311
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,759
if we take everything we've learned so

312
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,199
far from the strengths and the

313
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,160
weaknesses of each one of these pieces

314
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,560
of equipment

315
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,160
my money goes to the snow pusher however

316
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,000
you got to make your own decision

317
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,199
if you have a long drive all right say

318
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,039
six or 800 foot

319
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,959
i sell both okay i sell pushers and

320
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,719
plows plows i guess are

321
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,479
more common right they've been around

322
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,959
longer you see a lot more of them out

323
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,399
there

324
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,080
so that's kind of where people tend to

325
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,519
gravitate towards it doesn't mean it's

326
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,200
the right solution for everybody

327
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,959
let me give you an example i've been in

328
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,240
a few locations even my current place

329
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,040
where i live right now where i've used a

330
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,880
snow plow

331
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,720
on the front of a garden tractor if you

332
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,800
have an unrelenting winter

333
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,720
where the snow just keeps coming guess

334
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,279
what you can only plow so often to the

335
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,480
side

336
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,920
before you're gonna have to stack it

337
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,519
somewhere anyway otherwise your

338
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,120
driveway's gonna continuously close in

339
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,519
on you and get narrower and narrower

340
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,519
because

341
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,959
that plow's not gonna go ahead and just

342
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,120
keep dumping it over the top

343
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,160
there's just nowhere for it to go so at

344
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,839
some point

345
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,519
and you're better off doing this early

346
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,480
on is pushing that snow back

347
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,000
periodically

348
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,839
in sections off the driveway to the

349
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,680
locations that you can even if you have

350
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,440
a 600 foot plus long driveway

351
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,120
you're going to have these same problems

352
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,120
versus if you have a 25 foot long

353
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,000
driveway you have to have some place to

354
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,519
put the snow

355
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,040
and that's where doing so with a snow

356
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,120
pusher can be more effective

357
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,959
than doing so with a snow plow and so

358
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,240
basically with a pusher or a plow even

359
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,440
on a long driveway

360
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,120
you still have to push that snow

361
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,560
straight you're going to have windrows

362
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,560
with either piece of equipment

363
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,399
and so where that efficiency comes into

364
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,800
place is with something like a pusher

365
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,040
here

366
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,959
that makes cleaning up collecting those

367
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,440
windrows a lot more efficient

368
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,880
with a plow it's windrow after windrow

369
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,480
after windrow i deal with it all the

370
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,560
time when i use a plow at my house

371
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,320
because that snow never is trapped by

372
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,920
the far end of the plow it's going to

373
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,279
constantly spill over you have to go

374
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,399
back through and make one more cleanup

375
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,399
pass if you want to

376
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,800
however smaller volumes of snow that

377
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,320
windrows normally are

378
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,040
they're captured right inside this box

379
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,560
here on a pusher so you collect it

380
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,399
you move it where you want to you stack

381
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,160
it up and it's done

382
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,240
and again bear in mind with smaller

383
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,200
machines maybe not so much once you get

384
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,880
to an l6060 or into your utility tractor

385
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,640
but those lighter machines are going to

386
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,079
have a challenge

387
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,160
steering while you're pushing all that

388
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,680
snow with a snow plow so if you can

389
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,360
keep that load centered with a snow

390
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,880
pusher it could make your life a little

391
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,920
bit more enjoyable as you go through the

392
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,640
winter time

393
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,000
now for talking about larger areas maybe

394
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
it's a lot like what i have here at the

395
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,640
shop

396
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,480
maybe it's at home you've got a garage

397
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,079
here maybe an extra garage or a barn or

398
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,240
just a big landing area

399
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,839
snow pushers really are the tool to use

400
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,120
they're going to be a lot more efficient

401
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,959
at trapping that snow

402
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,880
minimizing the amount of passes you get

403
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,399
the job done a lot quicker with a piece

404
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,000
of equipment like this

405
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,839
now as you might be able to tell i'm a

406
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,440
snow pusher guy i just really love them

407
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,279
and again for me it's all about

408
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,079
simplicity and you can't beat that with

409
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,920
a snow pusher

410
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,760
however no matter what i choose to sell

411
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,640
or recommend to folks i want it to be a

412
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,399
good value

413
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,920
above and beyond everything else so the

414
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,320
tar river snow plows

415
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,920
the hla snow pushers they just have that

416
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,160
great combination of features

417
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,440
price and quality that you just can't

418
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,120
find with anything else that's out there

419
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,640
so i hope you found this video helpful

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,959
decision that a lot of folks are

424
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,560
trying to figure out on their own and

425
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,240
this gives you some insight a different

426
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,360
perspective maybe to think about
