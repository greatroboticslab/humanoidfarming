1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,880
it's lunchtime

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,799
so i've been at the farm about a week

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,520
now and i've joined the regular routine

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,360
of the farm

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,440
which means i'm getting up at 4 00 a.m

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,719
to help milk the cows

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,639
and i want to talk a little bit more

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,160
about what that process is because

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,840
the milking equipment that i showed last

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,960
time that's really just the end of the

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,400
process and there's

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,160
a bit more to it so i show up at 4am and

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,920
the first thing that we do is we

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,640
herd all the cows down to milking collar

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,240
which is down that ramp behind me

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,599
and it's kind of like getting the cows

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,120
out of bed because they're all in their

18
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,680
stalls and they're lying down

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,960
and they don't necessarily want to go

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
get milked

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,640
so you sort of walk up behind them and

22
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,600
you whistle at them and let them know

23
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,760
it's time to get up

24
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,800
and you you come and you walk in if

25
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,840
they're not getting up

26
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,680
and uh pat them on the path on the back

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,879
and eventually they get the message and

28
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,879
they're hurt animals so they know where

29
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
they're going and uh they head down the

30
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,840
ramp we close the gate behind them

31
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,640
and then that's the chance to clean the

32
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,559
stalls so i'm going to show you how to

33
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,079
clean a stall

34
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,760
so it's a pretty simple process we're

35
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,680
just breaking the cow pies out of the

36
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,799
stalls and sometimes there's

37
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,320
urine or milk that has puddled up and we

38
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,760
pull that out too

39
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,159
and we pull it away from the edges of

40
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,479
the stalls because if we leave it there

41
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,600
um the cow's tails hang over the edge of

42
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,720
the stalls and

43
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,439
they will get covered with cow poop

44
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,400
so just keeping it clean like that and

45
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,320
then

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,880
we cover it up with a bed of shavings

47
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,040
that will help absorb any liquids

48
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,640
and move on to the next stall so it's a

49
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,000
pretty simple process

50
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,759
and it kind of makes me think taking

51
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,280
care of cows is a little bit like taking

52
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,680
care of two year olds

53
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,640
so we take care of 122 year olds every

54
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,399
morning

55
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,159
and it's not that complicated we're just

56
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,759
taking care of their basic needs

57
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,520
we're giving them food and we're

58
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,439
cleaning up their poop and making sure

59
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,439
their poop doesn't get in their food

60
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,960
and because they're not toilet trained

61
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,960
there needs to be a system to make sure

62
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,280
that the poop doesn't get in the food

63
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,799
and that system is basically built into

64
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,159
the design of the barn

65
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,320
as you can see the food is down the

66
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,000
outside of the barn and this bar here is

67
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,399
preventing the cows from getting through

68
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and

69
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,600
stepping in their food and pooping in

70
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,520
their food

71
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,280
so the food stays on this side and the

72
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,640
poop stays on that side

73
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,480
but we can't leave the poop there

74
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,480
because it would just pile up

75
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,760
so the barn has a poop removal system

76
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,920
built into it that

77
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,280
is actually pretty ingenious and it's

78
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,400
certainly better than shoveling poop

79
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,480
into carts and

80
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,760
taking it away somewhere else so the

81
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,120
barn is set up so that

82
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,040
most of the pooping happens in the

83
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,480
aisles between the stalls and when we're

84
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,480
cleaning the stalls we're basically just

85
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,080
raking the poop into the aisles

86
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,920
and then these automated wipers come

87
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,640
down the aisles a couple times a day on

88
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,640
chains

89
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,720
and push all the poop into the drains

90
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,400
and there's basically a sewage channel

91
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,120
that runs all the way down the length of

92
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
the barn

93
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,400
and it comes out here and it doesn't

94
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,239
stop here

95
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,239
it actually flows down the hill to this

96
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,680
manure tank and then a couple times a

97
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,319
year robert will drive up to the manure

98
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,239
tank

99
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,920
he'll fill up his manure spreader out of

100
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,360
the tank and he'll go and spread manure

101
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,879
on his fields

102
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,879
so that's how goes down here at the

103
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,560
dairy farm i've got something special

104
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,640
