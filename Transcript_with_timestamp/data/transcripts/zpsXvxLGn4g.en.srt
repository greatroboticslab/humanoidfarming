1
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,750
and today I'm gonna be showing you how

2
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,450
to convert your sprinkler system into a

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,090
drip system sprinklers are really

4
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:27,090
inefficient ways of watering plants in

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,760
general what they do is that they spray

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,730
water up in the air and onto leaves of

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,000
plants where that water will then mostly

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,010
evaporate into the air and very little

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,320
of it will reach the roots of your

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:44,670
plants and so what we're gonna do today

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,460
is replace a sprinkler system with a

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,200
drip system and so I well you see what

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,980
you see behind me this is called drip

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,239
irrigation tubing and this tube has

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:01,230
these little black emitters in it every

16
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,840
12 inches and this tubing when I when we

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,109
finish hooking it up will drip water

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,679
right on to the soil right where the

19
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:12,600
plants roots are and will this is a very

20
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:15,509
efficient system compared to the

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,240
sprinkler it puts the water right where

22
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,520
the water is needed okay so the first

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,579
part of installing a drip system is

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,490
actually closing off all the sprinklers

25
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:29,490
on your system that sprinkler system

26
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:33,959
generally is divided into stations and

27
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:36,630
you can you can't mix sprinklers and

28
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:39,689
drip on the same station the reason is

29
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,420
is that sprinklers put out a lot of

30
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,669
water very quickly so a sprinkler head

31
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,369
you know might put out several gallons

32
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:49,709
of water in a minute whereas a drip

33
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,889
system puts out water really slowly so

34
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:55,799
if you have drip and a sprinkler on the

35
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:57,539
same system in the amount of time that

36
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,789
it takes for the drip system to put out

37
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:01,679
a gallon the sprinkler might suit the

38
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,939
sprinklers might have put out 10 gallons

39
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:05,459
and so you don't want that kind of

40
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,880
mismatch so the first thing that we're

41
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:11,340
gonna do is find all the sprinklers that

42
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,120
are in that one station the sprinkler

43
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,550
heads

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,360
and just go ahead and screw the

45
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:25,440
sprinkler head off and then replace it

46
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:27,930
with a cap and so you're gonna do that

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,390
to all of the sprinklers on that one

48
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,989
station and then move on to the next

49
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,930
step

50
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:36,840
the next step is to actually convert the

51
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:40,380
sprinkler head that's closest to your

52
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,590
garden beds into a system that will

53
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:47,100
allow us to move from the PVC piping

54
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:51,299
here to this kind of drip irrigation

55
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:54,120
tubing so for my system here what I have

56
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:56,400
is the half-inch pipe coming out of the

57
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,530
ground and that's attached to the

58
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,500
sprinkler head so I'm gonna remove the

59
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,690
sprinkler head then I'm gonna attach an

60
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,569
elbow and this is an elbow that has a

61
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,720
female side and a female side with

62
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,459
threading on both sides so that means

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,560
this is both of these sides can be

64
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:19,590
screwed onto here so I'm gonna screw

65
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:22,530
this on and then into there I'm gonna

66
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:26,430
screw on this adapter this adapter

67
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,900
allows me to hook up to my drip

68
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,180
irrigation tubing and the drip

69
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,130
irrigation tubing will just jam right on

70
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,760
to this fitting so I'm going to screw

71
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,760
this in here now

72
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,170
now depending on what's available at

73
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:43,200
your hardware store you might not find

74
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,209
these exact type of fittings but just

75
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,790
talk to someone over there and they'll

76
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,230
help you find the one that fits right on

77
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,110
to your system you might even want to

78
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,569
take one of these pipes with you to the

79
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,780
hardware store so you can find the exact

80
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:59,730
fittings that will work for your garden

81
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,430
once you have your adapter on your

82
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:06,690
sprinkler head the next step is going to

83
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:09,750
be to install the backbone tubing okay

84
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,660
so what this is this is tubing that has

85
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,540
no holes in it all it's going to do is

86
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,390
deliver the water from where we put that

87
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,970
sprinkler adapter on two of the places

88
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,940
where we want the water to actually come

89
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,610
out so this this is just a half-inch

90
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:30,450
it's called 1/2 inch blank irrigation

91
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:33,690
tubing and we're gonna connect that to

92
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:36,540
the starter fitting but before we do

93
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,919
that what we need to do is dig a trench

94
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,620
and see you see I've already dug a

95
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,430
trench starting from where my adapter

96
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,380
fitting is going close to all of my

97
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,320
garden beds because what I'm gonna do is

98
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,070
lay down the tubing in this trench and

99
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,880
then attach my tubing that has the

100
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:59,250
emitters to this tubing the important

101
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,539
thing when you're purchasing these drip

102
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:05,580
irrigation materials is to purchase all

103
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:08,720
materials from the same brand because

104
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,940
each brand has a slightly different

105
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,070
diameter of tubing and if you buy

106
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,800
different brands they won't all fit

107
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:20,190
together I know it's silly it's annoying

108
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,570
but just buy one brand and stick with it

109
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,870
and it'll save you a lot of headache

110
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:27,270
later all right so now I have my blank

111
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,010
tubing and I'm just gonna connect it to

112
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,260
this adapter that I already put on here

113
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,800
so all after you to connect it is just

114
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,870
push the tubing over the adapter and

115
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,840
kind of wiggle it back and forth and

116
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,820
once I hit the end I'm this is a snug

117
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,919
really tight fitting it's actually

118
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,370
really really hard to get these off so

119
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,350
this is watertight completely when

120
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,660
you're putting this

121
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,960
this type of tubing on it really helps

122
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:56,330
to have some gloves with a nice grip to

123
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,430
them because your thumbs and your hands

124
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,850
will get really tired if you don't have

125
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,890
good grip on your hands so now I'm just

126
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:07,660
going to roll out my tubing right down

127
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,660
my ditch all the way to the end

128
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:23,180
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going

129
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:26,720
to make a cut in my tubing and insert

130
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,580
this T adapter so when you go to the

131
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,190
irrigation supply store or the hardware

132
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,260
store you'll find adapters like these

133
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,780
for the tubing's you have a T adapter

134
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,750
you have an elbow adapter they also sell

135
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,600
a straight adapter for mending broken

136
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:44,120
tubing and so what I'm going to do is

137
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,949
I'm going to install this T adapter here

138
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,290
into this tubing and the way I'm going

139
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:51,080
to do that is very simple I'm just going

140
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,600
to take a pair of hand pruners or any

141
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,910
other you know sharp cutting tool and

142
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:02,300
just make a cut right here and then

143
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:06,229
insert this T into the tubing and again

144
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:14,840
I just push it in and then again on the

145
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:19,010
other side simply push it in and now I

146
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,440
have a tight fitting there once the T is

147
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,240
in then I'm going to connect some more

148
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,300
blank tubing into the other side of the

149
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,520
T and now what I'm going to do is I'm

150
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,789
going to make a cut here right where

151
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:36,349
about the soil is so that the pipe

152
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:40,070
reaches just above there and then I'm

153
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:43,060
going to insert in elbow into that pipe

154
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,060
into this pipe here

155
00:07:50,350 --> 00:08:02,350
and then put another little piece of

156
00:07:53,260 --> 00:08:04,720
pipe onto that elbow and now cut make

157
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:10,150
another little cut so that just my pipe

158
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:12,640
is reaching into the bed and now that I

159
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:15,340
have my little connection on I'm going

160
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,530
to use another tee and I'm going to use

161
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:22,440
one of the side connectors not the

162
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,440
center piece to connect into this tubing

163
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:31,380
and from here we're going to connect our

164
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:33,760
actual tubing with the emitters in it

165
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,500
all right and now I'm going to start to

166
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,020
connect my emitter tubing so you can see

167
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,500
the emitter tubing it looks almost just

168
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:44,140
like the blank tubing but every 12

169
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,110
inches you'll see one of these little

170
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,270
black sort ovals

171
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:51,250
so you can see one is here now we got

172
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,110
another one here we've got another one

173
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,320
here so they're spaced 12 inches apart

174
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:59,230
and the water will just drip drip drip

175
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,050
out of these emitters when you buy this

176
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,300
tubing it comes in different versions

177
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,310
there are somewhere that the emitters

178
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,170
are nine inches apart somewhere the

179
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,660
emitters are 12 inches apart somewhere

180
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,780
the emitters are 24 inches apart there's

181
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,850
also different water ratings for the

182
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,040
emitters so you could find tubing that

183
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,190
where each of these emitters is going to

184
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,700
admit half a gallon per hour or one

185
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,590
gallon per hour just choose one and

186
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,750
stick with it because that way you'll

187
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:31,450
have even water wherever you're using

188
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:35,230
this tubing so what I'm using again is

189
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:38,890
the 12 inch spacing and one gallon per

190
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:42,790
hour perimeter so to start now I'm gonna

191
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:47,020
take that T piece that I just put in and

192
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:50,800
I'm gonna put my emitter tubing into

193
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:53,210
here and it is a little difficult to put

194
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,940
these on

195
00:09:53,210 --> 00:10:02,510
okay now I'm just going to unroll my

196
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:04,400
tubing down the length of my bed and

197
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:07,130
when you're unrolling the tubing you do

198
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,770
want to actually unroll it if you just

199
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,660
try to kind of pull it off this way

200
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,430
it'll get all twisted up and it's

201
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:24,260
difficult to put to roll out

202
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:29,800
so actually unroll it down the bed and

203
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:32,660
when you get to the end go ahead and

204
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,390
make the cut you want to leave a little

205
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:38,630
bit of excess just in case you want to

206
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:42,470
move you know make any adjustments so

207
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:46,880
I'm going to cut weight up to you that

208
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:50,150
way I got play so the next step is to

209
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,790
attach our next lines of tubing the

210
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,410
number of lines you attach to a bed is

211
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,430
going to depend on the width of your bed

212
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:01,370
so these beds are about three feet wide

213
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:04,010
so I'm gonna attach about three lines of

214
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:06,680
tubing so now what I'm going to do is I

215
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:09,800
took a about an eight inch piece of

216
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:16,220
blank tubing and I'm gonna attach it

217
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:19,190
here to this tee okay and now I'm going

218
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,530
to attach another tee right here so this

219
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,150
is going to be my I'm gonna attach three

220
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:28,010
lines of tubing this is going to be my

221
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:32,320
middle line now I'm going to attach

222
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,320
another eight-inch piece of tubing here

223
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:38,670
and then I'm going to put an elbow on

224
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,670
the end

225
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,410
so now I'm ready to attach my second and

226
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:56,889
third line of my emitter tubing onto

227
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:58,839
this what I'm gonna do when I'm

228
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:02,319
attaching my next lines of tubing is

229
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:05,769
that I'm gonna cut my tubing here so

230
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:07,990
that my emitters are not lined up the

231
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:10,720
emitters like I said before on this are

232
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,790
twelve inches apart and so what I want

233
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,670
to do is stagger them so that I get a

234
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,500
really even coverage over my bed so you

235
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,819
can see this emitter that I've already

236
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,430
this tubing that I've already attached

237
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:25,930
has an emitter here so what I'm gonna do

238
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:29,529
is cut this next tube so that the

239
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:32,199
emitters are halfway in between the

240
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:39,189
emitters on this existing line so I'm

241
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:42,370
gonna make a cut just about here so I'm

242
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:45,009
going to cut off this end and now when I

243
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:49,060
attach this second line of tubing my

244
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:51,129
emitters will be staggered so you can

245
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,720
see I rolled up that second line of

246
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:55,870
tubing now I'm going to attach my third

247
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,339
line of tubing to measure where I'm

248
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,550
going to start on this tubing I'm just

249
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:03,220
going to line up with my emitters with

250
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:06,129
the first line because since I staggered

251
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:08,500
on the second line the third line should

252
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:10,959
be set should be cut the same way as the

253
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:18,009
first line so I just line up my emitter

254
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:23,339
and then I make a cut and now attach the

255
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:23,339
third line in to this last elbow here

256
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,660
and now I'm just gonna roll out this

257
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,870
third line and the front part of this

258
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,760
bed is done so now that I have my

259
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,500
connection all together here in the

260
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,920
front of the bed the next thing I'm

261
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,540
going to do is just pin my tubing in

262
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,050
place so I know exactly where it's gonna

263
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,880
go and so what I'm using are these

264
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:52,730
u-shaped they're called ground staples

265
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,880
and what you do is just take that staple

266
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,830
and put it around the tube and into the

267
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,180
ground and it should hold the pipe in

268
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:04,520
place so I just got a handful of them

269
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,520
here I'm gonna go along the bed and just

270
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:10,220
pin the tubing so that is nice and

271
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,320
evenly spaced apart all the way down the

272
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,860
bed and it's in the position that I want

273
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,860
it to be in

274
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,040
so here at the end of the bed what I'm

275
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,220
gonna do is I'm just gonna use one t

276
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,230
adapter to close all of these tubes off

277
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,899
and so what we're doing is we're

278
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,120
creating a loop between all the tubes

279
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:40,709
now there's no start point and there's

280
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,480
no end point they all just come together

281
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:45,060
and that means we're gonna have even

282
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,620
pressure throughout the tubing and the

283
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,839
water will get distributed very easily

284
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,540
so what I'm going to do now is I'm just

285
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,610
gonna cut the end of this tube off the

286
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,670
center tube and I'm going to attach this

287
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,959
tee piece here so just make sure we're

288
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,750
at the end of the bed and that looks

289
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:06,830
about right so I'm gonna make my cut

290
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:06,830
here and push this on

291
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:12,060
once that centerpiece is connected I'm

292
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:14,580
gonna connect just one of my other tubes

293
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,980
to that piece the reason being is I'm

294
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,620
going to leave one tube unconnected

295
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,320
because before I close this whole thing

296
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,740
off what I want to do is flush the

297
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,779
tubing out so before I actually connect

298
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,230
everything together I'm gonna leave one

299
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:33,690
tube empty on unconnected on every bed

300
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:36,120
turn the water on and let all the any

301
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:39,000
dust or dirt that might be inside these

302
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,630
tubes get flushed out that way they're

303
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,160
not there to clog the emitters when I

304
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:56,850
turn it on so just gonna make this cut

305
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:58,500
here and close this one off so now what

306
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,779
I've done is I repeated that same

307
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,770
process that I did on this first vent

308
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:07,410
here lunch my second and third bed I

309
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:09,750
took a branch off of our mainline I

310
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:13,050
connected it up to the top of the bed

311
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:15,140
and laid out three lines of tubing going

312
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:19,050
down the meds spaced them out with my

313
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:22,250
staples and then connected only two of

314
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,660
those tubes at the end and left one off

315
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,900
once your tubing is all together you

316
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,370
need to install your filter and the

317
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,589
place that you want to install your

318
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:34,170
filter is right where your valve is so

319
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:35,910
if you had a sprinkler system there's

320
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,550
probably some place in your house house

321
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,110
where you have a bunch of these valves

322
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:42,450
next to each other under some kind of

323
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,430
box and what I'm going to show you now

324
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:47,190
I'm just gonna demonstrate on this free

325
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:51,120
this loose valve how to install the

326
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:53,900
filter so what you'll need is a pipe

327
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,750
cutter and using the pipe cutter

328
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:00,270
whatever is coming out of this end of

329
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,089
the valve so that's the end that doesn't

330
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:06,240
have the black attachment pieces to it

331
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:09,990
you would cut that pipe off which the

332
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,240
pipe cutter and then unscrew whatever is

333
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:15,510
connected here okay and you won't need

334
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,360
that anymore what you then do is take

335
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:20,940
your filter and your filter will have an

336
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,040
arrow on it that with the direction

337
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,530
of the flow of water so the direction of

338
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,740
the flow of water is going to be down

339
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:30,870
from this piece that doesn't have the

340
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,710
black connectors connected to it and all

341
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:38,810
you're gonna do is screw in your filter

342
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:42,690
here and now that your filter is in

343
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:48,150
you're going to use a piece like this

344
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:51,300
this is a 3/4 inch female-to-female PVC

345
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:53,580
connection it doesn't have threading on

346
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,340
one side so it's just smooth on one side

347
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,680
on the inside and it has threading on

348
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:05,850
the other side so what I can do with

349
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:09,000
this is I it on to this filter and then

350
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:12,960
on the other side you'll connect back to

351
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
the PVC pipe that you cut before so for

352
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,920
example you have a PVC pipe like this

353
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,350
you're going to use this Christy's red

354
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,120
hot blue glue and what you're going to

355
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,550
do is with it with this glue you're

356
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,460
gonna apply a little bit around the end

357
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:33,150
of your PVC pipe and then you're gonna

358
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:36,060
apply another amount here on the inside

359
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:40,080
of this PVC pipe and just glue those

360
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:42,630
together ok and now all the water that

361
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,450
comes through here gets filtered by this

362
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:47,850
filter to empty these filters out

363
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:51,150
usually they just come out with a screw

364
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:55,080
and cap like this and so when you open

365
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:57,740
that up you can kind of dust a push push

366
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:02,310
out whatever's been filtered out and

367
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:05,900
also if you need to probably every few

368
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:10,020
years you open this whole thing up and

369
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:11,930
you can you can replace the actual

370
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:18,630
filter piece inside of here

371
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:20,730
ok so once you have that then your your

372
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,470
water is going to be doesn't it's not

373
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,650
going to have any particles in it that

374
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,960
will block up your tubes the other piece

375
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:31,290
that you might need that I don't have to

376
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,790
show you is a pressure regulator so when

377
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:37,330
you buy your drip tubing

378
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:39,310
on the tubing there'll be a rating for

379
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,590
how much pressure that tubing can handle

380
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,970
so maybe this to me you know maybe the

381
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,910
tubing says it can handle up to a

382
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:49,180
hundred psi of pressure well if my

383
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:51,340
pressure at my home is only 50 psi then

384
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,220
I don't need a pressure regulator to

385
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,830
keep this tubing in good shape but if my

386
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:59,890
pressure in my home is say a 120 psi

387
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,360
which it might be in certain areas then

388
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:05,890
you'll need to attach a pressure

389
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:08,860
regulator after the Y filter to bring

390
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:11,320
the the pressure down so that it doesn't

391
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:14,380
burst the tubing okay but in most cases

392
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,230
all you'll need is the filter as long as

393
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:21,280
you're using this half-inch thick walled

394
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,260
drip emitter tubing so now that

395
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,270
everything is set up the last step was

396
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,910
to turn the water on and flush these

397
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,890
pipes down so I've done that you can see

398
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,380
the water is coming out here it's also

399
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:34,930
coming out here and we're going to let

400
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:37,960
this run for a minute or so so that all

401
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:40,390
the water is coming is all the piping is

402
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,370
getting flushed out and after I let this

403
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,950
watch out for a minute we're going to

404
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,320
turn the water off and make this final

405
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,230
connection and then my drip system will

406
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,820
be done so now I've got my water my

407
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,550
tubes all connected together and I've

408
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,100
turned the water on and you can see here

409
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,690
the water is dripping out nicely out of

410
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,760
all the different all the emitters and

411
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,760
we have good coverage over the entire

412
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,870
bed and so now we can start planting

413
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,720
thanks for watching this video I hope

414
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,850
this gets you started setting up a drip

415
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,620
irrigation system at your own home and

416
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,930
