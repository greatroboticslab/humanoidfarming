  "text": "everyone it's Ross in today's video we're going to be pruning some Stone fruits uh we have just about everything pruned now like we've done the apples the pears the Persimmons the Jujubes the figs all of it uh except for the stone fruits and the European grapes and that stuff you need to wait longer uh before you can prune them sometime in early spring um late winter and it's really all about disease with the stone fruits right we want to prevent that from happening we want to make sure that in the forecast it's not going to rain U before we prune it's really important um some other things I think are really important that we're going to talk about is knowing how your tree fruits okay does it fruit on New Year's growth last year's growth or 2-year-old wood as an example so it could be one-year-old wood 2-year-old wood you know it could be any number of things depending on what it is you guys are doing I think that's really important and kind of developing a strategy around that um you can do this yourself right um You don't need to follow guidelines that I'm going to set for you guys or guidelines that people have recommended you can just do this your you know figure out your own little path and do this however you want to do it um every tree is different every yard's different so even though I'm going to give you guys some recommendations I'm trying to give you guys General recommendations here um these are my cherry trees behind me they're semid dwarf we're going to move over there to the asaya peaches in just a moment but I want to talk about these first um some things in particular we have a nice little deer just the nicest deer that comes through here and makes its way this way towards the cherry trees and inevitably every summer or I should say every spring he gets a little taste of them and as a result I've removed most of the lower growth so that was priority number one um I also wanted to make sure that these trees are not getting too big I want to form a nice little canopy with these um I want to keep them cuz they're so close together here I want to keep a lot of that growth out of the middle to a minimum and have most of these trees grow out in the other direction away from each other um I kind of want them to be bush-like have a a larger can a dense canopy um if I can and that's really the goal of what I've been decided to do this year and as you can see we've made some nice little Cuts nothing too drastic but we did reduce the height quite a bit because I don't want these trees to get Too Tall uh the sun about midday is somewhere around here and if this trees are too big it's going to shade out what's on the patio which would be the Potted figs and those take priority over the cherries um one thing about the cherries is that store-bought quality actually is pretty similar to Homegrown quality and if I were to do this all over again I wouldn't grow sweet cherries probably would grow some other cherries like bush cherries or sour cherries that are a bit more problem free than the the sweet cherries right the sweet cherries can really get attacked by rot and diseases they're not really the longest live trees either especially in my climate so you know it's all up to you guys and where you guys live and your situation but there are other things that I would rather grow um one thing I want to mention here about the cherries is that they flower in clusters I can get the camera to focus for you this is essentially a nice little cluster of flowers here there's about five to seven little buds each of those will turn into a cherry and they fruit on or they form I should say on 2-year-old wood I guess they can probably form I'm not entirely sure but they can form on older wood as well but they'll pretty much stay here for the remainder of their lives I can come in here and thin this out these little buds but for the most part we want to be focusing on getting a lot of this 2-year-old wood and limiting as much one-year-old wood as we can so it's kind of a bit of a a problem there um too much one-year-old wood means we're going to have a huge tree and too much well there's no such thing as too much 2-year-old wood but we definitely want to make sure that we're getting a nice little canopy set up a permanent structure I think is really what I want to come back to and really keep these things under control that way so that's kind of really the basics of what I have decided to do is prune out the lower growth for the deer um kind of control the growth so it's not growing into each other in its own little respective area and also keeping the number of one-year-old wood kind of to a minimum right I mean this is about you know a foot of growth here maybe and that's it I don't really want any one-year-old growth more than that um I mean of course it's going to grow more than a foot every year but we're going to keep it trimmed back to about that and that way we'll form a nice little almost as if we were poing this in a way we'll form nice little new branches here at a lower height than we would if we kind of just let it do its thing and let me show you guys the peaches okay the peaches are spy a you're not really supposed to do this but we' we've done it and these are my tips for this because I think you need to really get a little bit creative with these if you're going to do this um you can see here this is what we pred out I left this here for you guys to see this is only the 3-year-old wood um obviously there's one-year-old wood up here right two 2-y old wood as well but down here this is where the thick stuff is this is the 3-year-old wood and this has just got to come out and the reason for that is that I can't really control the height of this and recycle New Growth without doing that so we made a we only made three cuts um that's really it I didn't go crazy with these you can see we made one there and then two on this red Haven Peach right there um peaches are a bit different I want to I want to mention here they fruit on one one-year-old wood the new growth from last year and they form these little buds you can see that there really perfectly um they'll form about two to three different Buds and that's that will be the flowers whereas this Bud here is really just a new Branch um so you have to look at these branches in a way and say okay how much fruit do I have and how much do I want last year I really thinned this out we got to about a 100 peaches per tree I think that's reasonable for someone like me I don't need to eat more than 100 peaches it's nice to be able to share but um you know this stuff down here is really going to give me a nice little fruit set because this really has a nice little density of one-year-old wood um and that's on the bottom tier that we're looking at on the second tier we've actually uh got a similar situation but it's a bit more vigorous right as you go up higher on the tree you get more Vigor so I'm kind of keeping a lot of the lower stuff because that stuff's not going to grow all that much it's not really going to get in the way of anything too drastic the second tier we may want to thin this out a bit more and really space this out right so this is like let me give you an example this is a nice little system of branches here um this this whole thing that we're looking at it's got 2-year-old wood it's got some nice one-year-old branches that will fruit for me um we want to space this out between another little section of 2-year-old wood this is another good example so by doing that we're keeping them apart from each other they're not shading each other other out we're not encouraging disease we're increasing air flow um it's just better off overall for the tree um and then we also need to do something important where we select new branches that will then become 2-year-old branches this system next year so if we have a 2-year-old little complex system of branches here this will turn 3 years old next year and I I'm going to take this out I may keep on the lower tier I may let them stay here for about four years on the second tier it's going to be 3 years and the same thing on the top tier 3 years as well so any three-year-old wood has to come out but we also have to make room for new year old New Year growth for that to become something in the future right we have to be thinking about the future we can't be so short blindsided here that we just completely forget about the fruit we're going to have a couple years from now you know that's really the goal of these trees in my mind is that's what I'm thinking about probably the most we've got ourselves a nice form okay that should be your number one priority from the beginning but once you get that form down now you're trying to just manage the number of fruits that you want so by doing this right by selecting the the new wood so like if this is a a nice little permanent Branch here and this is a nice little permanent Branch here one of these two would make a really nice new system to turn into this or to this the following year and then if we wanted we could take out one of these and then that way we would have a constant recycling of new wood and new system of branches it gets a bit more complex as we get a bit higher and things really need to be pruned a bit more as we get higher but it's a similar scenario let me give you guys a good example here this is 2-year-old wood and you can follow this up and you'll see a whole different system of branches up there just like we saw below right next to that is one-year-old wood that has grown quite vigorously or maybe it's even 2-year-old wood but you can definitely see this one back here this is basically just one little shot of one-year-old wood this guy back in there so what we can do is that when this comes out next year cuz this will turn 3 years old this time next year we take this out this then looks just like that and this will kind of replace that right so that's all we're doing is we're Recycling and you get over here into this section these will become new branches to eventually become this 2-year-old section of complex branches so that's all we're doing that's really it in a nutshell and uh I wish I could have said that in shorter words and less time but uh there you got it all right so again nothing really needs to be too crazy but uh I did Summer prune these trees a bit um so with the connection of Summer pruning and winter pruning we really didn't do a whole lot to these trees what I will do is I'll come in here with hand pruners and maybe take out a branch like this where it's kind of in the way a lot of crisscrossing branches look for damaged diseased or dead wood I don't have any of that on these trees um you know they're pretty young but I think you guys kind of get the idea here so hopefully you enjoyed this one hopefully you learned something and if you did please let me know down below what you learned and uh I'll certainly be willing to um help you guys if you have any questions below all right please subscribe like the video um check out the website it's Ross rat. wixsite.com we had to change the website a bit uh the link to that will be in the description all right guys take care and I'll catch you all soon",
