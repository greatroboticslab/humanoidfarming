1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,600
right behind me here is a newly planted

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,120
bed of habanero peppers but just a few

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,160
days ago it was a cover crop of winter

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,920
ride and in this video I'm going to show

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,160
you how to use wintery cover crops as a

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,080
sheet mulch in a no tail Garden the

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,160
winter Rye crop behind me was uh planted

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,680
in like mid September the date today is

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,680
April 30th it's very important that

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,000
before you actually crimp the winter

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,599
ride that it has these flower heads on

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,200
it we want to crimp it before it forms a

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,079
viable seed but it's still ready to die

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,239
and that's how the plant will die easily

15
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,559
by crimping and tarping otherwise the

16
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,840
plant's just going to want to Spring

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,840
right back up and it's going to be hard

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,800
to terminate basically so it grew all

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,440
winter with no irrigation right next to

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,800
this High tunnel and the reason I put it

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,160
there is for erosion control basically

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,760
and to kind of make the soil better in

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,280
that area too that bed's just never

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,480
really performed really great and then

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,399
the water rushes off that high tunnel

26
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,600
and kind of washes off these beds

27
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,720
because the whole Garden's on an incline

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,439
this way and all my other beds go in

29
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,560
this direction except for this High

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,680
tunnel and these beds so the water

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,240
usually rushes down the hill this way

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,960
which works good in most of my garden

33
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,600
but in this part of the garden it kind

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,320
of causes problems wash out and so my

35
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,040
thought is that I put a pause button on

36
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,640
it for the winter help with erosion

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,400
control keep the soil in place while at

38
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,360
the same time bringing nutrients up from

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,560
way deep down within the soil and then

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,799
how I'm going to crimp this helps build

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,640
the soil up help with like wash out and

42
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,439
stuff that I'm going to have so to crimp

43
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,640
it this is just like a standard toost

44
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:45,960
right nothing fancy it costs no money so

45
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,840
this is just a leftover rope from when I

46
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,119
bought the caterpillar tunnels I've got

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,920
four green houses and they come with

48
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,399
this rope to help hold the plastic down

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,320
and there's always extra so it's great

50
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,039
for little projects around the farm

51
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,119
things like that so I'm literally just

52
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,159
cutting off like an arms length of this

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,479
rope and and then I'm going to tie it

54
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,240
around my toot

55
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,520
so got two lengths they're not quite

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,679
exactly the same size but doesn't really

57
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,319
matter I'm going to tie them to the

58
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,319
toost first so I just tie a loop in

59
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,040
it like

60
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,200
this and then that makes it so that I

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,440
can make a

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,840
loop like this just kind of lasso that

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,239
around my

64
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,920
TST that's it and I'm going to do

65
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,160
something similar on this

66
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,519
end and then that's it and I'm just

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,519
going to take this like

68
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,760
this and that's it and so now I'm just

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,519
going to take the tool I'm just going to

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,519
step on it I'm just going to crimp it

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,400
right down to the ground so the next

72
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,360
step is to tarp it and the wetter the

73
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,879
better so if you can like run your

74
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,560
irrigation over it first or I'm just

75
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,840
since it's such a small plot I'm just

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,840
going to water it with the hose but you

77
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,920
really want to like trap the moisture in

78
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,159
under the tarp and that really helps

79
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,879
like steam it to kill the cover crop if

80
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:12,400
I were just leave it like that it's just

81
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,159
going to Spring right back up and keep

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,120
growing I find that the tarping with

83
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:19,879
this method like actually is necessary

84
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,560
and then it can't just be like any tarp

85
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,519
you don't want to like go to Home Depot

86
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,879
and just pick up a tarp it has to be a

87
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,959
silage tarp and then I always make the

88
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:31,400
grass uh facing one way so then I can

89
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,959
bring the drag the tarp over it that way

90
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,720
and I'm bringing it all this way that

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,799
way the grass doesn't get caught on it

92
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,720
like going that way I just kind of like

93
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,519
piece together some tarps that I had

94
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,519
laying around here greenhouse plastic

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,360
left over from when I built the green

96
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,439
houses to kind of get this end because

97
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,159
it you know all my tarps are 50 ft long

98
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:54,680
for my 50t long beds but then when you

99
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:57,159
crimp the cover crop it sticks out like

100
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,879
several feet so if you don't cover that

101
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,560
somehow and get it to diee it's just

102
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,439
going to like curl back back up towards

103
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,200
the sun in my experience all right so

104
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,040
it's been about like 10 days I think

105
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,200
that I crimped the winter Rye last

106
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,480
Wednesday and today's Thursday so it's

107
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,319
been 8 days it's interesting to see like

108
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,519
at the other end like I put that little

109
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,440
piece of pla uh greenhouse plastic

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,520
instead of silage tarp and that just

111
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,120
turned brown like within a few days uh I

112
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,080
just kind of peaked under the tarp and

113
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,560
it's still a little bit green um it's

114
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,280
not completely brown but it's like kind

115
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,039
of Rotty smelling you know like it's

116
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,400
dead it's not coming back um so I'd like

117
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,520
to wait like another I'd love to leave

118
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,680
the tarp there for another week but the

119
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,560
truth is I got to go do deliveries all

120
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,000
day tomorrow I got two workers that are

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,199
going to be here they need something to

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,479
do I got pepper plants that are This

123
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,160
Tall that I need to get planted so I

124
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,080
just need to get plants in the ground

125
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,560
get these beds making me money keep my

126
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,960
workers busy so I'm just going to get

127
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,600
this bed prepped and ready for them um

128
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,280
so I'm going to pull the tarps back and

129
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,639
we'll see what it looks like there you

130
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,360
go you can see that's what it looks like

131
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,160
after about 8 days you can see it's all

132
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,759
facing the same direction it's like

133
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,919
straw it's like mulching your garden

134
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,919
with straw only it was grown there and

135
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,160
the roots are still in the ground and

136
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,880
then so I thought it was really

137
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,199
interesting like on this end you can see

138
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,800
how it's just like brown brown dead so I

139
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,440
had a little extra scrap piece of

140
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,800
greenhouse plastic that I put right here

141
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,720
and that's the difference of like

142
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,520
solarizing it or using the silage tarp

143
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,120
so if you got a piece of greenhouse

144
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,759
plastic I mean you I mean it looked like

145
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,560
that after 2 days so you could

146
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,039
essentially tarp this with greenhouse

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,520
plastic for 2 days be done build your

148
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,080
beds and plant something else there was

149
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,319
a bed of arugula right next to it and

150
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,520
then it just so happened that we

151
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:55,240
harvested that bed of arugula the same

152
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,960
day as we crimped this cover crop so we

153
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,120
harvested the arugula crimp the cover

154
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,440
crop and then just tarped both beds to

155
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,280
terminate both beds so now both beds are

156
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,639
ready to be replanted so I'm just going

157
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,880
to like measure out my beds I I use

158
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,639
states with strings attached and I

159
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,199
measure out the bed so I can keep

160
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,680
straight lines and I'm going to freshen

161
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,720
up all the wood chips along the side of

162
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,919
the tunnel right here put fresh compost

163
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,199
right on top of this winter rye and then

164
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,560
fresh compost on top of this uh

165
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,240
terminated arugula bed and we're going

166
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,919
to plant peppers in both of these beds

167
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,720
I'm pretty sure I'm going to go ahead

168
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,800
get them measured out and get the beds

169
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,000
rebuilt I just kind of like keep a few

170
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,560
of these buckets around and so I just

171
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,080
grab the bucket you know it's got like a

172
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,360
hammer in it tape

173
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,039
measure and uh a bunch of these

174
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,720
things just with string on them so I can

175
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,319
string the beds up measure them out and

176
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,280
keep everything nice and

177
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,360
straight there's a few weeds I'm going

178
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,840
to go and H them out you always want to

179
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,000
take care of any Weeds now you know you

180
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,599
don't want to ignore the weeds that are

181
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,800
right here on the sides that you miss

182
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,240
cuz those are just going to become big

183
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,280
weeds drop seeds and then you're just

184
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,879
going to have more weeds you want to

185
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,039
take care of that stuff now and then you

186
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,199
don't have to come back and weed this

187
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,199
Garden ever the winter ride not only

188
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,199
acts as a mulch but it's got an alop

189
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,879
theic effect so it mulches the soil and

190
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,440
then it inhibits weed seeds that might

191
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,319
be in the soil from germinating for

192
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,319
several weeks anyway it's doesn't last

193
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,560
forever but now I'm going to put compost

194
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,400
right on top of that and then wood chips

195
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,960
in the walkways and you don't

196
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,800
necessarily have to put wood chips in

197
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,080
the walkways you can just use the winter

198
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,759
Ry as a mulch but I just find it it's

199
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,199
like difficult to walk on so if you're

200
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,759
going to walk in your walkways a lot

201
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,360
you're going to slip on the winter ride

202
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,599
but it does a great job at uh mulching

203
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,080
the bed and then once I put compost on

204
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,639
top of that like you're not going to get

205
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,000
any weeds for the rest of the year on

206
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,120
that bed okay so now that I put the

207
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,599
compost down I'm going to go ahead and

208
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,840
like rake the compost smooth on the beds

209
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:03,560
and then once that's nice and tight then

210
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,000
I come back in and I fill in kind of the

211
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,960
Gap with wood chips and it just kind of

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,560
like fills the raised bed kind of nicely

213
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,360
you know and like I how I showed you how

214
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,240
I crimp It All in One Direction on

215
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,720
purpose like I really messed it up by

216
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,800
going this way with the wheelbarrow you

217
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,319
can see how like by stepping on it and

218
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,039
walking that way with it it like I like

219
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,720
kicked it up so I'm going to try to fix

220
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,720
that the best I can

221
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,440
so I was out doing my deliveries today

222
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,680
and I had Max and Katie my workers uh

223
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,240
finish this in with filling it in with

224
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,600
wood chips so I told them that we'll

225
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,440
Harvest this bed of salanova lettuce

226
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,040
next week and then we'll uh fill in the

227
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,000
wood chips right there and then we'll

228
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,760
probably freshen up that whole big uh

229
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,760
little walkway right there but um so

230
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,360
this is what it looks like when we're

231
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,240
done right you can't even tell that

232
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,480
there's a cover crop under there so I

233
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,000
just built the garden right on top of

234
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,519
the sheet malt cover crop so I'll show

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,519
you what it looks like
