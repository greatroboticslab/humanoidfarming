  "text": "I'm Doug Hamilton I'm waste management specialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service and you you may wonder why a guy from Oklahoma is talking about alligators I'll show you we do have alligators in the wild in the southeast corner of the state in the marshes along the Red River but we have no alligator production in Oklahoma oops but the interesting thing is a lot of the cultures that developed in alligator country the Seminole of the Muscogee the trucked all picado now are residents of the state of Oklahoma so if Osceola the Seminole national hero would to see an alligator he would have called that hook Lata that's how you pronounce that but why I am while you're listening to me today is we have a waste management channel on YouTube where we were looking and we are looking at different types of waste systems so that farmers can see virtually before they get into a particular practice and back in 2010 we went down to Louisiana dr. Ron Sheffield was doing some treatment for alligator wastewater and with his passing and I guess I've become the de facto national expert on alligator waste why do we have farms with alligators there's a number of products that come from alligators the number one moneymaker for them is leather they grow the alligators up to about four feet in length four for leather the growth of an alligator is really regulated by temperature so if you have a ninety ninety two degree temperature they'll get to four foot in about a year or 12 months they like to raise them slower so they'll drop the temperature down to 80 82 degrees and they end up with a much more beautiful leather and that takes about 16 to 18 months to get up to four feet the second big products are the valley Gators is the meat and when you look at an alligator it's almost all tail so the tail meat has used the restaurants county fairs you can get fried alligator tail I haven't seen it in the store probably if I'm in Florida or Louisiana they have it in the store their number three item is novelty items you can get keychains with an alligator foot they sell the teeth here we have a head I can imagine back when I was in college I could see this in someone's dorm room with an ashtray in the middle of it and then the fourth thing is tourism there's farms that let you come watch them feed the alligators instigator ranch the the place we were filming view they have a little kiddie pool and you can play with the alligators they have hurt their mouths are taped shut also they let you hold an alligator egg in your hands while it's hatching the Nate the alligators themselves are kind of an interesting Beast I don't think we have any other confined animals feeding operations that are actually reptiles there may be some snake farms I don't know but the alligator is interesting that their Anatomy is more or their digestive anatomy is more in line with birds than anything else they have to parts of their stomach they have a gizzard somewhat like a chicken they also like chickens and birds they only they they do not have a urethra so all of their urine mixes with feces and exits through what they call the cloak wall which would be the anus in a in a in a mammal and like birds about 70% of all the nitrogen excreted by an alligator is in the form of uric acid the other thing that's kind of different about alligators than most of our domestic species is they're an apex predator so they are fed a very high protein diet in the wild they eat eat their food whole but we generally have some kind of a manufactured feed and that feed is going to be about 50% protein comparatively cat food which is also fairly high protein is about 20% so if you want to look to analogous animal to an alligator you'd have to look at your apex aqueous apex predators in the burgh kingdom bald eagles osprey that sort of thing now there's two basic ways that the alligators are raised on farm the first one is the alligator farm and that's predominant in Florida some in Georgia southern Alabama what makes a alligator farm an alligator farm is all the breeding stock are raised on that farm they have the mother alligators and I'm assuming the father alligators and they lay the eggs and they harvest all of the 4-foot or marketable Gators so you could call that a closed system in the state of Louisiana it's kind of unique the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries issues licenses to alligator ranchers and they go out and collect eggs from the wild and then they released into 15% of the four-foot alligators out in the wild the 10 to 15% comes from the fact that in nature only about 15% at most of the hatchlings are going to live up to the be 4 foot about 1 year and so you could call that an open system and that that the animals are taken from the wild and are returned to the wild most almost this is the slight Regina seen our from the instigator ranch almost all of the alligators raised in the United States are raised under roof there still may be a few open systems in Florida but none of them in Louisiana this particular farm they have three barns and then they have one long pit in each in each barn at which are separated up into pens very similar to a slatted floor hog barn for instance the alligators spend most the time in the water you see there's a little ledge here in the corner where they can crawl up on and they also feed them on that ledge just like a hog barn that pit is filled through the pit recharge system they have a well that fills the pit and then they can pull that the pull plug in the middle and it's going to let all the water out the entire length of the barn they get in there with a pressure washer and wash out all the solids the alligators love that in fact they are constantly spraying the alligators at least in the summertime for for heat control you might ask what an alligator is fed all of the alligator ranches in Louisiana have some form of prepared feed this guy was actually buying his food from Land O'Lakes Purina they actually stored a gator child to him one of the things that the people at least in Louisiana are very sensitive to you may have heard of people that started raising alligators for mortality method for poultry farms those types of people are fairly ostracized by the alligator ranching community they like to they take pride in their product and and the raising them them for them is a fairly serious business although they do the tourism this is what the influent coming out of those barges looks like the pipe on the left is a pit that had the the plugs pulled so that's going to be the the manure and throw from the pit and the one on the right that's just the overflow from all those sprinklers in a particular bar this farm used a holding pond to hold waste and then they irrigated it onto about a 20 or 25 or 30 acre field and they were using the Kaline pods they would pull them out with a four-wheeler move them around the one thing you might ask particularly once how did they size that field well it just happened they had that much land and if you women and trying to do a nutrient management plan on an alligator farm you'd quickly find that there is no book data on alligator manure and characteristics in our si si si ve is not going to have that date anywhere and it's pretty hard to find even on online or excuse me in referee journal articles we I am working on a fact sheet that's a companion to this talk we so what I'm saying is the the best way to size a facility is to take samples of the the influent or the effluent and then get good volume estimates and try to base it it's probably going to fall on phosphorus loss heights but we will have some information out fairly soon giving you NPK concentrations for that came out of a thesis that Ron Sheffield was working on Sheffield was there mostly because the guy was interested in treating further treating that holding pond waste and his number-one concern was odor control he was in Covington Louisiana which is a suburb of New Orleans right across Lake Pontchartrain and he had some pretty high priced houses in his neighborhood so he's interested in controlling an older that's basically reducing your organic matter and also transferring and solid nutrients to the solid phase so if you wanted to go transported further he could do that some treatment system with potential for alligator waste where the first comes to mind would be Lagoon one of the drawbacks Lagoon is that with that higher protein feed it may not help you much with the odor control you can see on the one of his barns he's got a windsock that's not for a helicopter landing he actually monitored the wind direction so that he knew when was a good data to spread and when was not a good day to spread what dr. Sheffield was working on was a calcium phosphate precipitation system where they would precipitate the phosphates out and take most of their organics with them you can see here the the liquid on the right is after it's gone through the process had very little odor it looked clear but it probably had a fairly ammonia concentration also I'd be amiss since we're work with anaerobic digestion here in Oklahoma and we also work with a liquid digestion system so anaerobic digestion to knock down the organics followed by struvite precipitation wouldn't achieve pretty much the same goals that's my last slide I want to thank John Price who is the owner manager of the instigator ranch for allowing us to go down there and of course Ronald Sheffield the late great Ronald Sheffield was the inspiration behind everything in Craig woods was our videographer and most of the the slides you see here were screen safe from from our video I will be coming out with that fact sheet shortly you can contact me there or that's my personal website at least for the next couple of months until extension changes things",
