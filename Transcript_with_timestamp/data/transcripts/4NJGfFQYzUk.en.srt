1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
we let the grassland seal as much as

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,480
possible

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,280
a rotational grazing plan really varies

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,260
from year to year some years I want to

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,840
try to introduce cool season grasses

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,460
some years I want to introduce legumes

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,020
that I've planted like the slicer milk

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,180
batch and stuff and the big blue stem

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,859
we're not on a set pattern we try to

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,380
shift it up every year hit a different

11
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,019
Paddock the last few years we've been

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,779
making smaller paddocks finding it a lot

13
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,420
more even grazing a lot more thorough

14
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,120
grazing getting grazing on the noxious

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,860
weeds our grasslands we're usually off

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,360
of those by the first of November and

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,780
then we're moving on to our cover crop

18
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,399
and crop residue I think about the

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,020
latest we've had our cows out was

20
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,879
February 1st we had to bring them home

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,160
and start feeding we ran out of places

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,879
degrees we let the grassland seal as

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,879
much as possible
