00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,660
I am Shane Harris with a low-carbon

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,370
extension system you've got that raised

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,380
bed garden you always been wanting to

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,920
put in now you got to think about

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:19,900
planting that raised bed but planning a

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,439
rigs bed is a little bit different than

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,029
the traditional field or row garden you

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,720
don't need any equipment to plant this

9
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:30,279
garden and the spacing and the technique

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,829
is a little different than traditional

11
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:37,149
gardening let's take a moment and talk

12
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:38,830
about planting in the raised bed with

13
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:41,470
raised bed gardening we're going to

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:44,140
plant them on a block planting design

15
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,410
and unlike the traditional three-foot

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,930
rows the row gardening has a lot of

17
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:52,150
space that is wasted in a raised bed

18
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,930
garden we're not wanting to waste any

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:59,170
space for example large crops such as

20
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:02,320
tomatoes or squash will need to be on 24

21
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:05,229
inch centers whereas things like cabbage

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,229
potatoes or corn are spaced about a foot

23
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:10,750
apart smaller vegetables such as beans

24
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:13,540
peas or onions are usually around four

25
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,670
to six inches apart let's use this

26
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,220
illustration to explain the planting

27
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,760
techniques for the raised bed all

28
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:26,170
spacing is based on a 1 foot square

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:28,720
design and a 1 foot square spacing you

30
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,180
can get 32 plants this will be

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,790
appropriate for corn lettuce Irish

32
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,370
potatoes even okra

33
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:39,400
for larger plants such as cabbage

34
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:43,840
broccoli peppers and even collards 18

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:46,360
inch spacing is typically used are much

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,840
larger vegetables such as tomatoes

37
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:52,900
squash cucumbers and eggplant require 2

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,060
foot spacing many of the vegetables

39
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,280
require only 6 inch spacing

40
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,130
this would include beans peas and

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,290
especially carrots onions and even

42
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:05,910
smaller spaces for turnips or radishes

43
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:08,410
that's a lot of plants in a raised bed

44
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:11,560
using the block technique in a raised

45
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:16,150
bed there are multiple combinations and

46
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:19,290
planting designs that you can use the

47
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:24,760
idea is to maximize all available space

48
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:28,209
so that every foot of space has a plant

49
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,550
in it remember that dense planting

50
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:33,480
techniques result in higher production

51
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:36,370
of per square foot in the garden

52
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:41,489
hopefully more production will equal

53
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,489
success and a delicious harvest
