00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,220
my name is Ed Sakura I'm an extension

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,560
plant pathologist with the Auburn

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,160
University my email in case you want to

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,620
contact me later is

s-i-k-o-r-e-j at auburn.edu

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,800
I also post a lot on Twitter and my

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:24,199
Twitter handles Alabama Ed but

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,199
post a lot of pictures of sick plants

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,500
start off with some healthy looking

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,080
strawberries this is down at uh

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,960
slide on the left is Burrs Farms down in

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,340
Baldwin County or in Foley Alabama many

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,559
of you probably know

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,660
his operation he's been doing it for 30

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,700
years does a great job

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,800
um walked through that field and

17
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,420
could not find any disease that day

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,120
which

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,100
I guess I was happy to see on the right

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,840
is a nice basket of fresh strawberries

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,239
picked a Dempsey Farm which is just

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,879
North of Auburn near uh south of

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,640
Lafayette that's pretty much what you're

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,640
you're aiming for to produce as a grower

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,640
unfortunately

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,840
you get problems like this and

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,640
Leaf plates on the left you get a root

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,140
rots and Crown rots in the center and

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,000
also fruit grass

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,320
on the right which are showing up right

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,259
about now and all these can be

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,920
cost a significant amount of money and

33
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,659
in some cases devastate the crop

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,159
I like to start off with just this

35
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,320
simple definition of what a plant

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,000
disease is and I Define it as any

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,979
disturbance of a plant that interferes

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,960
with its normal growth and development

39
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,479
talk about biotic diseases which are

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,380
caused by living agents such as bacteria

41
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,420
fungi nematodes viruses and then abiotic

42
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,119
diseases caused by non-living agents

43
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,439
often uh related of Mother Nature maybe

44
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,460
flooding

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,920
of

46
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,780
uh cold weather and so forth Frost

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,880
injury

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,460
just a couple of examples of abiotic

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,579
diseases uh this poor pollination I saw

50
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,420
up in Edgar's area up in Clanton uh

51
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,920
possibly this poor pollination

52
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,560
leading to this disfigured fruit kind of

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,440
looks like a bird a ride with sun scald

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,959
some fruit on a black plastic malishes

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,940
years ago but it went from relatively

56
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,060
cold or warm those fruit were exposed

57
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,920
and he had damage that so abiotic

58
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,420
problems are out there insect problems

59
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,920
are out there like Ashley just talked

60
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,020
about we're going to talk about

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,420
strawberry diseases

62
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,020
um broke these down into a a few Leaf

63
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,360
spots both fungal and bacterial uh two

64
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,120
Crown rots root rots and anthracnose and

65
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,239
phytopra then we'll talk more more

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,340
heavily on the fruit rots which are

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,540
probably the most obvious ones

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,580
especially this time of year during

69
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,540
harvest season so botrytus and

70
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,540
threctnose fruit rod

71
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,040
new disease that Dr Connor in our

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,379
Diagnostic lab detected uh not long ago

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,420
this year and also rise of this route

74
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,760
which oftentimes shows up

75
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,580
post Harvest many times in your in your

76
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,379
kitchen in your refrigerator or on your

77
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,540
uh

78
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:14,099
encounter

79
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,379
as far as the least spots are concerned

80
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:19,440
we do have a couple fungal leaf spot

81
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:21,120
problems that are are common in backyard

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,180
gardens more than in commercial Fields

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,060
I'd say this is strawberry leaf spot or

84
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,580
common leaf spot uh

85
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,920
caused by a fungal pathogen oftentimes

86
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,900
you see these uh tan the brown lesions

87
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,720
surrounded by a darker margin these

88
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,700
could be red to purple and color you can

89
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,580
see on the left many of these lesions

90
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,680
start to emerge and you get blighting of

91
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,140
the foliage and eventually fall off and

92
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,040
typically these show up on the older

93
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,220
leaves

94
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,799
of the plant and it's look if you're not

95
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:55,680
on a fungicide spray program uh these

96
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,379
These are going to probably pop up

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,120
this is a strawberry Leaf blight another

98
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:02,879
disease sometimes you see both those

99
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,980
diseases on the same plant uh oftentimes

100
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,420
you get these tannish lesions

101
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,640
in the center you can see some

102
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,379
target-like patterns developing

103
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,360
on the right you can see where these

104
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:14,459
lesions start to merge and many times

105
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,260
you'll see almost like a U or a v-shaped

106
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,079
lesion extending out to the leaf Edge

107
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,440
and that leaf eventually uh turns brown

108
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,759
and dies both of these diseases are are

109
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,600
pretty

110
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,820
easily controlled with uh fungicides

111
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,919
so with common it's a it first appears a

112
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,360
small round purplish red spots on the

113
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,639
upper Leaf surface

114
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,259
uh Leaf death can occur when numerous

115
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,060
spots merge

116
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,340
and many of these this is often

117
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,139
introduced into fields on Infected

118
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,000
transplants and I highlight infected

119
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,460
transplants because I think with just

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,860
about every disease I talk about today

121
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,340
one of the ways the disease gets started

122
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:56,040
is coming in on Infected material

123
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:59,280
a commonly spot is spread within a field

124
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,380
by splashing water High rainfall warm

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,820
temperatures will favor rapid disease

126
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,460
development

127
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,500
as far as Leaf blight the spots become

128
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,440
target-like and only have a purple or

129
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,759
yellow or even a yellow margin to them

130
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,580
older lesions are as I mentioned I

131
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,220
usually v-shape at the leaf Edge leading

132
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:21,660
to a blight of the entire leaf

133
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:24,060
and similar weather conditions favor uh

134
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,580
Leaf blight as Leaf spots so that's why

135
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,380
I say oftentimes you might see these

136
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,600
together in the same field

137
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,800
I mentioned resistant varieties I

138
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,300
believe there are a few that have

139
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,240
resistance to these pathogens

140
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,520
disease-free transplants when you do get

141
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,160
your transplants in clean up some of the

142
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,020
dead tissue on them and then applying a

143
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,720
protective fungicide so a product like

144
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:49,380
Captain applied before these diseases

145
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,780
show up control them well caftan some of

146
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,860
the other

147
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,020
protective materials that are used by

148
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,820
commercial Growers do do a great job on

149
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,259
keeping these in check and more times

150
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,060
than not I see it late in the season

151
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:04,639
when the budget side programs have been

152
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,639
abandoned or in a home Garden situations

153
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,960
next disease is angular leaf spot and

154
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,639
this is a bacterial disease it's only

155
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,220
bacterial disease we'll talk about today

156
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,860
but it gets its name from the very sharp

157
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,880
angles to the lesions caused by the

158
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,400
pathogen

159
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,380
the bacteria get inside the leaf tissue

160
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,120
but they have a hard time Crossing some

161
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,340
of those major veins so you get these

162
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,440
these sharp angular lesions so it's

163
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,960
fairly easy to pick up in the field once

164
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,759
you get used to seeing it typically it's

165
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,460
a cooler weather disease likes it wet

166
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,639
like most of these diseases but a cooler

167
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,639
weather pathogen

168
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,740
So It Begins as

169
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,300
small water silk yellow lesions on the

170
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,100
lower leaf

171
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,539
yellow flesh will develop on the upper

172
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,180
surface and they'll eventually turn that

173
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,740
reddish brown color

174
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,440
and the elysians will enlarge to become

175
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,300
these angular spots uh short and merge

176
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,160
more or less and they're limited by the

177
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,840
lead veins

178
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,759
symptoms could also be visible on the

179
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,039
calyx of the fruit and I'll show you a

180
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,620
Sly of this but the bacterium does not

181
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,380
actually go to the fruit but that calyx

182
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,300
damage that does reduce marketability of

183
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,520
that infected fruit

184
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,740
now the bacterium can't survive on dead

185
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,780
leaves in the field so it can be there

186
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,880
from one year to the next it could also

187
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,800
be introduced on transplants

188
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,479
and then plant the plant movement uh

189
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,220
within the field is by splashing water

190
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,160
and I mentioned cooler temperatures

191
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,660
favor angular Leaf Spa

192
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,180
so with management we're looking at

193
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,639
disease-free planting stock purchasing

194
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,460
from a reputable dealer I do recommend

195
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,160
copper fungicides when this disease

196
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,139
shows up as they can be effective in

197
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,280
reducing bacterial problems and also

198
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,560
help you with some of your fungal

199
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,599
response you got to watch with coppers

200
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,460
and sulfur products some of these

201
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,800
products because they can cause a foliar

202
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,020
burn if they're overused or if

203
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,340
temperatures suddenly you know in

204
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,919
Alabama they might be 90 degrees

205
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,440
tomorrow some of these products can't be

206
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,300
more can cause actual Burns in a plant

207
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,880
and cause more damage than the pathogen

208
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,240
itself so be careful with them read the

209
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,620
label before using any product

210
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,360
so a couple early uh development of

211
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,860
angularly spot on the left and Center if

212
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,500
you were to cut one of those lesions

213
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,660
with a razor blade stick it on a die set

214
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,639
or a micro a compound scope in the lab

215
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,039
which you would see would be bacterial

216
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,620
ooze coming out and that's that gray and

217
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,599
a slide on the right the uh

218
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,279
that gray mass of spores coming out

219
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,680
there's probably thousands of bacterials

220
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,180
whereas oozing from one single lesion

221
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,640
and that's why these diseases really

222
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,659
take off these bacterial problems under

223
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,659
the right conditions

224
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,980
so with angular leaf spot uh we

225
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,899
mentioned water silky and an example of

226
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,760
that is on the left on the lower half of

227
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,399
that leaf you can see kind of a

228
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,320
just a dark almost like a water droplet

229
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,240
that's drying off that's water soaking

230
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,339
and that'd be the initial symptom for

231
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,200
angular leaf spot you could hold those

232
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,519
leaves up to the Sun as I did on the

233
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,240
right and then you can see those yellow

234
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,740
flecks where the pathogen causes initial

235
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,339
affection site and then eventually

236
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:14,459
that'll turn reddish from the bacterium

237
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:16,320
moving and reproduce rapidly

238
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:18,060
rip

239
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,980
and there's damage on the calyx I

240
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,720
mentioned and this I I noticed uh years

241
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,519
ago now but uh

242
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,700
I was able to get bacteria loose from

243
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,800
the calyx uh that dries down making that

244
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,140
that fruit a little bit less

245
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,760
likely to be picked by a you picker in

246
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,980
your operation

247
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,260
um it doesn't go to the fruit

248
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,680
but damage has already been done when

249
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,920
that fruit looks unedible

250
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,080
so angular leaf spot not a problem this

251
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,459
year at least I haven't seen it in a

252
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,959
couple years to be honest with you but

253
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,940
uh it's out there along with your other

254
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,920
Leaf puts

255
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,560
wanted to move down into the soil into

256
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,560
the crown of the plant a couple crown

257
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,440
and root rot diseases namely uh interact

258
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:05,580
nose Crown rot and then phytopter a root

259
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,080
and Crown rot and uh phytopus

260
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,820
we had that probably the most common

261
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,300
problem coming through the Diagnostic

262
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,060
lab according to Dr Connor our our fine

263
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,700
diagnostician uh attract nose Crown Rod

264
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,320
oftentimes if it comes in on transplants

265
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,660
it could be a significant problem to

266
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,399
Growers

267
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:26,880
on the left what happens is they they'll

268
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,440
plant their plants and then in in a

269
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,899
short time many of these plants will

270
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,959
start to die off you see a plant in the

271
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:36,540
center that has uh both phytopter and

272
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:38,519
spider mites uh Ash had a nice slide it

273
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,920
almost looks identical to that one

274
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,080
on the right is uh what I believe is

275
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,140
vital for Dr Connor noticed this field

276
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,300
in uh Brewton a few a couple months ago

277
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,040
diagnosed by top or in the field and the

278
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,680
grower lost plants but with vitopter

279
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,420
sometimes those plants will revive

280
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,000
themselves basically but they'll be show

281
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,140
that stunting that you see on the right

282
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,140
side of that bed

283
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,459
so with anthracnose what you're going to

284
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,740
see is uh

285
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:09,180
well it may attack the crowns direct no

286
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,560
says there's three different species of

287
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,839
them correct those and some are more

288
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,160
common as one is more common for the

289
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,380
crown Rod phase

290
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,000
and I'll talk about interact notes fruit

291
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,459
Rod later which is typically a different

292
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,380
species

293
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,180
so you get different phases of the same

294
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,100
disease

295
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,680
but plants may die after being

296
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,480
transferred to the field infected plants

297
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,480
the wilted plants will have a reddish

298
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,279
brown uh Crown so if you you cut the

299
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,140
crown open longitudely and I'll show you

300
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,720
a slide of this you'll see a this

301
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,120
discoloration on the inside it'll be a

302
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,880
firm Rod of the crown

303
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,220
um can be hard to ID based on Crown

304
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,839
symptoms of dying plants because the

305
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,519
crowns typically turn brown in short

306
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,260
order so

307
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,040
um which the same thing happens with

308
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:58,560
frost injury uh flooding of a plant dies

309
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,779
the crown is going to turn brown in in a

310
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,540
short period of time

311
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:07,260
but infected transplants seem to be the

312
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,000
main source of the disease in Alabama

313
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,820
so with management you want to plant the

314
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,800
Z Street material when possible hard to

315
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,540
pick up this disease by looking at the

316
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,760
transplants as they come in

317
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,040
Scout the field early on and remove

318
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,320
dying plants as soon as possible so even

319
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,959
in the fall after after planting or in

320
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,360
early winter period look for plants that

321
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,920
are dying check to see if they might

322
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,380
have symptoms of anthracnose and then

323
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,420
discard those as quickly as possible so

324
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,040
it doesn't spread then as the season

325
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,140
progresses you want to follow protect

326
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,060
the fungicide program early in the

327
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,300
season to try and keep that disease in

328
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,300
check

329
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,459
on the left you can see it on the upper

330
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,279
Leafs upper left corner that plant

331
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:53,639
starting to die down

332
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:55,680
if you what you want to do is uh

333
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,800
sacrifice one of those plants that is

334
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,920
still green but obviously on its way out

335
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,000
and cut the stem open the crown open and

336
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,700
that's when you're going to see this

337
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,959
reddish brown discoloration

338
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:10,579
you wait for the plant to be completely

339
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,579
Brown it's just going to be about

340
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:18,300
and you see uh just

341
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,360
symptoms of anthracnose on the left from

342
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,680
a healthy Crown to one that is uh

343
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,839
completely

344
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,180
been destroyed by it basically as a firm

345
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,560
or out remember picture on the right is

346
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,380
what I just showed you earlier so

347
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,079
dracnose Crown wrap uh significant

348
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,779
disease when it does show up

349
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,760
now if I top through a root in Crown rot

350
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:40,320
uh we used to call these water mold

351
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,860
fungi

352
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,220
um

353
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,800
guess that name from the the wet

354
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,440
conditions that this pathogen prefers

355
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,959
and you'll often see plants like the one

356
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,820
on the left that just suddenly Wilt and

357
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:56,760
die you don't see a progression of the

358
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,980
disease it just it goes down quickly

359
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,800
slice the stem open on that again you'll

360
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,800
look for maybe a pinkish rose color but

361
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,180
it can also be reddish brown to Brown

362
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,760
in the crown

363
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,920
usually on the upper part of the crown

364
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,899
some pictures from Dr Connor to share

365
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,300
with me from the lab from earlier this

366
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,740
year I believe but you can see uh phytop

367
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,600
there

368
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,920
or crown rot and some of the symptoms

369
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,920
inside of those crowns

370
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,339
so this disease really likes it wet

371
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:28,740
that's that's the main thing with these

372
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,500
water mold pathogens so symptoms begin

373
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,360
in the upper part of the crown uh young

374
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,779
Lisa will suddenly and you'll get

375
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,880
complete collapse excuse me of the plant

376
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:41,699
uh within days

377
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,079
and the plan sometimes will break at the

378
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:46,800
upper part of the crown when you try and

379
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:49,620
lift it from the soil uh quickly

380
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,260
cut that Crown longitudally you may see

381
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,480
a rose pink discoloration usually in the

382
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,920
upper part of the crown or it can be

383
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,779
brown and eventually that'll just

384
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,360
disintegrate

385
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,760
now when the disease is not bad and when

386
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,139
conditions dry out maybe you get some

387
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,399
warm temperatures some of these plants

388
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:07,399
will recover

389
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,500
but they're usually going to be stunted

390
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:13,079
and not produce as much as a healthy

391
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:16,079
plant during the season

392
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:18,180
warm wet conditions poorly drained soils

393
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,699
favor infection

394
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,980
so management especially in a commercial

395
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:26,160
field because phytopter can't survive in

396
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,079
the soil is as clusters of resistant

397
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,000
type spores fumigation would be an

398
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,920
option if you have a limited space for

399
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,620
planting or if you have a heavy

400
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,779
infection there are resistant varieties

401
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,600
available and you want to provide good

402
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:42,120
soil drainage when choosing a site and

403
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,920
you want to avoid low wet fields or

404
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,660
fields that have a history of this

405
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,980
disease because it can be quite

406
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,980
devastating when it gets going

407
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,240
left you could see a plant that

408
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,339
eventually uh was infected with

409
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,540
phytopper on the right is a slide I

410
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:59,220
showed you earlier but you see those

411
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,680
plants appeared to recover from

412
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,300
phytother but they're what about one

413
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,220
one-fifth the size of those healthy

414
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,899
plants in the left

415
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,459
oftentimes you might see them in a row

416
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,019
or a few plants together where the

417
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:12,440
disease is spread from one plant to the

418
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,440
next office

419
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,180
okay let's get to the cool diseases the

420
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,699
fruit rots and these this is what you're

421
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,860
seeing now if you if you're uh

422
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:25,139
taking your crop or if you have if

423
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,779
you're you picking yourself gray mold

424
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:30,560
detritus gray mold on the left

425
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:34,339
and on the right you could see

426
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,339
anthracnose fruit rod

427
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,600
and gray mole of course gets his name

428
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,600
from the

429
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:45,540
so here's just different different uh

430
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,060
levels of infection on strawberry fruit

431
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,100
from left to right but that gray stuff

432
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,680
you see there is fungal mycelium the

433
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,940
body of the fungus along with spores on

434
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,639
the right it almost looks of that fruit

435
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,920
is mummified by the path

436
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,839
this this stands out pretty much in the

437
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,860
field I'm sure any of you who've walked

438
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,600
through strawberries or grow

439
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,520
strawberries have seen this problem it's

440
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,280
an annual problem in Alabama

441
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,439
a little more common when we have uh wet

442
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,900
conditions like we had last year

443
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:16,319
especially in in some cases in some

444
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,720
parts this year this is just a

445
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,439
close-up of what the that mycelium looks

446
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,540
like these individual Haifa and the blue

447
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,880
and then off the hyphy you get these

448
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,860
clusters of botrytus spores on the left

449
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,200
hand side of the screen looks like a

450
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,120
somebody's bringing over some flowers

451
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,880
and then under in that star you can see

452
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,799
a couple individual spores and if you

453
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,500
see botritus in the field

454
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:42,780
and if you just see that gray Mass on

455
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,400
this on the fruit just flick it with

456
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,140
your finger sometime if it's dry and

457
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,360
you'll just see these four clouds come

458
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,640
off and that's individual spores being

459
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,740
released one of those spores laying on a

460
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,440
neighboring fruit and that can infect

461
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,120
the fruit directly so uh gives you some

462
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,640
idea how rapid

463
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,720
this packaging or how aggressive it can

464
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,780
be

465
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,059
this was in an organic field last year

466
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,919
in our region but you can see that

467
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:09,240
growing mold for me again if you just

468
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,400
flick that with your finger you would

469
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,400
see a massive spores blown off

470
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,140
typically these fruit might show some

471
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,039
darkening first but the mold comes off

472
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,039
fairly quickly

473
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:27,000
I mentioned it comes in on transplants

474
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,220
now this is a garden store in uh Lee

475
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,140
County that I when I when I go to a

476
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,640
garden store I look for diseases I mean

477
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,620
most of you are probably picking out

478
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,160
nice strawberry fruit or healthy flowers

479
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:40,380
I look for problems this was just from a

480
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,840
basket of strawberries being sold these

481
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,120
were probably the last six plants left

482
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,620
on the star shelf but they had a fruit

483
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,299
on them which was interesting but it

484
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,200
also had gray mold on them so this is

485
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:52,200
something you wouldn't want to bring

486
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,360
into your home Garden say and definitely

487
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,280
obviously with a commercial grower you'd

488
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,980
want to avoid this but

489
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,419
it was just sort of interesting on a at

490
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,520
least in the garden center

491
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,679
made for a nice picture

492
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,980
so would betrayed as gray mold it's it's

493
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:11,340
widespread has numerous hosts

494
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,500
survives and dead plant material

495
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,740
free water cool temperatures favorite

496
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:20,700
development so right now it's ideal uh

497
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,740
with the rain we had in recent days

498
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,020
green berries appear to be more

499
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,020
resistant to infection than red berries

500
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,360
uh management is to avoid disease

501
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,760
transplants which is hard to do and

502
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,559
avoid allowing over ripened fruit to sit

503
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,660
in the field that's probably the biggest

504
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,880
problem where Growers have extended

505
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,380
themselves uh more Acres than they

506
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,840
needed they can't pick them fast enough

507
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,820
in these fruits just start to rot in the

508
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,280
field so what you'd like to do is remove

509
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,940
and destroy the diseased fruit and uh

510
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:54,539
Ash earlier talked about removing fruit

511
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,919
with damage from insects and the same

512
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,320
thing with botrytus you would like to

513
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,799
get take those fruit off the plant and

514
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,840
then get them out of the field bury them

515
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:05,280
um I know a number of Growers that they

516
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,600
have time to remove the fruit throw them

517
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,799
in the center of the road but then they

518
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,820
they leave them there they don't they

519
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,679
can't pick them up because they don't

520
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,020
have enough time throwing enough people

521
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,700
power and that's still a source of

522
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,179
inoculum

523
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:21,000
this disease can be controlled with with

524
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:23,100
fungicides on a strict schedule uh you

525
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,559
need to get ahead of it caftan is always

526
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,179
a nice product to to add to your mix but

527
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,580
there's a number of other products of

528
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:32,880
different chemistries that are available

529
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,320
uh Dr Connor Dr Vincent and myself have

530
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,940
been doing uh

531
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,480
we've been doing some resistant

532
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:43,140
profiling of fields over the last year

533
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,240
and a half looking for uh

534
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,520
populations of botrytus that are

535
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,020
resisted to different fungicide classes

536
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,820
working with a professor over the

537
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,500
University of Georgia we're continuing

538
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,380
this project but we but we found about

539
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,960
80 percent of the fields that

540
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,780
um many that many of the botrytus

541
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,299
populations were resistant to uh class

542
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,700
one I believe was class 11 fungicide so

543
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:08,220
products like top semam would be uh

544
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:11,340
people spraying it were were not having

545
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,020
any benefits from it and uh I think I

546
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,820
think class 11 was the other one we were

547
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,940
having problems with uh things like

548
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,500
abound just not effective any longer and

549
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,400
that's problem throughout the southeast

550
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,400
it's not in Alabama

551
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,440
now with direct nose fruit Rod is also

552
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,419
occurring we saw it in about 25 percent

553
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,360
of the fields last year also seeing

554
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:34,740
resistance to this fellow in a in some

555
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,080
of the products

556
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,539
but we don't see it as

557
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,360
common as botrytus but it was out there

558
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:46,140
last year and I did see it this year

559
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:48,900
has that Telltale kind of a sunken area

560
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:52,440
on the fruit uh they could range from

561
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:54,000
tan to Brown to uh black

562
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,640
on the right there was a field down

563
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,760
brooding that had five or six fruit on

564
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,500
one plant uh you have to just just move

565
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,960
from plant to plant

566
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,039
just different examples of anthracnose I

567
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,659
think the one in the upper left-hand

568
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,340
corner you can see the initial symptom

569
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,799
and it almost looks like a thumb print

570
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,480
on these

571
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,860
in that one but that might be the

572
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,100
initial symptom and then you start

573
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:19,020
getting more darkening of the tissue

574
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,980
and the spores are then produced off

575
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,980
that tissue as well

576
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,120
so the source of the pathogen is also

577
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,679
from Nursery stock but it's hard to

578
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,740
detect coming on in

579
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:35,039
disease itself is favored by rain high

580
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,020
humidity warm temperatures all common

581
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,780
situations in Alabama

582
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,179
rain and wind can spread the disease

583
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,100
across the field fairly quickly

584
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:46,320
and then the dark lesions can form on

585
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,460
green fruit but also on mature fruit as

586
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,500
well

587
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,840
then management is to buy plants from a

588
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,880
repeal Nursery one that you or your

589
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,720
colleagues have had luck with in the

590
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,900
past

591
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,940
uh plant anthracnose resisting cultivars

592
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,820
I I threw sweet Charlie up here as one

593
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:05,460
and I Edgar I hope that's that's the

594
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,220
correct variety but there are some

595
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,620
available for resistance to anthraktos

596
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,659
and you want to monitor fields for hot

597
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:15,179
spots of interactives and then remove

598
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,679
infected plants not just the fruit but

599
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,299
whole affected plants you might be able

600
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,039
to limit the amount of damage you've

601
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:22,320
seen a feel from this disease or amount

602
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,900
of spread so the grower I talked to who

603
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,760
had anthracnose on his fruit a couple

604
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,919
weeks ago I told him remove that plant

605
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,960
and a couple plants next to it and he

606
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,600
might be able to compartmentalize that

607
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,820
disease and a keep it from spreading

608
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,460
rapidly

609
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,260
another disease when you take those

610
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,900
fruit off you also want to get them out

611
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,480
of the field Sanitation

612
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:49,620
so management there is a pre-planned dip

613
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,419
that uh doctor uh Edgar discussed in a

614
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:54,059
publication a couple years ago so

615
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:57,919
certain fungicides uh one we use is

616
00:23:54,059 --> 00:24:00,059
switch can be used as dips on your

617
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,460
transplants to reduce incidence of

618
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:03,600
anaphorectos and gray mole before

619
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,820
planting

620
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,039
and typically when your transplants come

621
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,900
in you you mix up the solution of the

622
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,940
Fungicide and then submerge the

623
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,799
transplants in the dip for at least or

624
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,080
dip them in in the solution for at least

625
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:19,320
two minutes and then plant and that can

626
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,059
reduce to your initial and oxygen load

627
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,700
uh if you have problems you want to

628
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:25,200
begin fungicide program early and follow

629
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,120
the guidelines and I would I would

630
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,880
follow the guidelines outline in the

631
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,559
Southeast Regional strawberry IPM guide

632
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,480
2022.

633
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,400
uh I'm not going to go through all the

634
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,039
chemicals because it gets complicated

635
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,159
very quickly but the website's down in

636
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:43,440
the bottom but if you just get your

637
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,159
go to your Google machine and type in

638
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,100
southeast strawberry IPM guide

639
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:52,320
2022 and it'll take you to that link and

640
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,919
then uh there's great information I

641
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,039
think Ash mentioned uh on uh insect

642
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,440
control weed control uh variety

643
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,200
selection and also on Disease Control I

644
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,419
think on pages 45 to 50 they outline

645
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,520
disease resistance management promote

646
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,500
them threat no sound bertritis

647
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,659
but it's very complicated to try and

648
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,500
explain it in a short webinar would be

649
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:15,500
would be

650
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,440
two more diseases I wanted I want to

651
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,880
mention one is Rise of this Fruita this

652
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,340
is one that

653
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,080
have you ever left

654
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,700
a carton of strawberries on your counter

655
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,679
for any length of time or even in the

656
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,539
refrigerator this is what you might have

657
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,760
seen looks like your your strawberries

658
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:36,240
have grown a beard this is also known as

659
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:39,740
old old gray man's beard we have a white

660
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,740
to gray tint to it

661
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,820
sometimes rise of this which is a fungal

662
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,820
disease is joined by another pathogen

663
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,980
name known as mucer

664
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,020
um both together or sometimes they can

665
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,120
be confused I confuse them

666
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,860
the blackberries on the right I found

667
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,500
those in my refrigerator a couple weeks

668
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,659
ago after a short vacation so made for a

669
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,260
good picture and for this seminar but uh

670
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:06,120
so rise was fruit Roth It's a fungal

671
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:09,299
pathogen

672
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,059
lives on decaying organic matter

673
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:13,559
the initial affection appears as

674
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:14,400
discolored water soaked spot on the

675
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,679
fruit

676
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,200
sometimes tannish looking and somewhat

677
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:21,240
soft fruit appears to be wounded or

678
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,460
where you wounded the fruit that's where

679
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,840
this fungus will attack

680
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,520
um under conditions of high relative

681
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,500
humidity barriers will become covered

682
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,539
with this coat of white mycelium that's

683
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,919
it's fungal growth that that hair you're

684
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:34,080
seeing

685
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,419
and that uh management is removed plant

686
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,520
debris this organic matter remove ripe

687
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:40,140
berries as soon as possible for Harvest

688
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,059
don't let them sit out in the field and

689
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,220
then maybe be gentle when you're picking

690
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:47,220
avoid bruise in the fruit which can

691
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,260
increase incidence of Horizons that

692
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,880
wound that you cause then a rapid

693
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,919
post-harvest schooling I think Ash

694
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,059
mentioned that as far as insect control

695
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:55,679
as well

696
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,600
uh cooling them down it's not going to

697
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,760
stop the disease but it will slow it

698
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,799
down

699
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,159
we don't recommend fungicides for

700
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:09,140
rhizopus it's mainly a cultural cultural

701
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:09,140
practices will reduce this problem

702
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:15,260
last disease I wanted to talk about is a

703
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:19,460
new disease for Alabama

704
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:23,480
neopestal lab neopestalo

705
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,480
lociopsis such a terrible name

706
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,299
Dr Connor found this down in Bruton back

707
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,659
in

708
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:32,820
it was March Mr degree down air new

709
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:34,799
grower for the state this is a disease

710
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,440
it's a fungal disease that was detected

711
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,080
in Florida about three years ago uh more

712
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,760
recently detected in Georgia also in

713
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,059
Michigan Texas and a few other places

714
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,460
but Dr Connor was able to First find it

715
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:49,080
in Alabama down in South Alabama and

716
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,240
this is the disease that appears to be

717
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,520
coming in on transplants but once it

718
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,720
gets into the field it can survive in

719
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,460
the soil and on debris and be a an

720
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,240
annual problem and it can be a severe

721
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,220
problem

722
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,799
and you can see some of the significant

723
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,620
least spots on that plan on the left

724
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,880
and then I took the pictures in the

725
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,380
center and the right but you can see the

726
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,960
least spot there but then going and

727
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:16,020
going to the fruit and you get a lesion

728
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,419
that looks a little bit like uh

729
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,140
like anthracnose fruit rot but it's it's

730
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:23,340
much I would say massive compared

731
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,900
comparison to interactive I should have

732
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,120
had them side by side for a year but

733
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:31,260
then you get that black fruiting

734
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,000
structures growing in that lesion itself

735
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:36,559
here's more pictures from what I

736
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,559
collected a few weeks ago

737
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:43,080
so uh really a nasty disease so it can

738
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,480
cause extreme yield loss it can destroy

739
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,940
entire Fields it's happening in Florida

740
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,919
you can't spread quickly to other fields

741
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:53,340
or within a within a field into other

742
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:56,279
fields nearby once it is introduced rain

743
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:59,279
events definitely uh

744
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:02,460
aggravated or I should say uh help it

745
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:04,260
out and spread it causes a leaf and

746
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,880
fruit spot as I showed you initially but

747
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,559
eventually it can infect the roots and

748
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,360
the crowns of plants causing plant death

749
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,500
and that's where we're really getting

750
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,360
concerned with

751
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,059
so with management you want to limit

752
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,640
operations when uh when plants are wet

753
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:19,080
to avoid movement of this disease if you

754
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,000
do see the disease you want to remove

755
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,940
those infected plants as soon as

756
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,440
possible and where practical

757
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,460
because you can't stop it from spreading

758
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,640
and of course you want to get those

759
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,919
plants out of the field so it doesn't

760
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,600
establish in the soil itself

761
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,580
so there's been work done at Florida

762
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,320
where they've had the disease for a few

763
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,940
years

764
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,919
they've been doing fungicide trials and

765
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:43,799
I think with one year data they saw that

766
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:47,539
usually something like thyram and switch

767
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:50,100
rotated with thyram or thyram cap tan

768
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:51,779
rhyme tilt or Inspire May reduce

769
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,399
incidence on the fruit so they're still

770
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:56,820
working on this to see how effective

771
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:59,700
these fungicide programs are uh

772
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:01,740
Florida's also was evaluating our our

773
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,080
current varieties that are available for

774
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,299
see if any had resistance to disease and

775
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,220
a couple had some I don't say called

776
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:09,720
tolerance but it appeared to have a

777
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,600
slight level of resistance but nothing

778
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,299
to write home about and there are

779
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,600
programs now trying to develop resistant

780
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:21,059
varieties to the to this pathogen though

781
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,159
the pathogens is so new that these

782
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,779
programs are just getting started as I

783
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,120
said we've found that just in one field

784
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:29,340
in Alabama came in on transplants

785
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,340
probably coming from Illinois We Believe

786
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:34,320
or the Midwest and um

787
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,600
and it was just on one variety coming

788
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,640
from that Nursery out of five that the

789
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,100
grower planted which was interest so we

790
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,820
uh we recommend in his case to destroy

791
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:48,240
those plants as soon as possible

792
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:50,100
so with that I will stop uh that is me

793
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,100
after a long day of picking diseases

794
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:56,480
with a Virgin uh

795
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,480
strawberry daiquiri I believe

796
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,580
but again my name is Ed Sakura with the

797
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:06,440
Auburn University Cooperative Extension

798
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:09,779
system you can email me directly at

799
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,580
s-i-k-o-r-e-j at auburn.edu I'll be

800
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:13,320
happy to talk to you there and then

801
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,360
follow me on Twitter uh if you're

802
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,520
interested in diseases or agriculture in

803
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,679
general I also work with tree fruits

804
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,559
small fruit

805
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:24,179
vegetables corn and soybeans so and hops

806
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,620
in heaven okay so if you have any

807
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:28,500
interest in those crops and you're on

808
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:30,299
Twitter please follow me and then uh

809
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,340
again for Disease Control you really

810
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,779
want to look at the southeast

811
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,399
guide

812
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:40,440
uh again the 2022 strawberry IPM guide

813
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:41,880
uh and look at the Z section look at the

814
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,580
fungicides and look at resistance

815
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,419
management that's all very important so

816
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,419
with that I'll stop
