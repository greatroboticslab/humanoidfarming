  "text": "Bhoochetana Department\nof Agriculture Presents ICRISAT DigitalGreen KSDA Coconut planting method Namaste my dear farmer friends. My name is Basavaraj. I work with Icrisat\ncompany as a researcher. Our farmers grow a lot, but\nwhile growing coconuts if they want to know how to do so they would need information. We will talk to the\nHorticultural department about how to plant saplings from their researcher Please take full advantage of this. Sir, Namaste. Namaste. My name is Basavaraj. I work with Icrisat company as a researcher We want to teach our farmers on how to plant coconut saplings My name is Dr. M. Prashant I work as a sapling\nresearcher and look after farm management. Yes, Mr Basavaraj A lot of farmers are coming and we tell them to change their planting methods. A lot of farmers hesitate to implement our method. They doubt it. One doubt is that we tell them to make a 3 feet deep 3 feet wide and 3 feet long ditch. And we tell them to plant it. We tell the farmers this. Farmers doubt this because the saplings will be of this size. So they think- why should they make such a big ditch and plant it. This is their doubt. Can you show us a demo on how plan the sapling? Okay Mr. Basavaraj, like you said, I will show them how to plant, measure and mix it. And how to plant it, support it and fasten it, I will show you the demo Come let us go see the demo One meter means 3.3 feet 3.3 feet depth, width and length Mr. Basavaraj I will show you how to plant saplings You should pay a lot of attention and understand it, so now You have to make a ditch like this which measures 3 feet in depth, width and 3 feet length After making the ditch it is very important to\nknow how to fill it up To fill this ditch the soil that was removed is here Along with it you have to mix sand with sand you have to mix manure mix it in a 1:1:1 ratio which means 1 part sand 1 part manure and 1 part red soil or excavated soil you have to mix all these\nthree and fill the ditch Once you have filled the ditch if possible you can make a waterway we have to give water route once it is closed and watered the soil goes down by one or two inches Why do we add sand? We add sand because coconuts attract white ants White ants will eat the sapling and kill it, since there is manure we have to add sand, red soil and Dimet to stop white ants We use Dimet for white ants This how you fill the ditch and prepare it Mr. Basavaraj, as you can see we have filled the ditch with equal amounts of sand, manure and soil After it is levelled like this we will tie ropes like this while plating we tie ropes, when they are tied we get the pit\u2019s centre point So we tie a rope like this on both sides then you get the center point and mark it. Now we will remove soil with a spade After removing the soil not too deep people have misunderstood that we will plant it 3 feet under it is a misunderstanding,\neveryone says that and then add Dimet or Foret into the ditch to avoid white ants it has to be mixed like this 2 spoons are enough? Yes it is enough Can you smell it now? Yes You will get a foul smell\nand insects stay away While planting this, you\nhave to keep in mind that You will have to plant it usually like this 1 inch above the coconut If you add more than this the sapling will get disease because mud will enter this part To avoid this and prevent this we will plant it in the centre and fill the soil one\ninch above the coconut After planting it like this then you can see the leaves are like fans when it is windy they move to avoid this we will plant a stick next to it and compact the surrounding with your feet and If you have drip system, you can install it If not, you have to pour water from the top The plant will settle well after it is set we will tie it to the stick This will avoid falling from wind and setting of the roots After watering it what to do next? No, nothign else, If you want to you can add more soil here and level and compact it with your feet If you compact it the plant will not shake and will grow properly You have ties the plant to the stick Yes it is very important Once it is planted the coconut will be inside we have to keep pushing it below also not to let the mud get in here but dont push it too deep like the proverb \u201cWalk straight like a coconut tree\u201d so we make a 3 by 3 by 3 ditch and we have filled it with soil, manure and sand and planted it Notice that that we have made PP on these because of this and the leaves being like a fan it moves when there is wind When it moves so much the roots wont set well and the plant may die to avoid that we have this stick here and tied the leaves to it and also the steam whne you tie it this plant wont move in the wind and no other problem will occur and it will have good roots and will grow properly What is the distance between the saplings? Length and breath? can you explain it in detail If you want to make a coconut grove then you will have to 7.5 meters between saplings and rows that is if you want to make a coconut grove some farmer wants to grow crops with coconuts we have to increase the distance between saplings and rows Here we have left 7.5 meters between saplings and rows Only to make a coconut grove? Yes So according we have planted it With this spacing how many can we plant in an acre? If we have a distance of 7.5 meters then in 1 hectare we can have 177 trees which is in 2.5 acres So for 1 acer if you do it the old way they will have 30 feet distance if you do it like that then in 1 acer you can have 40 trees and in 1 hectare you can have 120 trees so when you plant like this you can have 177 trees which is more trees in a particular area and we will get more profit Mr. Basavaraj, even if you want to plant on the main farm area we have to follow a certain procedure. Because, if we do not follow it properly the rows will not be aligned They will not be straight and when the distance is not equal the farm will look bad because of the planting methods To avoid this, we should first make a baseline From the boundary of the property you have to leave 7.5 metres How much distance? 7.5 meters and then make the baseline after making the line You should make markers at both the ends of the baseline and attach thread it will come out straight Once this is done we have to make another baseline like this once this is done measure the angle at this corner and they should be right angle with the help of tape then what ever you will plant it will be at a distance of 7.5 meters and then the rows will look aligned from all directions even diagonally they look aligned If you see it straight or cross or from any corner they will look aligned You can notice that in this farm at our main farm you can see it from here you have mark 7.5 meters and here on this row We mark 7.5 meters and will tie a rope and mark 7.5 meters here as well and place stick here The place where the stick is will be the centre of the pit and dig it centre the sticks and dig the pit yes dig the pit After making the pits next we should mix in equal quantities manure, soil and sand and fill the pit So if we plan the pits and fill it and then plant here you can see North to south the rows are straight, also form the sides rows look straight and also from east to west the rows look straight So when we plan like this we can have a planned farm and we can provide nutrition and minerals equally to all the pants and the plants will grow\nwell and more output Up until now, you have taught our farmer friends how to plant coconut saplings to dig a pit We thank Prashant Sir and and the horticulture research centre the staff and the staff here on behalf of us and all the farmers I thank you again. Namaste. Similarly I would like to say that Because of your department,\nthe farmers are able to share this research with\nthem and inform them about how to plant the saplings. Through us, you are able\nto show the farmers I would like to thank you and your team on behalf of us and our research I thank you very much. Summary questions: 1. How big should\nthe pit be to plant a coconut sapling? 2. What are the materials\nto be filled in the pit? 3. How much distance should be\nthere between the saplings? Researcher: Dr. M. Prashant, HRS. Camera: Renuka Murthy, Volunteer,\nHorticulture Department Actor: Basavaraju RT,\nICRISAT Technical advice:",
