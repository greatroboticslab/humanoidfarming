  "text": "we love shooting this video series of Jesse Hall farmer out of Arlington and one of the things I want you to pay attention to is how he has changed over the years not on his operation but his mindset I'm gonna get out of the way and this way Osito hello I'm Jesse Hall and I'm farming over in eastern Kingsbury County I currently live on my woman my mother his dad's place where she grew up years and years ago I started farming back in about 1996 dad gave up about 20 acres of land that was kind of my start and I him and I had been farming together you know pretty much ever since til he's passing here about a year ago and dad's basically the one that got our family started no-tilling here back in 1988 he was friends with dr. Dwayne Beck and doing at the time was telling dad about this new idea of no-till and we were having some problems with soil erosion at the time we wanted to address and that was kind of what we did on the wet years particularly you know we would really really struggle with wet spots you know and and we were being basically a corn soybean rotation and occasionally we'd throw in a note or a winter wheat or something like that but it's predominantly corn soybean so what we did is we would get the chisel plow out and we chose a plow all the low areas out and then we teal kolevatov the spring and we thought well you've got all these wet spots so this will fix it well you'd get in and you plant it and then then you only would flood out on you again and it never did us any good so then we decide okay we're we're gonna try a rotary hoe so we go out and we'd rotary hoe the fields in all these wet spots and basically that dried it out that that worked a little better but then that planet every we'd see that there was on top of the ground and then you had a mess well in about 2000 probably 13 or 14 we switched over to it to a basically a permanent three-way or rotation where we brought oats back in so so once we see once we started to your our three-way rotation a lot of those wet spots went away you know there's a lot of there's a few areas maybe acre patches or so here and there that were there were always borderline planning I mean you'd go through with good conditions and you kind of slop through that those low spots and you'd get to the other end and then those little spots never really recovered a lot of those spots went away you know I take home messages you got to give stuff time and if you're currently not a no teller the big thing that you want to do is don't switch the whole farm over to no tea all all in one year just go field by field let it be a progressive thing but if you bring in small grain and start cover cropping you're going to get your soil structure much faster and you're going to start seeing your soil turning around much faster and if you bring livestock and cover crops into it it's just going to accelerate that whole process even more so so instead of being three to five years you might you might start seeing a difference maybe sooner than that a lot of people don't think they can make any money on small drain and I disagree you know you might have to market a little harder and you can do it but the one thing you have to take into consideration is the yield bump you get on the other two years [Music] you",
