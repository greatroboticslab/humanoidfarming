let's give them all over welcome

19
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,460
anyway you guys without any more is

20
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:28,890
playing back from the collection

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,920
research this is just how we move wire

22
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,299
you can see there's lire on that

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,450
irrigator these are lateral moves that

24
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,640
move straight we also have pivot to go

25
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,310
go around but we just have the wire

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,020
running through there in those buckets

27
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,439
there's a rope hanging down with a fence

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,479
post on it and and those buckets give a

29
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,049
just enough weight that it doesn't the

30
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:59,819
fence doesn't blow and and and stuff

31
00:01:52,049 --> 00:02:01,890
like that so that works pretty good you

32
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:07,740
do like Dan does you get Cody to do it

33
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:10,679
and Casey you know but these are these

34
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,360
are bar jay-z Catalan and once we

35
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,700
started moving if they could hear the

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,620
irrigator you can see them my daughter

37
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,840
took that with her cell phone so it was

38
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,910
into the Sun you can't see it so good

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,340
but terrible place to work it's kind of

40
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,160
like here when you look out the window

41
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:29,130
but as soon as they heard that motor

42
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,450
those irrigation pivot motors run and

43
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,609
they're just a word they're not very

44
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,640
loud but they could hear them and they

45
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:37,680
just come they'd come at a dead run and

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,530
so we were actually moving out of corn

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,420
stalks into swath grazing and I just

48
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:46,290
said move that Cheviot and those in the

49
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:49,380
process and then I've got the next

50
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:53,819
saddle show they're moving from this

51
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:57,139
field into the corn stalks so we had a

52
00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:00,569
time what we did is we swath grazed

53
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:02,609
between I'll show you all the quality

54
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,609
and stuff we swath grades between this

55
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:07,410
oats and pea cover crop that was growing

56
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:10,620
behind winter wheat and then corn stalks

57
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,239
and until we balanced a diet I think hen

58
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,420
was talking about is exactly right

59
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:20,459
exactly the thing we do with the thing

60
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:23,160
we do with a farm ground in terms of

61
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,769
trying to build organic matter in feed

62
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,590
them soil microorganisms actly the same

63
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:30,470
thing and everybody wants to do turnip

64
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,959
and radishes and clover and whatever

65
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,790
well that's not enough carbon you have

66
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,940
too much nitrogen you just burn it up

67
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,670
and and you've got to have the balanced

68
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,920
diet now here the cows are moving we

69
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,170
move this lateral move down here they're

70
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,640
moving you'll notice if you look closely

71
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:51,410
they they mostly have collars on and

72
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:56,269
they have little fitbit's on their feet

73
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:58,370
and and what those collars do is tell

74
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,860
you how much their head is moving up and

75
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:04,519
down and eating and then the Fitbit

76
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,079
tells you how many steps and to be real

77
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,819
honest with you I haven't analyzed all

78
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:12,349
that that data yet because they're just

79
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:15,530
a mountain of data that we've got to

80
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:17,180
take care of this big draw here there's

81
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,470
some tall grass prairie there and

82
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,900
there's big draw there with tall grass

83
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:24,169
prairie that's our our area they could

84
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,220
get into when it got cold and crappy and

85
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,110
that's something you got to think about

86
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,500
it wind breaks and stuff until we had

87
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,330
that Christmas blizzard that's what

88
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,240
happened I move the pivot again you

89
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:38,630
watch them coming from back over here at

90
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:42,139
a dead run down to this pivot so they

91
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:44,120
they really like to swaths ot stuff

92
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:46,520
because that was the candy but you also

93
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,690
have to it's like we were joking here

94
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,760
everybody's coming over and getting

95
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:53,810
roles right it's a bit too much

96
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:57,410
carbohydrate so and and and those of you

97
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,150
that had that had hamburgers you got a

98
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,130
chance because you had your protein

99
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,050
right but I'm not sure you might have to

100
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:11,090
eat another steak before you leave here

101
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:14,180
if you do them any more so the Cole X

102
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:17,330
research farm is owned by farmers and

103
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:22,190
and actually the idea for the cold lake

104
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:24,020
started at the old steak house down over

105
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:28,250
the hill one night after field day in

106
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:29,660
the in the 80s and some guys said well

107
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,830
we want to we should have a research

108
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,350
farm and I just said you don't want the

109
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,050
government to own it

110
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,310
you want to own it yourself because the

111
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,720
government owns it you can never tell

112
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,980
what's going to happen and you got to

113
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,010
have the government involved and that's

114
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,320
me to a certain extent working for SDSU

115
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:50,680
but we we have to have the farmers own

116
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,250
dan is actually our president now so our

117
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:56,080
board of directors is important to us

118
00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:00,280
I'm just going to be real brief today

119
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,900
the climate will change but it will

120
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:07,390
still be a continental climate will

121
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:09,280
still have cold winters here relatively

122
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:12,960
cold winters cold and dry normally

123
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,270
winters will have hot and dry summers

124
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,800
that's not going to change now it's

125
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,180
going to change a bit but we're still

126
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,190
going to be a continental climate not

127
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,360
going to turn into a California or a

128
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:27,850
Florida a bigger issue though and at

129
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,310
least in your Mike lifetimes in the next

130
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,950
600 years or something which is beyond

131
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,630
our lifetime degradation the ecosystem

132
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,750
will have more potential impact and I

133
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:40,960
just wrote one of those articles for

134
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,660
farm journal it at one time we had the

135
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,760
Cronin's involved in and now I've got a

136
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,500
guy from Nebraska than working with but

137
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,210
I talked about that and especially as

138
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,610
you sit along the Missouri River here

139
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,190
and one of the things I think about is

140
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,750
all the people used to travel up and

141
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,120
down this river and think of what they

142
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,970
found when they came through here and

143
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,880
how is it different now from when it was

144
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,320
when they came and in you know four or

145
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,350
five hundred years or when Lewis and

146
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:12,300
Clark came through and and it wasn't

147
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:14,560
like what the revenant shows by the way

148
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,210
that was supposed to be here but we

149
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,740
don't have the big force of stuff we

150
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:23,260
didn't have that much climate change in

151
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:25,330
the last 200 years but but anyway but

152
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,180
what we've done is we took the land

153
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,790
around Gettysburg and we took the

154
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,490
organic matter down to half of what it

155
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,800
was when we came here and so it didn't

156
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,450
hold as much water and it wasn't as

157
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,330
resilient as it should have been and so

158
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:43,479
when I taught school here in 1975

159
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:45,910
through 78 which some of you didn't know

160
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:48,520
but a lot of you did she was a student

161
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,400
not one of mine but she was a student

162
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,020
she's like a freshman

163
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:57,020
when I left but we had dirt blown over

164
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,520
the road all time and we could only do

165
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,280
wheat and Sommerfeld and look at what's

166
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,320
different now and and it's because we

167
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,570
started to restore that soil to where it

168
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:10,010
should be and it holds more organic

169
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:16,010
matter than it did in 1976 and not as

170
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:18,620
much as it did in 1776 okay so this is

171
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,419
the thing we need to look at and that's

172
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,770
the thing we talked about in cattle I

173
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:26,030
think integration plays a role in that

174
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,889
ecosystems harvest sunlight energy and

175
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,690
drive all other process removing the

176
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:31,310
products from the ecosystem reduces the

177
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,050
energy available when the worst things

178
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,110
you can do is make hay on a piece of

179
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:38,630
ground and hold the hay off and not

180
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,010
bring anything back it's one of the

181
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,460
worst things you can do to an ecosystem

182
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:45,440
and so our North unit if you're familiar

183
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:50,480
with our farm we've got a half section a

184
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:53,170
big half section plus of 45 miles north

185
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,560
and it's been healing for a guy from the

186
00:08:53,170 --> 00:09:00,830
1930s on incredibly degraded ecosystem

187
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:04,160
and we bought it in 2000 and now we've

188
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,959
got it somewhat restored to lease it's

189
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,940
way better than what it was when we took

190
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:12,110
over it's better than the neighbours

191
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:16,130
pasture that's over grazed right before

192
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,779
it probably wasn't nutrients or all the

193
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,610
nutrients available or plant use or

194
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:22,580
environmental services or behave they'd

195
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:25,850
been leached eroded or transported from

196
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,279
the landscape if you've got saline seats

197
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:31,700
and those kind of things it's because

198
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:33,620
your nutrients are leaving where they

199
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,589
belong and going someplace else

200
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,820
that's fertilizer and those saline seeps

201
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:41,029
and we're going to eventually have to

202
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,650
put perennials systems back in there to

203
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:46,400
suck up those nutrients and big them

204
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:47,930
back to the top and then graze them and

205
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,170
put them back into place that's what

206
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,880
happened in the native Prairie

207
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,440
cover crops will help us balance our

208
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,589
water cycle a little better but they

209
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,910
won't totally do it on their own

210
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:59,930
ecosystems that leak nutrients turn into

211
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,190
desert

212
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,340
that's what's happened in North Africa

213
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,630
and all these places think about Israel

214
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:10,500
the land of milk and honey

215
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:12,300
climate hasn't changed that much in the

216
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,970
intervening years what happened is they

217
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,650
degraded the ecosystem and you can read

218
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,110
a thing that that a guy by the name of

219
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:22,470
Loudermilk wrote in the 1930s it's just

220
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,060
phenomenal what he found when he went to

221
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,930
Israel and looked what the soils are and

222
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:30,660
what they should have been we're doing

223
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:34,340
the same thing 120 car train of soybeans

224
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:38,010
contains 400,000 pounds of phosphorous

225
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:40,650
think of how many unit trains go out of

226
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,810
cell V and all these little circle

227
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,280
tracks here and there and across the

228
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,010
United States and they're all going

229
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:50,760
someplace like China they're not going

230
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:53,100
to send that phosphorus back to us so

231
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,140
we're mining when we're doing that we're

232
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,390
mining we're not farming remaining we're

233
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,390
taking the nutrients out send them

234
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:04,530
across the road February 20th last

235
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:06,930
Saturday or last something like that it

236
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,660
costs two dollars and 25 cents a bushel

237
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:15,960
to shift corn bushel corn to the west

238
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:17,460
coast from Aberdeen an elevator managed

239
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,410
from Aberdeen talking to me on the phone

240
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,830
and he says it costs me two dollars and

241
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:28,190
25 cents a bushel to ship my corn to the

242
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:31,140
west coast does that make any damn sense

243
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,570
hey making sense to me I mean why the

244
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,250
hell are we doing it and then they're

245
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,690
going to feed animals over there with it

246
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,520
with our and then their phosphorus is

247
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,780
there so we're spending that kind of

248
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,040
money and then we're loops sending the

249
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:45,240
phosphorus with it and Coltrane contains

250
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,280
7,200 tons of coal but when you're

251
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:52,110
digging up coal you're admitting to be a

252
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:54,120
miner that's what you do we take an oil

253
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:57,380
out your miner you know you're going to

254
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,850
take it it's just going to be gone but

255
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,680
when we started farming our gained

256
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,420
organic matter went out it was the same

257
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,220
thing

258
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:08,700
we took their gaining matter out gas it

259
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,770
off right and it would take at least one

260
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,810
coal train per half section in the top

261
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:19,080
just for the top six inches

262
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:21,029
a rain I mean top six inches of soil to

263
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,610
take all the organic matter that we lost

264
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:25,380
it's out of the top six inches one

265
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:29,250
Coltrain for a half section so if we're

266
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,420
going to restore to 2% in that top six

267
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,310
inches we're going to if we're going to

268
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,779
do that down to two or three foot just

269
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:35,430
think how many train loads of coal we'd

270
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,890
have to bring back in it's amazing

271
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:42,720
so we're partially using cover crops

272
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:46,800
through large extent to catch carbon in

273
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,300
the air and put it in the soil one of

274
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,070
the things I talk a lot and Danny's

275
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,300
heard me do this but when you ship out

276
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:58,350
oil we're working with cold pressing

277
00:12:53,300 --> 00:13:00,390
sunflowers in in in soybeans and flax

278
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,270
and whatever and we cold press it we get

279
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:06,510
the oil out of it we got good meal I

280
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:09,120
gave Don a bucket of soybean meal that

281
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,680
we we use for a protein supplement the

282
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,310
stuff that's left when we press the oil

283
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,020
out and and and now when we ship the oil

284
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,450
out all we've shipped out is carbon

285
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,400
dioxide and water

286
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,050
there's no minerals in there and mother

287
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,720
nature brings your back water she brings

288
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,790
you back carbon dioxide in the air and

289
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,670
if we do it right she brings your back

290
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,320
nitrogen in the air right we're not

291
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,450
transporting anything now if we use

292
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,410
those things here and keep all the

293
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:39,570
minerals here then we cut down this big

294
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,430
transportation thing in six hundred

295
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,839
years or 200 years or a hundred years

296
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,760
it's transportation thing just going to

297
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,250
get a bigger and bigger a bigger problem

298
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,990
right so there's our catching the

299
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,320
nitrogen we call his catch and release

300
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,720
nutrients you know what I stole that

301
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,820
from a guy in North Dakota but I got I

302
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,040
got another one from Jake Jake Fuhrer

303
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,560
the other day I got everything put it in

304
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,390
but he said a light bulb did not result

305
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:09,150
from somebody incrementally trying to

306
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:11,700
make candles better we're great we got

307
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,870
it we got to start thinking different so

308
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,220
to just keep trying to do what we're

309
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:18,270
doing to do a little bit better we'll

310
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:21,360
still have a damn candle so 1970 the

311
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:23,250
average wheat price was dollar 37 a

312
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,820
bushel average price of barrel oil is

313
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:30,089
three dollars and thirty nine cents

314
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:34,050
price of barrel oil today is just south

315
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:41,700
of 60 bucks and wheats about three and a

316
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:43,680
half or four think about that 80% 80% of

317
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,160
the total input cost and agriculture can

318
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,660
be traced directly to energy so

319
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,370
incrementally trying to do better and

320
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,260
better and still relying on all this

321
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:56,300
energy doesn't make any sense because

322
00:14:52,260 --> 00:15:00,560
we're losing the oil is going up faster

323
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:03,870
120 years ago we essentially were zero

324
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:08,600
don brought his dad down John he's 100

325
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:13,500
and 103 and he looked at the cows you

326
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:15,089
remember what he said he said if they're

327
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,680
eating the sloth he says well they're

328
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:20,060
bailing they're hauling the bales and

329
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,060
they're hauling the manor back out right

330
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:27,750
oh yeah that's it I thought that was

331
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,589
pretty good uh-oh you got the essence of

332
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:33,420
the whole thing right there 120 years

333
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:34,589
ago that was zero 120 years from now

334
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,740
we're going to have to be zero again

335
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:41,700
right now today we're talking about

336
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:43,980
grazing y-l and savouries been mentioned

337
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,020
a few times and he talked about brittle

338
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,959
or environment through dry climates

339
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:53,310
right well he's saying it's a hoof

340
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:55,589
action I think it's also in dry climate

341
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:59,820
soil biology slows or stops during

342
00:15:55,589 --> 00:16:01,680
periods of low moisture the rumen of

343
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,500
grazing animals remains moist during

344
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,470
button continuing those biological

345
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,930
processes the process in the soil are

346
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:12,450
almost exactly the same as a process in

347
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:16,740
the rumen there's almost no different

348
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:19,410
and somebody said and I thought it was

349
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,720
Darwin but I can't find the

350
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,660
the quote that somebody called the soil

351
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,630
the rumen of the earth if you know who

352
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,450
that was Cody would that was you that

353
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:36,930
did this so after you left the school

354
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:40,680
mines right okay but but that's the idea

355
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:43,440
behind grazing animals being important

356
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,540
in dry climates are relatively more

357
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,400
important to dry climates in cold

358
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,890
climates the same thing soil biology

359
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,650
slows during times of low soil moisture

360
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:55,650
or low soil temperatures the room and

361
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:57,270
the grazing animals are always warm they

362
00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:02,190
keep it going during the winter that's

363
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:03,360
the role we're cycling it we're not

364
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,970
getting rid of the organic matter

365
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,560
recycling it okay so here some of our

366
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:11,010
cover crops that would be our oats and

367
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:13,320
pea thing we swap it the slots have to

368
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:15,840
be relatively big so they don't get

369
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:19,290
covered up with snow the Canadians are

370
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:21,000
not worried about snow depth you know

371
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,760
those cows that go out there and really

372
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,410
deep snow if they can see it and they

373
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,140
will drive on if it gets to be hard snow

374
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,900
they'll just I have a tractor on it just

375
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,750
or a pickup and just to break the snow

376
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,450
but we had some pretty deep snow and it

377
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,950
didn't seem to bother the cows a bit

378
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:41,610
that's what it looks like in the fall

379
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:44,310
you know nice and green in there it

380
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:47,340
stayed green like that until basically

381
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:49,800
we were done grazing til is all gone we

382
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,190
had a couple fields where we had oats

383
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:56,190
peas and rapeseed winter wheat stubble

384
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:58,650
is going to be seated to corn in 2017 in

385
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:01,410
this field in particular had seven

386
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:06,390
thousand seven hundred pounds of biomass

387
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:11,370
per acre 18.2% of protein and 121

388
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:13,230
relative feed value zero three which was

389
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,360
that pivot you saw a little bit less

390
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:19,230
biomass not a lot seventeen point four

391
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:22,080
protein 115 now since ken was here you

392
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,420
saw me goofing with the computer because

393
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,130
I went back and got some he he started

394
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,070
using something I didn't have on there

395
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:33,160
so he was using tdn so our t DN was 72%

396
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:37,900
on these oat p rapeseed things

397
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:41,340
protein 17.4 that ratio is 4 to 1 so

398
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:44,169
it's too hot if all we did is graze that

399
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,820
that's not that's too hot we're just

400
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:48,520
going to waste it right it's it's like

401
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,049
you guys eating nothing but steak you

402
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,559
need to have some carbohydrates to go

403
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:56,980
with it so we we were grazing these

404
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,539
swaths at the same time we were allowing

405
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,390
the college to have access to corn

406
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:03,280
stocks not corn but corn stocks after

407
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,620
after harvest and that's how we balance

408
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,559
the diet and so one of the things if

409
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:11,580
you're planning to do cover crops it'd

410
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:16,870
be good to plan to have some source of

411
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:18,159
corn stalks or perennial pastures or

412
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,760
something like that you could use for

413
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:24,490
your filler so to speak instead of and

414
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,909
that's what we did we could vary the

415
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:30,760
moves to make them go to the corn stalks

416
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:34,299
and get full instead of just just eat

417
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,860
the oats so this is the reason for

418
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:39,750
grazing and material association a

419
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:41,890
little quality corn stock aftermath in

420
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:45,400
at the end of the grazing period

421
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,559
mid-january when Don come and got the

422
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:51,610
cows they we had a few sloths left and

423
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:54,880
went and pulled a sample out of the out

424
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:57,580
of those last sloth 16.8 still 16.8

425
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,580
versus you know just still just 17

426
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:03,309
something TD and a sixty five point one

427
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,650
and still had a relative few value of 95

428
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:08,220
so we lost a little bit of a little bit

429
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:10,990
of quality but not very dang much in

430
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,110
that period so I'm fairly confident in

431
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,640
the East here now if I lived I grew up

432
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,010
in Platte which is just west of course

433
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,409
because so you know in that area a

434
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,940
little bit more fall rains and stuff it

435
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:23,890
might be a bit different but hitting in

436
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,620
this country I'm not afraid of that

437
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,799
thing at all so what we did here is a

438
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,720
rope coming down from the irrigators

439
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,100
that bucket there's two wires one here

440
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,650
and here and yeah we should have had a

441
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,840
third when it gets really iced up you

442
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:41,290
should have that ground in the middle

443
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,379
and we had a couple cows I give you the

444
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:45,399
numbers

445
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:46,690
that you'd move them back through the

446
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:48,219
fence and they turn around come right

447
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,359
back through the guys screw you I know

448
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:52,779
this thing isn't going to hurt me

449
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:55,059
because it's icy now here I'm moving I

450
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:57,129
said we should be moving perpendicular

451
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:58,839
this loss we just couldn't arrange it to

452
00:20:57,129 --> 00:21:01,509
do that this year the way we had things

453
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:04,570
set up so we're moving like larry was

454
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:07,229
parallel parallel to the swass and it's

455
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,549
not ideal but we didn't we didn't have

456
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:12,879
we were done with this field before we

457
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:15,669
had snow so we moved about every day and

458
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:18,129
a half we gave them to sloths or sixty

459
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:20,589
feet and you can kind of see this we

460
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:22,749
these are where the moves before we

461
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:25,359
didn't have a back fence here we had

462
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:28,839
water on this road and then there's corn

463
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:32,440
stalks on the other side of the road but

464
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:34,450
then about every five or six days we

465
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,309
would throw back fencing or some side

466
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,049
fence so they couldn't get back and just

467
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:41,489
loaf around back over here but they

468
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:41,489
didn't spend a lot of time back there

469
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:47,649
they cleaned up pretty well and you can

470
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,929
see down through there the the wheat

471
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:51,869
stubble this is 120 bushel wheat stubble

472
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:55,419
underneath this is the court this is a

473
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:57,789
this is the stubble from the oats and

474
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:59,679
they left the stubble the ate the swath

475
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:01,479
they left the stubble there's and then

476
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,429
we had all the stuff from the crop that

477
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:06,009
we'd harvested lay down in there so

478
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:07,989
there's good armor there and you see

479
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:09,309
it's high quality stuff and we did fecal

480
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:12,399
sample and they haven't gotten those

481
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:15,039
back yet but we did fecal sample and

482
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:16,749
regular basis and we we thought that

483
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,279
worked pretty good last year when we did

484
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:21,159
study to tell us if we're getting a

485
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:26,019
little lower protein there it's coming

486
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:28,179
through corn stalks on wheat stubble

487
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:30,009
that will be seeded to soybeans we put

488
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:32,679
in oats German millet Brown Madrid

489
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:36,369
sorghum Sudan and somebody talked about

490
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:38,379
this not quite as much biomass because

491
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:39,999
it didn't grow into that late fall this

492
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:44,440
year you know that sportage sorted with

493
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:46,719
self quit relatively early proteins a

494
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,909
little lower for all T p-values pretty

495
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:50,919
good that's what it looked like where

496
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,399
the hay mill is just starting to head

497
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,950
out

498
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:55,510
oats is coming up through there

499
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,960
that's what looked like in the swath

500
00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:00,940
this is actually from a year ago I took

501
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,740
these in there we had to the sloth

502
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,720
running this way and we're moving the

503
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,300
fence perpendicular to the sloth and

504
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,700
they would and we had a bit of snow a

505
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,960
year ago and they would just follow that

506
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,180
swath just fine

507
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,200
see and you can't you can't see where

508
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:19,210
that swath is but it's there but that

509
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,280
tells them there's a swath there as soon

510
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,990
as you move that wire they'll just come

511
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,710
to those spots and there's like twelve

512
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:28,330
or fifteen of them and the way they go

513
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,010
we like bigger buckets better than the

514
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:34,900
small buckets a five gallon buckets

515
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:37,360
worked better actually so there's so

516
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,650
these were barge AZ cattle mature cows

517
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,890
various genetics

518
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:44,290
you can ask Don about that late second

519
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,810
trimester and we had a few opens in

520
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:49,870
there 60-day grazing period initial

521
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:52,480
weight of 1392 pounds final weight of

522
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:58,840
fourteen forty nine forty seven pound

523
00:23:52,480 --> 00:24:02,020
gain so I did that wrong fifty seven

524
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,030
pound gain typo title and you're looking

525
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:06,130
at no they meant game were net and there

526
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,390
was a few that didn't gain a couple of

527
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,620
them lost some weight and there's

528
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:11,170
something that did way better than the

529
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:15,460
others which is kind of interesting but

530
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:18,250
we did a sixty days forty seven acres of

531
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,930
oat P and six acres that millet stuff

532
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:25,230
and then seventy-five acres of corn

533
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:28,330
stock swap out P we we shot for a

534
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:31,750
grazing or what we have is a grazing

535
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:34,060
intensity of five eight a um per acre on

536
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,770
those cover crops of high-quality stuff

537
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:39,820
and then since we have more acres the

538
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:41,680
corn stocks now we're doing these at the

539
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,530
same time so the average is about a

540
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,360
tooth is really what you get out of that

541
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:50,830
if you if you do it and we just give a

542
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:54,720
mineral and salt at lib and you can't

543
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:56,640
possibly write this down in time but

544
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,980
but they're going to have they're going

545
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,950
to have a copy but all I did is you just

546
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,700
Google swath grazing Alberta and you'll

547
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,929
get this now the government of elet

548
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:10,470
Saskatchewan and Alberta in Manitoba

549
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:13,440
worked on swath grazing since I've been

550
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:17,250
married in we've been married 29 years

551
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,870
and we ran into this then and one of the

552
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:23,070
reasons they really did a lot of this

553
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:29,490
especially in the interim is is mad cow

554
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:31,860
disease because if you if you lived in

555
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:35,340
Canada and your cow calf died 15 years

556
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:41,039
ago an old cow killer cow was worth

557
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:43,620
seven cents American so you got to take

558
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,120
something out of your system in order to

559
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,070
be profitable or you got to get out of

560
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,340
the business and this is one way they

561
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:52,770
did it and and they did this a couple of

562
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,960
these large studies somebody showed

563
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,860
something from University of Brandon or

564
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,990
whatever it was actually a granada'

565
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,990
Brandon was one of the stations and they

566
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:07,380
took a 600 Cal herd and split it into

567
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:10,230
three herds at 201 Set stayed in the

568
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,440
feedlot all year one set feedlot in the

569
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:15,929
winter they went they went out into

570
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,340
perennial pastures in the summer the

571
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:25,320
other side of 200 just was in Fields

572
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:27,720
grazing annual crops in production field

573
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,720
the one that performed the bat they went

574
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,030
they went in and for five or six weeks

575
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,610
and captive they went into the buildings

576
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:39,179
but other than that they were out doing

577
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:41,010
their thing and and and the best herd

578
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:45,080
health the best performance the best

579
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,080
whatever was the ones that route

580
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:55,020
the new manager the AG research center

581
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:56,700
in Rapid City the Western campus of SDSU

582
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:00,150
so to speak the livestock people were

583
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:02,700
Ken works and the new person there we

584
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:04,559
were they were hiring they were they

585
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,120
were interviewing for that position I

586
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,270
was on the committee that came down to

587
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,160
last two and I

588
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:12,990
housed both of them the question do you

589
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,990
think they'll be feedlots in 40 years

590
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:18,580
you know but what a curveball right if

591
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,680
you're somebody applying for a job and

592
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,000
some guy asked you that question but one

593
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:27,190
of them answered the one that actually

594
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,540
got the job immediately said no and and

595
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:32,980
then the follow-up question is how do

596
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:34,660
you change the way you do AG research in

597
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:38,110
western South Dakota to get ready for

598
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:41,970
the vent reality of not having calves go

599
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:44,410
right to feed Lots now why don't white

600
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:47,770
why do I think there probably won't be

601
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:50,610
feed Lots in 40 years 60 years whatever

602
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:53,710
because you've got antibiotic resistance

603
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:58,150
you've got huge problems with energy to

604
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:59,350
take you know take do silage I don't

605
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:02,170
know what your site is cutting cost

606
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,800
Danny a lot I mean that's the way you

607
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:06,100
say that

608
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,090
and baling and hauling and whatever and

609
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,860
then you have tried to haul the

610
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:11,650
nutrients back out and we saw the data

611
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:14,890
today already that if fat cow peas and a

612
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:16,510
feedlot versus being out in the field

613
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,700
it's a huge difference in terms of

614
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:22,390
nitrogen so huge difference in terms of

615
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,820
phosphorus cycling so we really don't

616
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,080
have a choice

617
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,150
we need to get them back out in the

618
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,070
field I mean it's not one of those

619
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,030
things like we have a choice it's a one

620
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,500
of the thing that we're going to be

621
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:34,870
forced to do it eventually so we're

622
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,850
better off to do it when we start so I

623
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:39,100
that's a good place these are really

624
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:41,410
interesting videos in Raleigh leaves

625
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,600
Minh who isn't here but I hope to bring

626
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,950
him today but he's heading to Falls for

627
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,290
the rustling terminus sons in the

628
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,950
wrestling tournament and he didn't want

629
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:54,160
to get stuck not being there but he

630
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:58,720
wintered 400 head of cows and 370 acres

631
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:03,190
of corn failed corn this year he

632
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:05,770
wintered 400 acres of cows on 370 acres

633
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,870
of failed Corney at 370 acres of failed

634
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:11,440
corn north of blunt some gravely ground

635
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:12,880
got dry and he wintered his whole herd

636
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,710
there so what you know he was just one

637
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,360
move and I feel lying Helen she's put

638
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,710
your college in there and I told him

639
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,600
build fences and stuff he didn't

640
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,590
necessarily do that but he they're still

641
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,990
there

642
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,820
he says most money ever made growing

643
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,999
corn have it failed he got he got his

644
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:30,190
insurance payment right

645
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:32,710
fluffy he grades all he's God you

646
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:38,559
haven't said any hay or any silage all

647
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:40,659
year so and and and he got I sent him

648
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,490
this link and then I started getting

649
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:44,980
text last night he was watching his

650
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,539
videos and he then we always text and

651
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,710
commenting and whatever and I'm going

652
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:51,899
okay this picture was taken and just on

653
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:55,110
the outskirts of Lloydminster

654
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:57,999
Saskatchewan about 12 years ago

655
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:02,139
Lloydminster Saskatchewan is straight

656
00:29:57,999 --> 00:30:05,169
straight east of Edmonton long ways

657
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:06,549
north right long ways north long way

658
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:08,440
north the border probably four or five

659
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:10,119
hours north of the border right on the

660
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,159
Alberta Saskatchewan border the border

661
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:13,720
of Alberta and Saskatchewan was right

662
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,879
through the middle of Lloydminster so

663
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,320
kinda like Pierre Fort Pierre only is

664
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:20,710
not a river there there's just a lie

665
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,419
just like a little sign they have been

666
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:28,419
doing this for a long time they grow

667
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:30,639
corn just to grapes okay now more goats

668
00:30:28,419 --> 00:30:32,409
more cows more sheep why you say goats

669
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:37,320
number one meat eaten in the world is

670
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:43,389
goat just so you Cowboys don't get too

671
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:47,679
arrogant in Africa all the little girls

672
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:52,240
take care of the goats rate 100%

673
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:57,700
grass-fed ground beef this was produced

674
00:30:52,240 --> 00:31:00,940
in Aberdeen South Dakota like coke coal

675
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:04,360
cows in Montana bring them to Aberdeen

676
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:08,519
feed them on cover crops and they're

677
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,519
grass-fed because they haven't had green

678
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:15,640
interesting content

679
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:17,710
four bucks a pound and the world's

680
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,620
supply of my noble Foster's will have

681
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:22,480
exhausted in less than 120 years and the

682
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,990
people that have the minor bowl

683
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:29,710
phosphors are not our friends probably

684
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:31,630
even more so now use of perennial

685
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:33,520
sequences of perennial cover crops will

686
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:36,790
probably be necessary to get our

687
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,170
nutrient cycling rate mother nature does

688
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,120
not do tillage unless it's a

689
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:44,470
catastrophic event and she does not

690
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:46,450
export nutrients okay all tillage tools

691
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,310
destroy soil structure all tillage tool

692
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,810
degree water and filtration all tillage

693
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,570
tools reduce organic matter and all

694
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:55,090
tillage tools increased wheat and in

695
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:57,460
central South Dakota we all know this

696
00:31:55,090 --> 00:32:01,690
I'm heading to Missouri next week they

697
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:05,380
don't know this a really slow learners

698
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:10,270
in Missouri mother nature does not kick

699
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:12,250
oh that show me yes oh man she does max

700
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,560
here which species survive or die

701
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,330
right we don't have to do this to save

702
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,950
the planet plan we'll be fine without it

703
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,370
but we'll probably be without it unless

704
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:23,130
we do something different

705
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:25,060
bureaucracies like universities

706
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:27,150
governments and corporations are

707
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:31,720
operated by people with limited tenure

708
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:32,770
some with shorter tenure than others but

709
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:38,470
whatever

710
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:41,830
as a joke worked better last week they

711
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:45,780
have short term goals right they're just

712
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:49,660
thinking about three four years in

713
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:51,670
society landowners farmers you know

714
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:53,050
family farmers we need to have long term

715
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:56,680
research and that's what the code lakes

716
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:58,000
does farmers and ranchers harvest

717
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,740
sunlight carbon dioxide and water

718
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,080
produce products we can sell doesn't

719
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,420
make any difference some of this is

720
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,240
human food so we need to be aware of

721
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,470
nutritional issues off-site impact we

722
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,370
want to eat meat maybe we should

723
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:14,290
concentrate on growing meat instead of

724
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:16,180

00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,690
feed animals you know doesn't making

726
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,550
sense

727
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,500

728
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:22,570

729
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,259
phosphorus we're hit both peak oil and

730
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:28,460
peak phosphorus already

731
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:31,700

correct economic approach in the long

738
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:50,719
run think about that one so there and

739
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:53,570
