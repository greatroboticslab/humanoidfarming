  "text": "tractor has broke down so anyway want to see what we got going on check out the [Music] video so guys the burn pile is burned down good so far we got good hot coal so uh as soon as I get the tractor going be real easy to get this back going and we have obviously put a big Den in this but I got no go on that so let me tell you what happened and it's kind of a series of events it I've got two issues so first of all U and I'm going to include this in on the end screens when we get to the end of this video a while back I've got a video it's called I messed up and I'm surprised I didn't that it didn't break everything then but I'm convinced it did like 80% of the damage so what happened was I and again I'll show you the video when I was hooking up my grandpa I accidentally just for forgot to put in the Locking pins I did the hydraulic lines and anyway I just dropped off the grapple it pulled all the hydraulic lines very tight I think it did a lot of damage to them but they did not rupture so I've been working I don't know last two weeks contined to use the grapple well anyway over the weekend it finally um it finally gave up The Ghost and I had a ruper I was shooting uh as I was picking up this stuff and moving it over to the burn pile all of a sudden I started shooting a stream out of one of the hydraulic lines about 2 or 3 ft up in the air so I immediately shut down uh went to investigate real you know I knew immediately what was going on but I disconnected the hydraulic lines cuz I did not want to lose any more fluid and lo and behold when I went to crank back up battery was dead as a door knob even though I had been sitting here running it for hours so uh I know just the battery over time this this tractor is over 6 years old now and uh you know it's time for Batteries they you see if you get over 5 years you count your blessings right so anyway guys first thing on the list is I'm going to walk you guys through uh putting a replacement battery in here now I've already pulled the battery but no uh no big deal for you guys not to see that coming out obviously we're going to do the reverse process and as we go I'll tell you guys a bunch of stuff I've learned along the way so you know me guys let's get busy all right so obviously my tractor is a 3032e um and on pretty much all these versions of tractors the battery is located up in the front and so um this right here just sets in a in a a holder and it's real easy you can just lift this up and move this over and this right here just lifts up and comes out of the way and I'm going to set this over to the side and the the um battery goes right down here in the bottom and it's got a special way that it mounts in now now uh one thing I want to share with you and you know you guys can make decisions for yourself on how to do this but this is a 22 Series battery and if you go to like Advanced Auto now you can see I've got this was a John Deere I actually went to the Tractor place to get this and I'll explain why uh first of all if you go to like uh and I'm not knocking the advanced Autos or the Auto Zones uh they have a battery that's pretty close to the same size but the one thing their batteries don't have is this little protrusion out on the side with this hole indention and so you have to make a decision do you want to get a a little bit cheaper battery that does not have this and then this is what's used to lock the battery on the tractor in place or you can do one without this and you got to figure out another way to strap it down and hold it into place cuz it been up on the front of the motor and it is near the radiator and the uh intercoolers for the for the hydraulic fluid you don't want the battery moving around in and bouncing in and breaking you know you just will have another thing to get tore up so then I played the numbers game uh the batteries at the Advanced Auto that's in the 22 series are AutoZone they're all about the same they were anywhere from $110 to $115 I could get this battery which is a factory replacement from John Deere and this was just like 140 bucks so for 20 or 30 bucks more uh was it worth it to me it was because my time I did want to have to take time to reinvent how to strap this down and so uh I just went ahead and got it I was there it was available and it was the exact thing I needed so I got it you guys obviously more welcome to make up your mind on how you want to do the fix but that's the reason why so anyway that's the battery and now let me uh start getting things laid out and I'll show you how we get this in place and by the way while we're here these are the straps that hold down and this is why this is so important is this strap the way it goes and let me get the camera here so you can see it it this battery I mean this bolt sits right up in that little Groove and that's what's going to keep it from moving back and forth so anyway again the decision is Ys on how you want to play it but anyway let's get this in and get my girl going all right guys so I'm just going to ease this on down in here like [Music] so up and get it set in place and make sure I'm left and right from where these holes are all right and then as I was stating there's one hole to the left one hole to the right and this is where the challenge comes in a little bit because that has a nut on the back side and you got to reach around so hopefully my long arms are long enough they sure don't make this easy to get to from [Music] here there we go that's that side this right here is the hard Parts just trying to stretch around and get to the bolts I've got an extension on the upper end holding it in place and I'm screwed that in so now I've got them started all I've got to do is just snug them up like I said this is the fun part but it's not too awful [Music] bad all right one side done one side to go so now you just pull up the tabs and pull the tops off and obviously you want to make sure black to black or black to negative and red to positive and obviously if I was at my house I would have much better selection of tools but this is called in the field repair and you make out with what you got so it might be a little slower but we're going to get it so you just snug these [Music] up and hopefully here in a minute we're going to be ready to fire this bad boy up so if you've been watching any of my videos recent you know that it's extremely dry here and uh you also know that it's just been Dusty Dusty and boy if that doesn't show the tail of it right there with how dirty and dusty everything is underneath when we get home it'll definitely be time for a cleaning and replacing filters cuz I'm at my fall servicing anyway and uh just time for a good clean up good servicing all right so as you saw I just set the tray back in place and set this on top all right guys here's the moment of truth let's see oh we got all kinds of Lights that's a major Improvement and here we go yeah baby well guys I owe y'all an apology you know when this video started I was going to be doing two repairs well in the middle of me working uh something happened which I absolutely loved I got some surprise visitors that kind of interrupted my work so I never got around to recording the second part of the repair I'm sure I'm getting ready to show you what what happened and uh I'm sure you guys will forgive me when you see why get out of my way I'm coming through there she goes and Sissy's chasing her here she comes com s and there she goes you're the best Papa in the world well thank you are you coming through see you later I at your house now wiing with two swings there you go now don't you think you a little too big for that one hi I'm set going a baby [Music] swing here let's face [Music] hi hi hello byebye see you crazy well guys the tractor's back running great I also did a little bit more excavator time and this pile is just endless and keeps going and keeps going and keeps going so what we're doing is just reaching in pulling this stuff out get getting it to where we can work with it cutting off what wood we can burn and we'll continue working try to get the stumps burun down as well for now uh everything's back in action and working great and uh I'll catch you on the next one cuz you know here at project next one there is always one more we'll see you on the next one",
