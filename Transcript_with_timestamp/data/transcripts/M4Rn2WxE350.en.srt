1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,559
Well, good morning everyone and thank

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,480
you uh for allowing me to be here today.

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,280
Uh I'm going to talk to you a little bit

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,720
about the five soil health principles.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,760
Um my name is Daryl Oswald and I manage

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,880
the Berley County Soil Conservation

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,039
District. I've been with the district

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,240
for 25 plus years. Uh I am also a farmer

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:32,320
and a rancher from northeast Berley

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,079
County, a fourth generation rancher. Uh

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,120
and

12
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:39,520
uh near wing

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,040
uh up there in the northeast corner and

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,399
and uh this particular slide

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,879
is to lead off as a picture of the

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,239
Manoken farm. Uh some of you or maybe

17
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:53,680
all of you are familiar uh with the uh

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,160
Manoken farm. Uh it's our conservation

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,399
demonstration

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,480
farm owned owned and operated by the

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:05,000
Berley County Soil Conservation

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,439
District. Going to lead off uh of

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,200
course we've talked about these a little

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,360
bit in the past and and in our egg

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,520
production

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,320
model in general and and mine included

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,759
on our farm and ranch uh which I'm going

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,720
to relate to most today. We have to have

29
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,720
some we have to identify our ecological

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,880
or our excuse me our agricultural

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,560
resource

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,000
concerns

33
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,400
and really these are symptoms of

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,799
landscape

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,600
simplification and you know leading off

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,040
of course we have the wind and water

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,720
erosion. Uh we still have that across uh

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:52,000
North Dakota quite readily. Of course,

39
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:54,640
uh we see it uh in Berley County and and

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,520
every county across the state. Uh the

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,079
salinity thing is really coming to to

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,360
roost for us and and that's become

43
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,159
troublesome. Uh our lack of plant

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,360
diversity and cover. Uh we've really

45
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,479
simplified the landscape and the crop

46
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,200
rotations. We've taken a lot of

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,720
livestock off the land and of course our

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,879
animal in impact.

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,640
Um and we can have a drought and a flood

50
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,520
in the same year which tells me uh as a

51
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,720
farmer and a rancher uh if I correlate

52
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,160
that to Oswald Ranch it tells me that I

53
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,640
don't have any resiliency in the system.

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,239
And of course

55
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:41,200
uh with that uh we had uh Lindsay talk

56
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:45,599
about carbon and of course carbon drives

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,519
the cycle or the system and of course

58
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,280
exporting carbon off your farm and

59
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,840
ranch. Uh again agriculture is an

60
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,160
extraction business. That's going to

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,239
happen. But we have to understand that

62
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,319
we have to put more carbon back into the

63
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,800
system than we take out. and that can

64
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,800
lead to carbon deficient soils. This is

65
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,800
a page out of the nature and properties

66
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,200
of soils um that I use quite readily and

67
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,879
again correlating back to my own farm

68
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,200
and ranch. You look at the factors

69
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,360
promoting the

70
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,239
gains and and losses of organic matter

71
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,879
in soils uh which helps drive the

72
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:29,120
system. And of course the gains is when

73
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,560
the soil health principles if you look

74
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,680
down that list I won't read them all but

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,400
uh as you look down that list you see

76
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,760
that the principles that we're going to

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,560
talk about uh really pertain to the

78
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,239
factors promoting the gains and really

79
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,400
have very little to do with any uh of

80
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,680
the factors promoting the losses. And um

81
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,680
the soil health principles again

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,599
uh I won't read them off to you but you

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,640
can see this slide has been around the

84
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:06,480
world and back many times and it

85
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,560
correlates to soil health and the soil

86
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,560
health

87
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,319
principles are universal.

88
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,759
uh we were having a discussion here with

89
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:20,400
the group uh this morning but you need

90
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:23,400
to scope them to your particular farm

91
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,520
and ranch and to your particular

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,040
situation. The principles work on any

93
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,440
scale large or small.

94
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,320
[Music]

95
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,199
Uh currently at the Manoken farm, uh our

96
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,600
urban gardening and our outdoor

97
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,000
gardening and our high tunnel gardening

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,720
all employ the soil health principles

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,520
and again working on a very large scale

100
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,759
uh excuse me small scale and so they are

101
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,880
very

102
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:57,280
uh universal in that regard.

103
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,720
We always lead off with the or at least

104
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,360
I do I always lead off with armoring the

105
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,880
soil uh as the number one principle. Uh

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,960
I believe that again you can't really

107
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,160
get the system going. You can't move it

108
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,960
forward until you start protecting the

109
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,919
soil. Uh this particular photo is off of

110
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,039
Oswald Ranch. Uh, this is a cover crop

111
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,400
that we did graze and I can assure you

112
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,840
that armoring the soil doesn't look like

113
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,880
that all the time at the ranch, but I

114
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,400
thought it was pretty vindictive or uh

115
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,160
in in a good indicator of where we like

116
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,039
to be on our ranch when it comes to

117
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,840
armoring the soil. And again, uh, this

118
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,919
happens to be crop

119
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,400
residue. And that's one way that you can

120
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,000
achieve armor. And of course the other

121
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,639
way would be by growing plants. U most

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,759
of the carbon in this dead litter goes

123
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,759
into the atmosphere as carbon

124
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:00,240
dioxide and of course uh the green

125
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:05,520
plants gives us an inlet for carbon

126
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:10,240
going into the soil. And uh again armor

127
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,800
uh is very very important and uh is

128
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,039
generally in my world is always led off

129
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:20,880
as the first principle. Uh here I've

130
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:24,479
shown an example again armor on our uh

131
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:28,800
farm and ranch pertains a lot to how we

132
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:32,319
graze. Uh we do we do do some farmland

133
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,280
or crop land or some annual cropping. Uh

134
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,160
but we do uh way more grazing. And this

135
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,520
particular photo I think uh shows the

136
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,720
armor on the native uh graze native

137
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,160
range that we like to try to achieve and

138
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,720
we're out there.

139
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,840
Uh one of my mentors uh Jean Govin from

140
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,880
Turtle Lake uh used to say that his goal

141
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,560
was to capture every raindrop where it

142
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,319
falls and uh we've kind of taken the

143
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,280
same mantra but Oswald Ranch and we feel

144
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,160
that this is the way that we can do this

145
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,919
and again we're reducing our evaporation

146
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,120
rates uh our soil temperatures uh we

147
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,520
built more resiliency in the system uh

148
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,560
during the drier periods because of the

149
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,880
armor that we have on and uh we can

150
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:29,039
reduce this the temperature. We're not

151
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:31,680
uh evaporating the water uh per se and

152
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:35,440
as Carlos stated this is generally a

153
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:39,759
very very good provide great habitat for

154
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,720
the soil food web and uh we think it's

155
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,639
very important. So this is how we employ

156
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:50,880
armor uh on our operation minimizing

157
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,400
soil disturbance. Uh again I put an

158
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,919
emphasis on physical disturbance

159
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:00,000
because that is the thing that we

160
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:04,479
generally relate the most to. Uh we do

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,039
have to work I I believe uh across uh

162
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,160
our production model in eliminating

163
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:13,199
physical disturbance as much as we can.

164
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,440
We know that tillage removes pore spaces

165
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:20,000
and and uh slowly compresses the soil

166
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,800
much like if we were building the road.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,039
Uh we talk about water infiltration and

168
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,240
air movement and of course tillillage

169
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,000
restricts all of that. And then of

170
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,599
course it takes off any of the soil

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,159
armor uh that we did have in our

172
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:40,159
previous

173
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:43,120
uh and first soil health principle. And

174
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,440
I think someone said too that when we

175
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,560
till or disturb we release a burst of

176
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,920
carbon dioxide resulting in carbon loss.

177
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,279
And of course we want to more carbon

178
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,399
coming into the system than going out.

179
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,440
Uh physical con disturbance can also or

180
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:05,920
excuse me uh soil disturbance can also

181
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:10,560
be related to I think uh too much uh

182
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:14,480
chemical use uh pesticide use uh that

183
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:18,640
scenario as well uh too much overg

184
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,760
grazing I think that we uh we when we

185
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,160
see seasonl long grazing uh we see soil

186
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,959
disturbance in some places and not at

187
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,839
others

188
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,440
And so

189
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,480
this

190
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,760
the soil disturbance is important in

191
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,680
again keeping the area intact for the

192
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,160
soil food web and

193
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:45,440
uh making the

194
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,440
soil pore spaces stay

195
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,320
intact. Continually growing uh living

196
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,640
plants in the soil.

197
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,800
Uh this gets stated many times but it

198
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,360
can't be reiterated enough. Our soils

199
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,720
were built with perennials with a huge

200
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,560
root mass and of course we farm or in

201
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,160
our current production model we tend to

202
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:12,000
farm with annuals with a smaller root

203
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:15,600
mass and uh that leads to some issues

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,880
that we need to think about. uh a green

205
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,120
plant uh continually growing is

206
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:25,040
beneficial because again nature is a

207
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:28,200
constant feed process. Uh agriculture is

208
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,760
a extraction business. we're extracting

209
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,399
something and we need to be thinking in

210
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,120
terms of putting something back and of

211
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:41,440
course a continual growing live plant in

212
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,959
the soil does that and uh and

213
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,600
continually

214
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:50,720
uh builds soil aggregates and I'll show

215
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:54,160
you a a slide coming up that pertains a

216
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,480
little bit to that and of course uh

217
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,440
talking today this is a cover crop

218
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,399
summit and we know that cover crops can

219
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,920
fill in what otherwise would be a period

220
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,959
where nothing is growing and again gives

221
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,760
us an opportunity to continue bringing

222
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,640
carbon into the soil. This is a full

223
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,320
season cool season cover crop uh that we

224
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:23,440
raised at Oswalt uh that we planted and

225
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:28,160
raised up at the ranch. Uh it's we we do

226
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,720
different mixes uh periodically and u we

227
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,519
do switch to full season cool season

228
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,920
mixes uh at times and we find that uh

229
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,120
they work very well during the middle of

230
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,959
the grazing season uh right before our

231
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,360
breeding season which tends to be a

232
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,959
little bit later than than most

233
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,279
operations. Uh but still the the

234
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,839
philosophy is of course that we can have

235
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:58,959
a high energy high nutrient

236
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:03,279
uh mix in place where we can graze in

237
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:06,399
late July, early August. And uh then of

238
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,639
course we'll we'll we'll graze that by

239
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,040
managing it much the way we do all of

240
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,880
our perennials and our native and our

241
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,279
tame grass. and and we're actually

242
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,959
sometimes we're fortunate enough to

243
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:24,800
actually get another grazing on it later

244
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:29,040
in October or October and November uh if

245
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:34,079
the season allows us to do that. But uh

246
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,079
soil carbon again uh

247
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:42,000
most cropping systems and most rotations

248
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,000
cannot you cannot increase soil carbon

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,800
without the use of cover crops. And

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,399
we've seen that on our farm and ranch.

251
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,440
And uh again when you think about these

252
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,440
cool season cover crops

253
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:03,200
uh the below ground carbon allocation is

254
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,480
generally maximized during that first 4

255
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,079
to 8 weeks. And so a huge amount of

256
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,839
biomass

257
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,839
uh is not always required to be highly

258
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:19,200
effective in building soil aggregates

259
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:21,279
and and uh increasing carbon. And uh I

260
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,279
I've got some slides too. Here's an

261
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,839
example of a huge amount of biomass that

262
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,079
we all like to see. Again, this is

263
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,920
another full season warm season cover

264
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,800
crop uh on the Oswald Ranch. Again, when

265
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,639
I differentiate between cool seasons and

266
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,560
warm seasons, uh the species listed in

267
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:47,600
there, some of them are ve uh similar.

268
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:50,160
Uh most of them are not in the fact that

269
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,519
again when you look at the uh contents

270
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:58,120
of this mix. Uh this contains a lot of

271
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,120
warm season uh

272
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,680
uh species and this uh particular mix

273
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,480
generally is seated on our place from

274
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,000
the very oh the last week in May until

275
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,279
the middle of June. And our cool season

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,959
uh mixes we try to get in uh you know

277
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,519
midappril to you know maybe that first

278
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,839
week in June. And so we're we're

279
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,000
achieving different things. Uh again,

280
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,720
you can see the large biomass. It's fun

281
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,760
to hide in. Uh this is particular

282
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,959
pictures of just my two daughters uh

283
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:38,639
playing in the cover crop

284
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:42,560
uh a while back. And again, diversity is

285
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:46,000
the key. I think uh cover crops are all

286
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,040
good, even the simple ones, but I the

287
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,600
more diversity that we can get in there,

288
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:56,000
I think that more the uh microbes and

289
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,800
the soil food web, more of the soil food

290
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,600
web we can

291
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:03,519
feed because

292
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,920
again, when we manage holistically or

293
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,600
have that thought process, we're trying

294
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,399
to mimic nature. And when you look back

295
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,600
at the uh native population or the

296
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,760
native grasses, uh there was a huge huge

297
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,320
amount of diversity and that's what

298
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,519
we're trying to do with each of these

299
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,120
cover

300
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:28,560
crops. Continually growing plants in the

301
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:31,279
high tunnel. Uh I'm think Jay will t

302
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:35,440
touch on this a little bit, but I wanted

303
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,279
to show that uh again cover crops or

304
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,079
continually growing plants in the high

305
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:44,639
tunnel is important too. Uh not just uh

306
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,720
during the garden season, but uh

307
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,079
building

308
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,480
soils in the high tunnel as long as

309
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:53,399
possible and keeping a a green growing

310
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,720
uh

311
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:59,279
plant intact.

312
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,560
uh plant diversity. I touched on this a

313
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,240
little bit

314
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,279
uh can be accomplished by growing all

315
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,839
four crop types and I think we we miss

316
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,720
that some of the time with your warm and

317
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,040
cool season grasses and your warm and

318
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,240
season warm and cool season broad

319
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,880
leaves.

320
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:24,320
uh most is most effective to have a

321
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:28,160
rotation heavier in highcarbon plants uh

322
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:31,360
crops such as wheat or corn, not low

323
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:35,120
carbon crops like soybeans.

324
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:38,440
uh some of the diversity issues that we

325
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,880
deal with now are our corn and bean

326
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,720
rotations and I think that there's some

327
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,160
opportunity and we've shown that at the

328
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,480
Manoken Farm and with some individual

329
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,199
producers across the landscape in North

330
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,920
Dakota that we can add more diversity

331
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,800
into that rotation especially in with

332
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,759
the soybean realm and I think that

333
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,480
that's important and that kind of takes

334
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,120
away that angst, if you will, of

335
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:10,240
soybeans being a lowcarbon

336
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:13,679
uh crop. Uh we know this that highcarbon

337
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,439
plants build soils uh because again to

338
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,240
reiterate this, it brings additional

339
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,039
carbon into the soil profile and builds

340
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,520
the resiliency that we want in our

341
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,919
system. And the amount and quality of

342
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,319
carbon from crop residue contributes to

343
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,799
the amount of soil carbon. And it goes

344
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,640
back to our individual uh beginning

345
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,120
slides there with armor and uh having a

346
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,960
green growing plant as much as possible

347
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,200
and minimizing your disturbance. Again

348
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,480
to reiterate the soil health principles

349
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,559
are meant to be used in a system with a

350
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,799
systems approach and and I think that

351
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:55,200
that's important to remember. Uh every

352
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:58,080
green plant is a carbon inlet. Again,

353
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,480
we've harped on this quite a bit. Uh the

354
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,840
most potent tool with which to build a

355
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,919
healthy soil is a live plant. And uh I

356
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,799
think Lindsay again said this that

357
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,600
photosynthesis is the primary process

358
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:15,039
that feeds the soil. And so when I look

359
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,840
at myself as a manager of owner of

360
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:22,080
Oswald Ranch, essentially I manage

361
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:25,120
plants with photosynthesis and sunlight

362
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,080
and and so uh and then of course I

363
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,240
become a micro manager. Uh more

364
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,840
importantly than actually the cattle

365
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,919
that I raise and the crops I raise, I

366
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,320
deal with

367
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,160
photosynthesis and and managing

368
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,760
microbes. And uh we know that a cropping

369
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,320
system that creates these favorable

370
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,919
habitats and the one that will capture

371
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:53,440
the most energy from the

372
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:56,240
sun will resto uh excuse me will restore

373
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,000
soil health the quickest. And we often

374
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,000
get this question a lot regarding the

375
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,320
soil health principles.

376
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,679
Uh you know how quickly can we turn

377
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,840
things around? And my answer to them of

378
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,559
course is

379
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,840
always how much are you willing to how

380
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,760
many principles are you willing to

381
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,480
utilize? How many and how will you be

382
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,000
managing the principles? Because again,

383
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,840
they are universal, but they are very

384
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,360
unique and must be adapted to your

385
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:35,200
scenario. And that doesn't matter if

386
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:38,640
you're a farmer, a rancher, a uh

387
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,160
demonstration farm, a research farm, or

388
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:46,960
any of that. They all have to be adapted

389
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:49,360
uh to this to that situation.

390
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,480
Uh finally, livestock integration, which

391
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,120
is uh really uh one of my favorites or

392
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,919
my favorite of course near and dear

393
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,520
because of the livestock aspect and and

394
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:04,400
the ranching heritage uh that we have.

395
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,440
And again, we know that animals and the

396
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,160
plants and the soils have been uh

397
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,799
together since the beginning of time or

398
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:17,039
forever. And of course uh livestock

399
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,760
integration is important to balance

400
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:24,160
those carbon to nitrogen ratios

401
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:28,240
uh converting your highcarbon

402
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,400
uh crops if you will into the lowcarbon

403
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,080
organic

404
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,640
material

405
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:37,120
and livestock create the opportunity for

406
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,159
even more soil carbon. Uh this

407
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,360
particular photo is a actually out at

408
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,520
the Manokan farm and we're grazing uh

409
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,679
one of

410
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:52,840
our f full season cover crops. But the

411
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,159
simplification of the landscape and and

412
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,000
the the taking away of the livestock I

413
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,159
think

414
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,039
uh is vitally important. How do we know

415
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,039
if soil health is improving? Again, I

416
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,440
won't list all those things there, but

417
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,159
you can read them. And that's how we

418
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,600
look at things on our farm and ranch.

419
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,280
That's how we look at things at the

420
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:20,280
Manoken farm. Uh are we increasing uh

421
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:24,240
stability? Are we infiltrating water?

422
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:26,480
Uh decades ago, growing up, uh our water

423
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,640
cycle on our ranch, I believe, was

424
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:35,679
severely impaired or broken. uh and of

425
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:38,440
course I've worked to try to uh fix that

426
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,520
and of course uh or organic

427
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:45,440
matter increases are we seeing crop

428
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:48,080
response uh are we reducing inputs and

429
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,960
are we seeing an up upward trend this is

430
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:56,799
a a simple version of a manoken farm

431
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:58,720
from 2009 to 2020 on soil organic matter

432
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,960
uh if you you know there's many things

433
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,440
that help drive the system, but soil

434
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,960
organic matter seems to be a popular

435
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,480
one. And if you look across the graph

436
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,280
again, you'll see that field six has the

437
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,840
highest organic matter over

438
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:18,480
time. And we see this is the one field

439
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,640
that had the most crop diversity, uh,

440
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,200
the most used of cover crops and most

441
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,320
livestock integration. So that does

442
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,440
answer your question, how quickly or it

443
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,559
can be a a piece of the question or the

444
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:36,000
answer to the question uh how quickly

445
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:39,200
can we we change some things around and

446
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,880
uh and we know that when we implement

447
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,440
those principles of diversity uh and use

448
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,400
the cover crops and livestock

449
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:51,520
integration, we tend to see an upward

450
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:54,240
trend in uh what in the positive soil

451
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,280
attributes This is a soil organic matter

452
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,159
on Oswald Ranch from

453
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:03,200
2023. Um, this

454
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:05,760
was this particular field was a full

455
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,400
season cover crop field that I've been

456
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:12,240
experimenting with and I actually had a

457
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,640
annual crop uh in there in 2024. Uh, you

458
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,679
can see that there is some positive

459
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,400
things that are occurring. uh this

460
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:24,720
particular study was done by ECDIS and

461
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:27,200
uh was fortunate enough to be part of of

462
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,880
one of their studies and and I had two

463
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,200
fields that uh participated in that and

464
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,039
so I was pleasantly surprised to see

465
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:40,240
that we're seeing a a positive trend uh

466
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:43,640
upward and so we know that that things

467
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,799
are improving. This is the uh water

468
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,360
infiltration at Oswald Ranch again in

469
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,559
milliliters per second. And you can see

470
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,679
that we're able to infiltrate uh quite

471
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:59,919
well. I I don't know or I haven't

472
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:03,320
figured how that uh goes towards inches

473
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:07,520
uh per hour, but

474
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:10,799
uh we seem to have more severe uh rain

475
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:14,080
events at home or more impactful if you

476
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:16,240
will and we seem to be handling them uh

477
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,080
better than we ever did as far as

478
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:24,080
runoff. And again, the lighter events

479
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:27,159
were able to capture uh all the moisture

480
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,279
that we can. And and so

481
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:33,200
uh you know, you probably heard the the

482
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:35,840
the little funny that someone asked you

483
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,080
how much it rained and you used to say,

484
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,360
you know, well, half an inch or 20

485
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,799
hundreds or 3/4 of an inch. And now my

486
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,840
reply generally is I captured all of it.

487
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:51,200
Or how much did it rain? and I I got it

488
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,760
all. So, uh which is a good thing. This

489
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,799
is uh the corn crop on that particular

490
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,919
field. Uh this is my youngest daughter

491
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,640
Afton enjoying the day in the corn crop.

492
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:06,000
Uh this is a cover crop field or a soil

493
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,559
health field as I like to call it. Uh

494
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,799
that we were able to raise 110 bushel

495
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:17,080
corn on with

496
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:20,799
uh very limited inputs. Uh uh actually

497
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:24,400
uh it didn't have any fertility on it. I

498
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:27,840
I do attribute it to again 2024 being a

499
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:31,039
very good year as far as moisture and

500
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,799
that. But uh we were able to net, you

501
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,080
know, some pretty good profit off this

502
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:39,039
field because of our lack of uh inputs

503
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,880
on it. And this just kind of shows you

504
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:44,320
uh this is the same field that was in

505
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,039
2023. the organic matter uh has gone

506
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:51,600
down some. We we've used some of that

507
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:54,880
storage in the tank and uh but uh we've

508
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,679
got a plan to build it back up again and

509
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,000
uh we like to take a swing at the ball

510
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:04,640
every once in a while with these annual

511
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,279
crops and see how far our system uh with

512
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,000
using the soil health principles, how

513
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,720
far can we push it, how far can we drive

514
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,640
it. And of course with the armor on here

515
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,559
and stuff uh we were able to limit our

516
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,120
pesticide uh use as well. So we were

517
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,039
pretty pleased about that. Again using

518
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,400
the soil health principles and adapt

519
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:29,039
them to your production model. Uh you

520
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,679
know you can you can read through them

521
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,760
and

522
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:36,720
uh again keeping the soil covered

523
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,799
minimizing disturbance. uh good things

524
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,559
are going to happen if you can adapt

525
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:45,760
them to your production model and uh we

526
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:48,400
we've seen that uh over time at the

527
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,679
Minoan farm at Oswald Ranch at other

528
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:55,600
producers places again across the

529
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:57,919
landscape and uh and and so again the

530
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,840
soil health principles are are vital I

531
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:04,400
believe going forward to to help

532
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,720
mitigate some of these uh resource

533
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,960
concerns that we have across the state.

534
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,640
So, I think I'm pretty close to right

535
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,840
on. I might be a minute over. I

536
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,760
apologize for that. Uh but again, a

537
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,360
little self-education

538
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,720
uh slide uh

539
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,799
wmanfarm.com. And we do have a YouTube

540
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:31,039
channel and uh at Manokenfarm as well.

541
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:34,240
And thank you uh for uh listening today.

542
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,760
John, appreciate the presentation. Um,

543
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,240
like you, I'm doing a lot of the similar

544
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,000
stuff, grazing cattle.

545
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,279
I've got my and I'm curious of your

546
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,840
opinion and anybody else that wants to

547
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,000
chime in on this. Um, I got myself into

548
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,000
a situation this year where I've got

549
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,600
some additional land for grazing and it

550
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,440
was previously

551
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:58,720
uh uh silage corn fields. Um, and I'm

552
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,760
kind of being handed dead ground. Um

553
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,720
they had uh harvested the corn off of

554
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,679
it, put a very sparse winterkill cover

555
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,360
crop on it when they were done and it

556
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:15,760
sat bare all last season and now I'm

557
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:19,600
coming into it now. Um if I had time

558
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:22,000
during the winter, I may have, you know,

559
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,799
round bail grazed it to get some armor

560
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,080
on the soil or something. Um but now it

561
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:33,120
doesn't have much of anything.

562
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:36,880
Um, I have access to a lot of composted,

563
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,880
mostly composted wood chips. Um, and I

564
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,799
was thinking about spreading that on to

565
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,200
get some armor on the soil, but the

566
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,799
first thing that everybody says is that

567
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,480
all your nitrogen is going to get locked

568
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,679
up into it.

569
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,080
Um, I thought about possibly mixing that

570
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,320
with some poultry litter that I also

571
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,720
have available to me to at the same time

572
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,159
be putting nitrogen on it with that

573
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:03,320
armor and carbon. Uh, curious of your

574
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,320
guys' input.

575
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,840
I I guess first

576
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:14,360
off, I think the tie-up will depend on

577
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,960
how composted your wood chips are.

578
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,559
Uh, I think if they're a long way down

579
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:25,000
the road, you you'll probably be just

580
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:27,520
fine. Uh, you can put that on and

581
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,200
proceed. Uh, I don't have much

582
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:35,600
experience in poultry lure, Patrick, but

583
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:38,960
uh, I think it would act like other

584
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,679
manure when used uh, again, for lack of

585
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,840
a better term, responsibly. I would try

586
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,720
to get out there and get a cool season

587
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,760
cover crop on that on that ground if

588
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,880
you're able as quickly as possible and

589
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,039
then manage graze it and then get some

590
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,840
litter back on there and lay some of

591
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:00,520
that carbon

592
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:03,200
material on the ground on the

593
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:07,000
surface and then get that covered up

594
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:12,399
again. armor number one in in my book

595
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,480
and and again I that it's just how I

596
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,240
view things. But you need to get that

597
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,720
protected and covered and you can add

598
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:25,080
your compost if if you're in doubt. I

599
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:29,120
guess too you could get it tested. Uh

600
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:33,760
but you know, cool season uh cool season

601
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,919
mix on there with uh with quite a bit of

602
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,279
you know, cool season grass or something

603
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,799
that'll get you some biomass. Uh you

604
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,840
know, and then start working on your

605
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,480
legume and you know, your more fragile

606
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,120
peas and stuff later.

607
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,000
Yeah. the uh this situation where

608
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,840
because it was dead, there was no cover,

609
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,880
there was no living root system for

610
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:03,600
uh a year, um erosion took its toll and

611
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,399
because there's nothing uh holding the

612
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,480
ground together, you drive onto it uh

613
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:12,000
with a truck or any piece of equipment

614
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,399
and you kind of sink right away. Uh,

615
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,279
unfortunately I got to wait for drier

616
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,679
conditions before I could even get a

617
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,480
look at drilling in anything to it.

618
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,720
Okay. But yeah, I got myself into a heck

619
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,080
of a project.

620
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,640
Well, congratulations. I guess uh I mean

621
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,799
you're going to make it better. No

622
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:36,960
doubt. And and that landowner will will

623
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:39,840
thank you. Uh again, maybe keeping the

624
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,360
initial cover crop simple then if you're

625
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,760
facing some challenges. Uh but again,

626
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:50,000
try to get it in there when you can.

627
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,919
Uh and and get it protected, I think, is

628
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,679
the first thing. And then use the

629
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,360
livestock to get get the biomass to the

630
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:01,159
ground and and start building some

631
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,159
biology in there.
