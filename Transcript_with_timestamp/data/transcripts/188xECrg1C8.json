  "text": "[Music] the migration phenomenon is quite huge here in kenya there are many people moving from the rural areas to the urban areas and a lot of these people are young and why are they moving they're looking for better employment and education opportunities but we forget that as more people move from the rural areas we are putting more pressure in the urban areas so that's why we see that there's a lot of informal settlements that are coming up but also we have a rather large informal economy meaning that they're not going to access the decent jobs so they access more precarious jobs and that's why we're saying that through this project we are trying to address the advanced drivers of migration through local value chain development that means how can we provide better and more improved employment opportunities and entrepreneurship opportunities in the rural areas through agribusiness cambodia is a hot band for migration because first of all the proximity to nairobi that is the capital city where people perceive that there are many job opportunities here but then we also have to encourage them to stay within the rural areas because kenya means farmers are there at the end of the day the the the farmers that we have are a quiet engine and we need a future bunch that can be able to carry on the angry culture to fill this nation the youth believe that maybe farming is not for them this is what they have seen their parents doing from thai memorial and they want to do something different agriculture has been linked to poverty and business for the people who have not gone to school but then we see that our youth are quite educated and they want the the what they call them decent jobs because to them farming is not a job so they are going to the capital to look for employment so what we're doing in this project is we're trying to to help the youth they play their role in the angry business so that we can create opportunities for them first of all is to train the men to empower them say that in angry culture so there is that then business they can still make a lot of money through the the angry business they don't have to go to towns to look for jobs that are not there in the first place what we've seen is that agriculture was considered not cool or fashionable that is what the mindset has always been but we are seeing a new crop of youth who are taking up agriculture those who have known what the secret is many of them who are graduates who have gone to schools gotten their their degrees and having seen the benefits that have come out of it and not only agriculture but we're talking about agri-business bringing in the business perspective into agriculture [Music] these are the mothers these are my seeds first of all going to breed them it's four months old now you're doing well at the end if i have a hundred plus others then i start marketing them [Music] one of the beneficiaries we support is youth a unique young lady who studied for a job in the hotel industry but following three years in the industry she decided to resign from her job and get into agribusiness she is currently undertaking a poultry project which she got support from the fao and county government and this is a lady who is quite ambitious she sees herself as the next millionaire having a whole range of chicken and been able to supply the major hotels and supermarkets in kenya so for me that is a story that has stood out a young person who could easily have worked in a white collar job but has opted or her choice of work or business is in the agriculture sector there's no need of going to other countries you have seen some youth going to even to dubai catch out to look for jobs then they come back frustrated at the end they're like oh i wish i stayed in my country this is our home god drops kenya we can do it the market is with us wake up and go for it whatever is in your mind you perceive it and later on you receive it plural to urban migration is very common especially with the youth that is because of lack of employment but right now i have come to london agriculture has the potential to create many jobs because currently in africa we still have an opportunity to come up with business agree businesses which can sustain our economy and improve our life as a county we have been trying to make angry business cool so that we can attract more youth and one of the things that we are doing is to introduce technology and when we bring technologies within the sector like the the mechanization part like the value addition then they are now interested then they can be able to come in and again now we are also trying to change the mindset that they don't have to be farmers they couldn't be transporters they can get into the value addition they can be the marketers they can be there the input suppliers now we see a change a change of perception and we see now the youth the young people are they are really proud to be farmers yeah especially now that they realize in cambo county there's so much opportunities for us being close to nairobi there's a lot of market and there are opportunities that are coming in now the youth are more outgoing they are now going back to the farm to make the money the girl the purpose you know that's why you find me having this feeding them like my babies you know you must laugh whatever you're doing once you change the mindset and and you know you love whatever you're doing you achieve a lot having visited our youth over the past few days i would say we have changed a lot a few years back even when we were starting this project in itself many of them were quite skeptical but having gone through the trainings having been supported to to have linkages with the market and even to access finance we're seeing them open up their eyes and their minds to the opportunities that are out there but one thing that we have really seen stand out for us is that many of these youth are people who've gone to school who could easily have gone to look for a white collar job and many who have wanted to migrate to the urban areas and also internationally to look for some of this employment and education opportunities but many of them have chosen to stay back home in the rural economy and see how they can build their agri businesses and the key message that i pass out to youth when we are out there is that it does not only have to be production there are very many opportunities that are in the agriculture sector and in agribusiness because the future is there as we're the future leaders we're the zero hunger generation and of course we have our population gradually increasing over the next few years with the food demands also growing therefore it is important that youth are brought on board and engaged in the sector to be able to produce for future [Music] generations",
