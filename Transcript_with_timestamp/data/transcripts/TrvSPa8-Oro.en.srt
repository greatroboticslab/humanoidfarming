1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,799
uh first of all I want to just say that

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,560
I am not a PhD I am a PhD candidate so

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:10,320
hopefully I'll have that done uh here

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,360
within the next year year and a half so

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,720
uh one of the things that um I'd like to

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,560
uh talk about is um how we can mimic

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,560
mother nature and I'm having a little

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,760
bit of difficulty doesn't seem like I

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,439
can move so I'm going to let you guys

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,599
move it let's go to the next slide so we

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,840
want to mimic Mother Nature with the

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,640
application of manure and when I talked

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,800
to Regulators I'd like to remind them

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,320
that you know in the early 1800s we had

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,879
over 60 million buffalo in the United

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,600
States and and the question I like to

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,239
often ask is did they stop eating or

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,840
pooping in the winter time and of of

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,120
course they didn't and and did we have a

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,800
water quality problem so um as far as we

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,559
know we had pretty good water quality

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,280
back then I think there's a few lessons

23
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,359
we can learn from uh the Buffalo first

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,000
you need to apply the manure to a live

25
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,359
crop second if we apply low rates and

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,199
we've already heard many of our speakers

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,520
talk about that and then really third is

28
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,960
proper uh management of that grass uh uh

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,880
those those Buffalo rotational gray so

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,880
if we go to the next slide and if you

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,640
look at uh This Grass uh you can see

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,000
that uh in in one case we have a lot of

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,479
roots and in another case so we have

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,960
very few so I'm reminded uh several

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,320
years ago uh there there was a report

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,560
that came out that said 45% of the osor

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,960
is coming off of graze land and that

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,560
confused me until I saw this slide in a

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,799
lot of cases where we have uh very

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,880
little top growth we'll get about 50%

41
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,079
top growth 50% uh below ground growth

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,479
and if you have the grass is over Grace

43
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:48,640
you're not going to have very many roots

44
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,840
there uh we we need to think about how

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,759
we manage not only the cover crops but

46
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,159
all all of our plants so the more Roots

47
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,680
we have you have to remember live Roots

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,520
absorb soluble nitrogen soluble

49
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,920
phosphorus next slide

50
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,119
so if we look at uh some Concepts on

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,520
eco-farming where we're using notil and

52
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,879
cover crops we hear a lot about notel

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,120
how the macropores move that water

54
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,239
through the soil very quickly so I like

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,920
to think of them as super highways but

56
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,519
if we can move that water from a

57
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,519
macropore to a micropore to a biopore uh

58
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,640
we can actually use the roots there

59
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,360
where we have the cover crops and they

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,920
can actually absorb a lot of this

61
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,519
nitrogen and they can slow down uh the

62
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,480
the the water so that we have time for

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,280
that minerology the soil Act is a a very

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,360
good filter of these nutrients so

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,519
between the minerology and live plants

66
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,040
we can absorb a lot of soluble nutrients

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,280
especially nitrogen and phosphorus next

68
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,360
next slide so as we look at um uh what

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,840
we've done when we do intensive tillage

70
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,400
we tend to get these hard pans or a plow

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,239
pan there uh here we're going down uh 20

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,360
cm or about 8 in and uh that gives us

73
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,840
less soil volume to work with where we

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,920
have continuous noil and of course my

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,799
goal is to have uh continuous living

76
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,599
cover out there we have this network of

77
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,400
biopores uh that uh will slow that water

78
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,840
down and give it time that we can

79
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,879
actually absorb uh some of that nitrogen

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,879
and phosphorus so it's it's a retention

81
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,840
time the longer we can retain that water

82
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,040
in uh in the soil the the better U we

83
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,400
can uh absorb some of that nitrogen

84
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,480
phosphorus next slide so uh as we look

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,720
at some of the data soil organic matter

86
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,360
is extremely important on average we'

87
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,519
lost about 50 to 60% of our soil organic

88
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,840
matter uh from our soils uh if you look

89
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,640
at a sandy soil um it may have anywhere

90
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,920
from 1 to 2 and a half um uh store 1 to

91
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,840
2 and A2 Ines of water but it really

92
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,920
depends on the amount of soil organic

93
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,760
matter so the higher the soil organic

94
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,079
matter what this slide shows is that so

95
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,280
organic matter and available water

96
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,879
holding capacity per inch uh inches of

97
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,799
water per one foot of soil so a sand

98
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:10,120
will go from 1 to 2 and2 a silt Loom can

99
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:13,519
go from uh almost 2 to four uh and a

100
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,640
silly clay LOM can go from 1.4 to three

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,799
again as you increase that so organic

102
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,320
matter you can uh really store more

103
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:23,520
water and have more chance to treat it

104
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,600
next slide it's also related though to

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,320
how fast the water is moving So the

106
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,759
faster the water is moving it's actually

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,880
exponential so it goes up 2 to the six t

108
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:39,039
uh Power so uh if I double the speed of

109
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,199
water I can actually uh uh carry 64

110
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,400
times more nutrients so going from 1 to

111
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:48,000
2 mph is 64 times more nutrients uh that

112
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,960
uh uh that water can hold some of our

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
streams are actually moving now at 16 to

114
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,039
to close to 30 m hour we see a lot of

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,240
flashiness there and so that's over a

116
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:59,880
thousand times more nutrients the good

117
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,560
thing about the cover crops and the

118
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,720
plants as they slow that water down and

119
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,880
then they'll drop their load next slide

120
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,320
if we look at where nutrients are

121
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,360
extracted majority of them are extracted

122
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,160
in that top couple of inches so that's

123
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,440
where we want to put the manure as much

124
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,039
as possible uh and uh the deeper we get

125
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,560
that manure in the soil if we inject it

126
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:26,840
too deep uh the closer we are to some of

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,840
our subsurface drain so again over 40%

128
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,759
generally at least on corn 40% of it's

129
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,199
be taken up within that top 6 in so we

130
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,280
want to think about root structure and

131
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,160
where that manure needs to be applied

132
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,199
next next slide so what what cover crops

133
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,080
to use uh there's a there's a number of

134
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,960
different ones we have grasses versus

135
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,000
brassas versus legumes the nice thing

136
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,080
about the grasses they tie up uh

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,400
nitrogen and phosphorus they have very

138
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,240
fibrous root systems um most of them

139
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,639
live year round one of the best cover

140
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,720
crops we have to tie up uh manure is

141
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,520
oats but the problem with oats are they

142
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,120
they generally die uh in the winter

143
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,280
brascas uh also take up uh a lot of

144
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,680
manure they they can take up a very high

145
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,919
concentration of nitrogen uh but again

146
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,599
some of those brascas especially the r

147
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,599
radishes will die when it gets to be

148
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,720
about 15° fah legumes already make their

149
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,280
own nitrogen but they will readily

150
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,880
absorb uh uh free nitrogen if it's out

151
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,039
there so in in many cases we may decide

152
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,319
to put out a uh a mixture but if we are

153
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,080
going to put out a mixture we would

154
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:36,960
really heavily lean towards some of the

155
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,160
grasses cuz they they tend to do maybe

156
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,360
just a little bit better job Force so

157
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,240
again as we look at some of the

158
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,039
different types of cover crops next

159
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,240
slide um we're looking at the grasses

160
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:52,400
some of the ones that that uh we like to

161
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,879
use Are cereal Rye TR annual Ry grass

162
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,479
barley uh wheat uh again oats is

163
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,039
probably one of the best ones but it

164
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,120
depends on what time of the year if

165
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,360
you're going into the winter uh the oats

166
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,240
can die off the Sorghum both the Sorghum

167
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,479
and most of the millets are summer

168
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,800
annuals so they will die with the first

169
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,319
frost on brasas radishes are commonly

170
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,919
used however those radishes get a very

171
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,280
big root and they uh can cause almost

172
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,639
like preferential flow they're going to

173
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,919
move that uh nutrients when they Decay

174
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,400
uh could move those nutrients lose them

175
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:28,879
very quickly so you have turn-ups uh

176
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,000
some of the ones that will survive the

177
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,879
winter are kale and rape and then the

178
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,199
legumes there's a number of different

179
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,560
legumes uh again we probably want those

180
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,879
to be a fairly small amount of the

181
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,199
mixture because they do make their own

182
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:45,039
nitrogen uh and they do tend to have tap

183
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,960
roots that will will move that manure uh

184
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,560
down uh quite deep next slide uh you can

185
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,280
see some of the nitrogen uptake uh this

186
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,319
was a study we did at Ohio State Annual

187
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,639
Ride grass had uh anywhere from 5 to

188
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:03,680
5.3% nitrogen in the tissue we had four

189
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:07,080
4550 lbs of of nitrogen being recycled

190
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,840
serial Rye had 4 to 42% nitrogen the

191
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:13,599
tissue or about 350 to 400 lounds of

192
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,639
nitrogen and of course the daycon radish

193
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,319
they had the highest uptake but again

194
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,840
they also had the fastest release

195
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:23,039
because uh they can uh uh they will

196
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,599
decompose once it gets cold next slide

197
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,840
shows uh uh probably what we'd like to

198
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,639
say is an award-winning uh uh radish

199
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,839
this is Dave brand uh who who raises a

200
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,519
lot of radish again the problem with the

201
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,880
radishes uh they take up a tremendous

202
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,519
amount of nutrients uh very efficient

203
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,399
but uh since they don't survive the

204
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,399
winter uh in most cases uh they they can

205
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,360
release it so on the next slide we're

206
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,080
looking at the amount of fall soil

207
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,480
nitrate after manure application uh this

208
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,839
was an average of 24 test over seven

209
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,040
field sites you can see where we had no

210
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,959
cover we had

211
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,360
21.3 parts for million nitrogen compared

212
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,519
to where we had the oil seed radish uh

213
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,279
we had 6.5 in in the in the soil so

214
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,839
those radishes take up a lot of of

215
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,519
nutrients however again they can be an

216
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,480
issue uh going into the winter if if

217
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,440
when they die what are the best cover

218
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,680
crops next slide for manure

219
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,440
uptake uh again oats and radish are

220
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,240
probably the best ones if you're

221
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,440
applying in the uh in the summer uh

222
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,399
early fall but if you're going to if you

223
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,320
want those nutrients toh tie over into

224
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,240
uh the winter and through the spring

225
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,079
months you can see the ones that we have

226
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,880
starred that means that they generally

227
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:44,240
survive the winter seral Rye annual Ry

228
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,839
grass are uh have some of the the best

229
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,320
root structures and take up a lot of of

230
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,000
nutrients uh wheat and barley can also

231
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,120
take up nutrients but they're not don't

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,680
have near the root structure that Cal

233
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,360
Rye or anual Ry grass for the brasas we

234
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,320
have kale and rape uh you can see the

235
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,839
turnips and the radish they generally

236
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,760
will die out and then all the uh the

237
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,800
legumes we have winter peeas crimson

238
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,360
clover red clover sweet clover hay vetch

239
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,880
uh cow peas is one that is a an annual

240
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,079
summer annual and that will die out next

241
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:20,640
crop uh as you can see here uh this is a

242
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:23,519
slide where we had annual Ry grass and

243
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,120
we can get tremendous growth uh these

244
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,720
grasses take up a uh a lot of nor her

245
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,519
where we plied 6,000 gallons of swine

246
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,880
manure and we got some tremendous growth

247
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,079
just within 45 days so again the grasses

248
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,160
have more of a fibrous root system and

249
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:44,440
are very efficient at taking up manure

250
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:47,600
nutrients next next slide cover crops

251
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,480
for winter application of manure what do

252
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,040
we want in a good cover crop we want a

253
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,920
live plant to absorb both nitrogen and

254
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,480
phosphorus I prefer to see fibrous root

255
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,440
systems versus a Tap Root not that we

256
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,760
can't do some mixtures but you want to

257
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,480
make sure that you have some that are

258
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,160
going to survive that winter uh and uh

259
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,880
have some of the fibers more fibrous

260
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,160
root systems we want something that will

261
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,519
hold up the equipment in wet weather uh

262
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,600
in a lot of cases uh especially on

263
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,279
livestock Farms there's the forage

264
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,399
possibilities of getting something out

265
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,760
of that cover crop it needs to be easy

266
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,560
to kill and then we don't want to have

267
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,360
too many carryover problems for the next

268
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,279
crop either with insects weeds or uh

269
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,600
tying up those nutrients too long so if

270
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,480
we let those grasses grow too long in

271
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,720
the spring sometimes we can get some

272
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,200
apathic effects uh or uh they'll uh tie

273
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,920
up that nitrogen and won't make it

274
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,440
available to the next crop if they get

275
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,639
too high of a carbon and nitrogen ratio

276
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,839
next C next slide cover crops again for

277
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,800
manure winter manure application uh

278
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,760
these are probably the the five best

279
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,720
ones kind of in order seral Ry annual Ry

280
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,000
grass sometimes with Annual Ride grass

281
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,399
can be a little tough to kill uh and it

282
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,240
can become a weed problem the tral The

283
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:02,639
Barley the wheat uh if you're looking at

284
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,279
mixtures uh don't want to put out too

285
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,279
many of the radish probably no more than

286
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:09,440
a pound per acre at the most oats can be

287
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,160
part of that mixture and then uh

288
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,680
obviously we can put a few of the

289
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,360
legumes in but we don't want them to

290
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,000
make up too much last issue is uh uh

291
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,920
some things that we might want to be a

292
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,519
little bit concerned about is on very

293
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,600
short pastures because we don't have the

294
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:28,199
the root growth there uh we can get uh a

295
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,639
lot of uh uh either running off the

296
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:32,720
surface or even through preferential

297
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,800
flow we can get cracks in those those

298
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,519
pastures it's all about root growth and

299
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,360
then where we have alphalpha hay because

300
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,920
it has such a long tap route uh and

301
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,519
especially on a mature alphaalpha hay

302
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,120
field uh they tend to be very leaky and

303
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,199
sometimes those can uh get into uh uh

304
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,639
the tile line so you have to be a little

305
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:54,279
bit concerned you have to pick your

306
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,240
cover crops uh in order to avoid some of

307
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:58,560
these issues so I think cover crops can

308
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,279
really help us uh uh by adding that

309
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,040
extra organic matter and tying up some

310
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,040
of these soluble nutrients
