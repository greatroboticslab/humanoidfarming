[Music]

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,279
do

3
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,039
sharing i'm root rotten for the peas a

4
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,480
lot of history of that and we just

5
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,880
wanted to see

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,320
if we could get any inhibition of that

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,600
root rot

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,840
um

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,239
we chose the clear field technology so

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,239
we'd have the option like justin pointed

11
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,280
out of of using either raptor or beyond

12
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,600
we didn't put any fertilizer with this

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,399
and we ended up just using grass

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,399
herbicide only we didn't use the raptor

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,960
so on um 13th of

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,439
june we had a pretty nasty hail storm

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,840
this was the south end of the field

18
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,920
and it was 90 mile an hour winds and

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,439
tennis ball-sized hail and it really cut

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,640
things off

21
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,200
but being cool seasoned crops

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,759
the the growing point hadn't emerged

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,520
from the soil yet and so by the fourth

24
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,040
of july this is about what it looked

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,119
like it was

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,560
really coming back nicely the moisture

27
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,040
that we had gotten

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,280
with the hailstorm really

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,119
helped to advance the crop and

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,600
by late summer

31
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,159
we had really what i thought was a

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,920
pretty decent looking crop coming

33
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,920
what we were noticing was there were

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,840
more peas on the hilltops a little

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,799
lighter soil where the canola doesn't do

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,439
as well

37
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,560
and down in the lower ground uh wetter

38
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,960
and prone to saline we had more canola

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,600
taking over in those spots

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,719
um

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,040
so when harvest came we noticed that

42
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,840
this it was high lying yellows as was

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,439
our rp uh cultivar

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,479
and they were maturing

45
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,800
way ahead of this clearfield canola we

46
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,640
um we could see that was happening so we

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,160
did go out and we desiccated with a

48
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,239
quarter round up

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,440
took a while to get everything dried

50
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,000
down

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,599
and by the time we went out there you

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
can see the peas are pretty crispy

53
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,200
and in fact when you look behind the

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
header

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,200
you could see there was quite a number

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,840
of of peas out there we felt it was

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,840
probably seven or eight bushels an acre

58
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,879
so

59
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,040
um uh

60
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,280
you know it was overall we were we were

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,120
pleased with the bushels we got but we

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,319
felt we could have done better

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,080
that's what the the mix looked like um

64
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,519
in this instance uh by weight it was

65
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,920
two-thirds

66
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,160
peas and a third canola

67
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,360
and so we stuck it in the bin this way

68
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,440
we didn't have

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,680
our cleaning operations set up we had

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,360
plans to do it later on

71
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,760
we were concerned

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,720
that if the peas were 14 moisture and

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,800
the canola was 9 or 10 moisture

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:16,319
was at all going to turn into a

75
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,800
12 moisture where the canola was molding

76
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,280
but that didn't happen um we were we

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,440
were happy with the way it stored and in

78
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,360
fact uh we didn't get around to cleaning

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,599
it for about a year and a half

80
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,080
and it came out of the bin just as nice

81
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,000
as it went in so we were pleased with

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,200
that

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,400
so that year also we tried uh chickpeas

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,959
and flax seeded with the same drill so

85
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
they they went in one inch deep um

86
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,640
together

87
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,040
we had put on too much seed we ended up

88
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,959
doing 150 pounds and that was too heavy

89
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,680
on the chickpea seed

90
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,799
and we did about 12 pounds of flax and

91
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,120
that was too little so

92
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,200
we didn't use any fertilizer

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,080
and no fungicide

94
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,599
and

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,480
really that whole summer we we didn't

96
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,200
see

97
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,680
any ascochyta that we knew about this

98
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,000
was the same timing the field got hailed

99
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,200
on you can see the line between the two

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
fields

101
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,560
and this was fourth of july same way it

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,400
was coming back very nicely

103
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,440
and by late summer um the the flax had a

104
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,120
lot of bowls on it and a lot of pods on

105
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,440
the um

106
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,520
on the chickpeas

107
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,240
when harvest time came

108
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,720
we

109
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,240
we wanted to they were drying down

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,040
pretty well together

111
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,479
we decided to defecate them also with a

112
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,360
quarter roundup

113
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:49,199
and used a draper header to cut them it

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,040
cut similar to what soybeans would

115
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
the one thing we didn't like was the

116
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,600
residue distribution you can sort of see

117
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,320
it up in the upper right corner up there

118
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,160
when you put that much flax through your

119
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,759
combine it's just not going to chop and

120
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,320
spread as nicely

121
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,560
so we felt maybe in

122
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,960
subsequent years we would consider using

123
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,000
a stripper head instead

124
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,080
um that first year we really felt that

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,560
was our best fit comparing it to the

126
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,240
piola and we were pretty excited about

127
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,800
it

128
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,280
that's what our sample looked in the in

129
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,360
the hopper

130
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,680
i don't remember exactly i want to say

131
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,199
it was uh 60

132
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,960
by weight chickpeas and 40 flax

133
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,759
you can see there were a few unthresh

134
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,720
bowls in there but overall it it really

135
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,080
worked nicely together

136
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,759
so then moving forward to 2019

137
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,919
because of the shattering and the yellow

138
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,120
peas with the clearfield canola we

139
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,479
switched to

140
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,039
maple peas

141
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,639
and maple peas are a

142
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,520
longer vine

143
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,520
type of pea full season

144
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,199
they typically if you grow them by

145
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,520
themselves they'll get

146
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,360
maybe three and a half feet tall and

147
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,520
just about a week before you harvest

148
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,520
them they all go flat and you get to put

149
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,759
all of that through the combine so we

150
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,639
were kind of excited to see how that was

151
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,639
going to work out

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,960
we did try some different seating rates

153
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,880
we did three different trials we tried

154
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,560
120 pounds

155
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,680
and 110 pounds and 100 pounds of maple

156
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,840
peas all with two and a half pounds

157
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,440
of clearfield canola

158
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:37,280
we also tried uh some trials with 25

159
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:41,440
pounds of ams ammonium sulfate uh didn't

160
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,800
see any noticeable differences there

161
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,560
2019 was one of those years that was

162
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,199
a dry start to the spring and the um the

163
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,120
early summer were quite dry

164
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,000
but by the first of july it started

165
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,199
raining and that continued on in to

166
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,599
harvest

167
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,520
like a lot of you had

168
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,319
but it they really

169
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,240
you know they filled in nicely and uh

170
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:11,199
was kind of a jungle out there in places

171
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,120
and by harvest time um you can see we

172
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,479
had some weeds out there

173
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,520
but we also noticed that the um the

174
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,000
canola still didn't quite mature

175
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,960
as early as what the peas did

176
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,120
so

177
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,800
you know between rainstorms we felt we

178
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,520
better hurry up and get these off before

179
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,160
we lost them so we did desiccate with

180
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,080
reglone which is a lot like chromoxone

181
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,440
it's uh it's it's diquat versus paraquat

182
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,639
and um we got a pretty fast burn down on

183
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,720
that

184
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,280
and um

185
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,360
you know we had we had some struggles

186
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,639
with it you can see the that the stems

187
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,000
of the canola plants were pretty green

188
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,280
but um

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,800
overall we we got through it

190
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,800
um

191
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,440
we also tried some um

192
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,960
some yellow peas with canola actually i

193
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,800
should back up this was part of the um

194
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,720
population trial

195
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,879
the strip that you can see down the

196
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,840
middle that's lodged so bad

197
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:18,160
that was 120 pounds of maple peas

198
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,759
and as you go to the left of that that

199
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,919
was 110

200
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,400
and we came to the realization we really

201
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,800
didn't need that many maple peas in that

202
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,479
mixture it's a smaller seed

203
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,560
so um

204
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,719
we had also tried some yellow peas with

205
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,680
the canola and once again we had just

206
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,159
too much shatter on the yellows

207
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,440
but we also did try some yellow peas by

208
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,680
themselves

209
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,680
and once again this was a field that had

210
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,320
some history of root rot in it and we

211
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,600
had grown peas too many times over the

212
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,680
years

213
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,680
and

214
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,360
those peas by themselves were just

215
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,000
loaded with root rot and really were

216
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,000
quite poor

217
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,200
so that year also

218
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,440
we did

219
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,440
oh i just wanted to to say when we

220
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,120
harvested the

221
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,640
maple peas and canola we tried one round

222
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,560
with a stripper hat

223
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,680
but we felt we were shattering too much

224
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,600
of the canola so we did end up doing the

225
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,080
majority of it or the rest of it with a

226
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,120
draper head

227
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,040
so that year also we did um

228
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,519
try some more chickpea and flax that was

229
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,440
what we were most excited about and we

230
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,920
backed off that chickpea rate to about

231
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,680
120 pounds and we increased the flax up

232
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,000
to 15 pounds

233
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,040
we had some weeds and spots

234
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,720
but

235
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,399
it wasn't

236
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,519
too bad

237
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,519
but once again we had that prolonged wet

238
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,720
spell at harvest time

239
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,200
and

240
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,080
these two they're both indeterminate

241
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,440
type crops and with the cooler weather

242
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,440
and the

243
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,120
the the moisture that we got they just

244
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,040
wouldn't dry down

245
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,560
eventually the chickpeas started to

246
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,279
shatter and there was green mold moldy

247
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,279
seeds and black moldy seeds and

248
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,399
so it was getting to be

249
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,880
go time it was the first of october

250
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,519
and we just decided we'd go out with a

251
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,519
stripper head and just salvage what flax

252
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,680
that we could off of that

253
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,839
but what i was amazed we got a few

254
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,720
chickpeas in there but um it was

255
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,720
primarily flax but what amazed me was

256
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,800
that off of 15 pounds of of flaxseed we

257
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,920
ended up with about 13 bushelly acre

258
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,800
flax

259
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,680
and adjacent to that we had some flax by

260
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,120
itself seeded at a full rate of maybe 48

261
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,279
or 50 pounds

262
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,279
and that only yielded like 22. it was

263
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,519
one of those years that wasn't a great

264
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,839
one for the flax but i was i was

265
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,560
impressed with what 15 pounds of seed

266
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,560
could do for us

267
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,240
so in 2020 we switched it up again uh we

268
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,000
just wanted to get that maturity timing

269
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,720
figured out so we switched over to

270
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,839
yellow mustard and maple pea

271
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,240
and

272
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,920
we backed our seeding rate on the on the

273
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,800
maples off to 90 pounds and we

274
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,040
put in a half rate of of mustard five

275
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,360
pounds we felt that was a pretty nice

276
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,360
match

277
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,760
it's

278
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,320
they really

279
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,399
do a nice job of flowering at the same

280
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,600
time they attract a lot of

281
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,519
bees

282
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,079
into a mix like that

283
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,200
and they trellis together quite nicely

284
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,360
so

285
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,880
uh we're pretty happy with the way they

286
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,399
were looking

287
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,040
until uh an august second hail storm and

288
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,959
it wasn't uh i mean i've had worse hail

289
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,959
storms that have come through

290
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,560
but you can see there's a lot of mustard

291
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,000
on the ground there's some peas on the

292
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,000
ground

293
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,160
it didn't get all of them you can see

294
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,320
there were were certain clusters that

295
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,279
were greener so we still had some

296
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,279
production there so

297
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,200
seeing as how we had already lost some

298
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,000
to hail we decided to use the stripper

299
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,839
head and we were pretty happy with that

300
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,920
we you know it was tough to tell if we

301
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,240
were losing any more after the header

302
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,120
had gone by from what the hail storm had

303
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,800
done

304
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,880
but

305
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,720
at least we were able to

306
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,279
get the material through the combine

307
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,800
move a little faster and we were leaving

308
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,760
a foot or better maybe maybe even

309
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,959
16 18 inches of stubble out there to

310
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,680
catch snow

311
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,120
and uh help with erosion and those kinds

312
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,000
of things

313
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,800
i was amazed at how many uh

314
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,959
pheasants were out in the uh in that

315
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,880
field and this little guy jumped on and

316
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,120
rode for a couple rounds

317
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,440
um i finally had to get off onto the

318
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,480
platform and just pick him up and throw

319
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,639
him out

320
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,959
and he takes off flying

321
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,399
and he just he lands about 10 feet from

322
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,920
a hawk that was sitting out there and

323
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,959
i'm just going and you can't fix stupid

324
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,959
talk like me though

325
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,959
so um

326
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,200
we also tried with the mustard we tried

327
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,279
some yellow peas and that's a pretty

328
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,639
good fit also

329
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,240
the peas still

330
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,639
dried down a little bit ahead of the

331
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,519
mustard but we didn't dare to use the

332
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,279
stripper header on that use the draper

333
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,800
and

334
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,240
i think that's something that i'll

335
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,560
probably try again um most of the time

336
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,160
the maple peas carry uh

337
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,720
uh a higher

338
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,639
value than than the yellows but this

339
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,560
year it's gone the other way actually

340
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,880
the yellows are worth more than the

341
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,199
maples

342
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,120
so after the uh uh chickpea and flax

343
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,360
mess the year before

344
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,279
we we decided we'd try lentils of

345
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,199
plaques i had seen a neighbor a couple

346
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,120
of neighbors that have been trying this

347
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,920
and they've been pretty successful with

348
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,480
it

349
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,000
i thought i'd give that a try

350
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,959
we

351
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,399
we use 60 pounds of large lentils and 12

352
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,600
pounds of

353
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,320
flax

354
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,519
we had a lot of weeds in it

355
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,920
except for we had one done one strip of

356
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,000
fall valley we had actually intended to

357
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,120
plant soybeans on that

358
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,440
but

359
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,160
that's the strip off to the right

360
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,040
and that did a nice job on the weeds but

361
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,120
it thinned out the flax quite a bit so i

362
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,600
don't know if backing off from three

363
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,160
ounces to two ounces would be

364
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,440
a better idea or just increasing the

365
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,760
flax rate to um to

366
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,279
help some of that thinning

367
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,079
um

368
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:41,120
we still had disease

369
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,399
audrey's team had come out and scouted

370
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,120
that field

371
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:49,120
and let me know i i i believe it was a

372
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,720
fan of myself that we had in that field

373
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,760
and um

374
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,240
um

375
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,639
it was very poor we we ended up cutting

376
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,880
it with a stripper header just felt if

377
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,000
we can leave as much of that residue

378
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,360
upright again to catch snow and

379
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,199
keep from getting any erosion we were

380
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,199
we were ahead there was

381
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,279
you know the lentils we did get were

382
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:16,560
pretty beat up and and uh

383
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,800
we haven't gone back to that one since

384
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,279
so in 2021

385
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,639
we stayed with a maple pea and mustard

386
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,680
um

387
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,920
this went on an oats field the

388
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,560
the oats had been hit by that same hail

389
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,839
storm that got us on the on the maple

390
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
pea mustard

391
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,519
fields so we had a lot of volunteer oats

392
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,639
in it

393
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,560
we had to use uh two grass applications

394
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,600
this summer went on we just keep getting

395
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,800
new flushes and we still ended up with

396
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,880
some oats in it

397
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,199
at harvest time

398
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,240
we were fortunate this last summer we

399
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,480
had

400
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,759
one really good rain but we did have a

401
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,079
lot of a lot of hot weather with it

402
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,839
uh this was up along the north end of

403
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,199
the field along the road east of our

404
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,959
house um we had some flea beetle damage

405
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,639
and they probably worked their way out

406
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,000
maybe 60 feet or so into the field

407
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,680
but

408
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,839
what i like about

409
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:20,720
an inner crop is had this been just uh

410
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,480
mustard or canola on its own that kind

411
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,519
of flea beetle pressure would have been

412
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,920
huge

413
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,240
uh at least we had the peas to take over

414
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,399
it would have been bare ground and weeds

415
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,839
if it hadn't been for the the peas

416
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,519
taking over

417
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,519
in that area

418
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,519
um

419
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,839
so as summer went on they grew together

420
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,480
quite nicely again and

421
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,880
um when harvest time came we decided

422
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,279
again to try the stripper head and had

423
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,399
pretty good luck with it uh until we got

424
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,680
into some

425
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,639
some greener areas we switched and went

426
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,199
and cut some other crops for three days

427
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,639
and when we came back we've had some hot

428
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,480
windy days

429
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,160
and things were a little too crispy we

430
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,600
we tried the stripper head again and we

431
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,319
were just shattering too much of the

432
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,120
peas and the mustard so we ended up

433
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,199
finishing with a draper head

434
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,880
um

435
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,120
so we saw some

436
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,319
really strange differences uh this is

437
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,319
the field east of the house

438
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,160
we hit a line all of a sudden we went

439
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,799
from between 40 and 50 bushels down into

440
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,720
between 20 and 30 bushels

441
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,120
and we we didn't quite understand what

442
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,919
that was our seeding rate was the same

443
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,640
our

444
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,919
previous chemicals were the same uh it

445
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,640
had all been

446
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,200
hailed out oats the year before we were

447
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,200
at a loss i started looking back at

448
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,559
cropping history

449
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,360
and i

450
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,840
came to the realization in 2013 we had

451
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,120
seated peas on the south field till we

452
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,200
ran out

453
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,919
and on the north side of that

454
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,799
that had been flags

455
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,480
and

456
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,720
so we were still seeing

457
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,640
and again this was a field with a lot of

458
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,720
history of root rot so we were still

459
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,160
seeing some of that root rot taking hold

460
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,440
eight years later

461
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,039
so

462
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,720
the mustard helps to inhibit uh the root

463
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:19,919
rot but it it isn't the key role um

464
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,640
and i question if maybe the canola has a

465
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,559
stronger anti-fungal property than what

466
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,919
the the mustard does

467
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,480
but um

468
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,480
that was a little surprising to us on

469
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,160
the other quarter um

470
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,880
we knew we were going to have an issue

471
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,280
on the east we could see it all summer

472
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,840
that was actually the strip where we

473
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,200
started in 2018 so we didn't get give it

474
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,039
a long enough break so it isn't again

475
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,320
you still need to keep your rotations in

476
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,559
place but uh i think it it does help

477
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,520
having a brassica

478
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,679
in with your inner crop

479
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,919
this past year we didn't try a flax

480
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,200
inner crop with chickpeas or lentils or

481
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,240
anything

482
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,840
we went into the spring terribly dry

483
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,679
like the rest of you

484
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,520
there is no crop insurance on these

485
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,080
inner crops i was pretty comfortable

486
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,320
with the maple pea and mustard but uh

487
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,880
but less so with the flax

488
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,960
so i did a just a kind of a simple

489
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,880
comparison um

490
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,640
only using variable costs i didn't use

491
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,919
direct cost like

492
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,520
seeding or harvesting or land costs but

493
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,240
just uh a quick uh breakdown uh we had

494
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,440
about eight dollars 75 cents into

495
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,559
chemical

496
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:41,600
uh about 35 into seed

497
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,400
we used 40 pounds of map and 105 of urea

498
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,880
and

499
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,160
six dollars spreading charge uh for a

500
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,720
total of 77 of expense

501
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,200
um the income on that

502
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,880
uh this was a field that we had probably

503
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,600
two miles south of where we had the

504
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,600
maple pea mustard and um

505
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,840
it looked better all summer but i think

506
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,520
the heat affected it a lot worse than

507
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,640
what i realized

508
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,400
ended up 720 pounds we had a 37 cent

509
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,360
contract

510
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,559
for a gross of 266 and our net income

511
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,440
after variable was 189

512
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,000
now on the intercrop

513
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,159
again we had a little more chemical bill

514
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,679
there because we had to use two grass

515
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,200
treatments on

516
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,560
those fields

517
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,880
a little higher seed cost

518
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,760
[Music]

519
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,480
the inoculant we we have a cost there

520
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,559
but

521
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,840
our fertilizer and spreading

522
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,640
zero

523
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,320
and then we feel about a 17 acre

524
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,480
separation cost

525
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,799
for a total of 72 which is pretty

526
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,679
similar to what the mustard was but

527
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,640
by the time we we separated out 17

528
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,679
bushels of peas at 15

529
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,720
and 318 pounds of mustard at the 37

530
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,039
cents

531
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,320
it gave us a quite a bit higher gross

532
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:03,679
income and left us with uh 300

533
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,799
um net after variable costs

534
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,000
so

535
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,960
um

536
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,200
my neighbor morgan jacobs who's here

537
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,000
uh was kind enough to share with me his

538
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,960
breakdown and you know we saw

539
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,679
very similar results um

540
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,760
the the total costs he he put in his

541
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,679
combining and spraying and

542
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:28,159
seeding cost but um

543
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,400
you know it's still the the

544
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,600
the companion crop was the lower of the

545
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,240
three

546
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,919
and the gross income was the higher of

547
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,240
the three so

548
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,760
uh one thing he did that i really liked

549
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,080
was he had put together a uh yield that

550
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,520
it would take to equal what the inner

551
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,280
crop has done

552
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,240
in the case of the mustard

553
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,640
uh

554
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,400
he would have needed nearly 1500 pounds

555
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:58,320
compared to the 950 that he got to equal

556
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,080
the the bottom line of of the inner crop

557
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,039
and with the maple peas he was pretty

558
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,760
close he would only needed 37 versus the

559
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,600
35 that he got but um

560
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,400
you know there are a lot of advantages

561
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,840
to

562
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,080
not having to

563
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,440
scrape the ground to get the peas and

564
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,120
that was talked about earlier

565
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,679
so and of course there's going to be

566
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,880
advantages and disadvantages between the

567
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:26,559
two um i like the fact that it adds

568
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,679
diversity in the same field every year

569
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,640
it

570
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,240
has that potential for a higher combined

571
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,080
yield

572
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,760
we're reducing our fertilizer and

573
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,720
chemical bills

574
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:42,240
and i i truly believe that we are seeing

575
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,120
a disease reduction in in our in our

576
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,039
pees and and in the chickpeas in the

577
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,600
years that we've done that

578
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,559
and of course the disadvantages we don't

579
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,799
have

580
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,720
viable crop insurance we could be taking

581
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,640
hail insurance i didn't get a quote on

582
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,640
that decided it was too expensive

583
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,400
after three years

584
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,600
we might be able to get a written

585
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,760
agreement from rma so we'll see if that

586
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,240
comes out and see what value they give

587
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,120
us and and what the cost of that premium

588
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,919
is

589
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,919
of course the timing of maturities um

590
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,280
i've had to play with that a lot to get

591
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,640
things um to work out but

592
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,039
it is an issue

593
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:27,600
there's that need to separate it's

594
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,840
definitely an expense i do have a 5-2

595
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,400
quick clean also and i had planned on

596
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,600
running the maple peas and mustard

597
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,280
through that

598
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,679
this year we had a lot of dead

599
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,240
grasshoppers in the sample we had that

600
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,200
load of oats that was in there i just

601
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,679
felt it was just a little too dirty so

602
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,760
uh again i hired uh the neighbors who

603
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,640
have a bench sieve mill to run it

604
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,279
through

605
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,960
later on and then of course

606
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,279
we're pretty limited on our herbicide

607
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,440
options uh pre-plant is probably the

608
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,320
best way to go if you're after broadleaf

609
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,559
weeds fortunately the inner crops that

610
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,200
i've been using are

611
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,960
are grass tolerance so we we have that

612
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,960
in our in our tool belt at least

613
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,919
so i guess that's all i have um

614
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,440
did you want me to take a couple

615
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,640
questions or do you want to wait for the

616
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,919
panel

617
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,600
um well does anyone have any questions

618
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,600
that would be specific for drag because

619
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,799
we're going to have a panel

620
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,240
here next with um

621
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,559
maybe we'll just go right into the panel

622
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:36,720
i think sure yeah okay so we'll uh

623
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:38,400
oh audrey there was one question online

624
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,440
okay sure go ahead

625
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,000
um

626
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,480
sheldon asks which canola variety did

627
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,880
you use and is it a variety recommended

628
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,760
for straight cutting

629
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,360
um

630
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,880
it was pioneer

631
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,080
let's see

632
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,480
ends in a 76 h76 does that sound right

633
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,480
morgan

634
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:05,200
it really isn't a shatter tolerant um

635
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,919
uh canola variety uh not not like you're

636
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,360
invigors but um

637
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,600
again the reason we went with the

638
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,600
clearfield variety was thinking if we

639
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:18,480
needed to use the beyond a raptor on

640
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,279
as a as a broadleaf control

641
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,159
but

642
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,640
you know

643
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,320
i i think this could work really well

644
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,440
if we could find an early enough

645
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,320
seasoned

646
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,200
shatter tolerant canola to do this with

647
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,919
i

648
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,520
i'm still searching but

649
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,000
for the time being there's been some

650
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,440
nice contracts on yellow mustard and i

651
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,440
plan to do that again this year

652
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,720
you
