  "text": "foreign [Music] it's a farmer directed Grant arm from the USDA that started in 1988 with the farm bill because the USDA knew that farmers are always on The Cutting Edge to find applied solutions to their problems that they have Liz Brownlee Liz and her husband Nate raise livestock on pasture at nightfall Farm in southeast Indiana they sell via farmers markets restaurants and independent groceries but their meat and egg CSA is the Cornerstone of their Farm they typically have 50 families in their CSA and over 90 percent retention they raise meat chickens laying hens sheep pigs and turkeys on 50 acres Liz works as director of farm farmer programs for partners in food and farming pif which I would love to hear more about that too Liz um so my husband and I farm in southeast Indiana We're practically in Kentucky and so we are in a very rural space we're right where the glaciers stopped if you can picture it so it goes from flat flat flat flat flat to hilly um and we're on my family's farm so we worked on farms up in New England for about five years learning worked on organic farms and most of them had csas and we learned a ton from seeing that behind the scenes reality so if you're still in that aspiring phase I highly encourage you to or even if you're already Farm but you're thinking of adding a CSA find somebody who has a CSA near you and work on their Farm to help with distro I would love for somebody to offer that to me if you're near me come help me with pickup days and see what it's like what the decisions are behind the scenes what the stress points are in organizing pickup days things like that um we saw it work really well both as collaborative csas where 14 farmers were working together in Pennsylvania and doing a unified share we saw individual Farms doing meat csas that really worked and that's what got us excited so we actually run a meat and egg CSA only no vegetables um and we've mostly talked about veggies and meat so far but I'll add you mentioned soup right we've seen soup csas and cheese csas and bread csas and all sorts of cool stuff we stick to the non-perishables and I would say that's one of the keys to our CSA is that um there is no getting overwhelmed because if you don't have time to cook that week you throw it in the freezer and as long as you don't do that with six consecutive months of chicken you're gonna be fine um Okay so let me zoom out a little bit now that you know roughly who I am and where I'm from um I wanted to say on the the Sarah grants raise your hand if you love Sarah farmer Rancher grants who's already in love oh I can convince a bunch of you then okay great so if you don't already know Sarah has a bunch of different sorts of Grants and their farmer Rancher grants are specifically for farmers who are doing something Innovative trying something out that's either new to their state let's say maybe in Michigan they're killing it with X practice they know how to grow you know I don't know something really neat like they can grow mushrooms on an urban farm and I'm an urban farm in Indiana and nobody's doing that I could apply for a Sarah Grant to take a known idea that's Innovative and sustainable and try it in my place or if there's just an idea that I haven't heard of anybody else trying I could apply for funds to do that thing so the surrogant that my farm that we applied for we went into Cahoots with another Farm because here's another cool thing about Sarah grants you can ask for money I think it's up to nine thousand dollars per for one Farm but if you go in with others you can ask for more money which is even better so we had two Farms so we asked for like 18 Grand and if you go up to three Farms you can ask for twenty seven thousand dollars a lot of money um it's not going to change the world but it might change your farm so that's the other key thing is that you can really think strategically about how a Sarah Grant can not only research and trial something Innovative and help other Farmers because a key piece of it is that you're sharing out whatever you learn you share through talks or videos or some way to get the word out because the whole idea is this is government money right they don't want it just to help one individual business they want it to help lots of farmers but also can you use that Sarah Grant as a way to take some big step forward so for our CSA with meat a big bottleneck was processing that's a problem for Farmers all across the Midwest all across the nation in fact and so we wanted to find out what is the very smallest processing facility that you could open and make money how small could it get because our our farm and our friend's Farm Palmer Bowers Farmstead they raise cattle we do sheep and turkeys and chickens and and pigs and for all of those animals it's really hard to get a butcher date and maybe you know this well um you know in in March I called on the first day the butcher was taken butcher dates for sheep and they said How's December 27th and I said sold I'll take it because that was the only date I could get you're scheduling months if not years out at this point so we wanted to know could we open our own on-farm processing facility that would be State inspected and would it ever pencil out would we make any money so our project was actually a feasibility study um because we felt like we've kind of got the CSA thing working and their Farm felt like they had the freezer beef thing working it wasn't selling our product that was the problem it was getting from animal to product um and so we hired some fancy people who knew how to do the math and we paid ourselves to meet every month for two years to work through these questions and we worked with a chef and and basically we put together a really cool set of resources that we have not utilized so we've actually decided not to open a processing facility at this point they might they're like thinking about it and working on the the local zoning things needed to open the facility um but in some ways that's what a feasibility is supposed a feasibility study is supposed to do help you decide do I want this or not and I would say once a month at least somebody emails us out of the blue and said hey I found your thing online about your Sarah project and we're thinking about opening a facility in fill in the blank state and it was really helpful because we hadn't yet seen a free floor plan and layout for a really small facility we hadn't yet seen an equipment list of what you'd need um so we developed all those tools and now they live on our website um and if that's useful to you I'm not trying to get clicks because these don't do me any good but nightfallfarm.com and there's like an about us and you click processing um and Sarah paid for all of that and so we really wanted to get out to other farmers and be useful to other Farmers it's not directly helping our CSA which is kind of a bummer it's not directly helping our farm although it did probably save us a lot of money I think it helped us realize like wow that could that could pencil out we came up with a budget for a three species so all red meat right lamb pork beef uh facility that'd be open with one and a half employees and it can pencil out in 10 years it'll pay for itself and it'll be viable but we realized like wow we don't want to do that sounds miserable we just we decided that that wasn't for us um because you would that would be all the work every single week um whereas right now my husband and I are one and a half people farming and we've that helped us realize we want to be outside farming so that was our stair project what do we do on our farm um I wanted to tell you let's see so when we moved home to Indiana um we wanted our farm to be a piece of the solution on climate change and on rebuilding our rural communities so that's really been the focus and you were spot on that the first yeah your first chunk of CSA members are people you know so our first year we started with 12 CSA members and we knew every one of them and um and now we're at 50 really consistently and we really like that number that's what our firm can sustain um our our rural Place could not have a 400 member CSA I don't know 400 people who would buy a CSA and um and that's okay that's where we're at it's a pretty poor Community um and and for a lot of people value means cheap so finding our members has been a really interesting process you would think that our members are all uh well to do and they are not we have a lot of school secretaries and non-profit workers and military families and Factory workers we also have doctors and professors but it's a real cross-section and I think the unifying thing is that people prioritize good food so they they might come to us for a really wide breadth of reasons so some people when we ask why are you joining they say oh I care about the environment and other people say oh it's for Humane Animal practices and other people say I want to support small businesses in my local community but when we ask why they stay they say it's because it tastes good and that makes me really happy and so we get these people who wouldn't normally interact standing in line to pick up their CSA share interacting and that feels like a real win um let's see what else about the CSA in terms of connection I want to add to your connection list so um we do things like tree plantings and potlucks recipe books things like that for our CSA members we're going to make t-shirts this winter we're gonna have like a t-shirt making party that should be fun um and then just to bring it back to the CSA or to the sale project I do still hope to make jerky if anybody out there has figured out how to do jerky in a commercial kitchen well following all the rules let me know I haven't figured it out yet but that the Sarah project did really help us realize like oh even though we're gonna have to deal with those longer wait times at The Butcher and schedule way ahead there are still some other pieces of that processing and value-added puzzle that we think we could solve and maybe that's another share Grant I don't know um because people don't all love lamb but almost everyone loves jerky and if that jerky happened to be made of lamb I think they'd be okay with it so we're trying to figure these things out you know how do we offer things that make our CSA members lives easier and sell the products that that we want to raise [Music]",
