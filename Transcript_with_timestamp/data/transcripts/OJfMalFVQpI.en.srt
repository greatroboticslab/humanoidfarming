00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,040
today my team PR shaki will be

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,799
presenting a problem statement ID 1554

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,920
which is about smart irrigation system

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,400
for precision farming nowadays water

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,080
scarcity is a major challenge in

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,480
agriculture leading to insufficient

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,080
water usage and reduced drop traditional

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,359
irrigation method often result in

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,960
overuse or underuse of water however we

10
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,599
have developed an smart irrigation

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,240
system that utilizes iot and

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,119
Technologies to monitor soil moisture

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,960
nutritional level and weather condition

14
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,800
this system will provide a realtime data

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,520
for Farmers enabling them to make

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,079
informed decision on irrigation

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,360
scheduling th optimizing water usage and

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,879
maximize crop yeld we have come with a

19
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,440
robotic car fixed with different sensors

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,640
to provide such as for soil testing soil

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,000
moisture soil temperature then NSP for

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,600
motion we will be using IR sensors for

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,600
paste I thermal camera for air humidity

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,879
and temperature dd22 for checking

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,399
nutritional level of soil NPK sensors

26
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:03,120
and for detecting rain rain sensors all

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,839
sensors are controlled by ESP 826 which

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,799
drives the car according to the data

29
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,640
described by the farmer the data

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,680
collected to an I blink platform which

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,560
is analyzed precisely by using aimf

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,560
these datas are shown to the former

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,720
using user interface which shows

34
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,479
temperature water level humidity GPRS

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,040
nutrition and insects according to these

36
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,479
analysis the motor that is connected to

37
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,960
our fertilizer pump is opened and closed

38
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,799
by one click of the farmer here we have

39
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,159
also use GPRS sensor to detect the

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,040
location of the car the robotic car

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,079
consists of omni wheel which is free to

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,040
move in any direction without any D here

43
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,920
we have also prepared a video for this

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,920
problem thank you
