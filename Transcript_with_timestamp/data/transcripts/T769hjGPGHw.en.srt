1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,240
glass houses are really important for us

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,359
here in dalford

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:11,200
uh it's a short summer um

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,840
and long winter we have here so

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,759
these little dwellings that we've built

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,119
all around the place

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,439
and also various frost protection

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,560
such as above here on the north side

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,400
where we can grow kiwis and citrus

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,400
and more citrus down here

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,840
yeah just it's citrus will grow well in

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,680
dalsford

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,239
uh like these lovely maya lemons

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,120
but there is a little bit of frost

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,000
protection above and so

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,879
this dwarf lumen has just um struggled

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,399
for the first

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,079
two or three years and then it's about

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,800
five or six years old now and it's

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,760
really

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,800
starting to pump same with this uh blood

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,280
orange

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,039
it's really going gangbusters now but

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,879
the first few years we had

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,240
frost protection across the top there

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,240
and it's on a north facing wall

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,560
an earth rammed earth wall and that

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,799
creates a nice heat bank

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,600
these uh citrus are doing okay here as

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,400
well

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,360
we've got more uh we've got grapefruit

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,640
lime and

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,119
mandarins over here and another orange

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,920
um again there's frost protection above

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,720
them so

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,080
it's they're not fully enclosed these

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,960
ones but they are

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,320
getting enough cross protection i've

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,840
just finished this little

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:40,320
cloche um the uh

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:43,040
the galvanized frame i got from the tip

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,000
a local glass guy cut some glass panels

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,920
for us

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,920
and the wood came from a friend's mill

45
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,520
liam and nick and pete's mill they're

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,719
doing awesome things out there

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,320
sustainable uh timber millers

48
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,119
and um all sorts of different artisans

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,960
are out there

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,439
and they're also growing food pigs and

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,239
chickens and orchards and

52
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,280
just awesome so yeah these were off cuts

53
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,200
that i was able to

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,440
repurpose um yeah so

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
and then there's glass houses over here

56
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,040
as well

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,720
again there's citrus in there we really

58
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,720
want to build our citrus

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,480
this one this is another blood orange

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,319
that just went in last year

61
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,080
it's doing really well it's like a

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,160
little tardis or

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,239
outdoor dunny this one doesn't have a

64
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,560
roof on it so it gets rain

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,920
but it's enough of a protection with all

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,200
the glass

67
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,840
in there and it really heats up

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,519
beautifully um

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,440
and uh yeah it creates a nice little

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,560
micro climate and this one

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,200
here where we're stretching a goat skin

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,360
on

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,879
at the moment but this one's growing a

74
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,760
jam japanese

75
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,959
mandarin and uh woody's got a little

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,720
pineapple

77
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,440
project going on over there and there's

78
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,920
a um we've had some

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,519
uh chili's and capsicums and then this

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,920
is a little uh

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,560
tamarillo that got knocked by the frost

82
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,120
so

83
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
it's in here as a nursery yeah so

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,080
basically

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,800
um glass houses greenhouses

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,400
we build them out of whatever we can old

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,920
window frames

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,200
um things that uh

89
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,560
we yeah we basically uh

90
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,680
salvage and then reconstruct and

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,680
uh put together again so

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,799
this is gardening in a cold climate

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,799
extending the growing season
