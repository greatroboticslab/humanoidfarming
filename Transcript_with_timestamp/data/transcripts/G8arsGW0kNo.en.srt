1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:04,399
good afternoon

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:13,679
everybody I am very honored and pleased

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:17,080
to introduce our seminar speaker for

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,400
today he's Dr Bert CER that you see here

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,519
he's our senior scientist in the

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:28,599
division and he joined Erie in March uh

7
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:30,880
2011 but uh before that he was also at

8
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,440
eie like many of us here and then

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:39,640
returned back in 20111 or 20 yeah

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:43,440
2011 and uh joined our uh irrigated rice

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:47,039
breeding now he's leading it and before

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,000
that I would like to mention that uh he

13
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,000
was at the University of Melbourne where

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,399
he did his PhD and his bachelor's degree

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,079
with

16
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,280
honors and uh from Erie in 2005 to 2006

17
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,719
he went back to Australia and joined Jo

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,240
the uh primary Industries in uh

19
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,880
Department of primary Industries in uh

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,920
Australia uh and uh became the national

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,400
program leader of the durum wh uh

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,560
reading program so uh here at Erie he is

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,640
leading our irrigated rice reading

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,600
program and I would like to introduce

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:28,720
him as our speaker for today Dr Bert

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,799
colard his talk uh will be on uh

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,720
redesigning Eris irrigated breeding

28
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,720
program Dr

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,280
K thank you very much and good afternoon

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,799
to

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,479
everyone so I think many of you are

32
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,640
aware that there's been an enormous

33
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,840
amount of changes happening in the plant

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,240
reading of genetics and biotechnology

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,240
division it's probably an understatement

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,039
because I dare say that there haven't

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,399
been such dramatic changes in the last

38
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,200
50

39
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,920
years I will tell you this afternoon

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,520
about just some of those changes

41
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,720
particularly concerning the irrigated

42
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,280
breeding program so it's too much one

43
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,000
Thursday seminar is not enough to talk

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,440
about all of them and I I will leave

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,200
some content for my colleagues to uh

46
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,560
inform you about in the future but I

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,800
will specifically talk about the

48
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,160
irrigated bre

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,440
program first we might start with just a

50
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,879
little bit of hisory

51
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,239
uh I think most of us are aware of that

52
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,599
irie has a very illustrious and Rich

53
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,400
history it really started in

54
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:45,879
1966 when ir8 was was developed and

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,879
released and I think sometimes sobering

56
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:53,480
to remember that at the time Farmers

57
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:55,400
used traditional varieties and typical

58
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,599
you know yields were you know several

59
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,640
tons per hectare but after this first

60
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,959
semi dwarf variety

61
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,040
uh

62
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,040
yield the yield just shot through the

63
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,480
roof it was we're talking 6 to8 tons per

64
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,640
hectare and even in some really

65
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,599
favorable environments it would you know

66
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,720
nearly break 10 tons per hectare so this

67
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,120
was truly a revolutionary change in in

68
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,120
rice

69
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,680
production I had to do some counting to

70
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,599
see how many varieties had actually

71
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,159
released uh from the irrigated program

72
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:33,680
alone the were 45 or something like that

73
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,480
it's sometimes hard to keep track of all

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,480
of them because sometimes writ is

75
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,680
release in different countries with

76
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,400
different names but um it's really a

77
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,400
credit to the Breeders and the breeding

78
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,519
team that really developed all of those

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:53,400
varieties so initially from Dr Kush Dr P

80
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,720
and the team the the local staff that

81
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,480
really spend so many long hard hours in

82
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,000
the Sun but it's not the quantity it's

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,239
really the

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,959
quality and what I mean by that is uh

85
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,599
the some would argue the true measure of

86
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,040
how successful the variety is is

87
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,599
certainly not you know one doesn't

88
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,680
measure how good a breeder is on how

89
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,799
many varieties are released it's really

90
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,320
what is done with them and I've just

91
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,759
selected two varieties which

92
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,320
really almost led to the term a new term

93
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,880
to be proposed called Mega varieties and

94
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,360
I think Dave mckill was the first person

95
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,720
to to describe this or you know this

96
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,759
this term it it means a variety that's

97
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,000
grown on millions of

98
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,960
hectares so we're not saying it's just

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,680
popular it's extremely popular and if

100
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,400
you look closely here at this

101
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,199
table just for ir36 that was arguably

102
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,440
one of the first mega varieties of rice

103
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,280
that you know in the Philippines alone

104
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,320
it was pushing 4 million

105
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,720
hectares but the real Superstar

106
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,639
of rice varieties was undoubtedly ir64

107
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,320
and if you just look at the coverage of

108
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:13,000
this single variety alone it is quite

109
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,280
staggering just in Indonesia 47 million

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,440
hectares it's quite remarkable and I'm

111
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,840
not aware of any other crop that even

112
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,840
comes

113
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,840
close for our friends from SS this is

114
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,560
probably the bottom line there was a uh

115
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,240
an independent assessment done by ACR

116
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,479
which is the Australian Center for

117
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,000
international agricultural research and

118
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:41,919
they estimated the impact of irrigated

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,360
varieties in three Southeast Asian

120
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,479
countries and that was the bottom line

121
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,360
there 1.46 billion doar in terms of the

122
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,400
economic benefits per year and they

123
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,960
broke it down per country and you can

124
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,280
see you can you can read this this

125
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,639
report for yourself so it is it's a free

126
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,960
uh it's actually downloadable from the

127
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,240
ACR

128
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:08,599
website so with that rich history and

129
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,880
that quite Grand history in fact some

130
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:13,680
have described ir's irrigated program as

131
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,520
the most famous in the world if you and

132
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,160
when you consider what the outputs have

133
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,280
been that is probably a fair comment so

134
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,919
the question you're probably asking is

135
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,680
why have we changed

136
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,120
things I shall explain but first I'll

137
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,680
just keep you in suspense for a bit

138
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,680
longer I'll just give you some

139
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,400
background which I think is critical for

140
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,319
the context of what I will say first

141
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,080
point this is like plant reading 101

142
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:45,560
first point just so you're all on the

143
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,120
same page rice breeding takes a long

144
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,960
time it's generally accepted here at

145
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,720
irie that a typical time to develop a

146
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,520
new variety would be about 9 to 10 years

147
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,960
so it's a lot of work actually literally

148
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,879
is a lot of work the from seaing to

149
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,919
harvest there just enormous amount of

150
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,360
that operations that are required in the

151
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,520
field uh in front of a computer storing

152
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,400
seeds and what have you so there's an

153
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,199
enormous logistical operation uh those

154
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,199
in pbgb know this only too

155
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,879
well another point I'd like to emphasize

156
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:26,120
is that by the way this book it's a free

157
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:29,080
irie book which you can Google and I

158
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,759
used to basically give it to the

159
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,960
particip of the rice breeding course

160
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,840
that was the first thing I would

161
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,560
encourage them to read it's really the

162
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,360
Bible of rice breeding uh I still

163
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,599
sometimes refer to it from time to time

164
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,280
it's a beautiful textbook um but the

165
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,319
thing I'd like to me point out because

166
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,199
you may not be able to see it at the

167
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:51,120
back is its publication date

168
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,199
1979 and if one was to look at it you

169
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,400
would probably see that little here at

170
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,039
irie and that really represents what

171
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,800
Asia is on about has changed in in quite

172
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,840
a long time so that's the background so

173
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,919
why have we changed now I'll explain why

174
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,919
the reasons the first one you have to

175
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:12,840
pardon my language if I get a bit too

176
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:15,680
you know uh uh rough but I suppose

177
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,720
readers are a bit you know like this I

178
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,759
call it the f word that was our

179
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:23,120
main

180
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,960
uh our main reason almost overnight

181
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,360
because of for cost recovery we had to

182
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,000
change our

183
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:35,760
operations okay this just gives you a

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,919
summary of the amount that was spent

185
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,680
actually in 2010 and 2011 full cost

186
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:45,480
recovery wasn't it wasn't implemented so

187
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:48,200
I I basically got the samples that were

188
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,720
in our records and did uh a back

189
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,920
calculation in our current full cost

190
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,600
recovery rates but you can see here that

191
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,720
just this is just the trade screening

192
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,079
for disease and SE quality alone this

193
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,200
does not include our field costs and all

194
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:07,680
of our other labor resource costs that

195
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:12,040
are required and maybe it'll just shed

196
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:15,680
some light that our main funding source

197
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,279
in The Last 5 Years From 2009 to 2014

198
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,800
has been the Japan R breeding program

199
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:25,000
and you can see that the the cost of

200
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,480
screening alone exceed what we're

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,959
allocated from that

202
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,640
project so reason number one is from the

203
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:33,720
point of view of resources alone I

204
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,720
believe we have to change and you'll

205
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,519
notice also in 2013 there was no

206
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,360
screening done because I had a deficit

207
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,279
to carry over for that year I had no

208
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,360
money to do anything with for screening

209
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:50,120
anyway that's the first reason I think

210
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,079
it's also with acknowledging the funding

211
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,680
support from the Japan government for

212
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:58,320
for the Japan right

213
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,839
project reason number

214
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,079
two there have been tremendous changes

215
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,640
within the division as I mentioned just

216
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:08,360
before

217
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,560
uh in the last decade and and a half I I

218
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,839
think we were something like this uh

219
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,959
there was a very big irrigated program

220
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:18,880
and that included the golden

221
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,920
rice uh component there was a hybrid

222
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,120
rice which is still pretty much the same

223
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,560
now and I think we were kind of baseding

224
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,560
these tra based rainfed Focus breeding

225
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,240
programs and really the stasa program

226
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,760
has sort of has just uh has supported

227
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,399
those pipelines and there was always

228
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,839
some Japonica work that was

229
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,160
done 2012 2013 we we were transformed

230
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,800
into

231
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,959
this I think many of you would be aware

232
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,720
of the level of restructuring that's

233
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,600
been done uh from our head

234
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,560
eroa and what we look like now so I mean

235
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,440
it's similar but it is it is certainly

236
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,800
different we we've got uh a focus on you

237
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,639
know irrigated and rainfed E systems and

238
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,560
we've really been divided a lot more

239
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,560
into regions as you can see from from

240
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,320
this this

241
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,839
diagram uh I will also highlight for

242
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,399
those of you who may be not aware of it

243
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,959
that we've we've also really uh

244
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,720
decentralize a lot of our breeding

245
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:23,839
activities as well so for example The

246
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,600
Hub as we call it for South Asia and

247
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,440
irrigated is located in Hydra but in

248
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:33,519
India and the same is for the rainfed

249
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,800
program which I in kumal in in Hy same

250
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,120
location and there is also another Hub

251
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,200
in Burundi so that's a huge change in

252
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,200
terms of just the the way that the

253
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,399
breeding uh pipelines as they're called

254
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,399
are

255
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,720
organized uh many of you are probably

256
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,839
aware that uh for example you know there

257
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,399
used to be a a drought breeding program

258
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,560
there still is that that is certainly

259
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,160
going on but uh the way we've been

260
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,959
restructured has been focused on

261
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,720
generally separating the tra development

262
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,519
work or the research work or even some

263
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,920
people might call it pre-breeding work

264
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,480
from the actual breeding itself and so

265
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,680
that's that's been done for most of the

266
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,360
traits if not for all of the traits that

267
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,440
e was working on so one representation

268
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,279
might look something like this that

269
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,000
there's still a lot of input they have

270
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,399
into the breeding pipelines but they are

271
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,560
separated and the way I like to sort of

272
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,000
think about it is all of them still flow

273
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,000
into the relevant breeding pipeline the

274
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,040
variety development pipeline so and as

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,839
you can imagine some tra teams actually

276
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:45,480
flow into multiple pipelines um so that

277
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,639
that's how the structure is but again

278
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,920
I'm not going to talk so much about pbgb

279
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,800
itself I'm going to talk a focus on the

280
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,800
irrigated

281
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,720
activities reason number three

282
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:59,639
undoubtedly concerns with just a change

283
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,160
of philosophy

284
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,800
and I simply mean just new ideas about

285
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:09,000
the best approaches using modern methods

286
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,959
using alternative methods and as you saw

287
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,560
from the first uh the introduction slide

288
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,320
I mean my background is from other crops

289
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,440
and I've seen things done completely

290
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,360
differently with with cereals like wheat

291
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,519
and barley which are very similar to

292
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,519
rice but of course they they they're

293
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:28,279
bred in a very different

294
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:31,199
way reason number four is the high

295
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,920
demand on e scientists and I I'll I'll

296
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:35,040
actually mention breeders here I I don't

297
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,839
think we discussed this much but

298
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,839
compared to a typical Nas breeder we

299
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:44,600
have a lot more on our

300
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,399
plate we have seed requests we have and

301
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,199
just this year alone I mean we're only

302
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,279
August right I've had we have our team

303
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,199
has had thousands of individual seed

304
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,320
requests and it's been quite uh

305
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:58,360
demanding to say the least to fulfill

306
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,680
and we're obliged to do so and and we

307
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,399
want to do so what e is about but it has

308
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:06,120
been a challenge we have visitors nearly

309
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,560
every every week every day of every week

310
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,399
we have training courses uh we I've just

311
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,079
come back from a mission in Vietnam and

312
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,519
I'm still uh burning off the excess food

313
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:17,399
that I ate during that time uh we have

314
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,480
all sorts of research activities and I

315
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,519
think it's fair to say that I think

316
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,800
breeders need to be aware of that and my

317
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,519
point is I think there's no harm to

318
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,880
simplify methods whenever

319
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,560
possible and one thing I always like to

320
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,560
give I'm not sure if he's here but I'd

321
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,600
like to acknowledge Alan and the inur

322
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,079
team for really facilitating those

323
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,360
hundreds and thousands of entries that

324
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,079
we send to our Nas programs you know

325
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,079
every

326
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,639
year okay reason number five this is

327
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:51,880
possibly the heart of the

328
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:56,320
redesigning uh activities

329
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:58,600
by this is a figure from I think one of

330
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,720
the landmark papers it's a absolute

331
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,000
beautiful paper from sheling ping and

332
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,120
others here at er and it's quite simple

333
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,079
it just

334
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,759
basically uh describes what we we refer

335
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,519
to as an era experiment so basically you

336
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:17,680
take the varieties from the old the

337
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:20,440
oldest varities that you've got and you

338
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,759
include the you know the current and

339
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,279
older ones and and you you put all all

340
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:28,160
of those and Benchmark them with the the

341
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,319
modern the latest varieties and that's

342
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,630
what that was done so so it was

343
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,920
published in

344
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,639
[Music]

345
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,639
1999 and I think this one here turned

346
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,839
out to it was an elite line at the time

347
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,639
but it turned out to be PSV RC 52 so

348
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,759
that was the that was the data set they

349
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,560
had at the time and the bottom line was

350
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,440
that they estimated that the rate of

351
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:54,399
genetic gain or yield improvement over

352
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,240
time was about 1% per year okay that's

353
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,720
that's the first point and if you look

354
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,120
at the uh if you read the paper more

355
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,959
that translates to about 75 kilog per

356
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,759
year per hectare per year just to give

357
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,720
you a sort of a reference

358
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,440
point based on irie's projections and a

359
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,839
lot of other data it is this is believed

360
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:21,040
to be insufficient to meet future

361
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,199
demands for Rice so this is this is

362
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,160
something a very important take- home

363
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:29,480
message we've actually extended this

364
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,519
this experiment as as you saw there are

365
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,120
only about 12 varieties in that in the

366
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,920
previous one and that was done you know

367
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,000
15 years ago or or even further than

368
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,959
that and so what we did this was one of

369
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,560
the first things in 2013 we started to

370
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,880
basically reassess where we are at this

371
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,839
or in

372
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,959
2013 and so we put all of the varieties

373
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,680
that included in sheling P's paper

374
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:57,519
including ir8 and we put the latest ones

375
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,959
there and we found out that uh I should

376
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,319
point out I should have mentioned

377
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,600
previous slide that that study was done

378
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:06,480
during the dry season when yields are

379
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,640
higher of course but we wanted to test

380
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,600
both season this is still ongoing but

381
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,439
we've found that perhaps we feel that

382
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,400
the estimated rate of genetic gain is

383
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:20,199
actually lower than first projected

384
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,280
predicted by Shing P paper and the rate

385
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,400
of you can see there's a lot of noise in

386
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,640
this in this graph but uh certainly the

387
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,039
rate we we certainly believe C for the

388
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,799
wet season at least it is lower than

389
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:36,160
what was first uh uh reported by

390
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:38,600
P okay

391
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,000
so on the basis of that if you wanted

392
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,720
one more reason reason number six is as

393
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,440
I said the Japan breing program money

394
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,559
was to end this year and we we had to

395
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:54,600
look for an alternative source and the

396
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:56,360
Gates Foundation was interested in uh in

397
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,159
some discussions with irie about our new

398
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,679
ideas to change that last point the rate

399
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:04,200
improving the rate of genetic gain and

400
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,520
so reason number six is really we got

401
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,440
money to

402
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,840
do to do things differently we did not

403
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,240
get money to do things as they were done

404
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,880
previously and I think we we've that

405
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,720
previous slide shows about 50 nearly 50

406
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,799
years of of our best efforts and the the

407
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,120
rate was quite linear it certainly was

408
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:27,360
linear and uh that's as I said we we we

409
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,840
at e feel that we need to do do more

410
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,960
than that so I'll introduce this new

411
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,720
project which we call transforming rice

412
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,559
breeding or

413
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,640
trb it's it's a Gates Foundation project

414
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:43,000
like many others at the moment uh the

415
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,159
total amount is 12 a half million over

416
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,320
the 5 years and it's specifically

417
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:51,000
focusing on

418
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,280
irrigated uh e irrigated

419
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,440
regions uh and it's not specifically our

420
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,799
pipeline but it's it's it really

421
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,799
supports a lot of transformation

422
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,320
activities within the pbgb division

423
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,600
itself and I'll I'll elaborate more

424
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,640
during that but but certainly more will

425
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,280
be said about that uh in the near

426
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,400
future uh and just to complete the

427
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,840
picture the the focus of this uh

428
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,400
research project was was exclusively

429
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,280
South Asia namely India and Bangladesh

430
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,880
which are priorities for the Gates

431
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,880
Foundation okay I'll start by talking

432
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,640
about breeding methods and I'll also

433
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,559
this is also the most controversial so I

434
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,440
think it's a good place to

435
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,200
start again plant breeding 101 this is a

436
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,039
a simplified version of the pedigree

437
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,880
breeding method which has been used for

438
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:47,400
the last 45 50 50 years plus actually in

439
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,679
the irrigated breeding program and

440
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,960
probably the basis of this is that there

441
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,360
is extensive trait

442
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,600
selection during the segregating

443
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,720
populations that of so the new breeding

444
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,799
populations that are developed they

445
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,880
green for many traits and combinations

446
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:06,159
of traits at the same time as well Okay

447
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,320
so we've got the blast and there there's

448
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,679
several there's several variations

449
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,600
possible but this is just one one scheme

450
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,600
uh so that's that's why it was costly

451
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,400
and and even time consuming and resource

452
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,720
demanding because there was so much tra

453
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,080
screening done and individual lines had

454
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,159
to be kept intact in terms of their

455
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:33,000
identity from a single F2 plant

456
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:35,720
what we're trying to do is to use a new

457
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,600
approach it's called rapid generation

458
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,679
advance or

459
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,360
RGA it actually isn't that

460
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,720
new it was first reported in the I think

461
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,760
it was the 1940s can you believe uh and

462
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,840
but it really uh it was adopted by some

463
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,880
programs particularly winter Cals made

464
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,760
in the 60s and 70s so it's not that new

465
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,480
but probably the the bottom line is that

466
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,880
you grow

467
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,360
plants in these Little Seedling trades

468
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,679
at high density with low

469
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,200
fertilizer and in fact I think Ricardo I

470
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:14,799
think I'm going to get a prize for the

471
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,799
first prop of the year I

472
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:30,320
show R tra I hope you can all see

473
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:33,679
that uh so the features are that yeah

474
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,799
you just basically grow plants at a very

475
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,400
high density and you stress them you

476
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,080
actually impose a mild stress you can

477
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,520
see that you know if this was in the

478
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,919
field this would be tillering quite

479
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,760
extensively but in these small trays

480
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,799
where we can find the growth of the

481
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,159
plant it tilling is not possible because

482
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:54,320
the plant is stressed and when the plant

483
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,279
is stressed we we manipulate the

484
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,880
conditions in such a way that it will

485
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:02,039
flour much more early than it would if

486
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,400
it was grown in in optimal uh conditions

487
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:07,480
the other point I'd like to emphasize is

488
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,080
that in contrast the previous method

489
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,799
there is no trait selection during what

490
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,039
we call line fixation or line

491
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:16,279
development

492
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,720
stage okay so that's uh quite a quite a

493
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:20,960
big difference although as I said this

494
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,080
method is not actually that new it's

495
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,039
been used in a lot of other breeding

496
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:30,520
programs but it's probably had a limited

497
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:30,520
use in rice but some use in r

498
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,600
in okay this is just a before typhoon

499
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,960
glender we had a really nice operation

500
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,760
in vg9 and it looked something like this

501
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,960
uh we had a a two- tiered shelving

502
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,120
system so space was our main

503
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,440
limitation and you can

504
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,120
see probably the the thing I just wanted

505
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,919
to highlight by showing you this this

506
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:59,240
short uh video is we've got a lot of

507
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:02,600
plants in this small area that's

508
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,360
probably the the take-home message um

509
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,640
and from that was in March April uh

510
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,520
early this year during one of our first

511
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,919
uh rounds it's Joseph bero who I'll say

512
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,559
more about him in a moment uh we had

513
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,440
about 40,000 lines in what you just saw

514
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:21,760
and that that Greenhouse wasn't even

515
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,840
full the equivalent area in the field

516
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,799
would take several

517
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:30,679
hectares okay so this is this is

518
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:32,440
currently what we're at um uh we're

519
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:34,760
still doing a lot of optimization

520
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,159
because rice is actually not as easy to

521
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,480
manipulate as say wheat or barley uh but

522
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,559
we're we we've made excellent progress

523
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,279
and uh we've got several experiments

524
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:48,640
planned or even some that are ongoing uh

525
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:51,000
and what the idea is is to make this

526
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,520
basically a service a full cost recovery

527
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,320
service so that other breeders other

528
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,240
trait teams can actually use it and our

529
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,640
Target is some some sometime in 2015 it

530
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,720
really uh as I said spaces our

531
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,520
limitation and so new facilities are

532
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,559
being are being planned um so we've

533
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,279
actually taken a few Guinea PE

534
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,039
customers uh and we're seeing how that

535
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,799
goes because the the real challenge is

536
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,360
the wet season and it's let's hope there

537
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,919
were no more typhoons uh this year but

538
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,919
but the wet season brings its it's uh

539
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,240
you know uh a load of of insects

540
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,279
particularly which once they're in

541
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,840
Greenhouse can really um wreck some

542
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:31,039
damage and for those customers for for

543
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,000
further information uh and if you have

544
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,440
any complaints these are the people I'd

545
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,240
like you to contact not me uh Joseph and

546
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:43,679
RX will be leading the RGA team and they

547
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,600
they've made an excellent uh start to to

548
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,559
this this very critical stage of our new

549
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,080
uh cross cutting team um and it's it's

550
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:53,960
probably worth pointing out that

551
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,279
probably only 18 months ago to two years

552
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,880
we had just basically just a concrete

553
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,600
area there was nothing we had no no no

554
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,720
buckets or we we had nothing so we've

555
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,279
come a long way in a short

556
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,200
time some of you might have seen

557
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:14,919
this

558
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:16,760
sign um what that's about is well space

559
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:20,760
really was limited and we just thought

560
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:23,480
well would this work in the

561
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,120
field and we s well you know why don't

562
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,840
we just try it just just stick something

563
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,960
in the field so

564
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,559
we we literally did that and at first we

565
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,440
were thinking well can we just you know

566
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:37,200
basically grow them in the field but the

567
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,960
problem as you can imagine is the

568
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,440
tillering and the resources the

569
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,880
nutrients that the rice plants would

570
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,240
have so by keeping them in this

571
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,840
tray we we still confine the

572
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,559
growth uh and and really we still

573
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,840
maintain that that low level of stress

574
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:55,919
on these rice plants and so this started

575
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,360
in May this is the first season that

576
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,000
we've run it

577
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,080
and if you just walk past it I think you

578
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,559
would have seen it because it's next to

579
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,440
the long-term continuous cropping

580
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,080
experiment it really looks like a sort

581
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,880
of a Seedling Nursery that's been left

582
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,279
to run for too long okay so you can't

583
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,080
you can barely notice but the trays are

584
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:17,640
there all this this material has been

585
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:21,520
planted direct seated into trays and

586
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:23,200
just literally stuck in the soil and

587
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,520
just yesterday this photo was taken just

588
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,360
yesterday afternoon they've just started

589
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,279
to harvest that material and because

590
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,880
it's direct seated and there's that

591
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:35,760
moderate stress needed for

592
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,600
RGA uh I counted the calendar days

593
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,320
between seeding to the start of harvest

594
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,399
it was 91 days

595
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,279
yesterday um and and I think we can

596
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:46,720
tweak this system a lot more how far we

597
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:48,600
go with it I I don't know but certainly

598
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,039
in the meantime when we don't have

599
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,480
enough space in the green houses

600
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:54,440
especially after the typhoon um I think

601
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,600
we'll we'll run with this um we

602
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,880
certainly need to tweak the fertilizer

603
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,039
and maybe some other you know man but

604
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:06,640
but it's promising and uh again in half

605
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:08,919
of the area which is it's about the

606
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,799
total area is something like 400 uh

607
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:12,480
Square

608
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:15,600
met uh we had over

609
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,880
260 that's a predicted amount 260,000

610
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,159
lines in about 200 square meters so it's

611
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,360
quite a a really densely packed area and

612
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,840
I should have also mentioned that since

613
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,200
we are neighbors to the long-term

614
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,919
continuous cing experiment we're also

615
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,880
are following their their season so they

616
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,640
have the dry season the early wet season

617
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,720
and the late wet season and just Frankly

618
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,120
Speaking I think irie really should be

619
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,159
exploiting its capacity for multiple

620
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,760
Generations in the field a lot more

621
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:45,880
that's just that's just my sort of two

622
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,360
cents

623
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,640
worth okay now I'll talk to you about

624
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,919
field

625
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:56,559
tries again this is a bit more uh

626
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:58,320
introduction that uh a traditional

627
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,039
textbook pedigree breeding method

628
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,760
something like this you have the

629
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,200
pedigree line stage of pedigree

630
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,080
nurseries where you may have 10,000

631
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,399
lines uh tens of thousands of lines and

632
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,799
then you have usually what's called an

633
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:14,799
observational yield trial and then a

634
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:16,399
replicated yield trial followed by that

635
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:20,399
uh the

636
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:23,159
oyt is is the stage where we first

637
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:26,240
evaluate lines usually after the lines

638
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:31,039
of what we call a fixed and then after

639
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,039
that we go to a multilocation testing

640
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,159
scheme can uh just following on what I

641
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,519
spoke to about earlier it's implying

642
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:40,080
that there were a lot of other

643
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,840
alternative schemes I just thought I'd

644
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,519
show you this one this is a a textbook

645
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,159
early wheat breeding scheme it's

646
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,559
probably a bit hard to read at the back

647
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:53,279
but the take-home messages

648
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:55,880
are the multilocation trials a lot

649
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,039
earlier than what we would typically do

650
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,080
in

651
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:03,200
rice probably the take-home message and

652
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,279
um I learned a lot of tricks from a lot

653
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,519
of breeders back in Australia and this

654
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:11,080
this guy in particular uh and he had a

655
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:13,600
completely different philosophy altoe he

656
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,080
he would push it up even earlier F3 or

657
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,240
F4 actually but sadly he just passed

658
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,120
away last month but but he was quite an

659
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,240
innovator in Australian week breeding uh

660
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,360
cycles and and again just to let you

661
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:30,039
know this is not new information this

662
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,039
was published a long time ago de

663
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,600
ago I thought I'd show you this so you

664
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,159
can see sort of what what's happened to

665
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,240
me de since when I was back in Australia

666
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:41,240
I've got a lot more gray hair now and I

667
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,880
think I've aged terribly on the inside

668
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:47,720
but I I just wanted to obviously this is

669
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:51,519
not rice uh again in line with the

670
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,519
previous philosophy
