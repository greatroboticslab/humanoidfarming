they have to offer you to improve your

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,960
own operation

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,879
well thank you for joining me today i'm

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,640
excited to have you on the show i know

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,399
this is our first time talking but i

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,199
have visited with your brother a little

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,200
bit

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,439
so to start off would you really share

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,840
what your background in the ranching

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,840
space is and how you got started

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,400
uh thank you for having me shay um

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,200
basically

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,080
i'm a fifth generation cattle rancher

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
in the northern part of chihuahua mexico

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,680
uh

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,560
our family moved here in the

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,400
in the

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,880
late 1800s early 1900s um and we've been

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,000
ranching in this area ever since

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,799
going on

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,600
almost 100 years now

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,759
but

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,320
my personal background while i was born

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,119
born at the ranch raised at the ranch um

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,159
basically this is this is all i know

48
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,479
uh

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,040
when i first started actually managing

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,600
the ranch i was fresh out of high school

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,960
i mean it hasn't been that long

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,520
i didn't go to college i didn't i didn't

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,479
i didn't really want to go to college so

54
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,479
um

55
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,600
well the ranch was the second best thing

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,360
to do

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,120
um so

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,560
so i started managing the ranch in 2016.

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,000
um i'm only 24 years old and well

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,360
since then i've i've we've started

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,760
with more

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,520
intensive grazing practices more

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,080
regenerative

64
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,599
grazing practices here at the ranch

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,560
and we've been able to

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,280
to

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,519
maximize our profits

68
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,239
by doing so

69
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:40,319
how has the conditions of your pastures

70
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,319
changed with these holistic approaches

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,200
uh

72
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,400
well we've

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,400
been able to to

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,239
increase our carrying capacity by three

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,560
times uh three times as much so

76
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,280
i mean that gives you an idea the the

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,440
quality of forage we have now uh we we

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,760
don't give any any protein

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,879
i mean it's strictly grass

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,239
grass

81
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:10,159
fed uh beef i mean there's we don't give

82
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,560
any other type of forage just the grass

83
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,400
that we grow um during the winter we

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:20,080
graze all we graze all year round um

85
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,480
and and our area is a semi-arid uh area

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,159
we get from anywhere from 15 to 18

87
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,680
inches of rain a year

88
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,319
but we do have uh

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,560
some some drought years like in 2020 we

90
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,000
got four inches of rain and we could

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,319
still uh double our carrying capacity

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,879
with without having

93
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,680
that much rain um

94
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,680
so

95
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,519
as far as our pastures i mean you can

96
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,760
see the difference

97
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,560
in a heartbeat um

98
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,959
and

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,360
well the the numbers are there to show

100
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,480
to show that this type of management

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,519
actually works and i mean it's

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,480
for a ranch in this area to to

103
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,840
to

104
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,120
run as much cattle as as we do it's

105
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,400
i mean it's

106
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,480
it's one

107
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,599
one in a hundred so

108
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,280
um

109
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,640
i mean

110
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,239
that's

111
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,959
our

112
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,840
we've seen the benefits

113
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,519
so what is your like stocking right now

114
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,199
or what does your carrying capacity look

115
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,720
like now that you you said you've

116
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,800
increased the amount of cattle you can

117
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,000
run by three times

118
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,000
so what does that look like for you

119
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,639
in this area

120
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,560
people usually run from 12 hectares 12

121
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:41,440
to 15 hectares per cow per year

122
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,360
we use the metric system in mexico acres

123
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,320
would be about

124
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,960
roughly 20 acres per cow per year

125
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,360
and we're running three hectares per cow

126
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,960
per year which is roughly about seven

127
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,639
acres per cow per year wow

128
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,440
so what what are your forage types there

129
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,000
what are some of those um native forages

130
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,000
uh we

131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,600
we mostly we have perennial

132
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,720
uh grasses uh blue grama black drama red

133
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
grama

134
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,320
uh

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,960
there's we we've counted up to 20

136
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,840
different types of species here at the

137
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,320
at the ranch i mean they're all mostly

138
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,240
all perennials we have very very very

139
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,639
little annuals um

140
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,360
the high quality forages that keep their

141
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,560
protein year round and and with the

142
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,600
right rest period it it really helps

143
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,120
the cattle eat a better diet

144
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,960
when when

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,240
when you have

146
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,960
i mean

147
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,160
stockpiled forages it helps their

148
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,919
nutrition like you can't imagine

149
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,840
so there are

150
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,680
multiple different ways to implement

151
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,520
regenerative practices when you look at

152
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,039
grazing what models are you looking at

153
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,880
i'm sure you've kind of adapted it to

154
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,240
your own ranch and what works as many

155
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,800
people do but

156
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,639
really when you say you are implementing

157
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,319
regenerative practices what does that

158
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,319
look like for you on a daily basis

159
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,919
um

160
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,319
here at the ranch we have over 500 packs

161
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,560
give or take the five

162
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,360
all those 500 products we

163
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,680
we make them uh year round with poly

164
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,560
wire everything we use is portable

165
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,600
so

166
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,600
it has our our

167
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,680
our infrastructure is so portable we can

168
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,919
pick up and move wherever we

169
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,840
and at a very low cost

170
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,560
so

171
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,199
we build over 500 paddocks a year we

172
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,639
move daily sometimes we even four or

173
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,520
five times a day

174
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,960
so it's highly intensive so we can get

175
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,400
the best out of the

176
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,400
out of our forage uh use it properly and

177
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,240
and rest it properly also inside of

178
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,599
those 500 paddocks

179
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,000
we have a

180
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,280
rotation of about 425 days of rest per

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,919
paddock

182
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,120
so i mean our

183
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,039
per paddock we have a

184
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,720
a time period

185
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,039
we use it

186
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,599
maybe six hours per for every 420 days

187
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,120
so our our rest period is

188
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,919
is is

189
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,240
is what's making this work

190
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,319
wow so

191
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,720
you talked about how you're constantly

192
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,560
on the move moving cattle how many

193
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,720
employees how many people do you have

194
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,440
working on your operation to manage this

195
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,440
workload then

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,800
um it's only me and

197
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,680
i have one hired hand

198
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,639
but

199
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,319
other than that we're running i mean in

200
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,400
between me and my hired help we're

201
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,160
running over 500 cows

202
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,720
and and we have

203
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,639
about 200 stalkers here at the ranch you

204
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,720
know so there's a there's there's quite

205
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,639
a bit of work but i mean

206
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,240
when you're organized and since you move

207
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,400
them every single day it cuts down on

208
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,080
your on on

209
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,919
basically

210
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,319
uh

211
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,479
checking the cattle health-wise since

212
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,639
you see them every day i mean it

213
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,400
it simplifies everything most people

214
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,960
think because of moving once a day it's

215
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,000
going to be a lot more difficult but

216
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
honestly

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,319
it's a lot simpler than moving

218
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,160
moving every 15 days or every 20 days

219
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,400
and and your paddocks are a lot smaller

220
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,279
so it's easy to get around your paddocks

221
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,839
with poly wire

222
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,080
in a day and just just keep it portable

223
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,760
keep it simple and well i don't have

224
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,120
that much help

225
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,440
we have

226
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,560
we have a well organized

227
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
uh

228
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,279
ranch

229
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,279
well-fueled ranch

230
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,279
i guess

231
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,240
so what are some

232
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,959
processes you've implemented to make

233
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,640
putting up that poly wire faster easier

234
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,120
just make the whole process more

235
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,120
efficient

236
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,160
um

237
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,080
what we usually do is is make

238
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,920
instead of having like your typical

239
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,160
wagon wheel or

240
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,160
or having uh

241
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,880
something permanent

242
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,839
uh basically we go with the what our

243
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,880
land gives us so all our our all our

244
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,600
fences

245
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,880
go off of the terrain

246
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,120
most of our our ranch is flat so

247
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,959
basically we just build a

248
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,279
small squares and then we have water in

249
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,320
every single paddock so

250
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,720
the water

251
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,320
it's all piped we have a

252
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,560
pipeline a two inch pipeline that goes

253
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,600
throughout the ranch and from there when

254
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,560
we're grazing the animals we can connect

255
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,920
uh our portable water trough to to

256
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,480
wherever we need

257
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,080
wherever we need the pipe

258
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,600
so the water for cattle

259
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,560
so with that

260
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,040
you know

261
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,800
do you do any like

262
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,640
you know lease out any recreation

263
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,680
activities on the ranch or do anything

264
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,839
on that front um in addition to this or

265
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,360
do you just i mean is it just are you a

266
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,160
commercial operation what does that look

267
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,160
like for you guys

268
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,680
uh

269
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,040
basically it's it's a commercial

270
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,240
operation what we do what basically it's

271
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,519
cow calf

272
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,360
and

273
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,200
once we wean our calves we export them

274
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,240
to the us

275
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,720
so we export live cattle to the us

276
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,480
other recreational

277
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,000
activities we do there's a little bit of

278
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,959
hunting

279
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,920
i mean whitetail hunting uh

280
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,440
uh

281
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,399
turkeys

282
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,640
um but other than that it's it's purely

283
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,120
just cattle path so we might run a

284
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,440
little stalkers here and there but um

285
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,560
basically just

286
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,600
okay so have these grazing practices

287
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,240
benefited have you seen a large benefit

288
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,839
in the amount of wildlife present the

289
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,839
availability of hunting on your ranch

290
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,600
yeah for sure i mean what what's

291
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,399
happening we're basically building a

292
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,680
micro climate here at the ranch that is

293
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,360
helping

294
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,760
is helping us

295
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,519
with all types of wildlife biodiversity

296
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,880
where we also work with a lot of

297
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,959
conservation services uh basically any

298
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,720
migratory birds that come to our ranch

299
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,399
it's it's a conservation so we we can uh

300
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,839
take care of of

301
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,040
those animals that that need need that

302
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,160
habitat

303
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,920
and uh

304
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,279
we've been working with uh the rocky

305
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,160
mountain bird

306
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,360
con

307
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,240
conservancy for the past four years i

308
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,480
think

309
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,880
and uh basically what they do is take

310
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,120
care of if all the migratory

311
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,320
bird species that come from from the

312
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,360
rockies down to the down to mexico

313
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,399
and uh that that's a big part of our

314
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,000
our our goal here at the ranch to to at

315
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,959
least leave what what we have better

316
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,639
than we than when we got in

317
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,320
i think that's an awesome point to leave

318
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,399
things better than when you found them

319
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,600
and something a lot of ranchers try to

320
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,320
do

321
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,839
so with that kind of looking back at

322
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,480
you know the types of practices you're

323
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,720
using you know what resources do you go

324
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,480
to to continue your learning you know

325
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,399
what did that process look like as you

326
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,800
got started who did you turn to for

327
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,800
advice

328
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,279
uh

329
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,279
first i i turned to my dad obviously he

330
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,399
he was

331
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,800
when the holistic management movement

332
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,040
came to mexico he was one of the first

333
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,079
pioneers so

334
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,279
i turned to my dad a lot and and

335
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,320
also the savory institute helps a lot

336
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,720
and

337
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,959
ranching for profit i'm a

338
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,240
love of x alumni from wrenching for

339
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,480
profit which it help helps a lot when

340
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,399
you're trying to run a business that

341
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,440
well it's it's

342
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,600
it's

343
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,680
you're running a business off of what

344
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,920
nature gives you um

345
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,480
and and you're trying to manage you're

346
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,920
trying to manage resources that

347
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,120
that

348
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,320
that can be

349
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,880
be

350
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,880
bettered uh improved

351
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,839
um

352
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,440
knowing how to do it is is key and i

353
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,360
mean here

354
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,839
fortunately here in mexico in chihuahua

355
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,160
where there's quite a

356
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,040
quite a few people that are practicing

357
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,480
uh regenerative agriculture gender

358
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,160
ranching whatever you want to call it

359
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,639
there's a lot of people here in

360
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,720
chihuahua in my state that um

361
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,079
that are actually doing it and basically

362
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,480
what we

363
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,959
we we all have a group chat we just

364
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,240
bounce ideas off of each other but

365
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,079
um

366
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,440
any any type of thing you want to learn

367
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,880
i highly recommend to to take courses

368
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,240
and and

369
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,720
and learn about it

370
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,360
well that's exciting so

371
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,959
what mindset do ranchers need to have

372
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,959
when they are

373
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,240
starting to get into regenerative

374
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:17,480
grazing and really embrace that style of

375
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,480
ranch management

376
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,000
i think they need to change the paradigm

377
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,720
first i mean

378
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,440
there's a lot of uh misconceptions of

379
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,040
branching especially here in chihuahua a

380
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,720
lot of people think it's too dry it

381
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,800
can't be done here

382
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,519
but they're just all paradigms you need

383
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,360
you need to change and and once once you

384
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,320
start actually

385
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,480
uh moving daily and get the hang of it

386
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,800
there's no better way to actually do it

387
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,680
than doing it and and

388
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,519
i mean your failures are going to be

389
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,639
they're going to be

390
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,639
um

391
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,320
what's it called

392
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,079
they're going to be

393
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,079
it's going to be like your school i mean

394
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,959
it's going to teach you how what not to

395
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,079
do

396
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,959
um

397
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,959
but

398
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,600
uh just changing your paradigms the way

399
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,639
you think is it helps has

400
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,680
has a lot to do with uh

401
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,000
running a ranch this way

402
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,440
well awesome do you have any

403
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,199
last advice for those who are interested

404
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,120
in improving their grazing methods or

405
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:25,160
any last comments you'd like to share

406
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,160
before we finish up today

407
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,519
yeah i mean a lot of people get stuck on

408
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,880
on yeah i want to do the change and but

409
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,399
they don't know how to

410
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,360
start the change

411
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,040
um

412
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,800
i would recommend

413
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,560
getting

414
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,399
getting a consultant having someone

415
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,120
consult you for so so you don't make the

416
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,639
same mistakes like i did or

417
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,519
anyone else did

418
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,560
and

419
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,320
uh

420
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,240
yeah some people might say the

421
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,240
consultants are

422
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,040
are expensive or they charge too much

423
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,279
but

424
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,079
he'll give you a helping hand once you

425
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,240
start

426
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,560
and then once you're once you have a

427
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,160
consultant then then i i highly

428
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,320
recommend uh

429
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,560
keeping everything portable

430
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,160
i mean there's no sense in in dumping a

431
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,240
bunch of money when

432
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,199
when you can actually do it with

433
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,920
portable poly wire portable posts

434
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,680
so so you're gonna basically be changing

435
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,959
one thing for another you're gonna be

436
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,040
changing sweat for

437
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,000
an improvement or or changing money for

438
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,199
for

439
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,199
infrastructure so i i highly recommend

440
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,120
just

441
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,480
making everything portable

442
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,880
the more portable you have it the more

443
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,040
flexibility you have to graze wherever

444
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,279
you can or or

445
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,560
in points of opportunity throughout your

446
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,040
ranch

447
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,839
um but other than that i mean

448
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,000
just

449
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,440
it's time to change the way we think and

450
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,360
it's time to change the way we ranch

451
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,440
