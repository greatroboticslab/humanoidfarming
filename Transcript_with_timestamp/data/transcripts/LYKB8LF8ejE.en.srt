you my favorite garden tool and how to

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,880
use it the one side has a serrated edge

22
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,320
the other side is a straight flat Edge

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,920
has measurements on the side so you see

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,840
how deep youin shovel down and I'm going

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,320
to show you how to use it first put our

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,479
gardian

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,799
gloves can't do that and so with the H

28
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,680
hor knife it's really nice to dig and

29
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,799
plant bulbs you can see that there are

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,040
inches so you have 1 2 3 4 5 5 six and

31
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,960
if you need to get a specific depth like

32
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,720
I need to dig 4 in you can easily go

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,040
ahead and do that dig up where you need

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,680
to

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,079
be and then you know your depth is 4 in

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,040
if you have rock out soil you can use a

37
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,759
straight edge and cut it up you can also

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,000

window bird feeder and filled it with

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,880
seeds and meal worms it took a while for

107
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,160
any bird to come but I stayed hopeful

108
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,360
