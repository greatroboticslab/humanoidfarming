1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,980
it's fine

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:06,980
[Music]

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:21,869
so this place as you can see is a pretty

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,380
big castle but we're only a small part

5
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,240
of it so we're just starting our

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,730
permaculture project here at discussion

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,430
of Fuji let that permaculture is a way

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,890
that that tries to work nice with nature

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,440
instead of working against it so it's a

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,129
lot of observing nature and then trying

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,219
to interfere only in the slightest ways

12
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:50,850
we're digging trenches for our pony

13
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:52,469
tunnel so what we're gonna do the next

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,179
days is to put the plastic foil on top

15
00:00:52,469 --> 00:01:02,070
of this metal frame and then the cornice

16
00:00:56,179 --> 00:01:07,590
will be dug in and for this we need

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:18,530
trenches this multifunctional tool also

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:21,540
doubles as a backscratcher so good I

19
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,180
coordinated the gardens in a colony for

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,640
three and a half years yeah we met each

21
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,170
other in a colony five years ago and

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,800
that's where I first got into touch with

23
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,290
gardening and my passion or a medicinal

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,420
plants the last year's we were basically

25
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,010
just like you guys traveling in our bus

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:45,690
I went to visit this place with Sina and

27
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:48,330
after some long discussions here we

28
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:52,020
decided to to come here to set up the

29
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:54,390
garden side - Rafa all day - batches and

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,030

[Music]

39
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:30,230
beautiful plants grow it's about two

40
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:33,180
months ago that Hilden Oscar left us and

41
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:36,540
we just wanted to show you how our

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,959
garden looks after two months and the

43
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,150
tunnel that we built together with them

44
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:47,190
it comes - yes thank Estill I stopped

45
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:50,220
the drag vector still is any glaze no it

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:54,120
kill Dracula the cost was cold we should

47
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:57,230
have who means crazy and it's already in

48
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:05,280
the name we should add somehow so it's

49
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:08,519
it's a crazy castle first it was not

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,129
really a castle it was like a hunting

51
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,639
house and then the previous owner added

52
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:16,709
some castle-like features yeah exactly

53
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,199
the castle is just a meeting point like

54
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:22,500
that's how I feel it nowadays it's just

55
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,720
a meeting point for a lot of people for

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:33,419
the first time in my life I'm preparing

57
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:37,049
a bed for sewing sacrum I listen as I my

58
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:39,500
future it's out up in the baqia and his

59
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,209
eyes life on the site comes and the

60
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,519
pockets are chopped coated in a hockey

61
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,280
here and a fourth of here in the fill

62
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,989
and I work at the site we eventually

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,730
also want to teach courses and host

64
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:56,220
people have a little cafe and experiment

65
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,019
with new methods of gardening well we're

66
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,290
going to plant nitrogen-fixing plants

67
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:04,560
like trees and shrubs lower bushes and

68
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,409
the idea is that those enrich the soil I

69
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,599
love working with the ground working

70
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:12,660
with the soil working with my hands also

71
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,210
it just really grounds me

72
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,060
yeah makes me feel more connected the

73
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:19,970
idea is that there is in the future will

74
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,640
be a more permanent group here and

75
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:25,500
that's really what I what I like just to

76
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,630
live with a group of people that you can

77
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,870
inspire each other and everybody has his

78
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,240
own qualities that's just wonderful you

79
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:42,200
