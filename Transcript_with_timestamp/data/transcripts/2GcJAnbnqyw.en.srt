7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,399
mangoes are picked

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,280
in one of three ways the first is with a

9
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,960
harvest aid

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,119
this is where a team of people pick

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,640
mangoes and place or gently throw them

12
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,960
onto a tarp pollen

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,479
either with the stems on or off there

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,400
are different types of these machines

15
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,040
and you may either pick from the ground

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,799
or from a platform fruit are either snap

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,680
picked or picked with secateurs or

18
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,520
picking sticks

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,200
when snap picking the fruit is grasped

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,400
at the bottom and then the bottom of the

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,159
fruit is lifted up

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,759
snapping the stem of the fruit before it

23
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,520
is put onto the harvest aid

24
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,200
sat may spurt from the mango when it is

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,600
picked this way and it is important that

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,759
the sap doesn't contact the mango skin

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,280
your skin or the skin of other pickers

28
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,360
to neutralize the sap

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,799
a chemical commonly called mango wash is

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,560
sprayed onto the tarpaulin

31
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,560
and over the conveyor that collects the

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,159
fruit if the stems are removed

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,880
it is important that the fruit is placed

34
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,360
onto the tarpaulin within five seconds

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,880
otherwise the sap will burn the skin if

36
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,960
the stem is still on the fruit

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,360
the fruit must be distemmed either under

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,200
a spray or in a bath of mango wash

39
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,119
the fruit must be left under the spray

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,840
or in the bath for one minute

41
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,960
to protect the fruit from sap if you get

42
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,640
sap on your hands

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,079
it is important that you wash this sap

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,439
from your hands before you touch any

45
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,119
other mango fruit

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,440
as even a smaller amount of sap can

47
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,200
damage the fruit a picking stick is used

48
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
to pick mangoes you can't reach from the

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,599
ground

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,000
it has a set of cutting blades to cut

51
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,080
the stem and a set of jaws to hold the

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,599
stem when it is cut

53
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,840
the jaws of the picking stick must be

54
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,599
facing down so the fruit isn't dropped

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,239
after it is picked

56
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,040
once on the harvest aid the fruit flows

57
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,599
from the spray

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,400
or bath along a conveyor and drops into

59
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,400
a bulk bin

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
for transport to the packing shed it is

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,959
good practice for the fruit to fall onto

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,200
a foam pad

63
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,800
when it falls into the bulk bin and this

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,620
pad must be repositioned

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,480
as the fruit fills the bin

66
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,239
[Music]

67
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,000
the second way mangoes are picked is

68
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,239
with a hydraulic ladder called a cherry

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,120
picker a cherry picket is operated by a

70
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,280
single person

71
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,319
and moves up and down and inside and

72
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,920
around the tree

73
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,519
the fruit is snapped from the tree and

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,360
placed into a picking bag

75
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,720
mango wash is sprayed over the fruit to

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,879
neutralize the sap

77
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,840
when the picking bag is full it is

78
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,920
lowered to the ground

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,840
and emptied gently into a bulk bin for

80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,360
transport to the packing shed

81
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,840
it is important that all fruit in the

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,840
bag is covered by mango wash

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,840
so do not over fill the bag before

84
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
emptying

85
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,680
third way to pick mangoes is to pick

86
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,959
with the stems intact

87
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,120
and the fruit is de-sapped in the

88
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,760
packing shed using secateurs or picking

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,519
sticks

90
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,120
fruit is picked with a 10 to 20

91
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,959
centimetre stem attached

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,799
and placed into crates and transported

93
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,480
to the packing shed care must be taken

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,720
when placing the fruit in the crate

95
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,599
and during handling and transport so the

96
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,920
mango stems

97
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,840
aren't broken and mango sap does not

98
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,159
come into contact with the skin

99
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,920
these crates are stacked for transport

100
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,799
or short-term storage in the packing

101
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,080
shed

102
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,400
so it is important that they are not

103
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,959
overfilled and fruit damaged or stems

104
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,760
broken

105
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,760
when they are stacked if the mangoes

106
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,439
have been picked with the stems on

107
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,439
these stems need to be removed and the

108
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,439
mangoes decept before packing

109
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,519
this can be done either through snapping

110
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,360
the stems or using machine

111
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,040
which cuts the stem from the fruit

112
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,720
during this process it is important that

113
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,239
the mango fruit are completely covered

114
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,720
in a detergent solution

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,479
before the stem is removed so the sap

116
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,120
does not come into contact with the skin

117
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,120
and damage it

118
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,280
as well as damage from sap burn mango

119
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,280
quality can be lost through physical

120
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,720
injury from incorrect picking technique

121
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,360
and rough handling

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,120
damage from sap burn or physical injury

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,560
takes one to two days to appear

124
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,800
and isn't usually seen until fruit

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,400
reaches market take four to six weeks

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,080
for them to come back and repurchase

127
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,919
that product

128
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,479
it's therefore important that both the

129
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,600
visual and eating qualities of a mango

130
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,199
match consumer expectations

131
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,639
so why is this important for mango

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,479
pickers

133
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,960
even the simple task of picking a mango

134
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,639
fruit can have a significant impact

135
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,199
on the visual and eating qualities of a

136
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,400
fruit and therefore the profitability of

137
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,000
the grower

138
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,680
the aim of this video is to teach you

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,080
how to pick mango fruit correctly

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,840
and learn the skills required you'll

141
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,479
learn how to select fruit that is mature

142
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,840
and ready to harvest you'll learn how to

143
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,240
use the different equipment you'll be

144
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,000
using during the picking process

145
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,160
you'll understand how poor pecking

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,039
processes can significantly damage mango

147
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,880
fruit

148
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,840
and you'll understand how to pick

149
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,840
without injuring yourself or other

150
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
pickers

151
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,000
there are names for the different parts

152
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,919
of the mango the stem

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
end is the top of the mango that's where

154
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,080
it's attached to the tree

155
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,080
the cheek is the side of the mango

156
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,479
that's the part you eat

157
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,880
the blush is the red pink or orange

158
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,880
color on the cheek

159
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,080
the nose is the bottom part of the mango

160
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,800
you may hear terms like

161
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,520
soft nose used when fruit has a defect

162
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,140
and the beak

163
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,400
is the pointed part near the nose

164
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,000
[Music]

165
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,160
mangoes are picked in a hard green

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,840
mature state so they'll ripen

167
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,680
to an acceptable eating quality and

168
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,400
external appearance

169
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,440
at this stage the fruit is hard and the

170
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,520
skin is green

171
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,000
apart from the blush the shape of a

172
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,440
mango fruit changes as the fruit matures

173
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,440
the mature fruit on the left is more

174
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,960
rounded and oval-shaped as opposed to

175
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,160
the egg-shaped immature fruit on the

176
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,400
right

177
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,400
as the fruit matures the nose end of the

178
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,919
fruit fills out and is smoother and the

179
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,680
beak is less obvious

180
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,919
from left to right on this slide the

181
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,680
fruit goes from immature to mature

182
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,520
the beak of the fruit is much more

183
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,840
prominent in the immature fruit

184
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,280
on the left than the mature fruit on the

185
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,520
right when these fruit are ripened

186
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,280
the immature fruit stays green while the

187
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,160
more mature fruit will change color to

188
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,840
yellow

189
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,000
the shoulder of the fruit also fills out

190
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,360
around the stem and the stem sits in a

191
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,560
small depression

192
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,400
when the fruit matures it is important

193
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,080
to only pick mature fruit as fruit

194
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,440
maturity can have a significant impact

195
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,440
on eating quality of mangoes

196
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,479
you need to be particularly careful with

197
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,759
the first sap that comes from the

198
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,000
mangoes when you pick it

199
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,360
this is called spurt sap if spurt sap

200
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,240
comes in contact with the skin of the

201
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,800
mango it can

202
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,160
damage the skin this is called sap burn

203
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,880
this set can also burn

204
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,639
your skin or skin of other pickers sap

205
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,680
can continue to ooze from the fruit for

206
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,520
several hours

207
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,680
and although this sap isn't as damaging

208
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,360
as spurt sap it can still cause skin

209
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,440
browning and reduce the sale price of

210
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,360
mangoes

211
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,360
the types of physical injury include

212
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,400
abrasion cuts and scratches

213
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,680
stem punctures crease marks wounds and

214
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,680
internal bruising

215
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,759
abrasion shows as brown marks on the

216
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,400
skin often with scratches through the

217
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,919
mark

218
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,080
it is caused by the skin of the fruit

219
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,639
rubbing against dirty dusty equipment or

220
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,960
crates

221
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,160
and bulk bins or sticks and leaves in

222
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,160
the crates and bins

223
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,360
cuts and scratches occur when the sharp

224
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,919
edge of a picking stick

225
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,840
or secateurs not the fruit or when the

226
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,360
fruit scrapes against a twig or a branch

227
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,759
as is pulled from the tree

228
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,120
stem punctures occur when the stem is

229
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,720
not completely removed

230
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,039
and the short stem punctures another

231
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
fruit as it is placed onto the harvest

232
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,319
aid

233
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,680
as it rolls into the bulk bin or through

234
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,840
pressure from other fruit

235
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,599
in the bulk bin crease marks occur when

236
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,800
the fruit impacts heavily against the

237
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,440
edge of equipment

238
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,039
crates or bins when the blunt parts of a

239
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,120
picking stick knock the fruit

240
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,960
wounds occur when the fruit contacts a

241
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,840
sharp edge and the skin of the fruit is

242
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,759
pierced

243
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,520
monitoring of picking crews has shown

244
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,360
the effect poor picking practices and

245
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,080
rough handling has on physical damage on

246
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,080
fruit

247
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,520
at one orchard fruit was assessed for

248
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,400
physical damage on arrival at the

249
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,759
packing shed

250
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,919
damage to the fruit from different

251
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,200
picking teams ranged from 2

252
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,360
to 17 so for the worst team

253
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,760
17 of the fruit had already been

254
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,599
downgraded when it reached the shed

255
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,049
resulting in significant losses to the

256
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,330
grower

257
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:47,600
[Music]

258
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:49,040
[Applause]

259
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,959
mangoes are picked during the hottest

260
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,040
part of the year

261
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,640
the work is hard and constant and

262
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,560
temperatures in the orchard

263
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,720
often reach above 35 degrees celsius

264
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,240
there is little shade in the orchard so

265
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,880
it is very important that you follow a

266
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,399
few precautions when you are picking

267
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,320
wear the right clothes to protect you

268
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,480
from the sun lightweight long-sleeve

269
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,959
shirts and long trousers are recommended

270
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,120
wear a rod brimmed hat and good shoes

271
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,560
eye protection in the form of sunglasses

272
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,480
is also recommended

273
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,399
apply sunscreen before you start picking

274
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,440
each day and at least every two hours

275
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,760
during the day

276
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,160
drink water regularly during the day and

277
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,600
at least four liters each day

278
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,680
when you are snapping the fruit from the

279
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,279
tree make sure the sap doesn't spurt

280
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,640
onto you or other pickers

281
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,959
some people are highly sensitive to

282
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,560
mango sap and can develop a severe rash

283
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,399
from contact with the sap

284
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,760
if you're spurted with mango sap it is

285
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,440
important that you wash the area with

286
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,240
soap and water and then rinse it well

287
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,240
with fresh water

288
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,240
as a picker it is important that you

289
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,920
understand how manga quality can be lost

290
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,000
and why it is important you follow the

291
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,720
simple steps outlined in this video

292
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,560
to reduce quality loss some do's and

293
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,360
don'ts when picking mangoes

294
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,040
the do's do understand fruit maturity

295
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,519
and only pick mature fruit

296
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,200
be gentle with a fruit make sure mangoes

297
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,640
are in the mango wash within five

298
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,640
seconds of being picked

299
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,640
wash the mango sap from your hands or

300
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,760
skin wear the right clothes and drink

301
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,800
lots of water when you're picking

302
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,279
mangoes

303
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,120
and be careful around heavy equipment

304
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,279
the don'ts

305
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,800
don't make immature fruit don't hit

306
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,480
fruit with picking equipment

307
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,480
don't handle fruit roughly or throw it

308
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,120
against the hard edges of harvest aids

309
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,959
bins or crates don't let mango sap come

310
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,480
into contact with mango's skin

311
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,640
and don't let mango sap come into

312
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,480
contact with your skin your eyes or the

313
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,720
skin of other pickers

314
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,959
as you can see picking mangoes is more

315
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,640
difficult than it seems

316
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,480
and now you can understand why you have

317
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,279
been instructed to pick the fruit

318
00:10:44,480 --> 00:11:01,839
the way you have everybody has a role in

319
00:10:47,279 --> 00:11:01,839
optimising mango fruit quality

320
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,519
you
