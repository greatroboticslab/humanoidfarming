[Music]

2
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:46,689
[Music]

3
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,520
so

4
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,520
[Music]

5
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,509
[Music]

6
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,479
okay having

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,960
looked at the various relationships

8
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,640
which can be used for the

9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,640
design of our irrigation system

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,560
we look at another aspect

11
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,360
of the

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,360
system design

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,960
let's put a question to ourselves that

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,479
was the guarantee

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,680
that the parameters which you have

16
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,479
obtained from those relationships

17
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,720
are those the valid parameters when you

18
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,040
will be applying those parameters in the

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,040
field

20
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,240
so

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,040
quite often is required that we should

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,680
check those parameters

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,079
and try to uh

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,880
define some procedure by which you can

25
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,439
check those parameters

26
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,280
we had seen that in the case of border

27
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,640
irrigation design also that we had gone

28
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,759
in further

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,479
the field trials or field evaluation

30
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
similarly in this case also

31
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,160
we can adopt

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,440
a similar procedure

33
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,040
to

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,480
check those parameters which we have

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
obtained

36
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,959
whether those parameters are

37
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,760
close to the parameters which you

38
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,959
actually obtain through the field trials

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,160
if they are

40
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,760
well and good

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,120
if they are not

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,280
then you will have to

43
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,480
revise some of those parameters

44
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,319
depending on what are the actual

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,560
conditions because many times what is

46
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,879
the reason behind

47
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,680
if you look at the reason behind

48
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,680
you are trying to

49
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,680
use the relationships

50
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,760
which

51
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
which represent the conditions in the

52
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,319
field

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,280
so that representation if it is faulty

54
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,280
or if it is not

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,840
is always dependent on some observations

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,680
which you have made at some discrete

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,879
points in the

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,560
field

59
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,319
if those are not

60
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,519
proper

61
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,040
then

62
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,920
you might get some

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,840
some

64
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,280
parameters which are not representative

65
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,920
parameters

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,879
because many times you might be

67
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,400
you might be basing all your

68
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,680
criteria

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,200
on the

70
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,400
the infiltration

71
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,000
observations which you have made

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,040
those observations they belong to

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,840
certain point locations in the field

74
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,000
so when you do the trial run

75
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,519
you will be able to verify those

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,599
parameters so let's have a look at

77
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,599
the field trial verification procedures

78
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,840
of some of the design parameters

79
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
on the case of

80
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,319
furrow

81
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,319
irrigation the

82
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,000
first thing which you want to

83
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,639
find out is that what is the maximum

84
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,400
stream size which should be

85
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,639
taken

86
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,639
and

87
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,160
you have used this relationship to find

88
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,880
out that

89
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,880
q maximum

90
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,960
having obtained this q maximum

91
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,960
now you set up

92
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,639
a length

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,639
in the field

94
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,400
which is representative length of the

95
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,560
the furrow field

96
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,440
and select around

97
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,639
four to five furrows

98
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,639
for example if you have

99
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,840
this is your

100
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,840
total field

101
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,039
having

102
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,120
different photos

103
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,840
you can select some segment

104
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,479
maybe somewhere here

105
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,479
where you can

106
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,960
you have the upstream and there's the

107
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,639
downstream end

108
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,919
where you are making the

109
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,160
measurements

110
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,160
and then you select some of the photos

111
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,479
so you have you have selected a

112
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,919
representative segment of the

113
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,520
total field

114
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,120
and

115
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,639
this segment

116
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,680
has a portion of the field where you

117
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,000
will be making the observations

118
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,680
so so as to check the various design

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,960
parameters

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,280
now the queue maximum which we have

121
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,520
obtained

122
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,400
so let us assume that you have

123
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,400
selected four photos

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,319
and

125
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,319
you have a q maximum

126
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,039
which you know

127
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,080
which is a desirable stream size which

128
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,720
you obtained from the relationship

129
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,720
now select

130
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,639
four different

131
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,639
stream sizes

132
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,560
in such a way that

133
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,840
some of them are

134
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,199
more than q

135
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,560
maxima and some of them

136
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,759
are less chance

137
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,759
the q maximum value

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,280
the one which is

139
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,639
less

140
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,400
you try to select

141
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,319
one out of this

142
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,599
which hardly

143
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,599
which may not be able to

144
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,720
even reach the

145
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,160
downstream end of the field

146
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,160
so it's so low you are trying to select

147
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,199
those stream sizes which are extreme

148
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,800
scenes stream sizes

149
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,560
the one which is

150
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
very low and

151
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,560
on this side you might

152
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,280
select one which is

153
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,280
definitely

154
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,919
erosive

155
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,039
so as

156
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,680
to have a range of these stream sizes

157
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,199
because you want to you want to

158
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,199
make the observations that how

159
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,759
the

160
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,080
the movement of water will behave with

161
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,720
respect to these different ranges of the

162
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,720
stream size

163
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,840
so once you have

164
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,680
selected the same sizes

165
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,879
you make the observations

166
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,039
the observations

167
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,280
are only made in terms of the elapsed

168
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,280
time

169
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,360
but how the waterfront moves from the

170
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,680
upstream

171
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,759
end of the furrow to the downstream end

172
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,039
so you plot these

173
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,039
with respect to the distance

174
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,800
down the furrow

175
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,479
meters

176
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,479
this is in

177
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,279
minutes

178
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,560
depending on what sizes you have

179
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,720
selected

180
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,399
you might find that you are once you

181
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,760
plot those

182
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,160
you will get a

183
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,720
family of these

184
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,720
advanced curves

185
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,279
belong to different

186
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,279
stream sizes

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,320
for example this is

188
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,320
if you take this as the

189
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,480
you might now be able to observe one

190
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,600
if you have

191
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,040
many of them

192
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,720
you might

193
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,440
out of these you might

194
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,480
know that which is the one

195
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,480
which is the maximum

196
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,760
allowable stream size

197
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,279
because you want to select one

198
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,279
which is non-erosive

199
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,600
okay that you can call

200
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,680
as the maximum

201
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,560
allowable stream size

202
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,720
here

203
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,760
you will have all these

204
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,880
stream sizes will be

205
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,880
this will be more than

206
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,680
q maximum if we call this as the q

207
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,279
maximum now you can also match that

208
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,640
whether the q maximum which you have

209
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,040
obtained

210
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,959
from the relationship from the empirical

211
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,640
relationship does it match with the

212
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,360
allowable maximum

213
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,200
as per the field conditions or not

214
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,880
so that's the first check

215
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,120
so if you find that that

216
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,680
maximum allowable is different

217
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,440
choose that as the maximum allowable

218
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,000
and the others now

219
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,680
these are the sizes which are

220
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,320
greater than q maximum and they'll be

221
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,320
will be creating

222
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,240
erosion

223
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,160
on the field

224
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,160
and on this side of the

225
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,760
this maximum allowable these are the

226
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,680
stream sizes which are

227
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,600
less than q maximum

228
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,399
and they are

229
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,399
non-erosive

230
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,600
at the same time

231
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,360
they are of course non-erosive but we

232
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,360
have seen that to have

233
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,040
less of de-percolation

234
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,519
you should try to have the maximum

235
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,320
stream size

236
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:30,320
the fpr ratio which we have seen

237
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,320
we can we have seen the justification

238
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,560
now

239
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,600
having

240
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,480
obtained this family of the curves

241
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,680
now

242
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,160
this family of curve is with respect to

243
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,160
unknown

244
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,480
slope

245
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,480
and

246
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,279
non-q values

247
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,519
you can always

248
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,600
use iterative procedures to find out

249
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,240
what is the

250
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,800
the length to be adopted

251
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,839
and what is the corresponding

252
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,839
time of advance

253
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,560
to show you the

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,680
how you do the use the iteration to find

255
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,760
out

256
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,760
which are the proper parameters

257
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,200
let's take one

258
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,240
case

259
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,240
where you have been given

260
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,560
the given data is that q maximum

261
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,920
as

262
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,959
0.4

263
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,959
liters per second

264
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,959
the slope

265
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,760
of the field is

266
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,760
also given

267
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,560
and

268
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,560
the family curve

269
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,920
or the properties of the soil

270
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,200
in terms of the family curve

271
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,279
as known

272
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,959
so once the family curve is known you

273
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,279
know all that

274
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,600
the coefficients

275
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,959
a b and c

276
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,880
so now

277
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,160
as a first trial

278
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,320
you have to make

279
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,320
trial runs assume

280
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,839
a length

281
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,959
of the field let's say

282
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,680
we assume

283
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,680
100 meter land

284
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,040
let's call this as the

285
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,040
first trial

286
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,839
you can evaluate beta

287
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,839
since we know the values of

288
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,560
all these

289
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,560
parameters

290
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,639
g is known since the family curve is

291
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,639
known

292
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,160
and

293
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,720
x is 100 meters that's what we have

294
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,720
taken as the segment of the length so x

295
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,519
is basically

296
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,440
uh

297
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,440
the length of the field considered

298
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,639
does the value of g

299
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,920
with respect to the family curve

300
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,760
into

301
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,000
100 meters and q is known to be 4 liters

302
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,600
per second

303
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,240
0 0 5

304
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,720
to the power 0.5

305
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,720
and this is

306
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,040
2.13

307
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,480
now with this

308
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,800
beat off

309
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,600
you can find out what is the

310
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,600
advanced time

311
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,480
i'll call

312
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,480
it t1 because this is the first trial

313
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,760
this is given as

314
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,079
all these relationships we have seen

315
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,600
earlier

316
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,600
so

317
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,600
this is what this will evaluate to be

318
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,360
into

319
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,399
exponent

320
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,639
of beta is 2.13

321
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,639
this is

322
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,680
and then 10 minutes

323
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,839
having found this

324
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,839
advanced time

325
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,160
let me

326
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,160
let me assume that when once i have

327
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,880
found out the

328
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,279
the stream size

329
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,560
if the stream size is 0.4

330
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,800
i have taken

331
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,800
these

332
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,199
stream sizes to be i have chosen these

333
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,480
stream sizes for which the family curves

334
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,000
have been

335
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,240
plotted

336
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,040
and these belong to

337
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,040
these values

338
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,639
0.15 liters per second point three point

339
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,759
four five point six

340
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,000
okay

341
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:45,120
so let's let's assume that these belong

342
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,759
to the the given case which we have

343
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,759
just taken

344
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,000
and let's

345
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,320
give some values to

346
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,320
a distance

347
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,120
and so on i'm just trying to sketch it

348
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,880
in a rough manner

349
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,520
and the time

350
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,000
elapsed time

351
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,000
is from

352
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,360
0 to 500 minutes

353
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,360
now

354
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,520
in the first case

355
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,559
when i

356
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,559
i have found that the

357
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,799
advanced time

358
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,200
is 110 minutes

359
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,039
so for that case

360
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,200
i find out

361
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,120
for this advanced time

362
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,400
and the distance i know the distance

363
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,200
taken is

364
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,200
100 meters

365
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,080
if this is the 100 meter distance here

366
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,559
i try to project it

367
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,280
and if this belongs to

368
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,240
110

369
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,240
110 minutes

370
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,799
i find that this

371
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,400
point

372
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,080
lies

373
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,760
much below the

374
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,480
the maximum allowable stream size

375
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,039
and this point

376
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,880
with respect to these two parameters

377
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,200
if i take 100

378
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,559
meters as the length of the field

379
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,280
and for which

380
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,120
the advanced time with respect to

381
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,039
the given parameters

382
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,080
is 110 minutes

383
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,679
then

384
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,200
this

385
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,640
point lies

386
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,640
below this

387
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,080
the maximum allowable

388
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,919
which suggests that

389
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,760
if you use these parameters you are

390
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,720
going to get

391
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,520
the erosive conditions

392
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,760
so that means either

393
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,760
the length is not proper

394
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,760
or

395
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,200
the synth length is dependent on the

396
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,440
advanced time

397
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,480
or the advanced time is dependent on the

398
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,080
length

399
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,520
is the either way they are both

400
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,520
interconnected

401
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,880
so i can take

402
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,600
another length

403
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,039
as a second trial that means this

404
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,799
particular

405
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,720
condition is not

406
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,080
acceptable

407
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,080
i take the second trial

408
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,440
and assume a length

409
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,000
which is

410
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,960
which is

411
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:43,679
larger than the previous case

412
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,679
take a length of 140 meters

413
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,400
now for 140 meters length meter

414
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,480
gets over evaluated to

415
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,600
sorry 2.98

416
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,559
and

417
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,240
the corresponding advanced time

418
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,200
is

419
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,600
362

420
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,600
minutes

421
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,240
again

422
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,600
if i get back to this

423
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,600
for 140

424
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,520
140

425
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,520
meter

426
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,520
i

427
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,640
project a

428
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,039
vertical line from here

429
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,840
and on this side

430
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,520
the

431
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:35,440
elapsed time is 300 something 362.

432
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,919
if this is the point here for 362.

433
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,480
i project it

434
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,960
and you are getting a point

435
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,080
which is slightly above the

436
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,080
the maximum discharge

437
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,039
um

438
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,080
curve the maximum logarithmic discharge

439
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,080
curve

440
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,400
so this shows that

441
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,360
we have achieved a condition now with

442
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,360
respect to these two

443
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,360
length of 140

444
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,840
and the the

445
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,559
resultant advanced time is 362 minutes

446
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,280
so this gives you a condition

447
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,280
where you can

448
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,159
you will

449
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,600
have a situation where the erosion is

450
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,919
not a problem

451
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,640
but you might be getting

452
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,880
efficiency which is not as much as

453
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,799
achievable

454
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,799
it's not an optimum efficiency the

455
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,840
optimum efficiency you will get

456
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,559
when you

457
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,840
when you you will be able to closer to

458
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,960
the maximum allowable stream size

459
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,400
so you can

460
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,400
if you feel that you have come quite

461
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,080
close to this with the respect to these

462
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,480
parameters is fine otherwise you can

463
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,000
have another child

464
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,000
where you can still improve upon

465
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,360
take a third trial where you improve on

466
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,559
the length

467
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,320
and

468
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,600
you feel that you have taken a length

469
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,159
which is

470
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,640
more than the desirable

471
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,720
you can take it

472
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,640
to be

473
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,880
less than the previous case

474
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,559
and have another iteration

475
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,960
where

476
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:18,080
this case beta is 2.66 and

477
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,080
the

478
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,080
advanced time works out to be 235

479
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,320
minutes

480
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,320
now this

481
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,000
advanced time versus

482
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,000
the length

483
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,480
combination

484
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,720
it falls quite close to the

485
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,720
q maximum

486
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,400
and

487
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,200
now you can

488
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,840
you can say that you have achieved

489
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,159
a situation which is

490
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,559
desirable and at this at this juncture

491
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,919
you now compare the parameters which are

492
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,520
obtained here

493
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,640
with respect to the parameters which you

494
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,919
obtained

495
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,400
by the

496
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,400
the other

497
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,240
the equations which have been provided

498
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,400
and that comparison will give you an

499
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,159
insight into whether

500
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,960
the results which you obtained through

501
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,880
the

502
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,520
the procedural steps

503
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,679
using the procedure which you have

504
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,600
studied in the last class

505
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,880
how close they are to the actual

506
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,440
conditions

507
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,280
so if they are very far

508
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,120
they are far apart you might have to

509
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,240
make some adjustments

510
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,280
so once in a way it is always better to

511
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,280
keep track of these

512
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,880
these parameters and

513
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,279
wet those parameters

514
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,960
try to check those parameters

515
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,200
don't keep on blindly using those

516
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,039
parameters that is the main main reason

517
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,799
of having these

518
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,760
trial

519
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,000
evaluation runs for different systems we

520
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,720
have seen in the case of border

521
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,080
and this also even similarly in the case

522
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,120
of level basin which you are going to

523
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,159
consider

524
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,480
next

525
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,480
the procedures remain same only the

526
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,400
expressions the way you have to conduct

527
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,840
the trial runs

528
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,120
they will change

529
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,720
okay

530
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,279
so with that we

531
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,640
conclude this

532
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,720
topic

533
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,600
on the

534
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:29,039
furrow education system

535
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,039
and we will move on to the

536
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,440
the next

537
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,240
topic which is

538
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,320
a topic of level basin system

539
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,200
if you have any question i can answer

540
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,200
that at this juncture

541
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,080
we won't spend much time on the level

542
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,279
basin system because

543
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,039
is

544
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,240
quite same

545
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,000
procedures

546
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,360
as we have done in the case of border

547
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,559
irrigation system

548
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,200
only with very small minor differences

549
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,120
and i'll quickly go through this

550
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,960
particular subject

551
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,440
a topic which

552
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,440
is a

553
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,000
related topic

554
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,559
and try to bring out those differences

555
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,279
which are considered in the

556
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:19,000
evaluation and the design of this

557
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,000
level basin system

558
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,840
if you remember we have

559
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,080
discussed earlier

560
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,080
that

561
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,159
the level basin

562
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,320
is a special case of

563
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,559
the border

564
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,559
only difference is the level basin

565
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,600
they are not having any slope

566
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,320
they are

567
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,320
level areas

568
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,200
without

569
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,120
slope

570
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,279
they're relatively small in size

571
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,440
and what you are doing

572
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,960
the suitability in terms of the

573
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,279
suitability

574
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,279
they are suitable

575
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,720
far

576
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,720
low to moderate

577
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,679
and take soils

578
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,480
so for those soils where

579
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,760
the infiltration rates are

580
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,279
relatively

581
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,440
lower

582
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,840
you can use you can make use of this

583
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,840
system

584
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,360
the

585
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,720
shapes of the fields are normally

586
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,000
rectangular but the sizes are not the

587
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,679
lengths are not

588
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,880
as big as

589
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,080
you have in the case of border

590
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,320
derivation

591
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,640
because of the fact that

592
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,640
you are trying to flood these areas

593
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,240
now the reason is that you want to do

594
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,279
the flooding in these small

595
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,559
basins

596
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,559
so that you can

597
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,559
let the water stand for a long period

598
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,240
so as to have

599
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,120
the

600
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,559
the available infiltration opportunity

601
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,320
time

602
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,559
to be there so as to have the desired

603
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,640
desired infiltration

604
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,600
take place in the field

605
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,080
because

606
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,600
we have just said that the

607
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,360
the

608
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,840
infiltration rates of these soils are

609
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,320
very low if you let the water pass over

610
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,679
the surface of the soil

611
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,520
the

612
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,520
amount of time which is available for

613
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,279
the infiltration

614
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,880
is very small

615
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,080
and since the infiltration rates are

616
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,360
very low it needs a very long time for

617
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,200
infiltration

618
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,279
so that is the reason that the

619
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,279
shape of the basin

620
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,360
and the size of the basin

621
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,679
has been reduced the

622
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,200
the slopes are not given so that you can

623
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,240
flood the area

624
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,880
you can check the water within the area

625
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,440
that is the idea if you create slopes

626
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,320
then you will find that

627
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,960
the lower portions of the let me

628
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,520
elaborate this point that

629
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,520
if i have

630
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,279
a field which is having slope

631
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,679
if you want to

632
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,919
supply a depth of water

633
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,919
and

634
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,720
you try to trap this water it will get

635
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,640
accumulated only into the lower area so

636
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,039
you have to have a

637
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,320
relatively

638
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,360
level

639
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,360
surface

640
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,039
on which you can

641
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,600
now you can

642
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,520
establish a depth of water

643
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,080
and the depth of water will depend on

644
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,080
what is the ridge size

645
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,279
what is the height of the edge which are

646
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,880
created

647
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,720
in

648
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,520
creating these

649
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,520
these basins

650
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,919
will come to that that is also a

651
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,200
parameter which has to be considered in

652
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,640
the designs

653
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,480
so

654
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,640
this particular method

655
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,200
from that angle is

656
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,159
is created for some special

657
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,480
purpose

658
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,640
or some special circumstances but with

659
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,679
respect to the type of crops which can

660
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,520
be grown

661
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,279
we have already considered that

662
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,000
in this particular

663
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,000
method in the czech basin method or the

664
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,520
level basin method

665
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,960
the

666
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,399
crops

667
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,720
there's hardly any crop which cannot be

668
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,440
grown in this even those crops which are

669
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,159
not

670
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,600
suitable to be known with any other

671
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,159
method

672
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,600
example the rice

673
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:26,159
or the jute which need

674
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,880
the water inundated water which need the

675
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,080
standing water they also

676
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,240
are

677
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,000
used with this method

678
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,440
other all the other methods even the

679
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,120
orchards

680
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,520
they are also irrigated using this

681
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,399
method where you are

682
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,720
creating the conditions where you are

683
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,320
taking care of each individual plant

684
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,600
by having a ring method which you had

685
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,679
considered

686
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,039
so

687
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,080
we have discussed that earlier also and

688
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,320
let's

689
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,880
let's set this juncture try to look into

690
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,880
the various

691
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,360
formulations which have been considered

692
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,440
for

693
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,120
the design of these

694
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,360
systems

695
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,880
and this case also as we have seen in

696
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,159
the previous

697
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,600
cases

698
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,600
that there are some

699
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,600
relationships

700
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,919
which are based on

701
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,919
experience

702
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,480
and

703
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,720
the

704
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,440
even the field trials

705
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,679
and these relationships are ultimately

706
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,159
given in the form of

707
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,279
a very simple

708
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,480
chart

709
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,480
which becomes the starting

710
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,600
the starting parameters of the design

711
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,399
you can always use them as the

712
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,399
thumb rules or as the

713
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:04,720
values which are recommended values

714
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,480
so in this case

715
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,880
there is one

716
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,200
that they are presented in different

717
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,200
different

718
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,840
forms

719
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,159
and one

720
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,919
form which i am trying to express here

721
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,760
is the chart given in terms of the flow

722
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:30,399
rate

723
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,399
in liters per second and for different

724
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,279
soil type

725
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,880
the soil type vary from

726
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,679
sand

727
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,679
to sandy long to clay long

728
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,080
so

729
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,200
clay

730
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,200
and you are given the area of the

731
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,600
basin

732
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,600
and hectares

733
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,440
for different

734
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,519
forage and for different

735
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,200
soils

736
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:22,159
so i'll only pick up some of the

737
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,159
values for some in

738
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,159
intermediate

739
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,399
stream sizes

740
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,919
and give you the variation that how much

741
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,480
variation in

742
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,960
size can take place

743
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,960
which is the recommended

744
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,880
sizes for

745
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,880
all these different types of soils

746
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,440
let me say that this is

747
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,440
270.

748
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,879
now you can see

749
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,399
the variation

750
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:22,800
when you have very small stream size

751
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,720
within the same uh

752
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,960
the same stream size when you go from

753
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,639
one extreme of the soil type to the

754
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,720
other extreme

755
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,560
the area can vary

756
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,800
by around

757
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,800
10 times

758
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,240
same is true in this case also

759
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,159
and for different seam sizes for the

760
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,359
same soil

761
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:48,879
there's still a lot of variation in the

762
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,599
area which can be used for the

763
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,599
level basin

764
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,440
besides this

765
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,960
this this will give you a

766
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,240
reasonably good

767
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,760
starting parameters of the

768
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,200
design

769
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,040
but you can always

770
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,119
if you have more data available you can

771
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,760
go in for the detailed design which is

772
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,440
dependent on the hydraulic relationships

773
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,880
which we have been using for other

774
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,960
methods

775
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,320
the relationships basically used in this

776
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,560
these designs

777
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,880
are the soil characteristics

778
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,839
which we have seen

779
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,280
and

780
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,440
the manning's

781
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,560
equation which have been used very often

782
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,760
because with the assumption that

783
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,079
the

784
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,160
we are considering

785
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,400
a channel flow which is a very wide

786
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,480
channel with a very small depth

787
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,320
as the assumption made

788
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,119
because basically the manning's equation

789
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,400
is for channel flow

790
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,960
so let's look at the hydraulic

791
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,960
relationship

792
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,720
which we can use for the case of

793
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,720
level basin

794
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,599
this equation is still valid

795
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,960
for the

796
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,880
net depth of

797
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,560
infiltration

798
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,079
which is

799
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,880
which we have

800
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,560
used very often so using this equation

801
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,800
you can

802
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,680
always

803
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,000
get the time of infiltration

804
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,280
to have this much net depth of

805
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,800
infiltration

806
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,079
what is the

807
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,280
the desirable time of infiltration

808
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,280
can be obtained from

809
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,400
the same relationship

810
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,240
once we have this

811
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,680
tn available

812
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,680
now we use the fpr's

813
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,040
the fractional advanced ratio

814
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,160
and the fracture advance ratio

815
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,160
is

816
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,800
given for

817
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,240
this is basically

818
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,240
the

819
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,880
affair the way we are defined as the

820
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,400
ratio of

821
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,960
advanced time by the

822
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,960
net time

823
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,920
the fps

824
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,920
varies with respect to the

825
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,720
the distribution pattern efficiency

826
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,400
or

827
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,839
you can also say that the distribution

828
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,920
pattern efficiency is dependent on

829
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:55,599
affair and for different

830
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,280
distribution pattern efficiencies

831
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,960
far

832
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,720
value

833
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,720
has been computed and given in this

834
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,720
table

835
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,680
similarly for

836
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,680
other efficiencies

837
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,400
you have

838
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,400
now this is

839
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,920
something which is available either in

840
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,520
this form

841
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,079
or

842
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,839
even in a graphical representation is

843
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:50,400
one of the same thing even there's a

844
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,760
the equation which is available

845
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,839
to uh

846
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,359
find out

847
00:38:53,839 --> 00:39:00,839
the distribution pattern efficiency

848
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,839
knowing the affairs

849
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,280
and this equation is a

850
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,800
regression equation

851
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,359
which you can

852
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,359
make note of

853
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,200
and 2

854
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,440
dt by tn

855
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,079
to the power

856
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,079
0.5

857
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,560
this is 0.5 here

858
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,640
where

859
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,839
it is

860
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,880
and

861
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,880
percentage as in this

862
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,200
once you

863
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,240
either know your

864
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,800
t n

865
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,920
to the power 0.5

866
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,079
i'm sorry

867
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,760
as

868
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:08,560
i'll write with this

869
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,560
is it visible now

870
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,560
now

871
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,280
there can be different

872
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,560
situations

873
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,560
in one case

874
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,240
you might select a ed

875
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,000
that you want to

876
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,319
you don't want to have a

877
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,920
distribution pattern efficiency below a

878
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,520
particular level

879
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,040
so in that case

880
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,119
you fix your id

881
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,040
and you can find out what will be the

882
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,520
the far possible

883
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,440
for that id

884
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,880
so if that is the situation

885
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,680
then

886
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,680
you know your affair

887
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,000
if far is

888
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,000
known

889
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,280
you can

890
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,280
you can know the affair

891
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,480
or in other words

892
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,480
you know this ratio

893
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,800
this you can

894
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,720
find out

895
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,599
from the table

896
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,160
depending on the acceptable

897
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,760
distribution pattern efficiency

898
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,319
once you know this

899
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,160
you can now evaluate

900
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,960
t t because

901
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,400
t n is known

902
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,480
t n is known

903
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,760
and

904
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,760
the far is known

905
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,839
okay

906
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,720
so knowing therefore

907
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,960
the advanced time can also be

908
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,960
evaluated

909
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,839
then there is a relationship between

910
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,839
the

911
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,480
the time of advance

912
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,760
and the length

913
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,680
and

914
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,640
the stream size

915
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,920
now in this case let me tell you that

916
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,960
the stream size which we use

917
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,359
is not the stream size

918
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,720
for the total strip we use per unit

919
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:18,880
strip so the unit stream size which you

920
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,960
can

921
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,720
say is the

922
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,720
cube divided by the width of the

923
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,079
basin

924
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,960
and

925
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,000
this will be in

926
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,240
meter cube per seconds per meter

927
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,240
width

928
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,440
or meter per second

929
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,160
that is what we call the unit

930
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,160
stream size

931
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,200
and this length is

932
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,200
given in terms of the unit stream size

933
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,680
and the advanced time

934
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:15,000
and the other parameters of

935
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,000
the family curve

936
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,079
this is lying by

937
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,720
16.

938
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,720
and

939
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,599
advanced time by

940
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:52,400
3 by 60.

941
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,680
so that's the expression which is

942
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,280
used

943
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,280
to find out the length of the

944
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,040
basin

945
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,720
and this

946
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,720
the n value

947
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,599
n value is the same

948
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,359
as we had used for the border irrigation

949
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,440
system i had given you the three n

950
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,200
values

951
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,200
which are representative of three

952
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,760
conditions

953
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,960
the small this value was for smooth bare

954
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,720
soil

955
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,800
surface

956
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,800
point one

957
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,240
is taken as the when the when you have

958
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,240
small grain drill

959
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,000
rows

960
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,680
parallel to the bottle strip

961
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
and if you have

962
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:49,760
a dense crop or when the rows are

963
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,119
drilled across the border strip

964
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,240
then you have

965
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:58,240
more resistance the n value is 0.25 the

966
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:00,720
same and values or similar n values are

967
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,119
chosen for

968
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,880
if this is a similar situation the

969
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,760
difference is not much

970
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:11,280
the only difference is that you have

971
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,280
the flat areas

972
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,040
besides this you will also be interested

973
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,119
in knowing what is the cutoff

974
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,359
time

975
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,359
the

976
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:28,960
time to cut off

977
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,440
which we are calling as

978
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,800
tco

979
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,240
the relationship

980
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,240
used for the time to cut off

981
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,400
all these quantities you are

982
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,160
now quite

983
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,280
aware of

984
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,200
the unit

985
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,000
stream size

986
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,520
the distribution pattern efficiency

987
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,359
the length

988
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,880
and the net depth of infiltration

989
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,040
and this

990
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,040
the

991
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,400
ea is assumed to be 100

992
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,480
the application efficiency

993
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,640
so if the application efficiency is

994
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,000
assumed to be hundred percent then this

995
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,520
is the expression

996
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,760
otherwise

997
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,079
if the application efficiency is less

998
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,599
than hundred percent

999
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,000
which is normally not the case in the

1000
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,599
case of surface irrigation systems

1001
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,839
but if it is if you

1002
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,240
are certain that is not hundred percent

1003
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:53,760
then you can use

1004
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,760
the expression which is

1005
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,400
giving

1006
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,400
a also

1007
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,160
okay

1008
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,839
that'll be the device expression

1009
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,839
if

1010
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,839
your ear is not 100

1011
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,599
then lastly we are also

1012
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,240
interested in knowing that what is the

1013
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,240
maximum

1014
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,839
depth of

1015
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,559
flow on the basin

1016
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,720
this maximum depth of flow in the basin

1017
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,240
has to find out the requirement of the

1018
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,040
ridge

1019
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,040
and normally the

1020
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,760
ridge size

1021
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:10,000
is approximately 1.25 times

1022
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,000
the

1023
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,319
the maximum if we

1024
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:19,160
call this

1025
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:19,160
maximum depth as the maximum

1026
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,119
so you can compute the

1027
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:33,119
the maximum

1028
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,559
using this expression

1029
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:58,319
this expression used for

1030
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,319
obtaining the d maximum

1031
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,880
and the maximum

1032
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,520
will be

1033
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,520
millimeters

1034
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,520
now here

1035
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,520
there's one

1036
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,960
requirement that

1037
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,520
there might be a situation when

1038
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,480
the

1039
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,480
advanced time is

1040
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,839
more than

1041
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,839
the cutoff time

1042
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,079
if

1043
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,800
that is the situation which can which

1044
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,240
can only happen in the case of

1045
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,079
level basins

1046
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,839
so if that is the situation

1047
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,040
then you must

1048
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:42,800
and this

1049
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,800
equation of t max you must

1050
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,720
replace tco with

1051
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,280
dt

1052
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,839
so in this expression

1053
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,839
which is for the

1054
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,680
nd max expression

1055
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,000
okay

1056
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,359
that will have to take care that if your

1057
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,040
time of

1058
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:21,920
advances happens to be more than the

1059
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,839
the

1060
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,880
time of cutoff

1061
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,960
then

1062
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,280
this will be the governing time to

1063
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,119
compute the d maximum which is quite

1064
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,040
understandable

1065
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,400
so that is what

1066
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,760
gives us

1067
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,280
all the parameters which we are

1068
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,200
interested in

1069
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,520
and similarly in this case also you can

1070
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,359
go in for the trial runs and

1071
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:47,359
check the parameters as we have

1072
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:50,000
suggested in the previous two cases

1073
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:50,000
so with that

1074
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,559
i

1075
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:56,559
will conclude

1076
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,920
the topic of

1077
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,200
irrigation methods using the surface

1078
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,079
irrigation

1079
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,480
or the

1080
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,599
gravity irrigation flow

1081
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,200
and then in the next class

1082
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,240
we'll proceed with

1083
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,400
the design

1084
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,079
of other two methods

1085
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,079
the sprinkler irrigation and the

1086
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,319
depletion system

1087
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,319
okay

1088
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:27,200
any question i want to uh

1089
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,200
answer this juncture

1090
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,520
the question is that is there any thumb

1091
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,839
rule for the basin method

1092
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,680
the thumb rule in terms of this is the

1093
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:44,559
table which we have

1094
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:46,800
just looked at

1095
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,079
i had given you some values of that

1096
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,559
table

1097
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,880
that was basically a thumb rule

1098
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,280
uh it can be converted into a thumb rule

1099
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,880
in the sense that

1100
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,319
this thumb rule all the thumb rules

1101
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,440
which you

1102
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,040
normally

1103
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,079
formulate

1104
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,800
they are

1105
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,920
having lot of experience behind them

1106
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,920
so this

1107
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,800
can be taken as a thumb rule

1108
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,640
where

1109
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,319
if you know the stream size because

1110
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,200
normally what parameters are available

1111
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,800
to you

1112
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,640
the constraints the constrained

1113
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,559
parameters are

1114
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,640
the quantity of

1115
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,680
stream size or the rate of stream size

1116
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,520
which is

1117
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,240
the stream size which is

1118
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,359
available to a farmer at a particular

1119
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,040
location

1120
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,920
if that is known

1121
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,200
and

1122
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,599
we also know in general what are the

1123
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,920
the type of soil which are

1124
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,440
prevalent there in that field

1125
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,760
then he can

1126
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,200
use this as a thumb rule that what is

1127
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,440
the size of the

1128
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,480
the basin which he should

1129
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,240
adopt so as to get a reasonably good

1130
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,839
efficiency

1131
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,640
so this is this is nothing but a thumb

1132
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:56,400
rule it can be taken as a thumb rule

1133
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:59,640
okay

1134
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,640
thank you

1135
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:07,080
[Music]

1136
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,319
so

1137
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:33,070
[Music]

1138
