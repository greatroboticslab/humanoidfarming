00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,759
welcome to Wholesome roots today I'm

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,960
going to show you how to transplant

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:08,880
Tomatoes looking

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,639
good anybody who has followed me for any

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,480
amount of time knows that my tomato

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,000
plants get completely buried the whole

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,480
plant all the way up to the top growth

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,960
it's what I consider the absolute best

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,640
method for tomato planting you get tons

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,160
of root development and really healthy

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,480
plants this way so first thing you want

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,440
to choose healthy plants I have two that

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,079
are

14
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,680
growing oops I have two that are growing

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,600
I have two that are growing together

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,559
that I'm going to pull apart gently

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,640
teasing The Roots apart so whether you

18
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,920
start your transplants yourself from

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,559
seed or you buy them from a local Source

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,320
just choose the healthiest ones you see

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,280
then you're going to dig a nice deep

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:00,039
hole the whole height of the plant in a

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,559
wonderful compost soil well- drained

24
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,439
full sun that means you need 6 to eight

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:10,080
hours of Sun for these plants sometimes

26
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:12,960
I even will water inside the hole to get

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,080
it moist deep down inside before I

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,000
transplant then you put your plant all

29
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,080
the way to the bottom of the hole

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,439
leaving just the top of the plant above

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,240
the soil line so my soil is going to

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,280
come all the way up on this plant and

33
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,799
it's going to lead to root development

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,360
all along the

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,560
stem tomato plants root very easily on

36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,560
the

37
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,520
stem now you can pinch the lower leaves

38
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,719
off or leave them on I didn't have but

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,000
one on there so it got buried it won't

40
00:01:52,719 --> 00:02:00,119
hurt anything and that's that water it

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,640
in well right after planting

42
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,280
and keep an eye on it over the next

43
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,039
couple of days in water if you see any

44
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,840
wilting this is the most easy and simple

45
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,680
way of planting tomatoes that I have

46
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,640
found and I really have found it so easy

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,879
that I almost cringe when I see people

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,080
planting long leggy tomato plants all

49
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,160
above ground cuz I think about all those

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,239
roots you could have had so make sure

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,680
you don't miss out on your chance to

52
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:29,959
have lots of roots to help support the

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,280
plant to get the most nutrients from

54
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:36,040
your compost rich soil and the biggest

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,120
and most beautiful tomatoes but you do

56
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,239
have to give careful consideration to

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,120
how you support them during that growth

58
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,760
cuz tomato plants can get taller than me

59
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,480
and I have a great video that teaches

60
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,400
you all about different trellising

61
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,440
