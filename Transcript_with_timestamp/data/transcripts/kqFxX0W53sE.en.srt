1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
folks how we doing today we're going to

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,040
give you a bit of a pallet fork guide so

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,720
how to select the right set of pallet

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,720
forks for your tractor you know little

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,559
subcompacts a compact a large frame

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,080
utility a skid steer whatever it is

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,759
different options different quick attach

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,519
types fork tine lengths weight

9
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,920
capacities all that good stuff so stick

10
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,920
around

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,600
john deere quickitch just has two of

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,039
these pins one on each side down in the

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,079
corners sometimes they don't have much

14
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,120
weight or when they're brand new they

15
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,399
have a little bit of extra paint build

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,199
up they might not seep the whole way

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,039
through

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,800
or only just a swift kick

19
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,800
we'll seated on there

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
and once you take a bucket or forks or a

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,840
push or anything on and off you're gonna

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,159
wear all the paint off around here those

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,280
tolerances are pretty tight so um once

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,640
you wear it in it's normally not an

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,640
issue at all okay so now we're gonna put

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,400
the tines on the frame itself and you'll

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,159
notice along the bottom rail a small

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,000
little cutout and that's to allow you to

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,960
actually get the tine onto the frame and

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,320
then you're going to slide it to the

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,759
left or to the right okay i'm going to

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,439
give this a shot see if i can actually

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,880
use the tractor lower it down to the

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,320
right angle and

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,920
pick right up underneath here so i don't

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,119
have to lift it up of course i could

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,400
these are the ultralight forks so

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,479
they're not all that heavy but if you do

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,600
have a larger set like a standard duty

40
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,520
or one of the 4 200 500 pound sets

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,400
well those are really heavy tines so

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,400
anyway let's see if this works

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,799
[Music]

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,399
all right so i just missed that center

45
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,320
slot but you can see the top rails on

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,240
here so right now it's not fully seated

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,399
i'm going to give it a quick shift

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,080
and now it's on we do have our pin

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,000
that's in the unlocked position so

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,760
that's going to allow it to slide

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,760
all the way over we'll just

52
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,959
go wherever we want right about here and

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,160
you can kind of

54
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,440
shift it around and you're going to have

55
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,120
a little bit of wiggle room all right a

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,959
little bit of wiggle room is going to be

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,200
typical for all these this is steel on

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,720
steel so you have to have some place so

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,319
that you can freely slide it otherwise

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
you would bind them up all the time

61
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,239
you'd never move them you just hate

62
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,560
using them so this is just fine to have

63
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,560
a little play

64
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,760
all right so it's as easy as that

65
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,280
you're going to have a quick attach for

66
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,640
the john deere or the skid steer

67
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,840
depending on your tractor setup we'll

68
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,200
get more on that later but we're going

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,159
to line them up now let you see them all

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,599
side by side and give you that

71
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,000
comparison all right so we got them all

72
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,000
lined up in no particular order i got

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,959
the hydraulic forks these are 5 500

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
pound

75
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,360
frames skid steer quick attach you know

76
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,959
you need a hydraulic connection

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,040
ultra light these are the really popular

78
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,560
ones for the subcompacts these are john

79
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,920
deere quick attach

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,319
two thousand pound forks there on the

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,560
big kubota and then we have our 4 200

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,440
pound with a full brick guard forks on

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,200
the 20 25. now i got to point out those

84
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,680
forks are too big for that 20 25 all

85
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,159
right that normally goes on my 4720 that

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,280
i have and previously the 4066r but i

87
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,319
don't have that tractor out here right

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,760
now so

89
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,120
it's just holding fork so you can see

90
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,720
what they are and you're going to notice

91
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,480
these hydraulics aren't hooked up right

92
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,319
now i'm having a heck of a 24 hour

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,560
period right now i um well i'll show you

94
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,239
the back of my enclosed trailer i

95
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,239
smashed in

96
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,239
the top of that that was fantastic i

97
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,239
forgot to put a roll bar down so

98
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,400
feeling pretty good about that

99
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,159
then we have a drone that's about 50

100
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,319
foot up in the trees that we got stuck

101
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,680
there earlier today

102
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,400
and

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,400
the heat has expanded the fluid inside

104
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,360
of the hydraulics here and we can't get

105
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,879
the quick

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,560
couplers on the hydraulics to show you

107
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,720
how these will go in and out

108
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,120
hydraulically so this is the second time

109
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,720
this has happened to me this spring

110
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,239
there's just too much pressure in this

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,560
side when these sit out in the sun it

112
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,240
starts to warm up everything expands in

113
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,919
here there's just too much pressure

114
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,080
build up and you can bleed these off but

115
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,600
that's just you know

116
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,560
that's just annoying what i need to do

117
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,320
is stop procrastinating and get my hec

118
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,560
the hose end chambers hooked up on here

119
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,000
that's exactly what they're for is to

120
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,919
put on here when you're not using them

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,759
when they're going to be sitting outside

122
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,919
having the heat hit them have them warm

123
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,639
up and swell that fluid can expand into

124
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,400
the chamber and then go back right into

125
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,720
it if it's going to cool down it can

126
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,000
easily come off you need to hook it up

127
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,280
it prevents these problems from

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,960
happening because i really had to use

129
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,880
these right now i would be

130
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,560
up a creek basically so

131
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,479
check out the hose end chamber they're

132
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,039
relatively inexpensive you can save five

133
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,000
percent using code gwt so

134
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,520
anyway we're going to keep playing with

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,520
this see if we can get that hooked up i

136
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,880
do have a set of fork extensions that

137
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,560
are super handy as well i'm going to

138
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,160
show you what those are later on they

139
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,680
can go on pretty much any forks that are

140
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,520
out here but they'll extend out if you

141
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,440
need something really lightweight but

142
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,880
just a really long reach you get like a

143
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,560
six foot extension on those they're

144
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,400
pretty cool so let's start with weight

145
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,639
classes on all these and identify what

146
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,600
those are so we're gonna have 900 pound

147
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,160
on these guys 2 000 pound on the kubota

148
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,639
4 200 way over there on the end and then

149
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,360
5500 now that pound rating is going to

150
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,680
be at a load center or a load point that

151
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,360
um the little guys here is 21 inches out

152
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,360
from the frame so if you measured 21

153
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,759
inches out this way that's where that

154
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,199
900 pound capacity comes into play on

155
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
all the bigger ones i believe it's going

156
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,160
to be 24 inches a little bit further out

157
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,840
because

158
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,759
more often you're going to be at 48 or

159
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,600
60 inch tines on those and all these

160
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,680
forks are are overbuilt all right i

161
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,080
think it was like three years ago i put

162
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,919
a set of these little guys on my 4066

163
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,919
that i had back in the day

164
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,000
and lifted up a huge stack of weight

165
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,759
well over 2 000 pounds of them these

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,319
things i i used them for like a month on

167
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,000
that tractor they held up just fine so

168
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,479
you guys that ask questions like on your

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,759
two series tractors like that 2025r or

170
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,919
the 2032 2038 your kubota

171
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,600
lx 3310 all that those kind of tractors

172
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,520
that are really just one step above a

173
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
subcompact they're gonna work really

174
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,520
well on there so why i recommend these

175
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,039
lightweight these little guys for those

176
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,960
tractors like the subcompacts and the

177
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,520
next size up is because of the physical

178
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,000
weight of the entire assembly this is

179
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,759
going to weigh about 190 200 pounds

180
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,600
right in that ballpark

181
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,080
the next step up is the standard duty

182
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,840
forks those weigh 130 pounds more than

183
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,759
what these guys lift so that's 130

184
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,840
pounds of just lifting up the forks that

185
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,120
your loader has to do that's taking away

186
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
from whatever you want to put on the

187
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,840
forks whatever you want to put on a

188
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,520
pallet or a log or something else that

189
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,800
you want to lift so that's a lot of

190
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,199
weight that's eaten up for a little

191
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,280
loader like this so really weight is a

192
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,120
concern on smaller tractors with limited

193
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,800
capacity once you have a significant

194
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,639
loader capacity weight's really not a

195
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,039
concern with the forks you're more

196
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,960
concerned about making sure the frame is

197
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,720
built rugged and robust and not going to

198
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,319
fail on you and so on that note you're

199
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,199
going to see that all these forks are

200
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,120
hla forks which is up in ontario i've

201
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,960
been selling their equipment for a long

202
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,599
time their snow pushers are super

203
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,360
popular you guys watching if you own hla

204
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,880
products i know a lot of you do leave a

205
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,560
comment down below and let those other

206
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,400
folks watching know just how high

207
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,919
quality these products are one big

208
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,800
decision you need to make is if you need

209
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,840
a jdqa or an ssqa all right john deere

210
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,639
quick attach for john deere's skid steer

211
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,720
quick attach for kubota's for mahindra's

212
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,080
for coyotes for ls for new holland

213
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,680
pretty much everything else that's out

214
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,280
there but that's not always standard

215
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,520
sometimes you do have a pinned on bucket

216
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,520
or a goofy type of quick attach and we

217
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,800
can order forks to fit those kinds of

218
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,319
setups but they are typically going to

219
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,720
be an up charge because it's kind of a

220
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,400
custom job for hla to do and typically

221
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,280
going to be a longer lead time as well

222
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,199
all right something else we should

223
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,639
discuss before we go any further is

224
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,080
safety all right so that's ballast

225
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,680
weight so let's have chris back up just

226
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,360
a touch tell you more about it so we

227
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,039
spend a lot of time talking about safety

228
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,639
on this channel and it's because we have

229
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,400
a lot of new tractor owners joining the

230
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,000
group all the time so it's worth

231
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,599
mentioning again that you want to have a

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,199
lot of counterweight on the backside of

233
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,879
your tractor anytime you're using that

234
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,319
front end loader here you see we have

235
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,319
what's called our hitch hanger so if you

236
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,080
have a quick hitch like the spiko you

237
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,879
can put these weight brackets on the

238
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,560
side

239
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,720
still leave your three-point hitch open

240
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,479
to hook up an attachment if you want to

241
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,639
or if you need additional ballast weight

242
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,479
besides say the versa bracket and

243
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,479
suitcase weights or a ballast box or

244
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,759
another attachment so between these six

245
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,399
weights and the hitch hangers you can

246
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,000
get up to another 450 pounds of ballast

247
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,919
weight if you need it as always we're

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,839
sponsored by borah wheel spacers they

249
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,159
are made in america have a lifetime

250
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,599
warranty if your tractor feels tippy

251
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,120
side to side especially if you have a

252
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,800
cab on it then adding a set of wheel

253
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,160
spacers can make a big difference get

254
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,320
more information on them at the link

255
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,519
down below okay so you may think pallet

256
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,760
forks are only good for picking up

257
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,959
pallets but i wrote down all sorts of

258
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,560
stuff here and if i missed something

259
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,000
make sure you let us know but pallet

260
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,560
forks are great for

261
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,880
moving logs brush piles stacks of

262
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,480
anything you have patio furniture used

263
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,640
as a hanging mechanism for butchering

264
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,560
deer or seeing under a mower deck moving

265
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,480
hay bales supporting posts if you're

266
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,720
trying to put posts on the ground or you

267
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,080
know fence posts or a flagpole

268
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,040
hauling posts if you need to move them

269
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,320
around large boulders truck caps taking

270
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,320
them off of the back of your truck

271
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,399
moving heavy appliances the list just

272
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,000
goes on and on there's all sorts of uses

273
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,080
anytime you want to have a couple of

274
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,920
long fingers out there to grab something

275
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,440
you can use a set of pallet forks so

276
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,880
another decision you have to make is

277
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,800
going to be the right time length for

278
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,240
you all right and so

279
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,760
i think there's too many choices out

280
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,839
there personally it's just a lot of

281
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,680
inventory to carry you know these six

282
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,760
inch increments don't make a whole lot

283
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,839
of difference i i sometimes feel like i

284
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,920
just need to carry one size for each

285
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,839
frame and call it good but we have 42

286
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,480
inch forks on the little guys right now

287
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,279
you can get 36 42's 48s i don't carry

288
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,839
the 48s at all i probably just need to

289
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,279
carry 36 or 42.

290
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,040
you don't want the extra length the

291
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,720
further out you go with any forks the

292
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,160
less lift capacity you have so you do

293
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,640
want to keep things closer to the

294
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,360
tractor i wouldn't lose sleep over 36 or

295
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,079
42. now you had the same choices 36 42

296
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,160
48 on the 2000 pound frame

297
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,640
i typically don't stock the 36s on here

298
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,600
either the 42s or the 48s once you get

299
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,279
up to the 4200 pound and the 5500 pound

300
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,360
and so on it's pretty much 48 54 60 and

301
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,959
you can even get into 72 inch tines okay

302
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,880
so again typically you want to always

303
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,959
keep your load as close to the frame and

304
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,279
the in the base of the of the forks as

305
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,360
possible the further out you go the less

306
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,800
weight you can lift also if you have

307
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,480
longer times those are going to of

308
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,480
course way more than shorter times too

309
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,000
so there's that consideration as well a

310
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,360
bigger concern for smaller tractors and

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,959
larger ones but if you're tight on

312
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,399
storage space and of course a shorter

313
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,320
fork may work to your advantage so

314
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,760
you'll notice there's a different look

315
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,440
to these forks

316
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,079
probably more from your angle than from

317
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,680
mine so the shortest back is going to be

318
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,360
on the light guys here and so of course

319
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,720
you're saving weight by not having a big

320
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,640
tall back it doesn't mean there's no

321
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,480
back right you can still see you have a

322
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,279
good what 18 20 inches something like

323
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
that

324
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,720
right here to kind of back again so it'd

325
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,640
be really challenging for something to

326
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,399
fall back over this way i've never had

327
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,000
that issue at all now once you get up to

328
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,079
the 2000 pound forks you're going to see

329
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,240
there's an even taller back so again

330
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,680
those lighter duty ones come up to about

331
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,440
right here you have an extra i don't

332
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,959
know 10 12 inches something like that

333
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,720
that's adding more weight but giving you

334
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,640
a little bit more protection as well now

335
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,880
these are the 4 200 pound forks i want

336
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,240
to reiterate they are way too big for

337
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,680
this tractor we're just showing them on

338
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,519
here just so you can see what they're

339
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,399
all about these are for a large compact

340
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,800
or even a utility tractor as well these

341
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,959
are shown with this optional full brick

342
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,720
guard that's what this kind of squared

343
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,240
checkered thing is called up here you

344
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,560
can get it with or without it's an extra

345
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,640
cost to get it with these are 60 inch

346
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,720
tines that we have on here too so that's

347
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,399
an option as well but a very strong very

348
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,480
rugged beefy

349
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,079
set of pallet forks that's never gonna

350
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,560
fail you and here's a quick look at the

351
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,120
5500 pound set this is without that full

352
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,720
brick guard on there so the 5500 and

353
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,399
4200 are pretty similar if you don't

354
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,240
want to get that full brick guard a good

355
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,240
look at it here now one thing you're not

356
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,240
going to see in this video are clamp on

357
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,880
forks for your bucket and i am just not

358
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,800
a big fan of those we we can sell them

359
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,040
but i just choose not to we get a lot of

360
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,800
folks that have had a set of those forks

361
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,320
and just are sick and tired of them and

362
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,000
end up getting a regular set of forks

363
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,000
like what you see here but clamp on

364
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,440
forks yes they are a lot cheaper all

365
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,440
right they're going to clamp onto your

366
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,320
bucket to the bottom edge of your bucket

367
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,000
and so they can oftentimes become loose

368
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,920
and wiggly and wobbly some of them do

369
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,680
have a cross brace section as well which

370
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,600
can can help but it's also going to push

371
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,519
your load point even further out because

372
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,200
they're they're clamping on to the front

373
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,760
edge that leading edge on your bucket so

374
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,600
it's pushing that point way out there

375
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,200
there's a likelihood of potentially

376
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,120
damaging your bucket or bending the

377
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,639
bottom rail of it as well

378
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,320
pallet forks i'm telling you they're one

379
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,040
of the handiest attachments that you can

380
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,639
get for your tractor we sell them all

381
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,240
the time and it's just amazing we talked

382
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,240
about the uses for them but you're

383
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,240
constantly finding ways to use pallet

384
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,680
forks even putting your attachments on

385
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,519
individual pallets then you can shuffle

386
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,519
them around and organize as needed it's

387
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,120
just such a handy attachment to have all

388
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,720
right so these are the fork extensions i

389
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,720
was talking about and we use these

390
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,240
things all the time and so

391
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,440
easy to put on they're pretty

392
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,360
lightweight but they can give you a lot

393
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
of extra length if you need it in a

394
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,279
pinch and you can take them right back

395
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,600
off store them pretty easy too but

396
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
we got these from palletforks.com so

397
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,480
i'll post a link to where you can get

398
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,720
them through there but they're super

399
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,320
easy to put on you can see that that

400
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,079
steel loop that's there you just kind of

401
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,079
tuck that underneath

402
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,399
so it's kind of around the whole

403
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,760
time

404
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,560
slide it back and you might have a

405
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,720
little

406
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,120
play right you can use them with wider

407
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,639
forks as well but these come in super

408
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,600
handy they're pretty cheap i'm sure

409
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,279
they've gone up in price because

410
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,040
everything does since

411
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,560
since we bought them but overall if

412
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,639
you're kind of kicking yourself because

413
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,000
you wish you would have got longer tines

414
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,079
originally up front from wherever you

415
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,720
got your forks this could be a cheaper

416
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,320
way to get a longer set when you need

417
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,920
them in a pinch all right so that's a

418
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,240
lot of information to throw you there

419
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,079
hopefully you found that helpful

420
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,920
again for me i i wouldn't lose a whole

421
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,240
lot of sleep about the the tine length

422
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,800
and jdqa is for john deere quick attach

423
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,399
ssqa for skid steer quick attach you

424
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,880
know you can even use these two thousand

425
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,240
pound rated forks on a kubota tractor

426
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,199
like this one right here you could go up

427
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,800
to the 4200 pound you're not gonna see

428
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,560
you're not going to realize that benefit

429
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,240
for the most part though but if you just

430
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,680
really kind of if you're rough on things

431
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,160
maybe you want to step it up one notch

432
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,920
and go to the 4200 pounds otherwise this

433
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,839
set right here is our standard duty set

434
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,720
that we sell for anything like your your

435
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,360
john deere 3e tractors the 3r the 4

436
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,279
series and then again to the 5 series as

437
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,920
well on your kubota's it's going to be

438
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,240
like the standard l series the grand l

439
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,399
series and then the m series like what

440
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,639
you see here and again the ultralights

441
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,560
these are where it's at for you small

442
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,639

across the country the one thing we get

445
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,800
asked a decent amount is can you get

446
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,240
them with a receiver that's that's built

447
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,480
in you that's welded in here somewhere

448
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,880
and hla does not offer that right now

449
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,279
now i prefer to hook up trailers to the

450
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,639
back side of my tractor so if you're

451
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,959
