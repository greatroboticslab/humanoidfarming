1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Our last speaker for today is Mark

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,960
Storman and he is the chief operating

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,280
officer for

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,280
nutrient. Uh Mark came to this position

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,839
as an outgrowth of his experience with

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,600
with developing and building CG systems.

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,240
Right. Wow. Anorobic digestion CG

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,920
at Fair Oaks. at Ferros and he's

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,560
continuing in that view. Yeah, it's a

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,560
new new name today, but he's he's dealt

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,640
with a lot of other renewable energy

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,840
industry types of things and he's been

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,480
working on that for the last 35 years.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,640
So, with that, I'm going to turn it over

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:44,040
to give give control to

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,040
Mark. Thanks, Jeff.

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,440
I want to just touch on a little bit of

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,920
the question because one of the things

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,199
that we're really working on is at

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,120
nutrient is product orientation. You

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,559
know, you're the question that was asked

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,960
of Jeff is what's important, you know,

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,960
the operating cost or the the what's

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,119
really important is the net cost. And if

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,119
we can't create products that drive

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,960
projects that make product but makes a

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,799
make a profit, we just won't have

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,479
projects. We're just they're not going

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,479
to happen. And that's what we see over

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,240
and over again. So, uh, nutrient was was

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,400
formed because we have this dilemma.

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,600
You've all heard the joke. Two little

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,439
twins, one's a optimist, one's a

34
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,080
pessimist. Well, that's where we're at,

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,080
right? Take him to a psychiatrist.

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,840
Psychiatrist takes the one kid, puts him

37
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,600
in a room full of horsemen, closes the

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,280
door. That'll take care of his optimism.

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,720
Takes the other young man, puts him in a

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,640
room full of toys, and the kid sits

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,159
right down and starts crying. And he's

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,079
like,"Wh are you crying?" And the young

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,040
man says, "Because I know sooner or

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,360
later you're going to take all these

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,280
toys away from me." The psychiatrist

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,360
goes, "I can't believe this." Well, at

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,680
least this other young man cannot have

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,280
found a positive in that room full of

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,560
horse manure. So, he goes to the room

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,560
full of horse manure. He opens the door

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,880
and the kid is having a ball. He is

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,280
throwing manure everywhere. And the

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,360
psychiatrist

54
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,440
goes, "Why are you so happy?" and he's

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,840
like, "If there's this much horse

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,879
manure, there's got to be a pony in here

57
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,400
somewhere." Well, this is kind of the

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,599
situation we're in in the animal

59
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,239
agriculture neighborhood. You've got

60
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,520
optimists and you've got

61
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,400
pessimists. And nutrient is kind of

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,879
formed to help optimists be a little bit

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,360
more realistic, shall we say, and

64
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:36,000
pessimists to be a little less negative,

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:40,400
if we can. We were actually formed by uh

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,480
an group of dairy cooperatives. DMI is

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,879
this this group above the line

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,959
represents about 50% of the milk in the

69
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,040
United States and 50% of the cows. Uh

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,480
DMI and National Milk represent

71
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,560
certainly a larger group and they both

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,560
are on our board. And the idea behind it

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,480
was that the dairy industry didn't

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,120
really have an environmental management

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,640
group that took care of the third M on

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,080
the dairy, the back end of the dairy. Um

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,080
we currently see that we have increased

78
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,879
regulatory pressure, increased

79
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,440
environmental issues, increased societal

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,000
pressure on our producers. But what we'd

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,480
like to see is that we would be solving

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,319
those issues that we would realize

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,920
economic benefits for solving those

84
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,599
issues and that we would become the

85
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,159
producers of choice. Now that doesn't

86
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,640
mean we don't want other but we would

87
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,080
like people to say I wish everybody

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,760
would do it like the dairy community

89
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,599
does and that's what we're trying to

90
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,640
work toward and we're trying to work

91
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:40,000
toward products products that lead to

92
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,239
incentivized projects that increase the

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,720
profits for the dairy mill long-term it

94
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,599
comes down to sustainability is all

95
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,599
about staying in

96
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,599
business. That was a definition that

97
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,560
wasn't listed, but it's all about

98
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,120
staying in business. And so what we've

99
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,879
done is we've asked the question, what

100
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,760
technologies are out there to produce

101
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,879
products? And so we as nutrient were

102
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,439
only formed about 2 years ago, but we

103
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,760
started out by saying, what technologies

104
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,799
are out there? So we were launched in

105
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,040
July of 2015. We formed a technology

106
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,600
team. Um there's there's more of us now

107
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,240
than this select group. And we set out

108
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,240
with the goal to evaluate what

109
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,120
technologies are out there and how can

110
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,520
we put vendors and technologies together

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,199
with dairy farms that need this

112
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,080
technology and how can we help

113
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,680
incentivize both. And so we had to

114
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,759
actually go through a couple iterations.

115
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,919
We we actually launched a SharePoint

116
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,160
site to work internally to be able to

117
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,639
work on our documents. and we we built

118
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,040
out our first edition of our catalog on

119
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,759
that SharePoint site. Um it turned out

120
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,440
to be really too big and too robust like

121
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,840
everything everything grows to fit the

122
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,800
space. So we actually transitioned after

123
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,800
we launched our website to a a computer

124
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
system called Sitecore and then we

125
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,960
launched our beta version to our board

126
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
in November and December and in March

127
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,600
1st we actually launched the nutrient

128
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,680
catalog. If you go to nutrient.com and

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,400
it says catalog up there, you can go to

130
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,000
the nutrient catalog right now. So don't

131
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,160
everybody pull it up on their phones.

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
We're going to stay with the slides, but

133
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,240
afterwards I'll show you what we're

134
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,160
doing. So what did we do to evaluate

135
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,400
technologies? How how do you how do you

136
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,120
go about looking at everything from

137
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,280
anorobic digesttors to slope screens to

138
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,039
generators to CNG stations and things

139
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,440
like that? Well, the first thing we said

140
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,960
is let's let's catalog the technologies

141
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,360
and then let's ask them what their

142
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,360
business is like. So, we created a

143
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,320
business information request and then we

144
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,280
said, okay, that's your business, but do

145
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,400
you have specific technologies that you

146
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,639
sell in your business? And I'm going to

147
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,639
pick on a couple of different different

148
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,160
technology providers. Car's in the room,

149
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,720
so I'll pick on him a little bit because

150
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,240
he deserves it. And then there's other

151
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,000
guys out there. There are people that

152
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,680
sell multiple technologies. As a matter

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
of fact, car's technology breaks down

154
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,960
into two or three different

155
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,600
technologies. So you might have two or

156
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,360
three different pages in the catalog.

157
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,919
You would use the same business

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,759
information. It's not doesn't change his

159
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,600
business, but it does change the

160
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,919
technology and and that's how we make

161
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,319
the information available to people. And

162
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,000
then we wanted to do on-site visits for

163
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,440
those technologies that showed real

164
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,360
promise. We wanted to create a

165
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,280
standardized case study where the

166
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,520
nutrient technology people would go to

167
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,680
the vendor and say, "Take us to your

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,000
site. Take us to somewhere where you can

169
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,520
say, "This is it. This it doesn't get

170
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,560
much better than this if you put that

171
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,880
in." Now, I had an advantage. Car's

172
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,720
Carrie's system at at Fair Oaks is 20

173
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,720
minutes from my house. So, I've been to

174
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,360
his site multiple times and I helped

175
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,800
build the site, but we had an

176
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,639
opportunity to walk through there and

177
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,440
look at it and to talk to people and to

178
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,280
do an evaluation. And then we wrote up a

179
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,800
case study and then we shared that case

180
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,639
study and went back and forth so we

181
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,280
could really document what's happening

182
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,520
there when this works, right? And then

183
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,680
finally, we compiled all this

184
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,759
information, assessed it, and

185
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,160
synthesized it and put it into the

186
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,160
catalog. But then we decided to go one

187
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,599
step further because it's it's one thing

188
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,680
to have a catalog. It's another thing to

189
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,919
actually have information that goes

190
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,759
beyond the catalog. And so what that

191
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,639
team of experts that I showed you on the

192
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,319
first page was is we tried to use a

193
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,759
criteria scale to help make informed

194
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,400
decisions and to make recommendations

195
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,240
about technologies. And and so we

196
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,919
created the nine-point scoring system.

197
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,000
And then we actually created a couple of

198
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,199
different categories to recognize

199
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,039
technologies. And when we say rig

200
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,240
recognized technologies or we we

201
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,880
consider it a technology an emerging

202
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,440
technology, here's the criteria that we

203
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,720
use. Two farmers walk out of the coffee

204
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,160
shop, they walk out, they get to the

205
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,800
front of their truck, and one farmer

206
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,160
says, "Hey, I heard you bought name the

207
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,520
technology." and they lean for five

208
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,199
minutes on the front of somebody's

209
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,879
pickup truck and they talk about that

210
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,440
technology. That's what we're trying to

211
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,199
do. We're not trying to say, "Oh, this

212
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,800
is the technology you have to buy."

213
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,400
We're trying to say, "This is

214
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,560
information you'd like to know about

215
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,680
this

216
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,360
technology." If we're saying it's

217
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,280
emerging, it's probably something you

218
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,680
want to talk a little more about. This

219
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,840
is worth looking at. If it's recognized,

220
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,840
it's probably established. there's

221
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,800
probably a reason that it got to where

222
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,879
it is, but and you should probably

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,279
consider this if you're going to put in

224
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:37,479
that type of system. So certainly if you

225
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,760
have no reason to do clear

226
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,159
water, then you don't want to go to the

227
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,560
nutrient recognized technologies that

228
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,880
produce clean water because you're

229
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,120
unless of course you're just so cash

230
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,160
you'd like to invest in things and try

231
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,080
them. But we're trying to say if you're

232
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,839
going to put in something to get clean

233
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,399
water, then if there's a nutrient

234
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,080
recognized vendor, you should consider

235
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,440
talking to them as part of your

236
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,839
research. So that was the idea behind

237
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,440
the catalog. The nine-point criteria was

238
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,040
actually grew out of a lot of struggle

239
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,839
within our group. Our technology

240
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,600
advancement team, part of us wanted to

241
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,680
just really have numbers like we want to

242
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,480
put everybody's numbers right out there.

243
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,839
But then you have such divergent

244
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,480
technologies that what does a number

245
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,080
mean? I mean, and then another part of

246
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,160
us said, well, let's just be subjective.

247
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,600
Let's just put comments out there. We

248
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,040
didn't really like that either. So, what

249
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,040
we ended up doing was we came up with

250
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,720
this nine-point system. And you can see

251
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,399
they're kind of divided into three

252
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,560
groups. The first group was about

253
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,160
commercial viability. Do you have an

254
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,240
operational history? Do you have third

255
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,440
three systems operating on a dairy farm?

256
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,160
If you do, that goes from white to

257
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,360
brown. Do you have a record of 12 months

258
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,160
of reliability on those three? Another

259
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,640
another point, market penetration. Once

260
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,720
you get 10, you get the third one. And

261
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,920
you can see how it works. Have you in

262
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,839
that business and economic transparency

263
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,000
um technology, have you really explain

264
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,720
what your capex is or is it to be

265
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,480
determined by site? Right?

266
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,560
And we all know that there are

267
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,440
technologies that the price of the

268
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,480
technology depends on who they are

269
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,839
talking to, right?

270
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:25,040
So we try to get as much quantifiable as

271
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,320
we can in those TIS and BIS. We every

272
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,800
everybody's got acronyms, right?

273
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Business information request, BIR,

274
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,760
technology information request,

275
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,600
TIR, operation and maintenance cost. And

276
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,519
then

277
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,600
um we actually switched these around

278
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,839
because we did we wanted this value

279
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,240
proposition with the economics. But the

280
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,079
value proposition doesn't have to

281
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,680
necessarily be

282
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,279
dollars. It's value to the farm. And

283
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,200
I'll give you Fair Oaks is a great

284
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,839
example. When I first started working

285
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,640
for Fair Oaks, there wasn't a single

286
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,880
dig. There were nine dairy farms. Almost

287
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,000
not drive down I65. The smell was so

288
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,880
bad. And people weren't liking it. Local

289
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,800
people were upset. Over the next five

290
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:14,959
years, every digtor near the highway put

291
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,120
in an anorobic digesttor. 100% almost

292
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,200
30,000 cows going into anorobic

293
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:25,040
digesttor. You didn't smell

294
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:27,279
it. If we had tried to build a tent farm

295
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,279
without those digesttors, we' have never

296
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,959
got a permit. County wouldn't have

297
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:35,680
issued it. We had had

298
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:37,839
riots. Now we built a visitor center,

299
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,160
actually four visitor centers, and a

300
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,040
half a million people a year visit the

301
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,880
Fair Oaks Farms agurism

302
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:51,560
site. Completely different

303
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:55,760
situation. Did did the

304
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:58,720
digesttors add value? Absolutely. Can

305
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,279
you quantitize the odor reduction value?

306
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,920
No. we were able to expand. We were able

307
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,480
to build other businesses around it. And

308
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,600
then finally, real quickly, those um

309
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,959
vendor information sharing and business

310
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,959
technology information, those case

311
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,800
studies I referred to. And then the last

312
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,880
part is through constant contact, we

313
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,880
actually allow the vendors to reach out

314
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,120
to their customers, to the people

315
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,880
they've sold systems to and ask for a

316
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,639
rating. And the rating is very simple.

317
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,720
On a scale of 1 to 10, would you

318
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:31,040
recommend this technology to another

319
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,639
farmer? And why? That's it. You get over

320
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,200
seven from three of your vendors, you

321
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,800
get that last

322
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,120
point. So, this is a mockup of the

323
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,120
catalog real quickly because every time

324
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,120
I go out and do this, I try to do it

325
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,959
online, right, to actually show you the

326
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,360
catalog and every time there's a

327
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,120
technical D. So, I doing this on the

328
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,040
slide and then I actually have it pulled

329
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,399
up and it's working on Google. So, if

330
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,959
you want to look at it live, we can do

331
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,480
that afterwards. But basically the first

332
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,680
thing you do is you sign on to the

333
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,600
technology and it gives you an

334
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,680
explanation of how the thing works and

335
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,200
it gives you criteria that you may want

336
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,320
to use. And when you say you type in

337
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,200
tried it or you click on nutrient

338
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,680
recognized technologies it would fill in

339
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,839
here in what we call the landing page

340
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,680
all of the technologies that met your

341
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,680
criteria. So you can do very in-depth

342
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,360
searches there or you can just hit I

343
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,800
want to see all technologies and it pops

344
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,800
up 17 pages and 178 some technologies.

345
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,880
Right now when you click on the

346
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,560
individual pages you go to the

347
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,560
technology page and I'm going to

348
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,160
actually get a little bit more into

349
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,560
that. This is what happened when we um

350
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,279
taking it for a test drive when I put in

351
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,279
the category nutrient recognized. These

352
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,360
are the two that popped up right now.

353
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,639
Part of that is because we're still in

354
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,519
the process of getting a lot of the

355
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:55,680
material done. So this is the DVO what

356
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,240
we all have come to know as mixed

357
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,600
complete mixed digtor or mixed plug flow

358
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,680
digtor. And this is the mlina hand sand

359
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,040
separators. Two established technologies

360
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,880
lots of history. You know those were

361
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,800
done fairly early on because we did a

362
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,040
lot of testing with them. I could have

363
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,680
also clicked on emerging technologies in

364
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,120
Udys and carry system there and also a

365
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,440
couple of other systems. You've heard of

366
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,240
the Vanguard business model. That's

367
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,760
another one. But here is where you you'd

368
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,519
click on one of these and then you'd

369
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,240
move on. And I just happen to use the

370
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,000
Mlanahan sand separation because it

371
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,440
didn't really apply as much to the

372
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,079
individual. So we can talk about the

373
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,720
website, not the technology. But there's

374
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,320
the company description. the company

375
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,880
description, all of this information on

376
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,199
this half of the page. Nutrient through

377
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,760
the technology team and the leadership

378
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,680
they provide works to develop all of

379
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,440
this information with the vendor. So

380
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,839
there's a brief company description, a

381
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,480
picture of the technology, a description

382
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,560
of the technology, all of their contact

383
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,279
information, if they've got a YouTube

384
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,440
site, a LinkedIn site, a Facebook site,

385
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,440
everything they might want to put there.

386
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,839
These are the categories that they fall

387
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,800
in. And then business information,

388
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:12,519
equipment insights, photo links, video

389
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,160
links, case studies, all go right

390
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:18,000
here below the

391
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,480
fold. This is our little box for the

392
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,680
lawyers, the legal disclaimer that says

393
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,360
all of the things that anyone says a

394
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,120
lot. It basically says that we got this

395
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,760
from public information. We're not going

396
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,399
to defame anybody and stuff like that.

397
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,959
Below the line, we have basic

398
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:39,040
information. If there is a if it's a

399
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,959
standard system for say slope screens or

400
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,800
solid separation, there might be a

401
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,360
little description of what the big

402
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,360
process

403
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,480
does. And then there's actually

404
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,720
specifics to let you know and understand

405
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,759
what the technology advancement team

406
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,360
understands about that technology. And

407
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,680
then you can real quickly look at this.

408
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,839
And of course with a pointer it's not

409
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,920
moused over but when you mouse over it

410
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,000
it actually explains to you which of

411
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,000
these categories are you click in the

412
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,800
center of that score you end up knowing

413
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,600
what the final is what it'll take you to

414
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,560
a page where it explains

415
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,079
everything. I'm going to share with you

416
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,079
that we're actually continuing to work

417
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,920
on this. This is a suspended solid. So

418
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,920
here's that little kind of table of what

419
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,560
the technology is like. We're kind of

420
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,360
working on a way

421
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,519
to add a add a criteria at the

422
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,959
technology level that would help people

423
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:38,160
see how these would perform on your

424
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:40,560
farm. So for example, you would have N

425
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,639
recovery, P recovery, greenhouse gas

426
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,800
reduction, storage reduction, odor

427
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,079
reduction, and pathogen reduction. How

428
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,800
does this perform to the baseline for a

429
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,279
flush dairy, a dry lot dairy, or a

430
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,600
scrape dairy? And so that a farmer could

431
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,360
very quickly see, oh that that I'm a

432
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,160
flush. That's not going to do anything

433
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,920
for me. Now, I just made that up. These

434
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,600
are just mocked up because we haven't

435
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,679
gotten through that process. That's a

436
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,720
process we're working on to take it to

437
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,720
the next

438
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,720
level. Questions?

439
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,280
How much does it cost for a vendor to be

440
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,520
out there? Nothing. How much does it

441
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,839
cost for a producer to go there?

442
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,000
Nothing. They do have to put in their

443
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,400
name and their email address. So, how do

444
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,880
you pay for all this? We are funded out

445
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,280
of a very small check off portion from

446
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,240
those 12 dairy cooperatives and some

447
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,320
money from DMI. And and this portion,

448
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,039
just so that people kind of understand,

449
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,880
DMI is checkoff dollars. This portion

450
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,200
primarily is checkoff dollars because

451
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,039
it's all pre-ompetitive. It's all done

452
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,000
on a very non-competitive. We're just

453
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:49,600
evaluating technologies that are out

454
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,640
there basis.

455
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Jordan, uh, do you when you like when

456
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,360
you get numbers the pathogen removal and

457
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,120
things like that, how where do those

458
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,600
numbers come from? What we're what we're

459
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,000
in the process of doing right now is

460
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,559
having those discussions. The idea is

461
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,120
that we would start by quantifying

462
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,919
what's out there in peer-reviewed

463
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,840
literature, what's out there in

464
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,320
thirdparty validated literature, and

465
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,840
then we'll probably end up going to ex

466
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,760
putting together a room full of people

467
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,280
like this to get expert opinion for

468
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,520
those missing gaps. But that process is

469
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,760
actually we launched this in March. So

470
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,400
that's kind of the discussion around

471
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,000
version 2.0. That probably won't happen

472
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,880
till next year sometime. That I mean

473
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,640
that would seem quite expensive as the

474
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,280
trouble coordinators always have with

475
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,840
creating paintings is

476
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,840
it is it is quite expensive and and part

477
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,679
of the reason that we can do this is we

478
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,200
have distributed and work with a lot of

479
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,360
consultants. We don't have a lot of

480
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,840
full-time employees but we do try to get

481
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,400
a lot accomplished. So let's go to Bill

482
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,000
and then we'll get Jeremy. So, uh, you

483
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,840
heard Jeff say that the producer wants

484
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,760
to go to capital cost. Um, in your in

485
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,840
your model, your online form is for

486
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,320
Mlanahan, for example, is there

487
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,640
something in there that that gives you

488
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,320
cost for we ask we ask specifically if

489
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,679
they have if in the technical

490
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,720
information, if you click on that,

491
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,160
you'll download a PDF. It's 17 pages

492
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,679
long. It asks things like what kind of

493
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,200
water connection do you need? what kind

494
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,760
of power connection do you need? And it

495
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,280
asks specifically, what is the capital

496
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,000
cost of this equipment? And is it

497
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:33,799
scalable? So, for instance, somebody

498
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
might say, our system for 1,000 cows is

499
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,799
$500,000. I'm just making up numbers

500
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,919
right now. And it's scalable up, but not

501
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,960
down. This is as small as we make it.

502
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,200
So, again, it depends on the technology.

503
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,160
And that's why we've we've talked about

504
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,240
in this in this model having some sort

505
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,000
of

506
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,919
quantifiable, you know, idea of what the

507
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,360
impact is. We've actually even talked

508
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,280
about on the outside edges putting in

509
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,480
capital cost and operating cost and just

510
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,720
doing something like you see in a

511
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,280
restaurant of $1 sign to $4 signs. But

512
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,440
you know, it's very difficult to do

513
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,480
because something might be a very high

514
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,559
capital cost but very low operating cost

515
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,400
and that might work fine for somebody

516
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,799
because it's so it's a one-time

517
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,200
commitment and I can get a equip grant

518
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,520
to help cover the cost. I'll put it in.

519
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,120
So it that becomes really tricky when

520
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,559
you start dealing with relative cost of

521
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,559
technologies from anorobic digestion

522
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,640
down to a slope screen. Yeah, that was

523
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,039
another Yeah, let's go to Jeremy. Um

524
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,000
well this might be pretty quick. Um so

525
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,000
you mentioned like 178 so far in there.

526
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,960
It looks like I'm assuming these are all

527
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,120
onfarm systems or are there dairy based

528
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,280
technologies that would be centralized

529
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,159
or mobile that work across multiple

530
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,760
operations? There are a few centralized

531
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,200
and mobile systems. This this is

532
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,200
actually because it did work. This is

533
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,880
the actual page. So you can see here's

534
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,000
how it works and those sort of things.

535
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,440
And what I'm going to do just

536
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,799
to what I'm going to do if I can get the

537
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,320
mouse to work for me is I I'll just

538
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:14,480
quickly take you to the

539
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,480
uh all technology so you see how it pops

540
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,440
up. So you get about 10 10 pages if if

541
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,840
we haven't been able to validate the

542
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,280
information on the top page. So we build

543
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,200
these websites out of the publicly

544
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,360
available information, but we do put a

545
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,400
signal on it if it's not validated yet.

546
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,679
So like makes a gas upgrading system. So

547
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,159
but we haven't been able to get a hold

548
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,080
of them to validate all the numbers and

549
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,559
and the information that's there and get

550
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,000
a BIR and TI. So we just put that as a

551
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,919
flag up there. It's there's nothing

552
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,440
wrong with it. It's just we're still in

553
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,559
the process of working on it. But

554
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,000
there's about 17 pages like that. Got

555
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,240
two questions and we're going to have to

556
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
wrap it up. So Mark, but I'm willing to

557
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,520
stay and if you want to see stuff, we'll

558
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,120
play with it. But you guys are all free

559
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,840
to go after the next two. These two

560
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,919
questions. Just to follow up on the on

561
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,000
the cost in and and maybe uh on that

562
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,200
where you're where you're going back and

563
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,280
making some judgment calls on that. Is

564
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,880
there going to be an opportunity to then

565
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,720
to for your ex your panel or experts or

566
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,000
whatever to say is that a realistic

567
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,559
cost? Because if if the technology

568
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,480
provider they're giving a c cost for the

569
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,159
piece of equipment, they're not

570
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,559
necessarily going to be saying what's it

571
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,120
going to cost to retrofit that into your

572
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,520
existing system. So we we definitely

573
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,000
again remember the goal is you're

574
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,159
leaning on your pickup truck. Should I

575
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,640
call this vendor or not? So we're not

576
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,880
trying to replace any vendor. I mean if

577
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,880
you ask me should I call them?

578
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,480
Absolutely you should. But what I'm

579
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,880
trying to do is help guide you in a

580
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:54,000
direction. And so, you know, if if it

581
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,919
looks to us like there may have been

582
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,760
issues with a technology, then as

583
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,679
politely as we can without saying don't

584
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,159
call these people, we say make sure you

585
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,039
ask about reliability. You know, have

586
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:08,880
this discussion with the vendor, right?

587
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:11,200
So, and your idea what's too high a cost

588
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,120
and my idea might be different. And so

589
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
we're just trying to get the information

590
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,039
out there. We're trying to be very fair

591
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,960
to the vendors and the people who are

592
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,799
providing the technologies. At the same

593
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,960
time, we're probably trying to add value

594
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,280
to the dairy farmer who may be looking

595
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,159
at these technologies.

596
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,640
Nick, do you evaluate um only US

597
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,720
companies or is it other? What we've

598
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,480
done, and there's a few exceptions in

599
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,440
here, but what we've done is we've only

600
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,200
looked at US dairy installations. Now,

601
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,919
there are a few companies that have

602
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,000
joined with us that seem to have good

603
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,720
technologies that have promised for use

604
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,039
in the United States that have not yet

605
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,880
been able to find someone. What happens

606
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,799
in those cases is we'll put in the

607
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,960
comments that this has not been

608
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,440
evaluated using the nine-point system

609
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,880
because it's not operational on a dairy,

610
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,760
but the technology looks like it could

611
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,280
work. So until you actually have

612
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,559
something on a dairy, we're not going to

613
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,919
do an evaluation because even though it

614
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,240
even though you have 10 of them in

615
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,760
Italy, I'm not familiar with the I mean,

616
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,679
I'd love to go and spend a few weeks

617
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,520
studying the dairy practices of Italy,

618
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,279
don't get me wrong, but I'm not familiar

619
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,679
enough with it to say that that's going

620
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,279
to be transferable.

621
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,080
Does that make sense? Let's give it We

622
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,080
might close it off from there.
