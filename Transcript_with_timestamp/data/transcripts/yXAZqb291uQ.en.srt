00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,629
hey folks it's Josh Danny rich farmer

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,370
welcome to the farm blog today got my

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,600
best kid helper here she's filling

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,280
buckets of water we're gonna go up and

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,139
what are the goats and check on them got

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,320
a few chores to get done here around the

7
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,630
house I've got to put a light on my gate

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,980
so when folks pull up to my gate I have

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,140
a power gate that's powered with a

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,510
mighty Mill gate opener and I really

11
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,460
like it but the biggest thing is we can

12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,990
hit the button from the house up here

13
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,699
but you can't tell whether the gates

14
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,590
moving or not after dark so what we're

15
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,210
gonna do is we're gonna install a motion

16
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,309
light on it and you guys might have seen

17
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,500
the video where I installed some motion

18
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,300
lights on the house back here and they

19
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,190
turned out to be really really good so

20
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,750
come on along with just do some chores

21
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,610
here we've got to work on the rock wall

22
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,649
behind the house got to pick up loads of

23
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,420
rocks and sticks and also we still got

24
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,230

34
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:18,440
[Music]

35
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,660
so first let's give you a little update

36
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,040
on the lights okay so I'll put some

37
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,930
lights here on the house and now I'm in

38
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,520
between my house and my garage and I'll

39
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,940
put these lights they're called litem

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,530
lights home brand Li t om they really

41
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,970
worked well I liked them a lot

42
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,260
I put them all the way around the house

43
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,940
there's a couple up there it's really

44
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,260
bright you probably can't see them and I

45
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,150
really liked them a whole lot they

46
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,190
really did a good job and the company

47
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,930
actually saw that I installed those

48
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,940
lights and they said Stoney Ridge farmer

49
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,650
we've got a newer version of that light

50
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,420
we'd like to send it to you and let you

51
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,790
show it on the vlog so here's the newer

52
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,619
version I I've got the box with all the

53
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,210
specs on it but this is the light that

54
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:54,830
we're gonna put on the gate and we're

55
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,140
gonna put one down here on this sign

56
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,580
that I have posted that says smile your

57
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,619
own camera that way when people pull

58
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,170
down my road that thing lights up and

59
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:05,660
they're like maybe maybe I shouldn't be

60
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,080
here get all the water's ready they're

61
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,640
ready

62
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,520
somebody nice-looking shirt you got

63
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,260
there thank you self-promotion it's not

64
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,620
nice it's not a nice thing to do on

65
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:18,709
YouTube everybody hates that Josh so

66
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,600
pretty out right now so beautiful we got

67
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:24,350
some new rock put down on our road up to

68
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,520
the goats and it looks very nice very

69
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,380
nice

70
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,930
got a baby goat to catch and we get to

71
00:02:28,380 --> 00:03:06,360
watch miss the Stoney Ridge catching

72
00:02:29,930 --> 00:03:08,640
ready ready to catch him better and I

73
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:20,430
think he's a little calmer poor little

74
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:21,270
bit don't have any top two goats only

75
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,910
have bottom teeth

76
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:27,150
the bigger issue we have here guys is we

77
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:30,570
have too many goats in too small an area

78
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,240
and it's taxing on the goats its taxing

79
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,800
on us and we need to sell some goats so

80
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,600
if any of you guys are local and you're

81
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,610
interested in buying some goats we're

82
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,750
gonna sell off probably four or five six

83
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,340
of them something like that because I

84
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:46,710
think we're at about 20 goats right now

85
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:48,120
we just don't need that many goats so

86
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,740
we've got the ladder all loaded up in

87
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,750
the back here we're gonna go down to the

88
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,700
gate and we're gonna install this light

89
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,960
right here so while the gates closed in

90
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,810
here here's the product that I'm

91
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,150
installing it's the light tom 30 LED

92
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,250
motion light this is what it looks like

93
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,990
pretty pretty neat little design there

94
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,640
so I'll post a link down below if you

95
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,440
want to get some for yourself the other

96
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,270
ones work great I haven't used these yet

97
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,440
so I'll be honest with you I don't know

98
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,580
exactly how they're gonna work but I

99
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,170
know they're really bright because we

100
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,310
use them in the living room as motion

101
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,780
lights when we walk through the living

102
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,790
room at night and it worked really good

103
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,220
let's get busy so the challenge here is

104
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,900
to mount this light somewhere on the

105
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,550
back of this wooden sign because I don't

106
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,200
want to screw it into my metal gate this

107
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,000
thing will light up and let us know hey

108
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,290
I hit the button I'm up at the house I

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,580
hit the button and the gate started

110
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,730
moving because the light came on and

111
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,410
I'll know trying to figure out the

112
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,210
smartest way to mount this thing so if

113
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,740
you look it's just a little loop a

114
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,720
little hook right there and the screw is

115
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,610
right here and it just hangs OH

116
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,130
that screw pretty simple we'll see

117
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,620
they're not to be perfect just needs to

118
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,720
be perfect

119
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:53,790
timber dropping screws in the driveway

120
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,550
is not a good thing okay well we got to

121
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,800
turn it on here's how you turn it on

122
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:03,510
little button right there

123
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:05,160
find that sweet spot there we go so

124
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,690
since it's on a moving target I want to

125
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,220
make sure it's nice and secure you know

126
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,050
a moving target meaning the gate moves

127
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,820
all the time a mounting system on this

128
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,990
is really really really simple and I

129
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,430
guess if you're mounting it up to the

130
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,140
side of your house it would be just fine

131
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,820
or a tree which is what we're gonna do

132
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,770
next I'll worry about it shaking loose

133
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,020
and getting on my nerves and not being

134
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,530
level and not being pretty right I think

135
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,330
that'll work

136
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,800
so we'll try it out tonight I don't know

137
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,120
if I'll try it out on camera tonight but

138
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,680
we'll let you know in the future vlog

139
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,090
how it's doing I think it'll do just

140
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,560
fine so when you live in a country like

141
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,600
this we don't have a lot of neighbors

142
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,700
and people used to come down here and

143
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,020
park so before all the trees were gone

144
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,090
right here people would come down here

145
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,910
and park and do things that they

146
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,380
shouldn't be doing and you know people

147
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,970
still ride down here from time to time

148
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,919
that aren't welcome so having some

149
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,360
lights it's probably the best security

150
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,880
measure you could ever do around your

151
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,040
house or around your farm or anywhere

152
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,680
having lights when those lights come on

153
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,419
criminals they don't stick around so

154
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,910
right here's my fairly threatening smile

155
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,669
you're on camera sign if you guys didn't

156
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,520
know it Amazon's got a plethora I would

157
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:07,290
say a plethora of signs like this that

158
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,820
are just threatening to keep people off

159
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,310
your property signs it's a

160
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,930
closed-circuit camera system all sorts

161
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,270
of stuff and we've also got some cameras

162
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,490
up here if you can see them

163
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,260
let's see right there yeah so we've got

164
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,300
some cameras up here we keep track of

165
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,100
everything that goes in the road and out

166
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,540
of the road so if you come down here on

167
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,280
my property and something comes up

168
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,680
missing I got your license plate but

169
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,940
that's it so let's back up to this tree

170
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,870
I'm just gonna back the Gator right up

171
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,090
to it

172
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:38,360
good thing about John Deere Gator has

173
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,770
this plastic bed which you know plastic

174
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,870
bed wouldn't really sound too appealing

175
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,729
but I can bump into something with it

176
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,960
and not dent it so that's kind of nice

177
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:46,960
we're gonna bump right into that tree

178
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,450
here we go so for this next light

179
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,520
install we're gonna use a deck screw a

180
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,570
nice heavy-duty deck screw they'll just

181
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:06,830
hang up there just like that

182
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:09,080
pretty simple beauty cool just that

183
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,000
simple just that simple to install super

184
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,470
awesome I don't illuminate that sign

185
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,330
right there we got the sign kind of

186
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,890
flopping loose of this tree can grow a

187
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,780
little bit and I also left a little bit

188
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,250
of room for tree growth on that screw I

189
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,960
left it hanging out a little bit further

190
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,420
got my own little department of homeland

191
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,280
security here I think about living out

192
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,350
here in the country like this is when

193
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,120
seconds count the cops get here in

194
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,500
minutes we got to pretty much defend

195
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,660
ourselves and take care of ourselves out

196
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,810
here beautiful beautiful day today guys

197
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:39,710
the grass that we planted in the fall is

198
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:42,020
coming up so pretty look at this look at

199
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,790
that what a great stand of grass we did

200
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,230
all the right things the only thing we

201
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,210
could have done differently is the soil

202
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,980
is really acidic here so we probably

203
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,200
could have put a little bit of lime down

204
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,760
but once the soil gets compacted a

205
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,530
little bit we'll be able to bring a big

206
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,750
lime truck in here will spread lime

207
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,270
probably three tons to the acre maybe

208
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,130
even four tons of lime to the acre this

209
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,410
is what you call a lead in a lead into

210
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,210
tomorrow's vlog so I've got two more

211
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,850
loads of gravel coming out I had five

212
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,440
loads brought out and this is the result

213
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,760
of the gravel truck

214
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,560
I'll get the drone out and I'll show you

215
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,130
a little bit of tractor work here on the

216
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,780
driveway

217
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,280
and give you a little bit of driveway

218
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,650
science if you want to know a little bit

219
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,230
about how to maintain and keep a nice

220
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:23,540
driveway so 32 more tons of rock brought

221
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,430
out tomorrow and I want to expand this a

222
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,050
little bit as you can tell I've got a

223
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,640
lot of vehicles I want to be able to

224
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,410
come through here with a big ol trailer

225
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,410
and turn around and not have any trouble

226
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:39,950
last hole I'm gonna drill my dogs are

227
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,540
out here eating deer turds like grazing

228
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,460
on deer turds right now I think the

229
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,780
puppy loves to poop on the porch at

230
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,310
night so we keep them up on the porch at

231
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,630
night since my dogs ate my neighbor's

232
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,430
cat we keep them up on the porch at

233
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,560
night and I just totally look forward to

234
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,810
cleaning up doggie diarrhea later on

235
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,190
because they're 20-something deer every

236
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,870
night in this field and they're out

237
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,620
there the dogs are out there grazing on

238
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,830
deer poo

239
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,140
here's your farm reality right there

240
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,880
dogs grazing on here

241
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,140
you know it's not a good job unless

242
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,000
you're bleeding when you get done so

243
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,330
hopefully I have some blood drawn here

244
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,950
in a minute

245
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,420
oh well piece of heaven right there you

246
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,470
got my light these lights are so small I

247
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,270
can put them in our pocket really nice

248
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:25,900
then a little bit loose tighten it back

249
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:28,540
up a little bit nice nicely done the

250
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,730
solar panels are right here this is Wes

251
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,620
this is south so I want to get just

252
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,780
enough Sun and then when I walk in here

253
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,370
to access my tractor and everything like

254
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,750
that I'll be able to see so we're gonna

255
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,380
do another one just like this on the

256
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,510
other side

257
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,790
that's it we give you an example of what

258
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,080
it looks like lit so that's the light

259
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,390
that's how much light this thing puts

260
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,270
out I think it's 30 LED lights in there

261
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,590
very nice danger bush hog danger right

262
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,170
there that thing was sticking out of the

263
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,340
ground yeah if you go to clear land this

264
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,440
is the kind of stuff that you're gonna

265
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,710
be finding when you clear your land

266
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,910
people just use any old gully as just a

267
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:05,740
dumping ground and cinder block pieces

268
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,570
Pepsi is that Pepsi free this is what

269
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,220
you find just garbage so there's a lot

270
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,810
of garbage out of here it's a shame

271
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,100
back in the day people didn't go to the

272
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,170
dump and people didn't have trash

273
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,610
service they had a hole that's what they

274
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,260
did they threw it in there some of you

275
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,300
