  "text": "Whether you contact your local Extension\nOffice for a problem in your yard or garden or you're working with a new\nlandscaper on a landscape project, one of the first recommendations is going to\nbe to have a soil test done. Once you've taken the samples they'll\nsend back description of what they find in those soil tests. Those soil tests will\ngive you your basic pH, the electrical conductivity, whether you have lime in\nyour soils, soil texture, and give you some basic information about nutrients\nand organic matter. One of the things that your soil test\nwill tell you is that you have high salts or electrical conductivity in your\nsoil, and in Wyoming most of our pH tends to be high in the alkaline range. The organic matter is something that you\ndo have a lot of control in and if your organic matter is low we would recommend\nthat you use compost manure, anything that was plant material to amend your\nsoil. And then it will give you information on the nutrient levels in\nyour soil. Nitrate is really important for plant growth Phosphorus is important for root growth.\nPotassium is going to be really important for the overall health of the\nplants in your garden. If you need help in determining what\nthose soil sample results mean you can have a copy sent to your local Extension\noffice for details on your soil sample.
