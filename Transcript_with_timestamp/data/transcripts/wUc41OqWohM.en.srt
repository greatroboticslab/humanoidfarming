[Music]

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:22,559
so

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:22,559
[Music]

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,920
hello thank you so much for clicking on

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,000
this video i really appreciate it

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,840
spring is in the air here in southern

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,719
spain that's all i can say

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,200
we've had some seriously dull and wet

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,880
days

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,239
but every time there is a beautiful

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,640
sunny day it is

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,000
warmer than one would expect for this

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,879
time of year

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,719
but i love it i love it and along with

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,840
the warmth

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,000
come the pests the baby pests

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
or the adults that in the autumn have

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,960
laid all their eggs

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,320
on my orchids and then depending on what

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,879
kind of orchid it is

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,239
they either hatch and thrive and destroy

22
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,720
my orchids

23
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,680
or they just go on their merry way and

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,920
find something else to use as a buffet

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,240
and what you see here is my dendrobium

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,040
nephrits alex pauli

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,799
and the damage of a pest that i have

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,720
here in my area

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,320
which is a moth larvae which is my newt

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,759
and the eggs go on to new growths

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,000
old growths it is not fussy

32
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,280
where it puts its eggs and you can

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,479
hardly see

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,200
the damage happening because that little

35
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,759
let me say bugger is so tiny

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,600
that its eggs and its larvae are a

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,479
fraction of that and for me

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,680
at least not visible to the naked eye

39
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,640
this is a dead one

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,040
thank goodness but this is a culprit

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,680
that is doing damage and it is always

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,040
going

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,000
for my dendrobium types and i am quite

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,360
frankly

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,920
fed up i have tried several insecticides

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,040
also

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,840
on a soap basis and yeah check this out

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,840
that is just

49
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,560
that's that you know i'm i'm lucky that

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,840
i

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,239
i can manage to save this one

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,080
but all my den files went downhill

53
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,760
because every time they tried to produce

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,680
a new growth

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,440
there was already eggs or something

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,319
lodged in those new growths and they

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,000
didn't develop

58
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,400
anywhere beyond what they should have

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,239
done so in the bin with the denfalls

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,080
so it has attacked other dendrobiums

61
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,440
and it looks like it could be spider

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,920
mite damage but it's not

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,160
it really isn't i never wipe off and

64
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,599
have anything orange on me it's

65
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,160
it's this flipping moth larvae so the

66
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,640
insecticidal soap i can wipe the leaves

67
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,720
down

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,280
i have made a mistake to sometimes wipe

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,200
them down during the day because

70
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,959
that is when i have time and at night

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,840
you never know if it's going to be

72
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,640
too cold at this time of year to have

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
wet leaves

74
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,760
but during the day was a big mistake

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,640
because it

76
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,400
affects the stomata and the stomata on

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,239
the dendrobiums are open

78
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,879
during the day so i am going to give

79
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,159
credit to

80
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,440
a channel called orgyplanet spanish

81
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,120
channel i believe he's

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,840
adrian is in ecuador and he recently put

83
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,519
up a video

84
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:31,040
saying he uses or shows that the use of

85
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,840
garlic for pests on the orchids

86
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,080
and i was like okay i looked up the

87
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,959
components and things and properties of

88
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,760
garlic

89
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,799
to see what that was all about and read

90
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,000
up about

91
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,840
the allium sativan leaf lecithin which

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,680
is a

93
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,400
protein highly anti-nutritional and

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,000
toxic to some insects

95
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,080
aphids snails and then it talked about

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,040
larvae and the mealy beetle the meli

97
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,439
beetle has

98
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,159
larvae and when those are placed by the

99
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,439
adults

100
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,959
on the plant it will hatch at such a

101
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,720
time when the temperatures start to

102
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,640
become a little bit more conducive to

103
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,760
its survival

104
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,360
and start to have a sucking effect on

105
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,239
the membrane and the tissue of the

106
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,479
leaves

107
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,440
and again it doesn't distinguish all the

108
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,400
new growths

109
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,040
when i hear larvae i think of my moth

110
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,440
larvae

111
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,720
and i am going to give this a go and i

112
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,280
want to talk through

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,280
my preparation process to get this up

114
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,199
and running and ready for use

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,919
the essential oils in the garlic

116
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,199
is not apparently just nice for gambas

117
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,440
peel peel

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,919
or pasta alioli or anything like that

119
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,800
it is good for pests and i'm gonna go

120
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,040
for it

121
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,840
that includes spider mites and i think i

122
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,120
already mentioned

123
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:56,080
aphids i'm not sure spider mites aphids

124
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:59,520
anything to do with a larvae and snails

125
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:03,039
so let us prepare some concoctions

126
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,680
because based on my research recently

127
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,880
i've also noticed that it is good for as

128
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,360
a fungicide

129
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,840
with a different preparation but we'll

130
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,840
give it a go

131
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,400
so i'm going to consider that the asl

132
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,840
which is the alien sativum leaflet

133
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,960
citing

134
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:27,199
found in garlic as part of a protein and

135
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,479
the corresponding essential oils

136
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,720
i'm going to hedge my bets now and

137
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,880
try and do this and see if it works

138
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,639
because i need to make sure that my

139
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,240
dendrobiums

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,320
and some of my epiderm crosses

141
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,759
are showing similar signs that they are

142
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,960
protected

143
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,919
now i have here five

144
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,800
cloves of garlic and yes i'm just

145
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,120
putting all the

146
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
skin and everything on the floor because

147
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,479
hey

148
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,520
if it repels insects and repels

149
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,800
larvae and all that from feeding

150
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:11,039
and sucking out the

151
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,240
um the juices of the growths

152
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,680
the leaves the tissue this is going

153
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,840
on the floor so maybe i can start the

154
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,840
process in the garden at some point

155
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,680
but to my understanding

156
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,280
there is no harm to be doing this on the

157
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,800
orchids

158
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,400
during the day it is natural

159
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,639
and it is also used in many many

160
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,840
pesticides the only time

161
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:46,960
that i have heard about this was on

162
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:50,319
adrienne's channel so for

163
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,400
the pesticide that i'm preparing here

164
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,759
i'm just going to chop up small pieces

165
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,160
of garlic

166
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,479
but enough that you get a good

167
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,319
concentration

168
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,479
i wouldn't puree it because it's going

169
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,160
to go into a

170
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:10,240
pump spray so no puree just the pieces

171
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,599
you want the essential oils to come out

172
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,360
and leech into the solution

173
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,039
so i'm just making these pieces small

174
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,639
enough so that i can fill them

175
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:24,319
into my little pump spray

176
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,400
which is a beautiful beautiful container

177
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,000
this can be clear or whatever i just

178
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,599
don't go and buy something new my

179
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,720
daughter helped me find something to

180
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,840
recycle

181
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,039
this was a little bit of a body spray

182
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,400
from douglas very delicious but i

183
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,039
cleaned it out and it is now

184
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,639
my pump spray because i needed a measure

185
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,919
of a hundred milliliters

186
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,240
so the color doesn't matter if you don't

187
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,000
like

188
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,759
this color you can go with clear it

189
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,120
doesn't have to be opaque that's got

190
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,560
nothing to do

191
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,240
with how the solution is going to react

192
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,240
over time

193
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:07,520
100 milliliters though is the measure

194
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,919
and i have on the bottom here

195
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,599
already 30 percent of the little

196
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,160
container

197
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,080
filled with just plain ro water it

198
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,319
doesn't have to be ro water if you have

199
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,440
soft water in the home

200
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,400
please use that that's fine but i have

201
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,240
water in here because i only have 96

202
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,440
percent of pure alcohol so i am just

203
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,800
bringing it down to 70

204
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,839
so isopropyl alcohol 70

205
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,000
that is what you want

206
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,680
and that is why i put water in first in

207
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,719
order to to dilute

208
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,719
my alcohol

209
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,560
let's get that on there so we avoid

210
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,360
evaporation

211
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,920
this should be my pesticide in 24 hours

212
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,399
leave it refrigerated because you don't

213
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,480
want

214
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,680
the garlic to degrade become moldy or

215
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,519
fungus so

216
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,640
it is organic and you want to leave this

217
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,560
for at least three to six hours 24 hours

218
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,320
is the best though and then you have

219
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,360
yourself a wonderful garlic solution

220
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,519
which next day

221
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,600
you spray onto the orchid

222
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,080
right now it's obviously not going to

223
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,880
work but for the point of demonstration

224
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:31,920
that is what you do 70 isopropyl alcohol

225
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,519
enough garlic on the bottom i used five

226
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,440
small cloves if you have one big one

227
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,760
that is fine as well i don't believe

228
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,600
that any kind of concentration is of any

229
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,880
harm whatsoever but you want the

230
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,440
components

231
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,080
at least to give them plenty of time to

232
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,760
dissolve

233
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,880
and ooze into the alcohol and become

234
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,839
your solution so this is going to go

235
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,519
into the fridge

236
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,600
and tomorrow because it's going to be a

237
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,800
sunny day i'm going for it

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,880
got to try this i don't want to have

239
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,200
any new growths that are already

240
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,320
starting right here

241
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,760
become targets when i see something

242
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,800
black like that

243
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,800
i get suspicious

244
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,760
so that's coming off and i believe i

245
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,880
already started

246
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,880
it has already started because look

247
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,040
there we go that's already one point of

248
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,399
destruction right there

249
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,240
so it is already happening this is high

250
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,880
noon

251
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,720
and i am not going to have it if i if

252
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,760
this doesn't work i will definitely

253
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,000
update you but if it does work

254
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,839
you will also find out if it doesn't

255
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,160
work i'm going back to my insecticidal

256
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,360
soap and i'll be wiping at night

257
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,680
however another thing i found out

258
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,640
was the fact that this garlic the

259
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,440
essential oils are great as a fungicide

260
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,000
and i am going to make my solution for

261
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,560
that

262
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,200
today as well here i have

263
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,480
all the measurements on the jug just to

264
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,640
make life easier so it's one pint

265
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:19,760
or 16 ounces make sure i'm in

266
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,800
or two cups

267
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,680
or in my case half a liter

268
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,360
as you can see in the back there so

269
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,240
that's the measurement and in here i

270
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,279
have ro

271
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,279
water again because my tap water is

272
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,360
really bad quality and whatever i spray

273
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,440
on my orchids i do not want that

274
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:43,519
to affect the leaves here i have

275
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:47,200
ground garlic and that is

276
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:50,320
a quarter of a cup american but it is

277
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,720
actually half full which is

278
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:58,880
an eighth of a cup of ground garlic

279
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,920
i used five large cloves

280
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,560
i mean this size

281
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,079
okay this is a little bit smaller but

282
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,399
that's why i took the measurement out

283
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,680
but

284
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,000
five large garlic cloves which for me

285
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,120
came

286
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,440
out to an eighth of a cup

287
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,440
and that is going to go into the water

288
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,279
and this has to marinade and sit

289
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,519
and become one

290
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,920
for a day as well it's best the longer

291
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,959
is

292
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,959
you can do this and leave it the better

293
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:40,880
and then you strain out the garlic

294
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,120
and then you have yourself a fungicide

295
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,740
so now i'm really hungry the smell of

296
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,200
garlic always makes me hungry

297
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,720
[Laughter]

298
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,680
but if this works then i am

299
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,600
absolutely going to be over the moon

300
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,160
because i have myself

301
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,320
an insecticide that i can use during the

302
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,600
day on the underside of the leaves

303
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,440
without destroying the growth

304
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,560
at least three hours best 24 hours

305
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,959
store in the fridge and the fungicide

306
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,800
if you're gonna go with a high quantity

307
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,040
store in the fridge once you've strained

308
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,480
it

309
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,680
let it seep for about 24 hours and then

310
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,519
strain out the garlic chunks if you're

311
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,920
doing a small quantity like this

312
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,240
it's going to be used up at this at the

313
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,160
moment that it's ready to be used

314
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,000
for me in my case i'm going to probably

315
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,200
double the next dose

316
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,079
so i have enough to go around this

317
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,240
is my attempt to get ahead of the game

318
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:44,000
with regards to

319
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,639
the moth larvae and i am hoping

320
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,160
to come out on top this year quite

321
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,959
frankly i am tired of eventually seeing

322
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,959
these marks

323
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,760
let's hope we're successful because if

324
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,399
that is the case eventually i'll buy in

325
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,720
some more

326
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,519
dendrobium phalaenopsis because i do

327
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,839
like them

328
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,880
i just can't seem to keep them alive

329
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,240
because of this pest

330
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,519
issue i have which attacks

331
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,199
mainly my dendrobiums so i appreciate

332
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,680
you watching i hope that you

333
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,680
found this helpful again the credit goes

334
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,000
to orkyplanet and his name is

335
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,800
adrian i will leave a link to that video

336
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,320
down below

337
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,240
but i wanted to bring this to

338
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
everybody's attention because from here

339
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,560
on in

340
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,199
at least for the next month i will be

341
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,000
using this solution and if anybody asks

342
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,279
i can reference

343
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,519
this video if you've ever used garlic

344
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,920
as a pest control i would be super

345
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,760
interested to know if it had any results

346
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,079
or if it's just a

347
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,040
old wives tale and it doesn't actually

348
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,279
work

349
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,279
let me know in the comments below thank

350
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,440
