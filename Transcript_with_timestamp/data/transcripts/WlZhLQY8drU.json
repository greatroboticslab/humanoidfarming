  "text": "hello viewers welcome to elim TV a station where you watch learn and also interact your tutor is Mr an agriculture teacher in today's lesson we in form one lesson 24 topic Crop Production one it deals with land preparation subtopic importance of land preparation on to the lesson objectives by the end of this lesson you should be able to number one explain the various tools and equipment used during land clearing then number two State the various methods of land uh clearing terms used we have land preparation and and what is land preparation these are the various activities that are carried out in the farm to prepare the land or to make the land suitable for planting or the land to to be ready to receive the planting material then we have the land the some of the activities which are carried out we have during pre land preparation the first one we have land clearing and this refer to the cutting down all the vegetation uh cover on a particular piece of land then we have the primary cultivation and secondary cultivation primary cultivation refer to the initial opening of land in a virgin land or uh the the the initial opening of land uh following uh land uh clearing then we have secondary cultivation it entails uh the process of U hallowing or uh seed bed refinement whereby the farmer normally uh goes back to the field after carrying out primary cultivation and breaks down the large soil cloths into small pieces so that you can establish a fine H til which will promote uniform germination and also uniform depth of uh planting then uh we have the methods of land clearing the first method you uh you we have the tree Fairing and during tree fairing you can use various method uh for those people who uh have doing land clearing on large scale they can uh uh uh cut down the trees using the bulldozer and that is a a a machine uh which is uh well displayed there and and you can as well as use for the small scale Farmers they can use an ax to cut down or to during tree failing and also you can use a power so or electric so whenever it comes to tree faing as the method of land clearing then we have the second method we have burning method but this method is not advisable why uh because it will end up lowering the soil fertility because the high temperature which is induced it will cause the soil microorganism which are very very beneficial uh uh to the plant also to die due to high temperature so it is very very uh it is not advisable for you to use this method then we have uh the slashing method as you can see it is well Illustrated here you can use a slasher also you can use a panga when it comes to uh slashing of the vegetation cover then we have the fourth method is chemical method in chemical method we normally use the chemicals that are sprayed in the farm in order to mitigate the pro the problem of the vegetation cover and therefore all the vegetation cover will be will die at the end as a result of being affected by the chemicals which are normally used what are the factors that necessitate land clearing one whenever you are uh you you are preparing a virging land remember virging land is the one which has never been ctiv has never been cultivated before and therefore it is bushing and therefore you have to carry out land clearing then the second one previous crop uh if the previous crop was a stamp was made up of some stamps and therefore the the the it we necessitate land clearing for example maze if uh the previous crop of maze uh you should carry out land clearing in order to pave way for the subsequent operations such as primary and secondary cultivation before planting is done then we have interval between primary and secondary cultivation some Farmers normally carry out primary cultivation then there is a very big gap in between the primary the time when the primary is done and the secondary done it means that there is the growth of the crop of the weeds again in the field and therefore it necessitate for land clearing to be done and also where the land has left follow has been left follow for a long period of time if the land is left uncultivated condition in uncultivated condition for a period of 2 years uh it necessitate uh land clearing uh to be done first before the other subsequent operation to be exercised then we have tools which are used or the machine the tools equipment or machine which are used during land clearing we have a slush you can use aanga you can use a matchet you can use buza and also you can use a power so what are the reasons for land clearing number one to kill the wind and number two to reclaim the land this is to make uh uh land useful the land which was not useful after you carry out land clearly it becomes useful then to facilitate finally it is to facilitate easier carrying out of subsequent operation such as primary cultivation and secondary cultivation we have come to the ends of today lesson and the questions uh which I'm going to uh assign you is there inform of assignment the first question is list any four types of tools and equipment or machine used during land clearing then the second question State any three reasons for carrying out land clearing then number three mention any three methods of land uh clearing then for reference you can refer from the secondary agriculture student book one and the publisher is the Kenya literature Bure then for more information you can reach us at elim TV through the following addresses the first one you can use SMS at uh using the number which is well displayed for you you can use the YouTube at elim TV and also Facebook platform at elim TV and finally you can tweet us using uh at elim tvk thank you for joining me in this lesson please stay tuned till next lesson bye-bye",
