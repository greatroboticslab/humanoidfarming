00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,509
hello my name is Brian Otis with rice

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,880
tech incorporated proper grand real

3
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,920
calibration is a very important aspect

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,500
to getting off on the right foot each

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,570
season and with rice tech seed that's no

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,430
exception as you know we're dealing with

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,500
lower than normal seeding rates so it's

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,750
very important to get your grain drill

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,120
calibrated so that you get a good start

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,399
each season so today we're going to go

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,739
through calibrating three major types of

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,510
grain drills an air cedar like you see

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,579
behind me we're going to go through a

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,050
John Deere type box drill and then

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,829
finally we're going to finish with a

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,930
Great Plains type box group okay so I'm

17
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,340
going to go through basically your

18
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,460
supply list of what you're going to need

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,629
for proper drill calibration first thing

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,910
you're going to need to do is look at

21
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,160
your bag of seed or the piece of paper

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,670
that comes with a mini bull and find out

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,140
what your seed per pound rate is for

24
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,030
this particular bag we know that we've

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,880
got twenty thousand two hundred and two

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,189
seed per pound okay so what you're going

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,280
to do is divide that number into your

28
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,659
seeding rate which in the case you know

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,450
depending on how many pounds heat

30
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,460
breaker your number of seed per acre you

31
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,200
divide that number by the number on the

32
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,090
bag and when you do that that's going to

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,909
give you the exact number of pounds per

34
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,060
acre that you need to plant once you

35
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,680
determine the number of seeds per pound

36
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,829
either in our pre-planning newsletter

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,850
that we send out annually on our website

38
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:41,220
at Rice techcom you can get or you can

39
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,110
download an Excel spreadsheet which is

40
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,000
our calibration worksheet which works

41
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,369
for any seed you want to plant in your

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,740
grain drill works for rice takes seed

43
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,420
works for soybean seed but you're going

44
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,759
to need to know the number of seat per

45
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,259
pound and the number or the pounds per

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,600
acre of seed that you want to plant

47
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,060
you'll enter that number into our

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,860
calibration worksheet and our worksheet

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,750
will give you the proper amount of seed

50
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,470
that you need to catch in the grain

51
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,060
drill

52
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,240
to ensure that you're properly

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,090
calibrated now at our website and in our

54
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,370
pre-planning newsletter we also provide

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,970
basic starting points for each type of

56
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:20,490
box grain group which based on previous

57
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,560
experience of our field tech and tech

58
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,860
reps out in the field we've determined

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,230
on Great Plains and John Deere drills a

60
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,970
good starting point with each type of

61
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,040
drills so that you can be in the

62
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,010
ballpark at least from where you want to

63
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,650
get started okay so for supplies that

64
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,390
you're going to need first you'll need a

65
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,100
tape measure you're going to need to

66
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,530
measure the circumference of the gauge

67
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,220
wheel or the transmission wheel that's

68
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,870
actually turning the drill second you're

69
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,080
going to need a ruler and this will

70
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,240
enable you to measure the COG so that

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,330
you can get a very accurate measurement

72
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:01,980
so to which meters the seed coming out

73
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:04,500
of the drill we recommend a metal ruler

74
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,950
in metric so it's in centimeters and

75
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,540
millimeters second you'll need a

76
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,550
calculator just to help you do some

77
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,350
basic calculations although if you

78
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,070
download the spreadsheet from our

79
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,050
website

80
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,060
the Excel spreadsheet will do that for

81
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,610
you

82
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,620
duct tape you'll need duct tape to mark

83
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,420
the transmission wheel because we will

84
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,100
be making a number of revolutions with

85
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,959
the gauge wheel or transmission wheel

86
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,380
this will just help you keep track and

87
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,940
where you're at finally in something

88
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,030
that most people probably don't have

89
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,010
will be a small electric scale in this

90
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,370
particular case you can use a postage

91
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,959
scale or this scale is just about just a

92
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,950
standard electric scale that you can

93
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,290
actually buy off the internet next just

94
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,870
a couple of cups to help move in seed

95
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,180
around on the drill to measure seed out

96
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,000
of the bag to pour into the drill in

97
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,430
order to measure the seed out of each of

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,070
the each of the seed cups under the Box

99
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,860
drill you can either use individual cups

100
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,600
to put under the cups you can use the

101
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,019
styrofoam cup as shown here or a

102
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,180
standard plastic Solo Cup or if you'd

103
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,640
rather you can use a catch catch can

104
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,950
which you can catch several row units at

105
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,780
one time and then you can pour it out

106
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,430
here at the ends

107
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,280
you know either one of these methods

108
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,260
will work fine and then finally once

109
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,360
you're calibrated we've come up with

110
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,540
these handy magnets that can you can

111
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,850
affixed to the lid in the box and you

112
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,160
can write down your settings so each

113
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,900
year when you come to recalibrate at the

114
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,610
beginning of the year you've got good

115
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,669
starting points from where you were set

116
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,020
last year so that in the following year

117
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:43,730
you'll know where to start and you can

118
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,990
calibrate the drill on your own okay

119
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,810
we're going to demonstrate proper

120
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,430
calibration of a Great Plains type box

121
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,780
true

122
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,919
okay in order to get started first you

123
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,810
need to make sure that the drill is

124
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,610
completely empty all the seat cups have

125
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,090
been cleaned out but then have been

126
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,980
moved back up to that first position

127
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,320
then you can go to our website and get

128
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,660
the approximate starting points for this

129
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,280
type of drill first thing you need to

130
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,990
know on the Great Plains is to make sure

131
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,910
that the transmission is in the lowest

132
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,310
setting so on this particular drill this

133
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,900
is a Great Plains 2020 we're going to be

134
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,320
in drive setting number one a

135
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,639
transmission setting number one then

136
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,919
because this is an eight inch model

137
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:25,460
drill we're going to make sure that our

138
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,110
knotch setting is at number sixty the

139
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,690
times these drills have quite a bit of

140
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:34,039
play I'm going to go all the way to zero

141
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,450
and then move it to sixty okay now this

142
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,250
is just going to be an approximate

143
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,260
starting point from this point we'll

144
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,760
begin our calibration and then make

145
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,250
small adjustments up or down depending

146
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,020
on which way we need to go okay the next

147
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,729
step is to get a proper measurement of

148
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,440
your gauge wheel on this particular

149
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:50,660
drill there's two gauge wheels one on

150
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,919
each side that run the transmission but

151
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,020
we just need to measure one of them

152
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,580
because typically they're the same so

153
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,140
the easiest way to do this is to get a

154
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:02,810
tape measure and a piece of duct tape

155
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:06,830
tape the tape measure to the gauge wheel

156
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:09,220
and the center spin it around until it

157
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,229
comes back and then get a measurement

158
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,479
this particular gauge wheel is seven

159
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:15,770
foot eleven and a half inches long as

160
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,080
we're going to convert that into inches

161
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:21,320
and then enter that into our and our

162
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,360
spreadsheet as our wheel circumference

163
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,539
okay once you get the circumference of

164
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,070
your drive wheel you can go online

165
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:28,789
download our get our spreadsheet off the

166
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,199
internet

167
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,719
and enter the circumference of the gauge

168
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,029
wheel you can also enter the number of

169
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:36,620
seats per pound which on your bag or on

170
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,449
your mini boat is a listing of the

171
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,029
number of seats per pound for your

172
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:43,639
particular lot of seed you'll put that

173
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:46,999
information in and then you're going to

174
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:49,520
divide this number number see per pounds

175
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:52,189
into the number of seats per acre that

176
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,139
you need to plant that will in turn give

177
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:56,539
you the number of pounds per acre that

178
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,699
you need to plant you'll plug that

179
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:00,949
number into the spreadsheet and it will

180
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:03,589
give you the number of grams you need to

181
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:06,409
catch from the predetermined number of

182
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:08,839
row units and turns of the the gauge

183
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:09,800
wheel and when you get that number then

184
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,439
you'll know that you're properly

185
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,870
calibrated we're going to come back to

186
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:17,029
the back side of the grill and we're

187
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,649
going to measure five seed cups so with

188
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:20,360
this particular drill it's a lot easier

189
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:21,770
to pull the tubes off of the road units

190
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,960
and it is to pull the tubes down from

191
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,379
the seat code we've got this handy catch

192
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:30,620
catch can hear so what I'm going to do

193
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:33,969
is pull five of these drop tubes off so

194
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,969
that they lay in this catch pin

195
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,380
if you choose to you can also use Solo

196
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,720
cups or get some help here - just hold

197
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,729
cups underneath these C cups if you

198
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:59,180
don't have a pan like this to use to

199
00:07:46,729 --> 00:08:01,849
catch the C okay once you've got your

200
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,139
drop tube set and the drills cleaned out

201
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:05,870
you're going to need to go ahead and put

202
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:07,729
some seed in only put enough seed in to

203
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,380
cover the five row units that you're

204
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:10,940
going to calibrate because it makes it a

205
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,240
lot easier to make adjustments on the

206
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:16,250
drill if only a few seed cups are full

207
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,870
if the whole drills full it's nearly

208
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:21,710
impossible to move the thing once it's

209
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:23,900
been set so what you'll do is just put

210
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:27,169
enough seed in there to fill up the seed

211
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,599
cup and do that for each of the row

212
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:30,979
units that you're going to calibrate

213
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,240
once you get the drill primed all the

214
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:34,370
seed cups are full of seed and you're

215
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,709
ready to begin go ahead and empty your

216
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,839
catch pan until there's no seed left and

217
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:40,250
then we can begin the calibration okay

218
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,620
once you get the drill primed and ready

219
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,110
to go you'll enter your seed pan or your

220
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,260
seed cups get them completely empty put

221
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,430
the tubes back in and get it ready to go

222
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,730
now we're going to turn the gauge wheel

223
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,740
15 times because our calibration

224
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,380
worksheet has told us if we turn it 15

225
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,480
times we need to catch so much seed for

226
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,250
the right weight or pound per acre that

227
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,270
we're shooting for so I'm going to turn

228
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,270
the wheel 15 times

229
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,550
okay once you get through with your 15

230
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,350
turns before you get the weight of that

231
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,170
seed you've got to zero out the weight

232
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,410
of your container what you'll do is put

233
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,870
the empty container on your scale and

234
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,610
then hit the zero out button to zero the

235
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,380
weight so that when you add the rice

236
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,300
seed back into this or whatever seed

237
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,589
you're calibrating forward back in there

238
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,300
you're only getting that weight and not

239
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:32,120
the weight of the seed plus the

240
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:35,360
container and once you get the

241
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,130
calibration or get close because the

242
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,529
adjustments are going to be so small

243
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,470
it'll be handy to have a ruler one of

244
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:44,899
these metrics small metal rulers but you

245
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,180
can put on the COG on the outside of the

246
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:49,940
seed cup all the way against the edge of

247
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,339
the seed cup this number will actually

248
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,260
be much more accurate than using the

249
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:56,029
number off of the leaper because in many

250
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,160
cases there's a lot of play on these

251
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,950
older drills so it's always better to

252
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,779
use this number in this case we're at

253
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,310
eighteen and a half millimeters so we'll

254
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:07,130
make small adjustments up or down

255
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,890
depending on what our calibration weight

256
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,720
gives us okay once we get this side

257
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,610
calibrated we might have to make a

258
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,160
couple of adjustments back and forth to

259
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,290
get them the weight that's specified on

260
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,760
that calibration shoot once we've got

261
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,670
that we recommend that you go to the

262
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,200
other side and do the other side as well

263
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:26,089
carry that number that you get from that

264
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,190
ruler to the other side and rather than

265
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,630
using the number off of the lever use

266
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,700
the number off that ruler and that'll

267
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,770
get you died in a dial in a lot closer

268
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,200
okay once you get the grains real

269
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,850
calibrated write your numbers on this

270
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,130
magnetic sheet that right stick will

271
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,170
provide and keep it with the drill

272
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,790
we recommend maybe putting it on the

273
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,610
inside of the lid so you don't lose it

274
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,829
okay it's also important that once you

275
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,779
get out into the field that you follow

276
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:52,880
behind the drill periodically and check

277
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:54,980
behind the drill to make sure that

278
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,890
you're still properly calibrated in the

279
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,839
field okay also there are several other

280
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,779
drills that follow this same type of

281
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,610
format you can calibrate those exactly

282
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:06,770
the same way it really all comes down to

283
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,050
measuring the gate wheel getting that

284
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,490
information in and determining how much

285
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,589
you need to catch based on the gauge

286
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,560
wheel circumference and the row width

287
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:17,720
your row spacing once you get all that

288
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,610
done always be sure to check behind the

289
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,620
drill if you've got any question

290
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,880
you can always contact your ricetec grip

291
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,880
or your dealer
