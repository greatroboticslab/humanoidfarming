  "text": "All right, welcome aboard everybody. This is Steve at Thousand-Year Homes. So, out here I'm just solo building. Uh uh and this is a real world build. There's not uh you know, bank money and a whole bunch of money. I'm I'm building from paycheck to paycheck. Uh just like uh just like they did 50 years ago. So, uh and I can only build so much at a time. So, when you come visit me, I'm homesteading. I'm building these uh shipping containers. They're looking pretty good in thigh, but uh I'm slow. Uh which is an honest approach, especially here in Texas where uh the heat and the drought has been something fierce. And uh but it rained last night and it rained really solidly. Um and I'm it kept me up all night long, so I'm a little tired. But let's go ahead and walk around today. See how successful the rain has been or not. Uh the horses are up. They're showing me that uh they're muddy as all get out. So, they've at least got a little cooling off. Let's take a look. Okay, let's real quick just show you what's going on so you can get an idea as I drive around. So, uh right here, uh you see there's the farm. Um this is the satellite image that's about a year old. So, uh there's the shipping containers. What I've done today is I've driven you up to this stock pond which was dry. So, this one was mostly dry and we've taken a look at some other things. First off, uh on this particular satellite image, if I scroll in, it doesn't even have the uh pond that I built right here with here where I um first off, let me scroll in a little bit. So, right here is the pond that I went ahead and just dug and put the bridge over. So, from the house walking over now, I have this little pond right in here in this woods. Uh there is the um the two gardens that I have uh right there. So there's the gardens. So you'll see that I've done a lot of manage water management already. So let me go ahead and and zoom back out for you all so you can see the the complete property. So the couple of different things that I'm doing here. So one thing that I'm doing is I'm uh building a swale that will run through here. Let me go ahead and just get brown up then. So, this swale runs through here and I'm trying to pick up the water out of this area. So, I've got a little swale coming out here and it goes down and it goes all the way up to here. So, you can see that this area, if you look at it closely, that it drains over to here. So, I'm hoping that I can pick up all of that water that drains. Now, this didn't uh drain at all here uh during this rain, but that doesn't surprise me because um you know, we've had a drought. So, all of this water here that gathers up, what I want it to do is flow down here, go through the new bell gate that I have, run through here, and then find its way down to here. Now, what I've decided to do is I've decided to go ahead and um dig out underneath this fence and run a couple more swailes down to here. You can see the cattle are gathered up just like this. So, I'll have three swailes that'll be running down in. Now, these don't exist yet, but I'll go ahead and do them. But what did exist and what did work is right here. You can see there's a wet spot in the field right right through here. And um what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I put in that test pond right here. And um so that test pond is in and it's successful. And uh you know I've got a little tiny sweat ditch really that I just dug over to here and uh it's topped off right now. So those are uh the things that I'm doing. I'm trying to gather up the water here and pipe it down a swale into the pond. So instead of this dried up pond, I'll have a filled one. Then this paddic will have a pond. That paddic will have a pond. And then this paddic, what I'll end up doing is dividing it out. There's a there is a stream that runs through here, a ditch rather, that runs through here and dumps all the water into here and then it all runs down to Butcher Creek. So what I want to do is I want to harvest that. So couple of different things. Right now, this is spilling spillway through into the garden and then it'll run over to here and down. This thing when it tops off, you could see that it runs this way. What I want to do is uh one final pond and it will be a large pond uh that I'll build and I'll build it over in um this tree area. And I really want it to be a a two or three acre pond uh so that I can capture uh as much water as possible. Now through the property, I have a swale that goes here already and one that runs through here and they both dump out already right through these trees where they go through into the creek. And so I'll be building this pond eventually. Uh, and I want it to be a couple acres pond. And I want it to be, I don't know, 18 ft deep. So, with that, I'll have a p one, two, three, cuz hopefully this thing will hold water. Three ponds. And if I can get it filled up, I might even do, you know, expand out the pond a little bit here. But first, let me dig it deeper and get these swailes going so it doesn't go dry in the droughts. And then this pond. And then these uh swailes here, uh they're they're working out pretty good. So all of the uh everything that I'll capture in these areas, uh you know, all of that water that I'm going to capture in this area and run down this swale uh you know, will dump into that pond. I have to build these swailes. They don't exist yet. This one and this one. And that fence row has got a wall built up along it. So, the water kind of runs this way and is escaping into the creek uh like that. So, anyway, that's what's going on uh in this little roundabout. So, oh, the last thing that I did is down here I'll put NY uh you know, I have the little stock tank that I put in and it's only a little bit full. But that's a lot of different water solutions. And on 3 in, I already picked up a little bit here. I I filled this off. Uh, this didn't work here, but it will, right? The theory is is there. That one worked really well. This one is sort of kind of working. And that doesn't exist yet, but it will. So, um, and this doesn't exist yet. So, really happy with the overall water plan. It might take me more than a year or two to get it done, but I will get it done. And then during the drought, uh, you know, July, August, September, uh, you know, October, I'll be I'll be digging each one of these ponds as I can go. Um, the swailes will be the first thing up here that I'll do because I've already started them. And, uh, I want to get seed back on the the fields as soon as possible. So, without that uh, further ado, let me jump back into the video and you guys can watch the actual physical outcome of this game plan. All right. So, as my mud beasts are showing here, we actually had some rain around here for a change. 3 in is what my neighbors report. My weather gauge is not currently working. So, what I will do is we'll go take a look at the pond. We'll take a look at some of my other uh materials. I got to pick up all of my wet boxes that the uh UPS guy just left on the side of the road without plastic bags. That's always pleasant. So, let's take a look here. Now, one thing I did wrong was I did not get the salt block out of the water. So, uh this is always a bummer when this happened, but I I leave it evaporate, dump oats in it. They still get the uh you know, the salt lick out of there. But that looks I'm underneath trees. So, that's looking like 3 in, right? Maybe even a little more if I look at that wheelbarrow. Now, let's go take a look at some other things. Well, that looks pretty good for a no water garden. Uh, you know, nothing else grew in here. I found a composting place for me to go ahead and put compost over the top of that box. But, uh, let me tell you, my uh, it came too late to save my sunflowers. Either that or the horses got in there and ate them all. Not sure what happened there. Disaster on that sunflower field. I don't see anybody left. But they do look eaten rather than anything else. And I I don't actually keep the horses out of that. It doesn't matter to me, but something got that. Wowee. Well, 3 in is the magic number to take this from uh dry to filled right up. This looks really, really good. Uh man, this year was so dry. It went dry twice. So, there won't be any frogs in here that I can think of, unless they buried themselves in the mud. Uh, I'll go ahead pull the weeds out of there. There. I don't like that one. Weed. Not half bad, everybody. So, those have been I'll get some pictures of this when it's dry so you all can appreciate. Now, I have seen this as a running water and it runs this way. So, what I'm doing here is uh from the um uh pond, I'm going to make a swale. And I'm slowly working on it. And the swale will go around and it'll go around here. And if you look there into the garden, you could see that I've got a a swale beginning where the water will go flow into the gardens and and then out that way to a river. Looks really good. But oh my gosh, I have been I might be able to make it this year for water for my horses without having to bother my poor neighbors anymore. That's really really good. This side I I've got I put gypson in it and so this side ends up getting clear. And uh I might do the same thing to that pond. My chickens are out in the in the forest. All right, let's go ahead and get a uh in my uh UTV and go and drive and see what else we've got going on here. All right. Well, I'll tell you this rain really changed my mood. I I I just can't do in five months we got like two inches of rain. I I just couldn't do it anymore. I I'm not built that way. And uh I grew up in Michigan where you know land of lakes and there rains all the time and uh I never have adapted to Texas and to be honest when I watch everything die that I plant it uh gives me a a heap and helping of depression. So I'm very much a creature of my atmosphere very much connected to the land and uh you know it doesn't take much just some rain to cheer me up and a full stock tank. Uh, this thing is working out. Um, and I I wondered if it would. That's just three inches. So, if it rained a normal amount, I could dig this out even bigger and deeper and have a um, you know, I would still keep the front for the horses to wait into. So, it's a ramp there, but the rest of this I would dig out uh, pretty deep and pretty narrow. I try to retain as much moisture as I can. But, uh, this end of the house I'm real happy with. I've got grass seed. I've got long stem uh uh you know, blueg grass to plant and some other things uh natives uh grass seed here. I'll put it in the ground. Um it's supposed to maybe rain again this week. Now, I'm not declaring victory. I'm fully expecting uh to see, you know, uh the gr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr drought continue through, you know, July, August, September. But it was over 101 degrees in the summer here and everything that I had was was dying. Uh the horses were having to hang around me all day long and um because the grass is too stringy when it doesn't get any moisture in it and it's really hard to graze. So I was feeling their complaint. And uh anyway, I'm I'm so much happier with this. Let's go up and we'll take a look at my test uh stock tank that I dug as well as my swale that I put in to try to redirect more water. I I don't know if it got enough rain for that or not, but we'll find out together. Well, there's a whole herd of buzzards here. I don't know why they're still roaming around. I don't see anything for them to be eating. Maybe they were just having a convention. That there is all of the cedar that I'll end up stripping for uh coyote fence. I'm just moved it out of my way so that uh the needles can fall off of it and I can go through. I also uh will run this over with my brush hog. It can run up to 3-in uh size logs. So, that's how I uh I mulch it, right? So, I'll turn that all into mulch. Sure made the field look a lot better. I did get grass uh head. So, uh hopefully it'll recede. The cattle haven't been out here because there's no water for them to drink. This stock tank I'm coming up to has been empty. And the cattle, if they did use it, they would have had the trunk in the mud knee deep, and that's not safe. [Music] Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, for reference, the, uh, the pond used to be up to the bottom of that tree right there. Right. So, uh, it got a little water. It was all cracked and and whatnot, but not nearly enough. Let me see if my swale work. Doesn't look like flowing water went into it. It looks like the idea might work, but I'm just going to have to cut it in deeper. Some shallow spots there. All right. So, that uh bit of rain wasn't enough to cause runoff here along uh that old Pioneer Road that used to be a road that would go to a dip tank as well as some other go off in church or wherever it went. I don't know. So, that feels like my pond idea there uh might work, but uh I'm going to require more than 3 in of rain after 5 months of drought, right? Yeah, I don't see anything that happened. Just wasn't enough rain. Oh, I'm wrong. Oh, lookucky there. Well, that's a 4 and 1/2t hole. I'm going to take a look at it right now. Pretty pretty excited. My idea did work. Like I say, that's a 4ft test hole, huh? Well, all right. Well, I'll scrape the land with my uh my little tractor and I'll make a little halfacre pond here. All right. Wow. Wow, man. That that would be awesome. I would have uh I would have then two ponds. Uh I'd have this pond, I would have that pond in these paddics. So each paddic would have a pond. Man, that is exciting stuff. All right, another success that I'm super happy about. Lookie, you know, that was just a a wild hair that I got that um based on the lay of the land and how it ran into this aoyo over here. If I can hijack it and get it to come it and I could put a pond in here and uh look uh that I did it. So, uh, the the plan will be a similar size pond with a a decent ramp for the cattle to come in, but narrow and deep in order to kind of keep as much water as possible. Now, I'll be losing a little bit of uh of pasture to this pond, but it'll more than make up for it because uh I'll be able then to close off both paddics and then I can density graze each one. So, the cattle and horses um they'll they'll last a little longer. So, my bell way down there where I'm slowly working on the fence uh uh I I might get excited about and finish up. But now that it's cooler, uh I'll be I'll be back on the sawmill. Uh I just couldn't handle the tin there. Too hot. But uh this is super exciting. I feel like I've won. And uh you know, that's not a mud uh just a mud puddle. That thing's 4 foot deeper. So I'll put some uh some of the video of me digging that. Uh super exciting, man. I am happy about that. So and so will the wildlife. They'll they'll appreciate that little little drinking spot and so will the cattle. Ah, just so happy. Well, I'm pretty happy with the results of what little bit of uh water collection I've got going on here. I've been working on it for a few years. The first year I wasn't out here living. Uh I had an apartment, but uh I went and collected uh you know, images and paid attention and came out. So, my last bit of uh water is this tank. And Leah and I went ahead and repaired it, and it was dry. I can see that it's uh gosh, not not very full, just the 3 in. Now, I was expecting to collect more water than that from there. But what I'll do is I'll get aluminum tape and I'll tape along the gutter and the uh convolution. I think I'm losing, you know, half the water um through each one of the uh uh ridges and peaks of the corrugation. So, I'll go ahead and tape that up so that I can capture more water. This was just all juryrigged right now temporarily. I want to I've got I found enough uh um uh eaves to run the other side. I'll put a bulkhead here. Rebuild this. I need this to be about half full so before I can um uh go ahead and put the walls around it because uh I'm expecting it to change shape once it gets filled with water. So I was hoping more would be in there than the the 3 in. But I'm grateful for the three that are there. Uh I can see based on the bottom there's water underneath it causing a little uh you know can't burp out of there etc etc. But, uh, I'll just live with it the way it is. Once I get it full, then I can, you know, use this for agricultural, keep my gardens green, uh, get some additional trees out here. That was destroyed. Destroyed in the storm. Destroyed. It was already torn up, but the roof was still there. So, win some, lose some, but all that will be moved when I'm done with the sawmill area. I've got enough storage in there. I can move all of that. And so, I'll get the sawmill all set up way back yonder. uh working hard doing a lot of different things but uh when the when the heat is the way it is and it's over 101 and you know you can't touch tin and all I'm doing is working with metal and uh it's hard for me to keep positive energy going so you know I look for little jobs to do like clearing a tree or something like that uh working at the front on the gate just little things like that but they're not forward progress on the li on the living arrangement uh which this year I've got high ambitions to get the real foundations underneath here as well as the roof, etc., etc., etc. And daylight's burning and uh we'll see if I can accomplish this. So, a little bit of work here to do on the uh you know, I want to make sure that this thing catches all the water it can and fills up. Uh so, I'll be working on that. I might cut across here and grab that one, too, and see if I can double up the capacity. Uh, I should be getting about 340 gallons per inch of rain off of there and maybe uh, you know, that's a 5,000galon tank, so you know, it takes a lot of water to fill it up. Uh, but I need it at least half filled so that the walls are pushed out so that I can earth bag it about and stuckco it and, you know, not make it an eyesore. It's an eyesore. Uh, but it's an eyes sore because uh I got to get that yet. I don't have any water out here. I'm a dry cabin. So, I got to get that filled up with some water so that it's the right size and then I can fix it up, make it look nice, fix up the bulkheads, uh, you know, do these eaves. They're temporary, too. So, they're just up there with magnets. Uh, there's a lot of things to do, but I'm pretty excited about this bit of rain. I appreciate it much. uh really changed my moods and uh grateful to God because I complain. I have a relationship with God that's very vocal and uh so you know uh I appreciate the rain being out here and fill it up and hopefully it'll continue on.",
