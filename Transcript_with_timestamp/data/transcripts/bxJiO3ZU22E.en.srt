2
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:05,560
winter brings its challenges for horse

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,240
owners from freezing temperatures to

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,519
managing icy conditions whether you're

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,880
new to horse care or looking for a

6
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,480
refresher I'll walk you through the best

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,680
practices for keeping your horse safe

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,560
warm and healthy this season so let's

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,599
dive in so let's start with blanketing

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,080
Basics blanketing can feel overwhelming

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,400
but it doesn't have to be horses

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,880
naturally grow with thick winter coat

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,440
that acts as an insulator by trapping

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,320
air but some horses may need extra help

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,600
so here's what you need to

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,559
consider when to blanket if your horse

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,120
is clipped underweight elderly or

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,000
struggles to maintain body heat

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,920
blanketing is a

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,559
must but if they're healthy well fed and

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,879
grow a full winter coat they probably

22
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,359
don't need

23
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:02,160
one choosing the right blanket there are

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,439
three main M types lightweight sheets

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,960
for mild cold medium weight for jelly

26
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,360
weather and heavyweight blankets for

27
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,360
frigid

28
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,360
temperatures proper fit ensure the

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,320
blanket doesn't rub or restrict movement

30
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,840
it should sit snugly but not tight

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,360
around the chest and belly always check

32
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,439
straps daily to avoid dangerous snags

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,680
and the other things you need to check

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,759
every day sometimes multiple times a day

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,119
whether you know temperature

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,759
changes was it really cold in the

37
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:40,079
morning and so you had the sheet and

38
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,759
then a heavy winter blanket on and then

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,880
a turnout rug and now your horse is

40
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,200
outside and it's

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,360
45° like you you need to be able to

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,880
monitor these things and make the

43
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,479
blanket

44
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,119
switches when need be because not being

45
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:01,000
able to do that not

46
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:04,960
monitoring every couple of hours you you

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,960
could you know create conditions uh for

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,920
your horse that are not good you know

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,720
like sores uh excessive sweating and

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,000
then it gets cooler later on now they're

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,800
sweaty and wet and then it cools down

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,760
and now they're freezing so there's so

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,760
many things you have to consider when it

54
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,800
comes to blanketing I'm lucky Dakota

55
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:32,640
grows a polar bar coat in the winter

56
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,680
time what I do for him is I Curry him

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,800
almost

58
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,080
daily I will curry him to make sure that

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,640
there's no hair sticking together that

60
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,599
it's standing

61
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,920
up and so that you know when it's really

62
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,040
frigid cold and windy he just turns his

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,760
butt to the to the wind and continues to

64
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,760
munch on his

65
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,319
hay now we're going to jump into

66
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,560
managing frozen water oh

67
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,599
boy not fun

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,680
one of the worst parts of winter in in

69
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:08,519
my humble opinion but access to Fresh

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,360
unfrozen water is a non-negotiable for

71
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:15,440
horses even in the dead of winter

72
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,440
dehydration is a silent threat and

73
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,200
definitely can increase the risk of cic

74
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,040
so here's some tips to manage water

75
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,840
during freezing

76
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,640
temperatures invest in heated water

77
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,560
options heated buckets and trough

78
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,920
deicers are like saers make sure they're

79
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,480
properly grounded to prevent shocks I

80
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,799
don't use them inside the barn of course

81
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,400
Dakota would only come into the barn if

82
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,200
it was terribly horrible horrible out

83
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,920
meaning like sleet

84
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:51,799
and combined with the frigid

85
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,439
temperatures um what or or if he weren't

86
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,120
feeling well then he would come into the

87
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,760
barn but I would use an insulated bucket

88
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,640
before I would use one of those heated

89
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,879
flat-sided buckets buets because they're

90
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,200
dangerous and many of barn fire have

91
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:11,159
occurred because of those those buckets

92
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:15,560
so I don't use heated buckets in the

93
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:17,680
barn however I have invested in the big

94
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,960
they look like muck buckets but they're

95
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,759
heated um those work really well

96
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,160
consistently I've had a lot of issues

97
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,199
with the drop in heaters not being

98
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:34,240
grounded properly and and the problem

99
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,720
guys is within the heater itself you can

100
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,680
have

101
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,199
everything set up properly grounding

102
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,240
rods Outlets that are grounded the whole

103
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:48,639
nine yards but you could have a faulty

104
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,440
heater my suggestion to you is to

105
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,000
wherever it is that you're purchasing go

106
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,160
to a a you

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,160
know store like Tractor Supply or

108
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,520
whatever I'm not promoting any one of

109
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,479
those but go there in person bring a

110
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,440
voltage meter with you and right in

111
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,000
front of the cashier before you pay for

112
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,039
that check it many of them are being

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,360
bought and they're defective and they're

114
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:16,080
shocking your horses once you shock your

115
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,639
horse when they're trying to get a drink

116
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,319
of water then you really increase the

117
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,600
risk of dehydration and impaction colic

118
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,759
because they're going to be

119
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,520
terrified to drink from that bucket

120
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,919
again okay so again I have found those

121
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,800
big not big troughs but they look

122
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:38,400
they're the size of a muck bucket um

123
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,400
that are heated have worked consistently

124
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,199
the best haven't found any shock issues

125
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,080
and again but make sure that your

126
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,720
Outlets are grounded and you got to

127
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,919
check them you know how you check them

128
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,280
barefooted and you stick your hand in

129
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:56,680
there yep rather you than a $10,000

130
00:05:52,280 --> 00:06:01,080
$20,000 colic surgery right

131
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:04,639
okay here's some DIY hacks for icef free

132
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,840
water if heated options are not feasible

133
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,479
try insulating your buckets with foam or

134
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,560
wrapping them with a heat retaining

135
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:15,280
cover I've seen people build like a box

136
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,160
for a stock tank and then putting a

137
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,080
layer a thick layer of straw under the

138
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,880
stock tank and around it and setting the

139
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,890
stock tank in there that will help

140
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,880
insulate it get it off the

141
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:28,680
[Music]

142
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,199
ground oh add a floating ball that can

143
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,759
help delay freezing the other thing we

144
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:37,560
used to do was we had um big aquarium

145
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:39,160
bubblers that we put in our in our

146
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,759
troughs and those worked really well

147
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,319
kind of like Pond bubblers right you

148
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:47,160
ever see they do that for the Wildlife

149
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,440
on backyard big ponds and they have this

150
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,560
you know they have a fountain or they've

151
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,560
got bubblers going works you got to make

152
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,639
frequent ice checks guys you got to

153
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,879
break and remove the ice multiple times

154
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,039
a day if

155
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,160
necessary just make sure you always have

156
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,520
a rubber Mallet or a crowbar to help

157
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,639
make it a little

158
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,800
easier and you want to encourage

159
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,759
hydration so you might have to add some

160
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,759
electrolytes or a small handful of salt

161
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,879
to your horse's feed to encourage

162
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:19,000
drinking I do give Dakota Himalayan salt

163
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:21,120
in each one of you know twice a day just

164
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,240
a little but enough and they they they

165
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,000
drink adequate

166
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,039
amounts you can soak your

167
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,280
hay or warm the water slightly which

168
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,039
helps too too can also help during cold

169
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,960
snaps now what I love about those

170
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,680
heaters I mentioned the ones that we use

171
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,759
outside the heated muck buckets is what

172
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,440
they look like is they do keep the water

173
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:46,039
at a really comfortable temperature so

174
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,639
it does encourage a lot more uh

175
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:52,120
ingestion of water hydration is just as

176
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,120
crucial in Winter as in summer so you

177
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,680
need to keep a close eye on your horse's

178
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,639
water intake okay if you have multiple

179
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:03,000
people like we do that are rotating bar

180
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:07,520
chores and feedings we always before we

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,680
leave we inform everybody else that this

182
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,680
is how much water was ingested like it

183
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,720
was down to a quarter of a bucket or

184
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,360
trough I topped it off on and on and on

185
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,280
and on and on so we keep each other in

186
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:23,039
the loop about forage intake feed intake

187
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,639
and especially water intake all right

188
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,520
speaking of

189
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,280
food we need to touch on feeding for

190
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,719
warmth

191
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:37,000
because horses are natural foragers and

192
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:40,320
digestion generates heat making proper

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,120
feeding a Cornerstone of winter care is

194
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,519
imperative so here's what we need to

195
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,320
focus on forage forage forage on cold

196
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:51,399
days you got to give your horses extra

197
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,720
hay it's their main heat source and it

198
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,560
keeps their digestive system working

199
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,480
properly obviously you're going to

200
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,600
monitor body condition you need to check

201
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,000
your horse's weight regularly so that's

202
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,360
where like having your horse under a

203
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,160
blanket all the time and if you're not

204
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,920
pulling those blankets and sheets and

205
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,399
all that and getting a look at your body

206
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,760
your horse's body condition you might

207
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,680
miss

208
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,640
something okay you need to use a weight

209
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,600
tape or even just feeling along the ribs

210
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,000
to make sure they're not losing

211
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,200
condition winter supplements consider

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,640
adding some fat sources like rice brand

213
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,600
or flax seed for the extra calories if

214
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,480
your horse is struggling to maintain

215
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:40,320
weight and of course a favorite warm

216
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,040
Mash treats offering warm beet pulp or

217
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,720
soaked ha cubes can provide hydration

218
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,800
and comfort on cold days just make sure

219
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,880
it's not too hot every bite counts in

220
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Winter plan your horses's diet to keep

221
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,399
them warm and

222
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,120
healthy now we're going to talk about

223
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:05,040
turnout and safe

224
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,440
turnout turnout is absolutely vital for

225
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,680
a horse's mental and physical health

226
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,600
even in winter but icy conditions

227
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,959
absolutely can turn playtime into a

228
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,079
hazard so the number one thing you want

229
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,000
to start with is you have to prepare

230
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,480
your Paddock clear the walkways in hight

231
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,680
traffic areas of any snow and ice or you

232
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,440
know most of it you can add sand or

233
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,079
gravel or even a non-toxic deicing agent

234
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,279
for better

235
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:40,839
traction snowball hoof

236
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:43,000
care snow can compact into hard walls

237
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:46,240
under their Hooves and it can cause a

238
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,720
lot of discomfort guys you want to apply

239
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:53,880
a non-toxic hoof oil or spray to prevent

240
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:57,639
buildup or even hoof boots if

241
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:00,160
necessary monitor the weather extreme

242
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,519
cold wind or free freezing rain May

243
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,519
warrant keeping them in the barn but

244
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,639
they still need to get daily

245
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,000
exercise let's not forget about the

246
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,760
buddy system horses stay a lot warmer

247
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,279
and happier when they can interact with

248
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,920
their herd mates so group turnout is

249
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,880
ideal when it's safe you need to balance

250
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,440
safety with the benefits of fresh air

251
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,760
and movement to keep your horse

252
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,200
happy and how about grooming and hoof

253
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,800
care winter coats are nature's blanket

254
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,880
but regular grooming is still essential

255
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,760
it's about more than just

256
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,639
appearances grooming is your chance to

257
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,639
check for issues and I do that's why I

258
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,920
do that every single day with Dakota I'm

259
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:51,639
checking his feet I'm

260
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,680
checking his legs for any inflammation

261
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:57,360
I'm checking for boo boos I mean

262
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,279
everything you want to focus on

263
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,920
hygiene because mud wet and moisture can

264
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:06,639
cause a lot of skin problems like rain

265
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,079
rot use a curry comb and a stiff brush

266
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,000
to clean their coats thoroughly

267
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,000
like

268
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,199
often don't forget about hoof

269
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,720
maintenance pick those hoofs daily to

270
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:21,120
remove mud snow or ice and keep an eye

271
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,440
out for thrush or cracks caused by wet

272
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,920
and freezing

273
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,079
conditions shedding tools oh these are

274
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,639
my

275
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,880
favorite for clipped horses consider

276
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:36,279
using fleece or wool coolers after

277
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,279
exercise to Wick moisture and prevent

278
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,199
chills I like the shedding tools and I

279
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,959
do use them because most of them will

280
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:49,160
separate the hair and get it to stand up

281
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,920
too um and also when I see the shedding

282
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,040
begin and that let's face it that can

283
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,600
start in late February early March it's

284
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,880
indicative of warmer weather to come and

285
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,519

286
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,560
not for nothing but your grooming

287
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,839
routine it's a great way to bond with

288
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:09,120
your horse and ensure that they're ready

289
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,560
for any kind of weather you know I love

290
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,480
my time spent brushing Dakota and I know

291
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:18,480
he enjoys it as

292
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,800
well you need to monitor for health you

293
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,760
got to do a visual because winter can

294
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,880
amplify existing health concerns

295
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,279
especially for older horses or those

296
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,079
with special

297
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,360
needs you should be proactive about

298
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,440
their health and you can use these tips

299
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,199
to do

300
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:40,040
so regular vet checks ensure your horse

301
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:42,199
is up to date on vaccines and deworming

302
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,720
as winter can still bring parasites and

303
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:47,560
respiratory

304
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,760
problems Dental Care horses with dental

305
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,639
problems can struggle to chew hay now

306
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,600
you need to look for that right if you

307
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,839
start seeing qubing which is where

308
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,320
they've been chewing and chewing on hay

309
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,720
and then they spit it out and you find

310
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:05,120
these Globs of wet or in the winter

311
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,240
Frozen chunks balls of chewed forage

312
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,320
that they didn't

313
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,120
swallow that's telling you there's

314
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,480

315
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,959
to because they need that forage guys

316
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,600
you need to make sure there's nothing

317
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:21,040
going on in that mouth that their teeth

318
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,480
are able to chew if you have to start

319
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,600
feeding soaked hay pellets to add extra

320
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,199
forage then that's what you need to do

321
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,360
