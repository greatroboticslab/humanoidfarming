  "text": "thanks Marty I want to thank Ruth for putting this together she does all the work and I want to thank you for coming it's always good to talk to real farmers last winter if you were here we spent a lot of time talking about water and that's what it's all about is water and if you look at what impact that we've had with with no-till in South Dakota and whatever it's all about water and better utilizing the water and we calculated a couple of years ago for the Board of Regents who wanted to know what the hell we did the board board of directors of Dakota lakes got together and we met with the Board of Regents and we calculated the difference in crop production in 1987 versus 2014 this was in 2015 if we took the center of the South Center and the and in the north central crop reporting districts in South Dakota basically that middle third of the state of South Dakota in the middle there we changed the farmers change there we use the the Woolsey price the night before Woolsey South Dakota price we we changed the amount of grain that they sold by one point six billion dollars those are big numbers unless you're in Washington but that's big that's big numbers in South Dakota that's a big increase in you and it's it's the thing that I noticed from when we first started doing this in 1990 till now cities like Gettysburg that at one time years ago in the 60s or whatever when there's lots of babies had to two classes in every grade in in the elementary school and then they went to one class in every grade and then all of a sudden they're almost talking about closing the school they're going back to two classes and every grade again and I think that's a good news and I think part of that is how we produce things and I'm going to kind of follow up a little bit with what Cody is doing and then I want to talk about just some real basics a lot of talk about soil health and muffin fluff and whatever but they're just some real basics to how you do how you do no-till and it's and it's just real simple stuff so we're going to talk about a little bit of that and then you can go home and get ready for the blizzard that's a Dakota Lakes right you know that's our main station then we have some soils to the north and if you're not familiar actually that main station the north those North two quarters right in here those are what we call mill Broyles which would be very similar to what you see around Kennebec in that area for you guys further east they're a bit just a little bit better than the peer soils and stuff you see out here in some places and then the south side are some pretty good less soils our North unit has the old triple threat with promise opal and sans arcs so those are ones that you're familiar with some of you guys here have none soils which are really quite good soils actually and then quite if you've formed some farms and Pierce Pierce oils or something like that a little trivia question for you there's the soil call all our soils are named after cities and whatever localities right so the sand Sark is a really shallow soil it's about a foot and a half deep over fractured shale and it's a put in half of that real clay stuff the true virtus all just really shallow what's that named after well the sand Sark soup right San Sark - tribe there's a little city of San Sark there Craig across the river from guess Gettysburg but where does that name come from it's French anybody here speak French well in French saans means without Arc means archery or bow and arrow so when the first fur traders first came to that area across the river from Gettysburg the tribe they ran into there was it's not using bows and arrows still using Lance's so that's where that name comes from it's kind of interesting I always like to joke with my Native American friends from that I said that those guys were the conventional tillers of the Indian society the last the last Native Americans to adopt a new technology right we still have people doing conventional tillage here you shouldn't be doing tillage here water is too precious to you did a meeting yesterday in Columbus Nebraska get 28 inches of rain a year well maybe they can grow crops without saving water there and then they got irrigated they got irrigator sitting on fields there where they get 28 inches of water a year and rainfall what a bunch of pessimist right okay this one are native vegetation looks like we're going to go to Australia Ruth's not gonna go to Australia in about a month and they have trees everywhere and they have less rainfall than we have because the rainfall comes in the wintertime when it's cool and it goes deep past because you're not using any water and it all just moves deep and then you've got trees okay so that the only place we see trees is where there's a major drainage way so the first time I went to Australia I showed this slide somebody in the audience went I said yes ma'am she's worried the trees go I said Paul Bunyan cut him down there's no idea of Paul Bunyan why so you don't do that that was a dumb thing to do so Ruth and I went to France four years ago and we did a kind of it we were in England first that was fun and then we went to France and they they got us a car that had GPS that would speak English and we would do a meeting I do a meeting from 8:00 till noon and then we'd hop in the car and turn on GPS and go to the next town and somebody meet us for supper and show us around that town and we do another meeting the next day and whatever it's kind of interesting trip but every town we went to they had to show us their castle so we went looked at the castle when you got the grain bins and got and they all kind of looked pretty impressive and took a lot of energy to build them and and a lot of work and a lot of wealth and whatever and you you know you go in and now you got the grain bins there where did where did you produce the grain that went in the grain bins they said well on the land right around the castle so you look over the wall and it was so degraded it wouldn't even grow bushes very well and you'd point that out that maybe that was one of the reasons it's no longer castle and when we looked at their soils this is what they look like and this is what they look like and they're still plowing them and they're plowing them deeper and they're plowing up and down the hills and there's places are plowing down the hills because they can't plow across the hills and they can't plow up the oats that can't pull it so they drive up and plow down and so I I started the discussion by saying my ancestors left Europe to come to the United States because they degraded the soil so badly that they had in Europe that they had to go someplace else and find soils that weren't degraded and then I said they've done a good job of degrading the soils that they find in the US ok this area is part of the Louisiana Purchase Louisiana Purchase happened because they're the Lavi Andre brothers came from Winnipeg Manitoba they were fur traders and they came across the Continental Divide in eastern North Dakota if you didn't know there is one there is one there between the Red River drainage and the Missouri River drainage right there between Valley City Inn and Jamestown there's a Continental Divide it's about this high okay and and they came across that Continental Divide that came down the Missouri River and they buried lead plates in different areas of around here we don't know how many they built they buried but one was buried just above Fort Pierre and you can see that one in in the the Heritage Museum and it claimed this area for France that was 17 43 so the white man had been here quite a while you know pretty pretty actually before the Revolutionary War we had white guys running around out here claiming they're here for France you know pretty optimistic guys there too and in the our founding fathers George Washington Thomas Jefferson and those guys were way back in the early part of our nation the late 70s 1700s a few years more increased surreality will drive the inhabitants of the Atlantic states westward for support they were degrading the soils and they knew that and they were trying to figure out what to do about it whereas if they were taught how to improve the old instead of going on to in pursuit of the new and productive soils they would make these acres which now scarcely yield him anything turned out beneficial to themselves George Washington he and Thomas Jefferson had lots of conversation about how stupid it was that they continued to degrade the soils that's 300 200 whatever years ago David Montgomery wrote a book dirt if you haven't read it it's kind of interesting reading this photo here was taken in South Dakota in the 1930s because we were doing that when I went to Gettysburg in the 1970s to teach high school chemistry not not AG dejan chemistry people don't understand that you couldn't be assured that you would make it to Pierre and back if you left Gettysburg go to Pierre in the wintertime you wouldn't be assured you're going to get home if the wind started to blow because everybody was doing wheat and summer fell in that country okay talking about his dirt book at a meeting and they said you know in the teachers line I mean speakers loans that you have at these bigger conferences I sat down with him I said you know you really should come and revisit that area north appear again and see what's happened there because it's changed and he comes subsequently wrote this book growing a revolution which has a chapter about some of the guys in that area in fact my carnal teas in that in that book they talked about his his operation okay but anyway Thomas Jefferson realized that they had to do something so in 1803 he bought the Louisiana Purchase and then he sent Lewis and Clark up the river right here's where two cold Lakes is by the way right in there but they came through here so we know what this land looked like before before we got here and start screwing it up but what they were looking for were beavers was the first thing that's what the lobby hunters weren't looking for beavers and they took all the beavers out well what were the beavers doing here all these dams and all these little tributaries all the way from Black Hills down down River through Missouri whatever so you take all the beavers out then you send the settlers in and the settlers start to do tillage they cut down with few trees there are and they start over grazing and we have flooding now what should the response be put the Beavers back and quit doing that stuff you're doing right no no we're we're not that smart so we're gonna put in large main stem reservoirs we're European males right that's what we do we go put in large main stem reservoirs we've got four in South Dakota they're gonna they're gonna give us 500,000 acres of irrigation over around Redfield because that was flat in the 1930s and 40s you can't irrigate land that's rolling you have to have this stuff that you can run the water down between the rows and we all know that you couldn't produce corn and soybeans at Redfield without irrigation for God's sake and it's kind of like Nebraska they don't think they can produce anything without irrigation ray did you notice that so they built a big dam and they build a big power plan and they built an irrigation pump station that's never been used and they built a whole bunch of canals so I I show people the canals when they come to visit if they're going the right direction we show them this huge huge canals that were built to take the water from the Missouri River over to the Jim River but when I went to red field in 1983 and by there a Ray managed the same farm I managed it the one at red field one time in its existence we both had the same major professor in our PhDs we have a lot of parallels but when I went to red field in 1983 there was nineteen hundreds of soybeans and and Brown County combined and I made the mistake on my PhD orals to say that I thought if we no tilled we could probably grow corn and soybeans in the Jim River Valley without irrigation and Larry fine whoo-hoo ray remembers nobody else does but he thought I didn't understand water very well so he he really made my life miserable for an hour or so in my orals but he lived long enough to see no-till and different crop production move into the Jim River Valley which now those two counties are the number one number two corn producing counties in the state and I was told before we came to Pierre that we would never produce hundred bushel dryland corn it in used County I was told that George and I made a bet on it so we won that bet several years in a row before the guy to say he didn't want to do that anymore but it just it talks to the idea of we haven't in the old days we didn't use water well the thing that we have done no-till is just a tool the thing we're doing is using water better that's really what we're about so in 1973 we had a whole bunch of guys got all excited about the Russian wheat deal energy prices were low 1970 and interest rates were low in 1973 everybody started putting in irrigation along the Missouri River it's because somebody had invented a center pivot we didn't need to we didn't need to have a level ground to irrigate anymore so these guys start pumping water out of the Missouri River and irrigating and it ran promptly back down the hill into the river because our soils were these wind blowing less soils and they when they got tilled which everybody said to grow irrigated corn you got to have it black and then we put water on it just look like this floor and that's kind of when I entered the scene have tried to figure out how to stop runoff under irrigate errs and that's where those efforts led to a meeting after a field day one night at Bob Steakhouse where people said we really need to have more research effort long the center in the western part of the state and another guy said well I'll get my brother-in-law who's in the legislature to get you some land and I said why don't you leave your brother-in-law alone let's see if we can't get our own land instead of having the state own it so we can control it so that's the way that started its own and directed by farmers all fixed facilities of land and much of the irrigation equipment owned by the corporation and things like that right again the comparison of corn soybeans spring late winter wheat and sunflower production those three areas increased by one point six billion in 2014 as compared to 1986 we didn't do that because we set out to improve yields the goal was to better manage our water because that's what we're having trouble with we weren't getting the water in the ground better manage your nutrients and this is what this whole movements about whether you call it soil health that you call it no-till or you whatever you call it it's about better managing the ecosystem we have to do a better job or we're going to end up looking like the Europeans where they're totally degraded soils we've only been at this for 200 years so what we did is look at how the native systems work because they water goes in the ground and native systems and you don't have the salty spots and native systems normally and we call this a transformational change or a holistic report approach I stole this from Jay Fuhrer who said he stole it from somebody else but it's one of my favorite statements the light bulb did not result by incrementally making candles better you know you think about that it's just go okay yeah that makes sense you know back and often and so what we've been doing a lot of times in agriculture were just incrementally changing what is really a system that's been broken since it was in Europe instead of just saying now this is stupid let's do something else farmer manages ecosystem take sunlight water and carbon dioxide and makes them into products to be sold and we look at this water cycle energy flow mineral cycle community dynamics and there's lots of places where we have talked about how we do that does the brain feed plants and recharge groundwater or runoff or deep percolate if you're running your water off and you live at wall you that's a problem you don't want to do that okay yeah that's what's wrong here we can now put on 2 inches of water in 9 minutes with our irrigate errs and we have nothing runoff and if you come into summertime and many of you've been there we walk in behind those irrigate errs and it totally changes your way of looking at things and it's because we have this armor we don't have the armor there because we think that's cute it's there because it protects the soil keeps the weeds from going keeps the soil cool does all these things people so I really like to use that big hole opener makes that wheat grow better well now you have no more armor ok you gotta have that armor and that that that whole process starts it there's where earthworms live they're protected for anybody has been around irrigation this is 20 years we tract if you've been around irrigation those things always had big ruts in them and when we first started doing this we had our Board of Directors from the coal lakes the guys that were irrigating we're irrigating with tillage come to Redfield one day and we had a lateral move they're running on some no-till drop and we went out to look at crops and I'm walking along I'm talking together yeah then turn around I have no farmers behind me they're all lightened up on one of my wheel tracks going why isn't that deeper and I hadn't really ever thought about that you know they didn't set out to make shallow wheel tracks and they noticed it because there's weren't that way take the e out of it evapotranspiration ET the evaporation makes you know money when you make the water go through a plant it makes you money when you make it let it just float off the surface it doesn't make you any money so one of the ideas behind this forage cover cropping thing is to try to take something that would have to evaporate to make it dry enough for you to plant or whatever and make it go through go through a plant and yesterday at in Nebraska we had two young farmers that were on a panel and they're both talking about well you know one of the things I really like now than a no-till would that cover crops and whatever I can drive in that field anytime we want to and I don't think in that don't make rice and all that kind of stuff doesn't happen year one but they've noticed now that that is starting to happen make water in or the soil and then maximize the water holding capacity by building the organic matter we've talked about those things today this is a good idea for irrigation is a great idea for those without irrigation like you guys so most of our impact has actually been on the non irrigation part of of the country most of the guys that were irrigating in in nineteen seventy six have quit because their lifts are too high and they grow they make more money per dollar invested by far on their dry land they would irrigation irrigation is expensive and it costs you a lot of money everyday and it and it's it it's high management and it gets obsolete and it has issues there's places where a Geisha makes sense but you shouldn't be competing as you know and tell you tell you've used every drop of water that Mother Nature gives you as efficiently as you can you shouldn't even think about irrigation ecosystems harvest sunlight right and that drive all other processes sunlight energy that's stored in the residue removing these products from the ecosystem reduces the energy available so if you're taking off all your residue which they are in a lot of places there's nothing to drive that soil biology everybody keeps talking about the soil biology well the soil biology you've got to feed them and they eat residue got a guy from Iowa called me that day and they gonna harvest his corn they're gonna take all he's a dairy you got agreement with the dairy he's gonna harvest these corn and then they're gonna take cut off and rake up and Bale all these corn stalks and he says I want to continue the no-till my soybeans how do I do that we've got a lot more things to discuss and just how you're gonna know tell your soybean that's one of the reasons we're doing the thing with livestock it has to do with the residue and cycling the residue so there's one of our cover crops that mixture of barley oats and peas and whatever and we slice that you've seen these photos there's winter wheat growing back in there so we got the living root it was in winter wheat during the summer but we also have winter wheat going back there and it'll be there next spring and then we'll kill it before we plant the corn in this case and this that thing stays nice and green in there one of the things that I don't know if Cody mentioned it but the stuff we bailed this year those wasps we be able to make the comparison so we have the residue remove stuff so that's waswas pretty wet when we bailed it but it was a wet fall and and so we've had to feed those bales because they were going bad whereas a swath is fine finding the really bad stuff and that's velocity of the day no day went in really wet because of the wet fall sauce it when it's pretty wet it's fine so there's there's our our mamas and their babies eating their swass but the question always comes up there's a swath get spread out if you move that thing a little bit every day they clean it right up but you can see the are more steel in there that swath reat stubble still and they leave that alone it lays down and everybody's happy okay more cows more goats more sheep number one meat eaten in the world is goat okay so and they're good at getting rid of Candida thistle so you might want to get excited about this but there's no way to feed the people in the world in the future if we're going to take me to way the only way to take marginal land and turn it into human edible protein produce human edible protein on upgrade the protein is to use ruminant animals and anybody that tries to tell you that we're going to have fake meat and all this stops they can't make feet fake meat on marginal land okay so if you're going to feed people we're going to have to use the animals which is fine that's what we should be doing anyway 100% grass-fed ground beef certified USDA where was this produced well we get some cows from Montana than never seen grain doesn't know what grain looks like some coal cows you haul them to them place in central or eastern South Dakota and you put them on cover crops and you fatten them on cover crops you take them in Omaha and you make them in hamburger okay so this is actually being done okay I don't know why me having trouble with that I'm probably doing something goofy all tillage tools Detroit destroys soil structure all tillage tools decreased water infiltration all tillage tools reduce organic matter and all tillage tools increase weeds 27,000 gallons of water with one percent organic matter in six inches of soil that's 1/4 of an inch of water we can increase the organic matter by four percent we've put in an extra inch in the top six inches and extra 2 inches on top foot grandpa had more organic matter than you do he came here because it had a high organic matter he mined it that's fine now you have to quit doing that what about pests well let's talk about aphids given the high rate of reproduction by aphid certain levels continue increase all summer a photography males that give birth to pregnant females see you know all the guys in the in the audience should be afraid because you could be out of business if you're in the aphid world if your next reincarnation you're born is an aphid you're really trouble so pregnant females that give birth to pregnant females you should grow high populations but we don't because a fat population dynamics depend on levels of natural enemies temperature and that kind of thing 7 spotted lady beetle females 8 on average 100 15 soybean aphids in 24 hours a male eat 78 the end starts of little things that look like dragons 8 105 the other kind eats 95 males 54 not quite as hungry great so when you go to check on me a fridge you got in your weed or how many aphids you got in your soybeans you also count 2 ladybugs wait a week walk at the farm a few years ago and the entomologist was saying oh well he's way above thresholds and I smiled and whatever and we went home that night rooster not gonna spray are you I said well I'm gonna look at a Monday because I have lots of lady birds in there and the temperature was going to get hot Monday or Tuesday they're all gone okay so no one knows the number one thing that kills a foot is fungi 84% soybean aphids got whacked by this one fungi so if we know the number one thing that kills aphids is fungi number two are these predators and somebody tells you if we're going to come out and spray some herbicide now why don't we just throw a little fungicide a little insecticide in that and it just doesn't cost very much and it can't do any harm see you're gonna kill all your predator seven species of aphid found seven species of Asian pathogenic fungi were found in them in 2003 and for overuse of fungicide can cause insect outbreaks if we use too many fungicides you kill you kill the the predatory fungi so we had this cover crop few years ago my neighbor come over and we were you know it was what a pollinator type thing it was a mustard and it's all flowering just full of bugs he's aren't you gonna spray this I said why would I spray this see what his bugs in here most bugs are good bugs some of these weren't good bugs but I didn't want to harvest his crop anyway I said I'm feeding my predators so I'm gonna have predators around next year when the when the bad bugs show up I got to feed him something to keep him around and let them have babies and stuff so they're ready right over-reliance and herbicides leads to resistant weeds and maybe disease problems everybody talks about these resistant weeds one of the problems we have is we have too many bacterial diseases now because we use surfactants too frequently the things like bacterial leaf spot and whatever what what bacteria do is they penetrate into leave if you put a surfactant on a week in the wax you're going get more disease fungicides herbicides and insecticides have collateral damage their disturbance to the system ray mentioned chloride when we get a chloride we always put a little chloride on with our wheat because chloride helps the wheat protect itself from disease so we don't have to put the fungicide on so we just put a little bit on there so it has high high chloride concentration high disturbance techniques HOH drills and such and in vertical tillage increase weed pressure and cause soil erosion and this this is tillage erosion we pull the top of the hills down as I came north from Columbus yesterday up through Norfolk and in the Yankton came home that way have all these big rolling less hills down there blew up by the Missouri River bottom and they're still doing tillage on them and the tops of the hills are going down to the bottom I couldn't believe they were still doing that okay the way we control pests is we use sanitation rotation and competition pesticides are only part of Sanitation to keep weeds from going to seed for instance they're only part of rotation what I want to do in terms of competition is to keep a weed small enough that my crop can compete with it fertilizer placement ray doesn't care about fertilizer placement I do because I don't want my weeds to have it so I'm going to place my fertilizer either in a place or a time when it's not going to benefit to weed something like Palmer amaranth is a huge and feeder and if you if you broadcast nitrogen on you're just feeding the wheat so we're gonna place our fertilizer three inches from the corn row at the same depth or the sorghum roll I don't care where its roots are II just don't want the weeds to get to it so I'm going to put it where the plant my plant my beneficial plant can compete with the weeds ecosystem the lake nutrients for extended periods of time become deserts saline seats and you have some of them out here is because we aren't using and cycling the water in the nutrient like it should be a nutrient placement is part of cycling I'm a farmer takes sunlight water and carbon dioxide and make products that I can sell and Ray said to me earlier today in a private conversation what we need to do is be getting to the point where we're selling stuff instead of selling commodities selling stuff that we can sell in the internet you guys all know how to do that that's old guys don't know how to do that but young guys not do that so we're going to produce something and sell it and there's people that want to buy stuff that's produced sustainably or regenerative Lee or whatever at a half an hour conversation the other day on a telephone on the way down to Nebraska I stopped on top of Hill had a half an hour conversation to the person in charge of sustainability for Cargill ok and we've got to be able to give them a product state that we can defend and say this is done the right way the best environmental way the best food safety way and and this is the way we do it focus on having the soil wet during the dry part of the year instead of just focusing on having it dry during wet part of the year so you can be the first guy to get done planting right and you know it every year people come and I got a neighbor that works a heck out of his ground and sometimes his corns bigger than mine the last week in the June last Thursday in June most time it isn't but sometimes it is and guys a look at things away his corns bigger than yours and I used to go through a long explanation now I just say oh I didn't know you harvested corn in June and I turn around and walk away and then kind of Bend the end of that conversation focus on having the soil cool during the hot part of the year roots don't like it hot and they don't do a good job of taking up nutrients if they're hot that cover that armor it keeps the soil cool so we can have it cool during that hot part of the year that's important to irrigation people it's imperative to rain-fed farming mother nature's an opportunist if you have a problem weed these insect I don't care you provide the opportunity somewhere in your system here's resistant kosher that we developed on purpose in the early 1990s to prove we could it's resistant to pursuit because I said I predicted that was going to happen the company threatened to lawsuit if I didn't retract so I just developed my own and then that negated that whole lawsuit thing that's that's kosher right there that's chickpeas hiding in there just for my carnally that's sick t-mike but we didn't have much at that period of time to control anything in chickpeas he surely couldn't use it now the cross compliant the cross resistance came because those kosha I went and got from somebody that had been overusing glean so it's not just a pursuit thing it's all oversight said if we don't use them properly now what happens there oh here let's look at the how this happens if in the old days and you guys used to have a little bit of downy Brome here you don't have it anymore right it's gone Scott you don't have any cheatgrass scene where do you he's just grinning but that used to be a huge problem because it did a rotation that provided huge opportunities and randiandersen made this statement two years of warm season crops or a fallow unusual warm season crop and a fallow reduced number seeds by 95% so we did wheat corn fallow the old eco fallow thing we could take care of cheatgrass same thing happens with warm season weeds like the Palmer amaranth or waterhemp or something like that and the reason that works is let's take foxtail it emerges Palmer arm amaranth same time after the corns plan that goes to flower before the corn is harvested so it has its whole lifecycle here and it can compete in the early phases if I put winter wheat in that thing hasn't emerged winter we weed has full canopy and it it's harvested before that thing goes to flower and you can control it just very simple thing we had long term rotation study maybe some of you remember that warm and cool season crops everything was done no-till is in linemen counting on some promise tiles we did that for 12 years and in the 13th year Randy Anderson came out we had a what we had to do was was planted all uniformly to a wheat crop which we did and he came out and counted the number of weeds in the different rotations where we did week chickpea for 12 years he found 94 weeds where we did wheat corn chickpea found 40 where we did a more diverse rotation that he found seven Clara Seamus who allow do you still remember had a similar type study where he used in anhydrous tonight for once every four years other than that he was no tilling and he had a loader he had a high diversity sunflower wheat corn spring wheat and he had a low diversity wheat millet rotation and and Randy did the same thing with his and what we found was the same trend highest with a low diversity Louis with high diversity rotation but since I didn't do any disturbance I did better the real comparison there is tillage and poor rotation 225 weeds per square yard or square meter no-till and good rotation 7 weeks 97% weed control just with cultural practices that has to do with disturbance so if you're thinking well dad just gonna go out and disc a little bit right I mean one of the one of the things I used to tell guys cuz they'd want to start no tilling but dad didn't want or the uncle didn't want to get rid of the machinery just in case we might need it I said fine ok just tell them you'll do that but you know to protect some tires and hydraulic cylinders take the height tires off and hydraulic cylinders off before you park it over in the edges and then they really won't be tempted to start up and go out and screw with it when you go on vacation right so because that used to happen at times kid goes on vacation dad goes disc bunch around just just to make it better he took Green Fox Hill place at 3 deaths in the soil zero two and four inches and he looked at number of live seeds yearly okay after two years if he left it on the surface only 11 percent were still alive buried 2 inches 28 percent buried four inches 55% if you're doing disturbance are constantly digging up and burying and makin seeds go dormant you can't control the weed seed bank so to prove that even further we took four places at Dakota Lakes I let little areas go to all the weeds grow and go to seed once and then he tilled a small area and left a small area you're not not tilled and then when we put herbicide on these areas we put a tarp over top of them so they never got herbicides on them and he counted the seedlings yearly for three years okay first you're not much different from tilled in no-till second year not much difference it's when you have that two year break that you get the big difference corn pea winter wheat corn if you got a weed that goes to seed in the corn that you really can't control in corn you can get rid of ninety-six percent of it if you're just doing every other year you can't so there's a typical thing if we drive a little wide with our winter wheat or don't really get a runaway in terms of weeds so real quickly rotation types simple rotations this is the one most people think about wheat corn canola spring wheat winter wheat corn sunflower corn soybean wheat fallow whatever they're simple they're predictable limited number of crops the managing market this is what a lot of people are doing but they're very predictable to the insects and such rotations with perennial sequences which I think we're going to have to use we're going to have to put those deep roots in that Cody was talking about and we can if we we can do a stupid rotation for about six years and then put it in a perennial for three or four or the only thing I don't like about this is I'd rather see grasses in there but there's lots of examples of those limited number annual crops demands your market excellent place to spread manure if you spread manure you can probably produce more soil structure with annual than annual crops because the grass specially the grass mixtures disadvantage you've got a Cody pointed out today that we got that new rotation we started we're only putting in a perennial five years out of 20 now I'm not sure that's enough okay compound rotations where we take two rotations and make them into simple rotations make them more complex we were talking about one of these at noon spring late winter wheat corn soybean corn soybean half the corn is behind soybeans and half the corns behind wheat if you're over in the Jim River Valley that's probably a good good rotation for you because you can grow pretty good corn behind soybeans as you get further west you can't do that you got to have more moisture I call this a mother-in-law a blanket rotation because the mother-in-law banker comes to visit you in June you show them this corn planted in the soybean looks great if they come in August or September most likely you'll take him out and show them the stuff that was in the in the wheat stubble okay still have a limited number of crops to manage creates more than one sequence for some crop types if you grow corn behind beans every year you're going to get corn rootworm beetles at five from the corn field the soybean fields to lay their eggs that's happened in Eastern Corn Belt if we grow if everybody here grew corn behind wheat we would get corn rootworm apply to the wheat stubble to lay their eggs so we got to try to be not predictable complex rotations we're crop to the same crop type varies so we started putting in bill barley instead of to wheats we got barley or oats we got most sunflower and pea that kind of thing has some advantages very capable creating a wide array of crop type by sequence combinations sorghum and corn have advantages and disadvantages but they complement each other it takes a lot more crop management skills but this is why we pay you guys the big bucks right it's not you got to have the management skills it's not because you can drive a tractor straight anymore because I got auto steer so now how the tractors going across the field you can work on your management stacked rotations is the one that surprised us and that we developed and we didn't really realize the power until laters where we put the same crop or crop type twice in a row and the idea is to do that to get the long break the secret here is the long break to let that weed population go down right and so and once it's down it takes a couple of years for it to come back up again so we do two and then get out of there and we got a four year break before we come back to that crop again okay we keep the pest population diverse or confused diversity in sequence and intervals its mix along and sort residual herbicide programs for you guys out here if you're afraid of atrazine because the low rainfall if you stack to warm season grasses corn or sorghum or millet one after the other you can use a higher rate of atrazine in the first one that's one of the most powerful things you can do it's cheap atrazine is cheap and you can do that kind of stuff and especially if you're doing grazing things ok 2 year break between corn and wheat so you don't have to worry about the head scab thing but the goal is to allow sufficient time for press pressures declined to very low levels before sequencing the crop or crop type 2 times and we can reduce the rest of developing bio type resistance we grew the cost of herbicide programs some crop sequences may not be ideal we really don't stack broad leaves very often but the goal is to be in inconsistent in both sequence and interval so look at your rotation same there how predictable am i right to you it might look predictable to insects I mean if you're just doing something that allows them to develop some habit in the in the court in the Western Corn Belt for instance corn-soybean guys now have corn rootworm beetles where the eggs don't hatch for two years instead of hatching first year because it's always one year so they figured that one out that's why they've got to use BT and all that stuff where we don't have to here's some rotations utilizing most actin and in normal sequences canola winter wheat corn the two corns and then the rest of it's not stacked we got one we use on the farm on the north unit where we do two eats a pea and then we do a sorghum corn actually up there and then and then pea I guess that's one here right here when our wheat winter wheat sunflower sorghum corn pea and this one really is a some kind of an oil seeped might be flax whatever dryland rotations again those that's where those at you'll be able to get these slides too but there's no set recipe or best rotation the everybody needs to pick their own it's going to vary with fields it's going to vary with if your neighbor has resistant kosher and he lets it blow across yeah it's going to vary with a lot of things and including you know your personal lifestyle wouldn't when do you want to have a little vacation time in the summer or whatever show you a few slides there's a rotation in 2006 that wheat let didn't look very good 2006 very dry year and right across the road that's what the winter wheat looked like what was the difference there and you can see it from an aerial photo the good-looking wheat was in this corn pea winter wheat had been in that rotation since 1990 this was 2006 and this one was soybean corn pea winter wheat half broadleafs half low residue we didn't have the armor and look at that week okay what's it mean in yields 2006 60 versus 29 bushel 7.9 inches of rain from the time we harvested two peas until we harvested the wheat in 2005 when we got 23 inches 92 versus 50 seven in 2002 which is the first time this happened 6.4 inches in a year 56 versus 28 I can't afford to do I hear this all the time I can't afford to grow yes I can't afford to do this I've got to do the high a value of things I've got to do the low residue things could it make me more money they don't make you more money if you look at this type of response this rotation just doesn't have enough high residue so we've taken the soybeans out Cody mentioned this and now we put we have these this three way just looks like this three way same thing other than we have a five-year perennial sequence in there and in 17 or 18 years we're going to have good information and when I explained that to Cody one day said you better keep riding your bicycle if you're going to be around here to watch that what happens where there is lots of water surely they don't need to worry about this right so corn corn soybean wheat soybean first-year soybeans 76 bushels second year soybeans 81 this is under irrigation if I just do corn soybeans I get sixty two point nine bushel so if I average those two from the other one seventy eight point eight versus sixty two point nine so the guy doing corn soybeans is getting less soybean yields how about corn yields well continuous corn we've had corn in one field since 1990 it's about two hundred three bushel the acre average type thing corn soybeans to seventeen corn corn soybean wheat soybean the two corns average the first ones like 250 or so the second ones 217 or 220 235 okay so what if I grew 5,000 acres of that I get a million bushels if I got 5,000 acres of corn I got a million bushels of corn and a big-ass dryer lot the trucks I mean wow but there's guys that do that and think they make money okay corn-soybean I got 2500 acres of corn I got 2500 acres of soybeans corn corn soybean wheat soybean I got 2,000 acres of corn 2,000 acres of soybeans on thousand acres of wheat and there's the bushels okay would you trade 7,200 bushels of corn for 120,000 bushels of wheat today see that's what the numbers show yeah and that can't afford to do anything but corn soybean I produce more bushels of soybeans on 2,000 acres of soybeans in this rotation than you do on 2,500 acres of soybeans on that rotation interesting can't afford to do that with all grain over here can't afford not to first time I went to Argentina they were doing seven years of pastures and seven years of cropping and then there cropping was no-till with cover crops and diversity corn wheat beans and I had a friend of mine we dug out a little bit of soil and he held it up and if you want to talk about what is a healthy soil that's a healthy soil and then they outlawed the export of beef get rid of the beef thing can export beef keep all the beef for the poor people well guys the poor people can't eat enough beasts they can't pay enough for it so the guy started got rid of the beef and started growing soybeans on soybeans I went back in 2006 and it looked like this exactly the same fuel and went back a year ago that's last fall they haven't change that yet and now they have lake showing up where they never had lakes they have rivers showing up where there were never rivers because they've got the water cycle broken so bad knee we can't expect our governments and our companies and whatever to understand the importance of maintaining our soil resource we have to do this ourselves organic matter makes a difference there's our daughters who are much older than that now and one of them might come by often in here pretty soon but this is a prairie plant and and and Cody's showed you one of those right compare that to what you get with wheat and whatever and that cycles these nutrients back to the surface of your ph's are dropping your light you got lying down here but you keep pushing it down goes sideways becomes a Saline seat bring it back up get it on the surface but if you haul that off and take it to a feedlot Cody showed you that too today that nutrient doesn't get back to the fields all tillage tools are soy so structural tillage tools decreased water infiltration right people I got to vertical tillage thing I got this tillage thing got that thing though it works great no it does it Mother Nature doesn't do tillage till they just agriculture what fracturing is to petroleum they both increase the speed and extent of nutrient removal from the resource leaving the resource degraded that's not what we're about we're not miners I did ask the North Dakota and the Alberta people and I was there earlier this year what's the hurry why don't you leave some of that some of that oil there for your grandkids I mean do you not like your descendants why are you mad at them why do you got to get rid of it all right away I mean you don't think we're going to use some of that down the road 100 200 years okay some expert proposed using tillage as a means to address weeds resistance if tillage was so good at getting rid of weeds they should all be gone by now and that goes through the science of that but I'm not going to okay thank you very much you've been a pleasure [Applause]
