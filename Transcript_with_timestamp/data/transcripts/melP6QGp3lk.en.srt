00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,359
welcome to an introduction to drip

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,599
irrigation

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,200
this key farm element can be part of a

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,040
sustainable farm system

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,080
that considers conservation of natural

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,920
resources farm economic sustainability

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,680
and produce safety in the next few

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,359
minutes you will hear and see an

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,400
overview of drip irrigation

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,880
implementation for farm enhancement from

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,199
a whole farm planting perspective

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,240
installing a drip irrigation system may

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,040
lower your cost

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,680
and your food safety risks there is also

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,840
no doubt

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,680
that installing an irrigation system

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,760
also protects the farm

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,719
income from the financial effects of

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,719
drought

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,719
drip irrigation also called micro

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,120
irrigation or trickle irrigation

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,760
provides a slow and steady source of

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,559
water

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,480
right on or below the soil surface drops

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,800
of tiny streams move through emitters

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,600
each emitter delivers a metered amount

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,399
of water

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
some drip systems are in line and some

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,280
have

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,879
detached emitters that can be placed

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,720
along the drip lines

32
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,880
the water is distributed by these

33
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,280
emitters and provide a consistent source

34
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,960
of water across the bed by keeping the

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,320
foliage free of excess water

36
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,720
you can reduce the spread of plant

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,119
disease this system is not the best

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,159
choice for crops that require frost or

39
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,920
freeze protection

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,360
or cooling which involves overhead

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,439
delivery for maximum

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,360
effectiveness applying the water

43
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,240
directly to the root zone also reduces

44
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,200
the potential

45
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,720
of water to serve as a vehicle for human

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,600
pathogen contamination

47
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,640
to the edible portion of your crop since

48
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,119
it is possible

49
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,320
for soil insects or rodents to enter the

50
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,400
irrigation system

51
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,360
through broken lines carefully inspect

52
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,960
the system

53
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,960
to keep the water supply safe

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,439
this system reduces your water uses so

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,320
it can also save you money on your

56
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,880
electric

57
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,799
or water bill another advantage is the

58
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,079
ability to apply chemicals through your

59
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,079
irrigation lines

60
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,079
this helps keeps them from spreading on

61
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,719
a windy day and potentially

62
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,200
contaminating a public water source or a

63
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,680
crop

64
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,360
you don't intend to treat carefully

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,440
managing fertilizer applications through

66
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,920
drip irrigation and flushing the soil

67
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,360
with water when necessary are important

68
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,599
in a high tunnel

69
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,599
since the building up of salts is

70
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,640
possible with this system

71
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,440
tools like flow meters to automate the

72
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,239
delivery

73
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,280
of precise amounts of water timers and

74
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,840
soil moisture

75
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,720
sensors can help you monitor the use of

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,680
your water

77
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,200
safely and efficiently the usda natural

78
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,800
resource conservation service can

79
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,640
provide financial assistance

80
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,480
for implementation of conservation

81
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,840
practices through the environmental

82
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,640
quality incentives program

83
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,319
and the conservation stewardship program

84
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,280
nrcs and extension

85
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,920
can also provide technical expertise to

86
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,680
help

87
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,720
implementing drip irrigation on your

88
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,840
farm drip irrigation is a common way to

89
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,400
conserve water

90
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,959
reduce plant disease reduce food safety

91
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:05,840
risks

92
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:05,840
and reduce costs
