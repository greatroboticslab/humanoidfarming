1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,960
foreign

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,800
my name is Joe Sanford I am a professor

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,100
at UW Platteville in the school of AG

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,840
I'm also associated with the Wisconsin

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,880
Dairy Innovation Hub

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,740
um and so today I'm going to talk a

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,080
little bit about some of the ongoing

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,920
research we have going into adding

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,520
biochar into manure management

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,780
and so before we start getting into it

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,440
too much

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,140
um

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,320
what is biochar for those who may not be

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,260
as familiar with it biochar is a product

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,719
of a process called pyrolysis where

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,879
essentially we're just taking a biomass

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,719
that can really be any organic biomass

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,199
wood chips corn Stover straw manure

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,199
putting it into a reactor with low

20
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:04,320
oxygen content at very high temperatures

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,720
we're talking 600 and 900 degrees

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,880
Fahrenheit or higher and out of this

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,760
process what we end up with is a syngas

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,080
and a bio oil both of these products can

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,939
be used for energy production or Heating

26
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,340
and then we end up with a biochar as

27
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,100
well which is this charcoal looking

28
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,720
material down here

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,580
here's some material that's been made in

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,159
our lab from a lot of different things

31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,159
and so biochar has a lot of interesting

32
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,259
characteristics very similar to

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,060
activated carbon not the same thing but

34
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,880
does have some similar characteristics

35
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,759
it has a very high carbon content it has

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,100
a high surface area alkaline pH and

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,200
generally has a fairly good exchange

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,299
capacity with nutrients and other

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,700
elements

40
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,020
and so biochar has been around for quite

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,500
a while

42
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,240
um and it's been primarily used as a

43
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,759
soil amendment

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,079
um and so biochar has been applied to a

45
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,420
lot of different types of soils a lot of

46
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,520
different production systems

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,320
um and you know the kind of conclusions

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,300
from a lot of the research you can find

49
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,400
out there is that it's been shown to

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,160
help improve nutrient retention this is

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,500
a study that was done by a graduate

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,319
student in my old Lab at UW-Madison with

53
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,959
Becky Larson that found that soils

54
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,000
amended with biochar that receive manure

55
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,319
application if we amended it with

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,060
biochar we could see significant

57
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,280
reductions in total nitrogen leaching

58
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,400
significant reductions in in nitrate

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,040
leaching as well it's also been found to

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,940
increase water use efficiency and

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,120
sandier soils increase aeration

62
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:44,280
and porosity and more clay soils some

63
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,080
Studies have found it to reduce soil

64
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,720
emissions I put a little asterisk there

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,099
because the research isn't really

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,560
conclusive yeah there's a lot of

67
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:54,420
different opinions on this right now

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,580
um but a big one that's receiving a lot

69
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,640
of tension right now is biochar's

70
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,440
potential to sequester carbon and so

71
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,060
um if you're in in ag I'm sure you've

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,280
heard about all the carbon credits going

73
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,340
around anaerobic digestion things like

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,580
that carbon sequestration is a is

75
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,459
becoming a Hot Topic and

76
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,120
um agriculture is kind of seen as as the

77
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:19,980
place for biochar and this quest to

78
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,800
sequester carbon is kind of the place

79
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,720
for that biochar to go and so one thing

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,140
my research group has been looking at is

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,580
yes it'd be nice to apply biochar to

82
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,920
sequester carbon improve nutrient

83
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,620
intention things like that but how else

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,019
might we be able to use biochar in a

85
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,159
manure management system to

86
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:43,200
get more benefits out of the product

87
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,540
and so what my research group at

88
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,879
Platteville has been doing has been

89
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,519
looking at different areas that we can

90
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,400
add biochar into the manure management

91
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,200
system one of these areas is compost

92
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,879
this is probably one of the most studied

93
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,260
areas when it comes to waste management

94
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,959
and biochar is composting biochar has

95
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,060
been found to have some benefits in

96
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,099
composting particularly around nitrogen

97
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,140
retention in the form of nitrogen in the

98
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,640
compost

99
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,980
we've also seen out of Europe quite a

100
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,320
bit of research into actually

101
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:19,380
incorporating biochar into animal feed

102
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,699
as well right now I'm not actively

103
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,079
looking into those there's some

104
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,600
literature out there I'd be happy to

105
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,699
share with anyone that's interested but

106
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,080
my research group right now has been

107
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,479
looking at

108
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,880
actually using that manure from manure

109
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,440
solid so if we have solid liquid

110
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,720
separator we're separating out those

111
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,580
solids taking those solids drying them

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,540
down and converting them into biochar as

113
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,699
a another potential export from the farm

114
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:47,400
we've also been looking at using it as a

115
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,259
cover on the top of manure storages and

116
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,419
also incorporating it into anaerobic

117
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,340
digestion systems and so for the rest of

118
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,199
my my time I'm going to talk a little

119
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,180
bit about these these different studies

120
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,919
that we have ongoing and some of the

121
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,919
preliminary results we've been seeing

122
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,040
so making biochar out of manure

123
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,860
um this was a project that I started on

124
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,840
uh back at you uh in UW at UW-Madison

125
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,060
with Becky Larson

126
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,419
um looking at phosphorus Management in

127
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,220
Wisconsin and biochar and um for those

128
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,080
of you who may not are

129
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,080
in Most states where we have a lot of

130
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,300
livestock production a lot of kfos we

131
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,400
have an issue where you know we have a

132
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,320
concentration of animals we have a

133
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,240
concentration of manure and generally

134
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,100
Around The Farmstead that manure is

135
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,720
being applied and in particular in

136
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,520
Wisconsin we have a lot of issues with

137
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,220
the buildup of phosphorus in that soil

138
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,620
leading to some Legacy phosphorus issues

139
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,199
and so a lot of research has gone into

140
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,360
how can we better manage our manure

141
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,039
phosphorus particularly in areas where

142
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,620
we have high concentrations of animals

143
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:55,380
quite a few Studies have come out of the

144
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,780
ew Madison groups kind of looking at

145
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,600
different areas of concern and different

146
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,639
methods and the conclusion for it is is

147
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,919
that really we need to find a way to

148
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,320
help densify the phosphorus in manure

149
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:09,000
and try to export it from some

150
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,699
watersheds where we have a particularly

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,560
high amount of livestock production

152
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,000
um and so solid liquid separation is one

153
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,280
way to get a little bit of phosphorus

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,080
out a lot of Studies have found that

155
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,780
it's still a little too wet for

156
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,580
economically transport reporting fairly

157
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,380
significant distances and so what we've

158
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,080
been looking at is taking that manure

159
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,060
solid densifying it through the biocharb

160
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,520
or the pyrolysis process and then

161
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,720
shipping that out potentially as a as an

162
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,720
agronomic fertilizer

163
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:41,460
and so here's some results that we

164
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,759
published a couple years ago on this

165
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,520
topic here so the figure up here

166
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,979
um in my lab I have this little tiny

167
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,960
biochar unit this was the material that

168
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,759
went into the biochar the same mass and

169
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,039
this is what came out and so you can see

170
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,259
here there's a really large reduction in

171
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,940
the volume of that material it's a large

172
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,380
reduction in the mass of that material

173
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,539
well it makes it a little bit more

174
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,880
feasible than to potentially transport

175
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:07,319
further distances and so what we wanted

176
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,080
to look at in the first part of this

177
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,240
study was what happens to the nutrients

178
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,000
in the material

179
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,740
and so the figure on the left here this

180
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,240
is the phosphorus concentration this is

181
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,060
kind of what we're targeting here to see

182
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,500
how we could densify the phosphorus

183
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,319
taking the manure drying it and then

184
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,240
going to biochar at two different

185
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,819
temperatures what we found was that we

186
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,000
could really increase or densify that

187
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:35,280
phosphorus into this biochar product

188
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,240
when we did a mass balance through the

189
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,120
system

190
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,280
um we essentially lost no phosphorus so

191
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,199
we retained about 100 of the phosphorus

192
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,419
there's a little bit of losses probably

193
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,580
from user error

194
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,139
um but we retained all that phosphorus

195
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,960
and so we were able to densify that

196
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:53,340
phosphorus from the manure solids into a

197
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,740
very lightweight product that could

198
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,660
potentially then be shipped out on the

199
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,300
nitrogen side of things we did also see

200
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,340
a densification in terms of nitrogen in

201
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,039
the product so in terms of pounds of

202
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,800
nitrogen per ton

203
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:10,199
of wet weight we did see more nitrogen

204
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,819
in that material however if you did a

205
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,180
mass balance here what we found is we

206
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:17,039
lost about 40 to 60 percent of the

207
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,360
nitrogen when it went through pyrolysis

208
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,139
and this is primarily due to

209
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,419
volatilization of of nitrogen off of

210
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,039
that process

211
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,120
and so right now we're kind of looking

212
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,039
at

213
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,780
um you know yeah we can densify the

214
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,880
phosphorus what does that mean though if

215
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,219
we use it then as a fertilizer somewhere

216
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,200
else so we did a small incubation study

217
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,419
this is some results from that looking

218
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,279
at phosphorus available phosphorus and

219
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,260
some soil incubation studies over time

220
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,880
what we found was that compared to the

221
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,160
regular manure saws there's a little bit

222
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,320
of a lag in the biochar in terms of

223
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,200
available phosphorus first but over time

224
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,880
it was statistically the same all right

225
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,140
over the growing season so right now

226
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,180
what we're doing is we're transitioning

227
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,180
some larger field studies to keep

228
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,640
exploring this is an option and get some

229
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,380
more data and seeing how we can

230
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,860
incorporate into some of our production

231
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,940
systems in Wisconsin

232
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,480
the next area I want to talk about

233
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,720
adding a biochar to manure systems is uh

234
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,420
manure storages and so manure storages

235
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,540
are essential to a lot of our operations

236
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,560
particularly large operations

237
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,180
however there are some concerns

238
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,160
particularly around emissions so our

239
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,200
manure storages are going to emit quite

240
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,839
a bit of methane they're going to emit

241
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,519
some nitrous oxide and also some ammonia

242
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,880
or we're gonna have some nitrogen losses

243
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,860
from that manure storage and so changes

244
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,860
in the industry particularly water use

245
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,899
has resulted in manure storages looking

246
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,420
less like this and more like this not

247
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,459
having this natural crust and what we've

248
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,860
seen is that particularly ammonia

249
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:52,260
emissions have increased when we have no

250
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,260
crust on the surface and so what we want

251
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,360
to look at is can we use biochar as a

252
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,399
surface cover over these more liquidy

253
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,899
storages to help reduce particularly

254
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,220
ammonia emissions and maybe some

255
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,220
greenhouse gases as well

256
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,000
and so we've been working on some pilot

257
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,800
studies here about to transition some

258
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,399
larger scale studies

259
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,740
um and so what we've found is we had our

260
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,839
manure storages which were five gallon

261
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,880
buckets essentially we filled them with

262
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,740
manure we had some controls we applied

263
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,480
covers over the top of this so this is

264
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,519
some wood chips that were not processed

265
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,680
into biochar some wood chips that were

266
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,540
and we measured ammonia Emissions on a

267
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,339
weekly basis and also greenhouse gas

268
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,260
Emissions on a weekly basis to kind of

269
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:36,540
tracked what the emissions were and what

270
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,279
we found was pretty Stark in terms of

271
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,580
emissions of ammonia from that control

272
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:44,640
wood chips we also did a corn Stover

273
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:47,160
those two covers did reduce ammonia

274
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,019
emissions but when we added biochar into

275
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,060
the mix we took that material made into

276
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,980
biochar where wood chips we almost

277
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,100
eliminated ammonia emissions off that

278
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,380
storage and for corn Stover we had a

279
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,720
fairly large reduction as well and so

280
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,640
what was going on here uh what we kind

281
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,680
of found is that that cover stability is

282
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,440
really important so biochar is fairly

283
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,660
hydrophobic for the most part

284
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,480
um and what we saw was that the cover

285
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,100
staying on the surface of that bio of

286
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,399
that manure storage was really essential

287
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,980
and so this is the storages initially

288
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,140
this is about two or three days after we

289
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,420
applied the cover here we see both

290
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,000
covers you know on top but after about a

291
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,820
month that that biomass started to sink

292
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,800
however biochar was still pretty much

293
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,420
just as good as it was on day one and so

294
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,459
this is what we think was the primary

295
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,920
driver here I mean this has been a

296
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:40,800
complaint of producers that do use

297
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,600
permeable covers as a as a mechanism for

298
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,579
ammonia where they they sink and they

299
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,980
have they require frequent reapplication

300
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:49,079
so biochar really does seem to be a

301
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,019
potential method to reduce the

302
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:55,519
applications of that permeable cover and

303
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:55,519
help reduce ammonia emissions

304
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:03,120
the next topic I want to talk about

305
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,940
um is adding biochar to anaerobic

306
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,740
digestion systems this is an area that's

307
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,920
I've gotten a lot of questions about

308
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,060
recently and so for those of you in the

309
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,220
room I'm sure you're familiar with

310
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,140
anaerobic digestion of manure we're

311
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,820
taking the manure putting in a reactor

312
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,920
we're getting biogas we convert that

313
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,500
into energy there's a lot of benefits on

314
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,560
the digestate side as well however a

315
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:29,100
major problem with anaerobic digestion

316
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,079
and particularly Dairy manure is that we

317
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,339
feed a lot of sulfur to our animals and

318
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,779
that sulfur when it gets in this

319
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,760
anaerobic condition

320
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:38,880
turns into hydrogen sulfide through

321
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,519
sulfur reduction and so hydrogen sulfide

322
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,500
is a is a really costly part of the

323
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,540
operational budget for removing it takes

324
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,240
around 15 to 20 percent of your animal

325
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,519
operation budget is put just towards

326
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,380
removing hydrogen sulfide so that we can

327
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,519
use that biorgas for some sort of energy

328
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,200
purpose

329
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,420
and so what we've been doing this is

330
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,040
this is um kind of coming off of some

331
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,540
work that had been done by Becky Larson

332
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,980
at Madison

333
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,079
um expanding upon that but I was looking

334
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,240
at adding biochar to anaerobic digestion

335
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,820
systems quite a few people have looked

336
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,139
at this in terms of reducing methane but

337
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,480
we wanted to look at and see what its

338
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:14,279
impact was on hydrogen sulfide so in our

339
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,380
lab we've been looking at multiple

340
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,600
different types of biochars and adding

341
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,139
them in batch reactors and then

342
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,420
analyzing the hydrogen sulfide methane

343
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,279
and the biogas quantity off these

344
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,279
reactors when we add biochar into the

345
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:31,560
reactors at relatively low ratios in

346
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,920
terms of a mass ratio

347
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,740
and what we found has been pretty uh

348
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,019
Stark removal of of biochar of hydrogen

349
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,540
sulfide and so this is from a study my

350
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,500
undergrad finished up about two months

351
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,300
ago

352
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,459
um at uw-platteville and what we did in

353
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,680
this study is we had controls which were

354
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:52,980
just manure with some digestate from a

355
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,060
local farm and then we added biochars

356
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,519
produced at different temperatures

357
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,019
starting around the lower end of what we

358
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,940
consider biochar production to the

359
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,579
higher end and looked at hydrogen

360
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,519
sulfide production over the course of

361
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:07,680
the period and what we found was that by

362
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,180
adding biochar particularly low

363
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,399
temperature biochars we could

364
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,639
significantly reduce hydrogen sulfide

365
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,860
production when we did a mass balance of

366
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,260
hydrogen sulfur produced compared to the

367
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,800
biogas produced as well we found we had

368
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:26,459
around a 70 to 80 percent reduction when

369
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,579
we added biochar in the range of 660

370
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:31,019
degree Fahrenheit to 930. when we get to

371
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:32,519
that higher temperature we're still

372
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,959
trying to figure out what exactly is

373
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,459
going on here so I'm not going to have

374
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:38,160
answers to that questions if they're out

375
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:40,500
there but high temperature biochars are

376
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,880
not great at reducing hydrogen sulfide

377
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,160
and we've seen this with a couple other

378
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,300
biomasses as well so this is some Aspen

379
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,220
wood

380
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,320
um really not having much effect very

381
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,579
similar to control

382
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,079
um so we're not 100 sure what's

383
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,699
happening here but the results that

384
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,740
we've gotten so far has really shown

385
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:57,660
that low temperature biochars are very

386
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,720
effective at mitigating hydrogen sulfide

387
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,860
production during anaerobic digestion of

388
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,860
livestock manure

389
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:11,399
so that is what I wanted to talk about

390
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,860
today in terms of biochar and adding it

391
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,199
to manure Management Systems um just a

392
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,600
few take-home messages here you know

393
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:20,880
biochar has been shown to have a lot of

394
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,440
potential as a soil amendment and kind

395
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,560
of what my group has been looking at is

396
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,000
how can we increase the uses of it in

397
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,680
manure management so that there's maybe

398
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,019
some more adoption of it and so we're

399
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,000
looking at a lot of different things and

400
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,560
a lot of different benefits that biochar

401
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,839
could potentially have in these manure

402
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,699
Management systems and I think a key

403
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,339
takeaway from what I talked about today

404
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:42,899
is that not all biochar is the same the

405
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,180
temperature the feedstock that the

406
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:47,279
biochar is produced at is important on

407
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,079
your end goal and so recognizing that

408
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,300
when you are

409
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,740
thinking about adding biochar thinking

410
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,480
about encouraging a producer to add

411
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,760
biochar to their manure management

412
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,860
system is important

413
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,060
uh one thing I didn't talk about uh

414
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,699
which I'm sure there will be questions

415
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,800
on is the cost and so it's kind of the

416
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:06,540
elephant in the room biochar production

417
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,040
is going to be a fairly high cost

418
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,839
particularly if we're trying to do it on

419
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,579
Farm it's going to be a high capital

420
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,339
investment to put in a biochar

421
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:16,320
production system on Farm however I

422
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,120
think with the carbon credits and the in

423
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,980
the way we're seeing anaerobic digestion

424
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,139
moving right now I think in the near

425
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,300
future there may be some incentives to

426
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:27,000
start thinking about this biochar and

427
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,920
lowering the cost a little bit

428
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,959
and so with that just want to say thank

429
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,720
you here's my contact information if

430
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,639
you'd like to uh shoot me an email or

431
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,800
follow me on Twitter and the research I

432
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:40,680
presented today has been funded both by

433
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,430
the dairy Hub in Wisconsin and uh the

434
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:54,889
USDA nifa program

435
