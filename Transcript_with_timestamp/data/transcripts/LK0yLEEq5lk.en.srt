00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:11,130
hi I'm Gary gem from harvest Farm in

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,080
Whateley Massachusetts I've got a

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,460
wholesale vegetable farm with my partner

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,920
Dave and we specialize in certain

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,220
brassicas primarily collard greens and

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:29,939
kale we grow tomatoes peppers eggplant

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:32,790
some herbs and greenhouse crops we grow

8
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:37,079
about a hundred acres of crops most of

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:40,730
it as brassicas cultivation is a big

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,079
part of our weed control program

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:47,760
herbicides are used as well as hand

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:50,760
hoeing and cultivation using various

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,600
different techniques and tools we find

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:59,510
that we can grow some of our crops with

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:02,160
no herbicides and only cultivation and

16
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,979
other growing techniques with the

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,979
brassicas we find that we need to use a

18
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:11,159
combination of herbicides and

19
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:14,729
cultivation in particularly weedy fields

20
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,189
we may have to get out and hand hoe but

21
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,640
what we're looking for in the long term

22
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,500
is to clean up our fields and get them

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,470
to a point where we reduce hand hoeing

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,689
to a minimum but when we have to seed

25
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,470
crops directly into the field we find

26
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:35,369
that we need to use a pre-emergent

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,159
herbicide usually just to get a jump on

28
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,630
the seeds coming out of the ground

29
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:44,369
before we get to to whether we use

30
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:47,430
cultivation or herbicides or both really

31
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,259
starts with the crop rotation we have a

32
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,829
three year rotation program here on the

33
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,810
farm

34
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:56,070
to try and keep diseases and weeds at

35
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,409
bay we find that it works quite well for

36
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,049
diseases but the weed pressure is always

37
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,490
there we're trying to do better and

38
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,110
better all the time but it seems like

39
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,799
the weeds are getting tougher and

40
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,440
tougher to deal with - so we start with

41
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,450
the rotation that tells us where we can

42
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,090
plant

43
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:18,470
certain crops certain families of crops

44
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,970
and we look then at the conditions weed

45
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,430
pressures in the different fields and

46
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,209
decide where to try to farm with no

47
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:28,459
herbicides where to farm with them and

48
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:30,410
what herbicides we may have to use and

49
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:39,590
basically our whole approach to farming

50
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:44,260
those fields so this tool here is the

51
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:48,170
basis of our establishing a clean field

52
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,760
from very early on and this combined

53
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:53,299
with making a bed to get a smooth

54
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,150
surface gives us the capability of doing

55
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:57,590
a good job to start with once we get a

56
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,930
little bit of weed pressure and our

57
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,480
transplants are still small enough we

58
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:07,430
run through with this Cub tractor and

59
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:10,069
the budding cages we slide right in

60
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,900
between the plants and do a nice job of

61
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:16,600
cleaning everything up except what's in

62
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:21,109
between the rows are in the rows and

63
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:23,750
that serves us as our first cultivation

64
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:27,049
and after that we go in with a different

65
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:30,560
tractor we can do an acre in about a

66
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:33,049
half an hour with this and my goal is to

67
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,239
always go as fast as I can speed seems

68
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:37,250
to to really make a big difference with

69
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,130
this thing if the plants are tall enough

70
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,410
and the ground is firm enough I've gone

71
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:46,130
in Rhode gear with it and really been

72
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,950
pleased with the results you also like

73
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,060
to get your work done quickly but you

74
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:56,180
want to do a good job and that's the

75
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:59,690
primary goal when we find conditions are

76
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,930
particularly clumpy such as after heavy

77
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,670
rains before we go in for the hilling we

78
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,519
will frequently go in with these small

79
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:10,549
teeth with these little wires attached

80
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,440
to them to break up the clods so that

81
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:15,139
when we Hill we don't throw the clods

82
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,739
all over the plants and do more damage

83
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:21,829
than good these we found hanging around

84
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:23,810
in an old barn and put them to use they

85
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,780
work quite well for for fracturing the

86
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:30,170
soil

87
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:33,800
the key to doing a good job is to have a

88
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:37,610
nice straight flatbed that the

89
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,430
cultivators can follow to a tee this

90
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,280
system works well enough that the

91
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,910
tractor virtually does it itself as a

92
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,800
matter of fact one time I was chased by

93
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:51,290
some mean bees and I jumped off the

94
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,520
tractor and it caught up to me at the

95
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,190
end of the row and it had cultivated

96
00:04:52,520 --> 00:05:02,120
perfectly all the way along without me

97
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:07,100
on it after we go through with the

98
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,860
budding cultivators we then leave the

99
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,460
crop alone pretty much until it gets to

100
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,970
a stage of growth where we can just

101
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:19,280
sneak in one last time and that's when

102
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:23,810
we come in with this tractor with the

103
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,730
big sweeps on it and we adjust them the

104
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,610
cultivating shanks are adjustable so

105
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,710
that the teeth are tipped down not as

106
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,690
they are now but they're pointed more

107
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:38,840
towards the ground and we go through and

108
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:42,320
Hill them up and top dress them at the

109
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,930
same time now so far with the use of the

110
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,370
buttons we've achieved weed control in

111
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:53,680
between the rows once we come in with

112
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:57,050
these particular cultivators we achieve

113
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,170
weed control within the row because we

114
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,450
Hill up the dirt around the plants and

115
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:06,320
we can vary weeds up to about two inches

116
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:09,830
in height we do that just prior to the

117
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:13,430
canopy filling in and usually when we go

118
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:17,830
in we also add fertilizer to give the

119
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,830
crop enough food to carry it to maturity
