00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:09,539
foreign

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,539
[Music]

3
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:19,140
it's a farmer directed Grant arm from

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,080
the USDA that started in 1988 with the

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,240
farm bill because the USDA knew that

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,880
farmers are always on The Cutting Edge

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,640
to find applied solutions to their

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,740
problems that they have Liz Brownlee Liz

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,899
and her husband Nate raise livestock on

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,480
pasture at nightfall Farm in southeast

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,640
Indiana they sell via farmers markets

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,739
restaurants and independent groceries

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,379
but their meat and egg CSA is the

14
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,660
Cornerstone of their Farm they typically

15
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,640
have 50 families in their CSA and over

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,800
90 percent retention

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,760
they raise meat chickens laying hens

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,680
sheep pigs and turkeys on 50 acres Liz

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,180
works as director of farm farmer

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,760
programs for partners in food and

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,039
farming pif which I would love to hear

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,500
more about that too Liz

23
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,560
um so my husband and I farm in southeast

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,720
Indiana We're practically in Kentucky

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,360
and so we are in a very rural space

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,860
we're right where the glaciers stopped

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,500
if you can picture it so it goes from

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,840
flat flat flat flat flat to hilly

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,759
um and we're on my family's farm so we

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,400
worked on farms up in New England for

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,619
about five years learning worked on

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,840
organic farms and most of them had csas

33
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,020
and we learned a ton from seeing that

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,420
behind the scenes reality so if you're

35
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,680
still in that aspiring phase I highly

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,759
encourage you to or even if you're

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,000
already Farm but you're thinking of

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,100
adding a CSA find somebody who has a CSA

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,900
near you and work on their Farm to help

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,780
with distro I would love for somebody to

41
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,820
offer that to me if you're near me come

42
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,500
help me with pickup days and see what

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,220
it's like what the decisions are behind

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,799
the scenes what the stress points are in

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,619
organizing pickup days things like that

46
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,899
um we saw it work really well both as

47
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,640
collaborative csas where 14 farmers were

48
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,399
working together in Pennsylvania and

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,979
doing a unified share we saw individual

50
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,660
Farms doing meat csas that really worked

51
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,180
and that's what got us excited so we

52
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,920
actually run a meat and egg CSA only no

53
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,260
vegetables

54
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,300
um and we've mostly talked about veggies

55
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,920
and meat so far but I'll add you

56
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,800
mentioned soup right we've seen soup

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,580
csas and cheese csas and bread csas and

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,319
all sorts of cool stuff we stick to the

59
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,040
non-perishables and I would say that's

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,780
one of the keys to our CSA is that um

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,940
there is no getting overwhelmed because

62
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,980
if you don't have time to cook that week

63
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,720
you throw it in the freezer and as long

64
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,580
as you don't do that with six

65
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,560
consecutive months of chicken you're

66
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,560
gonna be fine

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,420
um Okay so let me zoom out a little bit

68
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,340
now that you know roughly who I am and

69
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,379
where I'm from

70
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,400
um I wanted to say on the the Sarah

71
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:55,200
grants

72
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,540
raise your hand

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,940
if you love Sarah farmer Rancher grants

74
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,700
who's already in love oh I can convince

75
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,920
a bunch of you then okay great so if you

76
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,660
don't already know Sarah has a bunch of

77
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,459
different sorts of Grants and their

78
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,800
farmer Rancher grants are specifically

79
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,260
for farmers who are doing something

80
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,319
Innovative trying something out that's

81
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,120
either new to their state let's say

82
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,140
maybe in Michigan they're killing it

83
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,340
with X practice they know how to grow

84
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,879
you know I don't know something really

85
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,500
neat like they can grow mushrooms on an

86
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,480
urban farm and I'm an urban farm in

87
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,459
Indiana and nobody's doing that I could

88
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,620
apply for a Sarah Grant to take a known

89
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,420
idea that's Innovative and sustainable

90
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,700
and try it in my place

91
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,860
or if there's just an idea that I

92
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,260
haven't heard of anybody else trying I

93
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,319
could apply for funds to do that thing

94
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,120
so the surrogant that my farm that we

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,920
applied for we went into Cahoots with

96
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,780
another Farm because here's another cool

97
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,799
thing about Sarah grants you can ask for

98
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,420
money

99
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,180
I think it's up to nine thousand dollars

100
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,360
per for one Farm but if you go in with

101
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,360
others you can ask for more money which

102
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,220
is even better so we had two Farms so we

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,780
asked for like 18 Grand and if you go up

104
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,159
to three Farms you can ask for twenty

105
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,200
seven thousand dollars

106
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,239
a lot of money

107
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,099
um it's not going to change the world

108
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,720
but it might change your farm so that's

109
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,699
the other key thing is that you can

110
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,799
really think strategically about how a

111
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,660
Sarah Grant can not only research and

112
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,759
trial something Innovative and help

113
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,680
other Farmers because a key piece of it

114
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,100
is that you're sharing out whatever you

115
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,199
learn you share through talks or videos

116
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,280
or some way to get the word out because

117
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,600
the whole idea is this is government

118
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,100
money right they don't want it just to

119
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,400
help one individual business they want

120
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,199
it to help lots of farmers

121
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,139
but also can you use that Sarah Grant as

122
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:47,160
a way to take some big step forward

123
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:50,100
so for our CSA with meat a big

124
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,660
bottleneck was processing that's a

125
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,580
problem for Farmers all across the

126
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,880
Midwest all across the nation in fact

127
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,280
and so we wanted to find out what is the

128
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,419
very smallest processing facility that

129
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,040
you could open

130
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,020
and make money

131
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,380
how small could it get

132
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,780
because our our farm and our friend's

133
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,300
Farm Palmer Bowers Farmstead they raise

134
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,840
cattle we do sheep and turkeys and

135
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,580
chickens and and pigs and for all of

136
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,020
those animals it's really hard to get a

137
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,100
butcher date and maybe you know this

138
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,139
well

139
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,699
um you know in in March I called on the

140
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,020
first day the butcher was taken butcher

141
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,560
dates for sheep and they said How's

142
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,120
December 27th and I said sold I'll take

143
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,220
it because that was the only date I

144
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,500
could get you're scheduling months if

145
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,419
not years out at this point so we wanted

146
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,919
to know could we open our own on-farm

147
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,440
processing facility that would be State

148
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,720
inspected and would it ever pencil out

149
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,180
would we make any money so our project

150
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,320
was actually a feasibility study

151
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,479
um because

152
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,520
we felt like we've kind of got the CSA

153
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,080
thing working and their Farm felt like

154
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,120
they had the freezer beef thing working

155
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,919
it wasn't selling our product that was

156
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,020
the problem it was getting from animal

157
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,860
to product

158
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:04,020
um and so we hired some fancy people who

159
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,940
knew how to do the math and we paid

160
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,940
ourselves to meet every month for two

161
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:11,039
years to work through these questions

162
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,900
and we worked with a chef and and

163
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,400
basically we put together a really cool

164
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,979
set of resources that we have not

165
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,840
utilized so we've actually decided not

166
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:22,380
to open a processing facility

167
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,780
at this point they might they're like

168
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,880
thinking about it and working on the the

169
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,440
local zoning things needed to open the

170
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,880
facility

171
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,319
um but in some ways that's what a

172
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,840
feasibility is supposed a feasibility

173
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,080
study is supposed to do help you decide

174
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,639
do I want this or not and I would say

175
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
once a month at least somebody emails us

176
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,819
out of the blue and said hey I found

177
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,039
your thing online about your Sarah

178
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,800
project and we're thinking about opening

179
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,720
a facility in fill in the blank state

180
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,319
and it was really helpful because we

181
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,240
hadn't yet seen a free floor plan and

182
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,800
layout for a really small facility we

183
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,880
hadn't yet seen an equipment list of

184
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,919
what you'd need

185
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,419
um so we developed all those tools and

186
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,340
now they live on our website

187
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,600
um and if that's useful to you I'm not

188
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,780
trying to get clicks because these don't

189
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,699
do me any good but nightfallfarm.com

190
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,979
and there's like an about us and you

191
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,139
click processing

192
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,000
um and Sarah paid for all of that

193
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,139
and so we really wanted to get out to

194
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
other farmers and be useful to other

195
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,080
Farmers it's not directly helping our

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,759
CSA

197
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,139
which is kind of a bummer it's not

198
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,300
directly helping our farm although it

199
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,099
did probably save us a lot of money I

200
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,080
think it helped us realize like wow that

201
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:30,479
could that could pencil out we came up

202
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,360
with a budget for a three species so all

203
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,460
red meat right lamb pork beef uh

204
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,319
facility that'd be open with one and a

205
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,300
half employees and it can pencil out in

206
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,460
10 years it'll pay for itself and it'll

207
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,900
be viable but we realized like wow we

208
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,080
don't want to do that

209
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,460
sounds miserable

210
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,539
we just we decided that that wasn't for

211
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,000
us

212
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,699
um because you would that would be

213
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,960
all the work every single week

214
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,639
um whereas right now my husband and I

215
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,139
are one and a half people farming and

216
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,639
we've that helped us realize we want to

217
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,500
be outside farming

218
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,419
so that was our stair project what do we

219
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,580
do on our farm

220
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:08,220
um I wanted to tell you

221
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,180
let's see so when we moved home to

222
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,880
Indiana

223
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,360
um we wanted our farm to be a piece of

224
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,860
the solution on climate change and on

225
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,620
rebuilding our rural communities so

226
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,360
that's really been the focus

227
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,580
and you were spot on that the first yeah

228
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,860
your first chunk of CSA members are

229
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,780
people you know so our first year we

230
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,240
started with 12 CSA members and we knew

231
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,219
every one of them and um and now we're

232
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,839
at 50 really consistently and we really

233
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,520
like that number that's what our firm

234
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,200
can sustain

235
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,300
um

236
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,599
our our rural Place could not have a 400

237
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,839
member CSA I don't know 400 people who

238
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,420
would buy a CSA and um and that's okay

239
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,380
that's where we're at it's a pretty poor

240
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,720
Community

241
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,779
um and and

242
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,580
for a lot of people value means cheap so

243
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:58,740
finding our members has been a really

244
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,200
interesting process you would think that

245
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,019
our members are all uh well to do and

246
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,899
they are not we have a lot of school

247
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,779
secretaries and non-profit workers and

248
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,660
military families and Factory workers we

249
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:15,000
also have doctors and professors but

250
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,740
it's a real cross-section and I think

251
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,019
the unifying thing is that people

252
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,839
prioritize good food

253
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:24,420
so they they might come to us for a

254
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,860
really wide breadth of reasons so some

255
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,779
people when we ask why are you joining

256
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,940
they say oh I care about the environment

257
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:31,740
and other people say oh it's for Humane

258
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,300
Animal practices and other people say I

259
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,000
want to support small businesses in my

260
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,220
local community but when we ask why they

261
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,300
stay they say it's because it tastes

262
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,120
good

263
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,320
and that makes me really happy

264
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,240
and so we get these people who wouldn't

265
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,940
normally interact standing in line to

266
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,279
pick up their CSA share interacting and

267
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,880
that feels like a real win

268
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,980
um

269
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,600
let's see what else about the CSA in

270
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,940
terms of connection I want to add to

271
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,680
your connection list so

272
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,839
um we do things like tree plantings and

273
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,120
potlucks recipe books things like that

274
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,740
for our CSA members we're going to make

275
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,300
t-shirts this winter we're gonna have

276
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,860
like a t-shirt making party that should

277
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,779
be fun

278
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,300
um and then just to bring it back to the

279
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,740
CSA or to the sale project I do still

280
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,240
hope to make jerky

281
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,279
if anybody out there has figured out how

282
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,339
to do jerky in a commercial kitchen well

283
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,380
following all the rules let me know I

284
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,000
haven't figured it out yet but that the

285
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,519
Sarah project did really help us realize

286
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,959
like oh

287
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,339
even though we're gonna have to deal

288
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:31,440
with those longer wait times at The

289
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,820
Butcher and schedule way ahead there are

290
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,220
still some other pieces of that

291
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,320
processing and value-added puzzle that

292
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,540
we think we could solve and maybe that's

293
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,940
another share Grant I don't know

294
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,920
um because people don't all love lamb

295
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,079
but almost everyone loves jerky and if

296
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,940
that jerky happened to be made of lamb I

297
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,320
think they'd be okay with it so we're

298
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,519
trying to figure these things out you

299
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,920
know how do we offer things that make

300
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:56,540
our CSA members lives easier and sell

301
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,540
the products that that we want to raise

302
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:10,149
