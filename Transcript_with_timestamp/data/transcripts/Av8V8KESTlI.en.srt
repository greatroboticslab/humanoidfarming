1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,120
it's

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,880
one week after planting now and i'm back

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,679
at the field here lee has gone off to

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,080
the beach

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,840
i've just come back from the beach so

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,560
for a few days nobody was watching the

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,240
crop

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,600
but it's now about the week after

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,000
planting and

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,080
it's the time to apply the first dose of

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,279
fertilizer because we didn't apply

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,559
a pre-plant application normally

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,800
during the first one or two weeks

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,559
or before planting you should apply a

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,280
little bit of nitrogen phosphorus and

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,399
potassium to help the crop establish

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,079
so that's what i will do now and

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,000
hopefully that will help then also with

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,000
the further

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,280
early stages then of course development

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,039
and tillering

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,000
so what i've done is just like i did

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,960
last year so i used the

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,800
fancy mobile phone application that we

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,520
have developed over many many years here

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,559
at erie

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,519
nutrient manager for rise and the only

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,119
difference is that

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,200
this year we have a new version for the

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,000
philippines version 2.2

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,360
so it has a few more refinements but

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,439
what it does

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,360
it walks you through a series of

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,640
relatively simple questions about your

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,000
field

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,920
what you've done previously in the

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,880
management how you

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,880
manage your organic metal what you do

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,840
with your crop residue

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,960
what your source of irrigation water is

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,960
what your variety is

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,079
in all of these things that basically

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,119
one way or another

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,320
influence the nutrient input output

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,720
budget

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,000
of this particular field and so we come

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,880
up with

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,040
field specific fertilizer recommendation

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,079
so i can do this directly here in the

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,399
field on this

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:57,280
smartphone or i can do it before that

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,240
at home either on a smartphone or on a

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,439
tablet computer or on a desktop computer

54
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,479
that's actually what i've done so before

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,560
i came here

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,560
i ran through this and i came up with

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,680
actually two fertilizer recommendations

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,560
because if you may

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,040
remember one half of the field this over

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,080
there

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,800
we planted with an inward variety and

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,720
this half

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,200
we planted with a hybrid so this is all

64
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,720
normal and well-known principles of crop

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,680
nutrition and rice

66
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,599
that are reflected in this software and

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,800
what i really like with it in particular

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,599
is that it comes out with

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
a very concrete prescription so it's

70
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,760
printed

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,360
out and i'm given the the window

72
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,879
of when i should apply it pretty

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,920
precisely

74
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,680
and i'm also given a very clear

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,440
recommendation of what to apply

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,080
so my main challenge is now to apply it

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,160
and also make sure that i apply it

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,720
relatively uniformly

79
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,200
so i have a bag of fertilizer here which

80
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,400
is

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,159
14 14 14

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,120
14 nitrogen fourteen percent p205

83
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,519
fourteen percent k200 that's my if you

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,560
wish startup fertilizer for this

85
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,560
uh first application and

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,519
basically since our recommendation is

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,599
four bags per hectare and our field is

88
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,680
about a quarter of a hectare it means

89
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,239
i have to spread this one bag more or

90
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,480
less uniformly over this field

91
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,159
and what i will do is if i have a little

92
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,599
bit left over i will put it on the

93
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,599
hybrid strip

94
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,799
not on the invert strip that's the only

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,040
adjustment i will make

96
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,080
other than that it should probably not

97
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,440
take me more than

98
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,720
maybe half an hour i hope what i learned

99
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,280
last year is there are a couple of

100
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,799
tricks

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,200
to apply this one is that

102
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,560
i've you know imagined to divide this

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,560
strip into four

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,159
strips each of them about six meters

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,239
wide

106
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,920
but the the trick is not to walk in the

107
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,040
middle of each but a little bit to the

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,239
side because

109
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,959
that way you can throw better and then

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,920
the other

111
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,959
uh tip they gave me last year was that

112
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,799
you have to really

113
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,040
swing with your arm wide and keep

114
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,479
walking and not sort of looking down

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:29,840
and try to sprinkle it like powdered

116
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:29,840
sugar you just go and throw

117
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,479
yeah here is something i wanted to show

118
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,520
you because it's always bothered me you

119
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,720
know when you apply

120
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,080
fertilizer in most traditional rice

121
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,240
growing systems and you don't have a

122
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,479
machine basically this is what you see

123
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,160
so you have tiny little young rice

124
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,479
plants here

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
in this case because spaced quite wide

126
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,639
because we use the

127
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,720
mechanical transplanter and

128
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,520
they're not really at a stage where they

129
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,919
have a big root system that can capture

130
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,039
much of the nutrient supply and then you

131
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,440
throw this by hand

132
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,320
broadcast and you see where most of the

133
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,320
fertilizer ends up

134
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,360
in this case on the surface in between

135
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,120
so even if i had incorporated it would

136
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,520
still be in between

137
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,240
so i keep wondering wouldn't it be nice

138
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,280
if

139
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,759
on that planting machine that we had

140
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,120
we would have been able to already apply

141
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,280
some of the fertilizer

142
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,039
at least disperse those right away

143
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,960
closer to the road

144
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,240
so that it can be captured by the plants

145
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,960
and doesn't end up

146
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,720
fertilizing the soil something has

147
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,320
always been bothering me

148
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,000
because i'm pretty sure that with this

149
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,000
kind of system here

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,520
our efficiency is not as good as it

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,479
could be

152
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,000
so hopefully in the future those

153
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,919
machines can be improved for this

154
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,840
purpose particularly even the small one

155
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:07,840
they used

156
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,520
you
