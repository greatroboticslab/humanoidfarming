  "text": "[Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] fail now [Music] all right folks I'm in the truck now and it is extremely hot out here uh I had to stack all that or uh put all that hay and Rose our hay trailer will haul eight Bales at a time so I put it in eight Bell rows all throughout the property so that I can just bring the truck and trailer out here and have the tractor sitting there and just load eight and move on load eight and move on so anyway this was a lot easier way of getting a count on actually how much hay there actually was and um so I'm just going to go around here and show you what we got okay in the in that little field that you saw at the end of the hay cutting video that they were cutting a little square field there are I have put eight Bales in here but they're it actually made Seven I brought one from outside to make an eight Bale row right there so there's eight all right let me go on across here in this little field right here it made a lot because there was no second cutting on it last year so it was the old stuff and the new stuff all together and uh it actually made more hay it's two acres and it made Seven bales so you go into the next field which is the big how you feel one of the big hay fields and right here we made a tiny one and then a about a half a bale and then there's a see how many we got there one two three four five six seven and then a half a bell and then a tiny bell so we're going to consider that half a bell and a tiny bell one Bell so eight Bells right there all right so it's 16. then we move across here and these hay fields are rough I know they look smooth there's glass from the air but hayfields are always rough so so we had 16 here's another eight Bale row three four five six seven eight so that makes 24. so we got 24 bales so far all right 24 then we'll go across here and here is another row of hey eight Bales there so that makes 30 two all right so we got 32 Bales which is pretty sad for the amount of area that we we actually bailed we bailed it pretty huge area you saw from the air I mean I think I think all of the hay baling area is about 60 Acres of open ground so you know we're not doing good so far on the amount of hate so we got 32 Bales so far now I'm going to take a shortcut up through here almost cut field on the neighbor area all right cut around behind here pretty narrow little spot right here all right remember we had 32 bales all right 32 bales right there's eight over there that's 40. so there's it makes 40 . there are eight Bales straight ahead of me so that makes 48 with this eight here and then we go get right over here and we have another eight right there so all in all we have 56 bales 56 bales we fed about 75 Bales last year so and my brother needs at least 30. so we're gonna have to at least make 100 510 bales uh in order to kind of break even this year so the good news is it well bad news bad news it's a hundred today the good news is it's supposed to start cooling off today and there are chances of rain coming several chances of rain over the next two weeks they're not great chances but they are chances so if we get some rain there's a possibility we can get that second cutting that we need but right now we are in a deficit on Hay [Applause] foreign [Applause] folks that is when the microphone decided to die so what we have here is we have a 32 10 10 uh ratio of fertilizer it is nitrogen phosphorus and potassium 32 nitrogen so it's a nitrogen Rich what they do is they take a skid steer and they load this Hopper with the amount that we wanted it goes from the Hopper into a tumbler and what that does is just like Mixing concrete it goes into that um into that shot in there by the conveyor and it is mixed up well inside of that uh inside of that uh little tumbler there so then after it is mixed well in the tumbler it goes on to that conveyor belt it's right there below it and that conveyor belt it runs up and it loads itself right into the uh trailer that I'm pulling the fertilizer trailer so this is purchased four tons of this and uh the uh and I and I hate it because he he wanted to know what I was doing what I was feeling I believe his name is either I think it's Jason or Jaden um he was helping me out with uh with putting the fertilizer in there and he was doing a he was doing a bang-up job and uh I really appreciate his help getting me lined up getting the the trailer lined up and uh that's where I can get on it real good and uh and smoothing out the fertilizer so it wasn't you know flying out whenever I was going down the road so yep I appreciated their help down at the co-op so anyway uh the fertilizer cost was a little bit north of twenty five hundred dollars so [Music] okay this is more area where the audio was broken so what I'm showing is how to work the fertilizer trailer so what you do is you pull this pin right here that holds a lever once you get the pin out you're able to move the lever to the side and what you're trying to do is you slide it up past this plate right here and then you lock it in once you do that that rod runs this little wheel with fins on it which pushes down into that tire which engages that and then you'll see right here there's some belts that run the actual conveyor system and the uh and the actual Spinners that that throw the fertilizer this is a gauge that shows uh actually a chart that shows if you want to flow a certain amount of fertilizer then you have a gate opening rate that you use so we're going to do a 200 pounds per acre and it's going to be like a two and a half inch uh gate opening and and I run the truck at about oh five to seven miles an hour to get the required 200 pounds of fertilizer so what I'm doing right here is I'm actually opening that gate up to the two and a half inch Mark to allow the fertilizer to flow and that you can see the fertilizer is sitting actually on a conveyor and it brings it back and runs it onto these uh actual spinner wheels that are that that I failed to get video of right then that are below that foreign [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] folks I've got all the fertilizer sprayed I got to spread all over the property here where the cattle are where uh where the hay is you can see the nitrogen on the ground here so what we're attempting to do now is wait wait out the rain when the rain comes then this will just uh just take off but in the meantime I saw something whenever I was driving around here and I need to find it if I can um I didn't I didn't think it was going to be this quick but I believe we've got a new baby calf so let me find that if I can I'm looking oh there she is right here baby this is 23 Cal she is Minnie's mama and that is Danny's first baby and look at them ears and this baby appears to have just been born but it's up and it's moving around well and she looks like she's got a bag oh don't fall down I wonder if this was a little bull or a heifer oh look at those ears you sure tell Danny's your daddy uh we got some little heifer a little heifer so that's a keeper all right I'm just gonna kind of leave them alone for a minute I need some help with this I need to get a I need to get an ear tag in that calf but let me see if I can maybe my brother's home and he can come give me a hand I don't know we will see I'm gonna leave them alone for a minute anyway we got a new baby on killing Farms all right the next couch getting ready to have calf is right here this is uh this is Oreo and she has got her bag going real well and she should be having a calf just any day so Oreo is next in line followed by two or three of the other cattle so uh yep Oreo is coming she'll be next so that'll be the next calf that update should be just any day all right what a day what a day we got the fertilizing all done on both properties on the uh on the hay field and out here at uh where the cattle are uh we have a we had a complete surprise when we got here whenever I uh found that uh number 20 or number 23 cow had had a nice little heifer calf out of Danny this is our first calf from Danny and you know you always wonder if that bull that you bought is going to be a good bull you know we bought that bull we didn't test him ourselves but what the fellow told us he tested him he come out good and he showed me pictures of all of his calves and he had a lot of nice calves and you can definitely tell this is Danny's baby I mean he's got 30 those ears so uh but anyway we so now we've got the a new calf we got everything all fertilized up I guess the next thing I got to do is I got to come out here and do some brush hogging I need to ear tag this calf it's a little bit uh I've got to get that that buggy back to the co-op because I've got it rented and I I've got to get it back before they close so I'm going to run it back and I need to brush hog here I noticed that uh the Briar is down on the on their side of the pond are really taking over so I need to come down and brush hog and I need to see if I can get an ear tag in that calf so that'll probably be the next time so anyway everybody's happy happy happy and we got a new baby so if you like this type of content like And subscribe and we'll continue to bring more content in the future and as always everybody God bless together",
