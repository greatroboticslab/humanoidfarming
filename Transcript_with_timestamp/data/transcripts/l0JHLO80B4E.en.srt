00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:09,570
hi I'm Christy smart man and I'm Melissa

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,090
Wilson and we're with the University of

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,710
Minnesota Extension using manure is a

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,509
nutrient source it can really improve

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,940
your pastures and cropland while

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,980
reducing the need for fertilizers but it

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,800
has to be applied properly in order to

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,060
protect the environment and

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,619
understanding the application rate is an

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,289
essential piece of a manure management

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,359
plan today we're going to talk about and

12
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,489
demonstrate how to calibrate a solid

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,780
manure spreader the first thing you need

14
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:35,489
to know about manure spreaders and

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,520
calibration is that there are several

16
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,290
variables affecting application rates

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,879
for all spreaders the tractor speed or

18
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,250
gearbox settings will help determine the

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,050
rate at which you apply manure then

20
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,850
depending on the type of spreader used

21
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,129
you'll also want to know the apron or

22
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,840
hydraulic push Gate setting an example

23
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,350
of the setting for an apron spreader is

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,180
shown here other important settings may

25
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,640
include the PTO speed and/or the

26
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,840
spreader gate opening settings but

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,190
please know that not all of these

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,799
settings will apply to every type of

29
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,330
spreader while calibrating keep all of

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,250
these factors consistent but make

31
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,650
adjustments if you need to increase or

32
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,510
lower your rate when you're finished be

33
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,130
sure to record the final settings used

34
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,840
so you can repeat them in the following

35
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,220
years

36
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,840
remember that application rates will be

37
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,720
determined by the crop or pasture

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,460
nutrient needs as an example regulations

39
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,259
in Minnesota state that you cannot apply

40
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,770
more nitrogen that is needed by the crop

41
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,030
including manure and fertilizer sources

42
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,470
this is why writing a nutrient

43
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,229
management plan and calibrating your

44
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,060
spreader are important there are two

45
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,610
possible ways to calibrate a spreader

46
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,110
the first is the load area method which

47
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,299
involves weighing your spreader with

48
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,040
drive on scales and the second is the

49
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,020
tart method which involves spreading

50
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,649
manure over several tarps and weighing

51
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,509
the manure collected if you have drive

52
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,979
on scales available to you the load area

53
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,439
method is the most convenient way of

54
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,670
calibrating a spreader the only other

55
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,439
equipment you'll need is something to

56
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,719
help measure distances like a measuring

57
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,090
wheel and paper and pen to record the

58
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,979
measurements first step is to weigh the

59
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,700
spreader when it is full of manure and

60
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,700
record the weight

61
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,849
make sure to include the tongue weight

62
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,849
of the spreader

63
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:19,660
once the Lotus spread way the spreader

64
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,660
empty and record the weight

65
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,700
by subtracting the empty weight from the

66
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:29,310
full weight you can get the weight of

67
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,080
the manure next you'll need to measure

68
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,450
the area over which the manure was

69
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,099
spread if the area is rectangular in

70
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,099
shape measure the length and width

71
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,630
once you've recorded the length in the

72
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,170
width and feet multiply the two values

73
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:53,930
to get the area in square feet finally

74
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,760
calculate the application rate divide

75
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,460
the weight of the manure by the area

76
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,670
over which it was spread then multiply

77
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,260
by a conversion factor of 21.8 this will

78
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,800
give you the tons of manure spread per

79
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,870
acre

80
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:11,960
where does 21.8 come from it is 43,560

81
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:14,330
square feet per acre divided by 2,000

82
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,340
pounds per ton this will convert pounds

83
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,770
per square foot to tons per acre

84
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,540
we suggest repeating the process at

85
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,430
least three times with the same settings

86
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,040
so that you can find the average manure

87
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,680
application rate if the application rate

88
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,930
is too low or too high make adjustments

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,330
to your speed gearbox or spreader gate

90
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,490
opening settings then calibrate again

91
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,560
and that's how you use the load area

92
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:39,720
method to calibrate a spreader

93
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,450
for that art method you'll need a tarp

94
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,819
for rocks or other heavy objects to hold

95
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,450
down the corners of the tarp a measuring

96
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,730
tape a bucket a scale and pencil and

97
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,080
paper for recording first step is to put

98
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,330
the tarp in the bucket and weigh it

99
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,930
empty before any manure is applied then

100
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,400
record the weight next spread the tarp

101
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,260
out in the field where you'll apply

102
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,410
manure and secure the corners with the

103
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,239
rocks then use the measuring tape to

104
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,739
measure the length and width so that you

105
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,019
can determine the area of the tarp

106
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,910
record these values now you'll want to

107
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,920
spread the menorah most people try to

108
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,930
spread manure as evenly as possible and

109
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,180
avoid skips between application passes

110
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,700
so they'll try to overlap their passes a

111
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,710
bit in this case we're spreading the

112
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,600
manure fairly thick this is because it

113
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,970
is composted it has a low nutrient

114
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,930
content other manure may be spread more

115
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,850
thinly depending on the nutrient content

116
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,710
to account for overlapping passes you'll

117
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,530
want to do three passes with the middle

118
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,960
pass lined up over the tarp make sure

119
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,110
you are spacing each pass the same as

120
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,760
you would when you normally apply manure

121
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,260
once the manure spread carefully pick up

122
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,360
the corners of the tarp and fold the

123
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,190
manure into the center place the folded

124
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,750
tarp with them in or in the middle into

125
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,919
the bucket and place it on the scale

126
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,689
record the weight

127
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,270
now we can begin to calculate the

128
00:04:56,689 --> 00:05:01,039
application rate first you will need to

129
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,050
know the weight of the manure subtract

130
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,479
the empty bucket weight from the bucket

131
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,210
with manure weight this will leave you

132
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,439
with pounds of manure that was applied

133
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,819
next you should calculate the area of

134
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,279
the tarp that thinman or of a spread

135
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,169
over multiply the length of the tarp by

136
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,360
the width of the dark this will give you

137
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:19,370
the area in square feet the remaining

138
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,680
calculations are very similar to how we

139
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,840
calculated the application rate with the

140
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,669
load weight method divide the weight of

141
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,219
the manure by the area of the tarp then

142
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:30,199
multiply by a conversion factor of 21.8

143
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:32,840
this will give you the tons of manure

144
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,669
spread per acre for this method we

145
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,860
recommend doing this procedure at least

146
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:39,949
three times and then find the average or

147
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,750
use three tarps at once line them up in

148
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,430
a row in the middle pass and find the

149
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,620
average weight of manure on the three

150
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,719
tarps the application rate is too low or

151
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,939
too high make adjustments to your speed

152
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:52,009
gearbox or spreader gate openings then

153
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:54,229
calibrate again one question that people

154
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:56,120
will often ask is how often should I

155
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,249
calibrate my manure spreader we

156
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,529
recommend doing it when the manure

157
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:03,080
consistency is not the same perhaps when

158
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:04,789
it is wetter or drier than normal when

159
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,529
you've changed your management practices

160
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,389
like using a new type of bedding or

161
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:10,129
maybe you've started composting the

162
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:12,560
manure instead of spreading it raw or

163
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:14,990
when something changes on your spreader

164
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,699
equipment like a new tractor or ATV or

165
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,039
if something gets replaced on the

166
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:21,110
spreader if nothing has changed over the

167
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,699
years we still recommend recalibrating

168
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,129
every couple of years to make sure

169
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:27,020
nothing has changed to summarize

170
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:28,370
calibrating your manure spreader is an

171
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,870
important step in knowing how much

172
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,580
manure you are applying so that you can

173
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,969
accurately create a manure management

174
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,770
plan using either the load weight or the

175
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:39,199
tart method is a useful way to calibrate

176
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,969
your manure spreader remember to record

177
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,529
the tractor settings like the speed when

178
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,569
you're traveling and the gearbox and

179
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:46,370
spreader gate opening settings your

180
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:48,860
spreader is run by PTO then record the

181
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,349
PTO sb2 this will help you remember what

182
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,980
settings to use in the following years

183
00:06:50,349 --> 00:07:04,980
good luck and happy spreading

184
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:04,980
