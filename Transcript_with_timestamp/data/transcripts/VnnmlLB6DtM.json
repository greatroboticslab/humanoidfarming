  "text": "now let me back up if you've ever watched a fail video of some kind hey your tires are mounted backwards hopping off or quickly getting out of the way instead of being crushed by it as it rolls over i hate this one i hate even knowing this is in here and i don't know if i can follow the rules but i still found it interesting because it is the opposite of what i do pretty cool huh do you think your manual is boring that you can't learn anything from it you think they make these things just for fun there's actually some pretty good stuff in here okay if you got nothing better to do with your life you can sit here and read through the whole thing that's a boatload of fun right well i'm not going to say i sat here and did that but i did spend quite a bit of time recently because i was going through and came across something that i thought was kind of cool answered a question from a long time ago so then i got to looking and i found all sorts of other pretty cool stuff in there too you know the things that are buried in there when you're going through a manual looking for how to fix this or what this knob or control means you're not really going through front to back and kind of you're just skimming you know you're just going through getting the information that you want well guess what there's some things that stood out to me that they maybe will stick out to you as well if you've seen these things on tractors the setup whatever it might be or maybe you can do it on your tractor get some more versatility or capability or stability or anything else that ends in ility out of it okay so i promise we're going to keep this fun we're going to keep it quick we're going to keep it simple let's get to it if you haven't done so yet hit that subscribe button right underneath the video make sure you read through the description as well a lot of good at links to attachments or accessories places to get a discount five percent off discount code gwt go to goodworkstractors.com as well i sell tractors i sell attachments all sorts of good stuff this is just me the cool things that i found in the manual if you know something pretty cool in your manual because it could be specific just to the model of traffic that you have make sure you leave a comment below okay make sure to check those out as well it makes it a lot of fun thanks so much guys okay so this one is a little unique i have intentionally got an x series garden tractor and a one series 10 25 x 738 side by side right here okay two different procedures and you know what this has come up before uh several times actually when you're engaging a pto okay so pay attention because the different series are going to have different instructions so to turn your pto on any john deere 1025r let's see what it says set engine speed to 1500 rpms or less okay lower than that if anything and then turn your pto on how is that going to compare to a john deere x738 garden tractor this is totally different okay so after engine has warmed up move the throttle lever to the maximum engine speed and then pull your pto knob and turn it on okay so totally different depending on what machine you have what series you have so never assume it's the same for every machine always check your manual good information to know right can anybody tell me what the difference is though between one machine versus another does it have anything to do with it being gas versus diesel could that come into play at all or is there something else going on okay courtesy of our 4r series manual right here okay this is a 4066 tractor right here but i think this applies to a lot of machines it's not just this one this is where i happen to find it at but take a look at these front tires okay so let me just read it really quick here front tire rolling direction under most conditions tires should be installed with a directional arrow pointing in the direction of travel there's going to be on most of these tires an arrow that actually points forward okay so that's the direction of the tread however hold on now okay if machine is mainly used for loader operations lug direction lugs okay these bad boys right here may be reversed to increase tire life and improve traction while backing out of dirt piles intriguing isn't that okay and you know what i've never seen that emanuel before and sure that maybe that's just me but i've had quite a few tractors come in with the uh the tires mounted in the opposite position here so you would take this tire put it on that side and flip flat one over and put it here okay but i've had them like that before you know i've kind of wondered i've kind of hypothesized actually thought that before and had folks say hey your tires are mounted backwards well turns out there's actually a legitimate reason to do so wheels must be installed so that the valve stem is facing outwards alright keep that in mind but very interesting tidbit of information there if you're doing a lot of loader operation perhaps that's a setup you want to look into okay so this is one you definitely want to know before you get into that situation so pay attention okay so i want you to pay close attention to this picture right here can you see that picture okay notice how the front wheels are up in the air the rear ones are here but it appears to be tipping back now pay attention you see this chain right here could be a chain could be a cart could be a wagon whatever it is but imagine you're stuck in mud right here okay you get these now let me back up if you've ever watched a fail video of some kind where you see a tractor online and it is just tipped right back up over you know maybe in a a polling contest even or you know some guys have a wagon loaded down with brick or wood or whatever it is and it's just in swampy muddy areas and things like that or it might not even be it might be on a hard surface like this too but at a certain point you got to be very careful if you're stuck and you're just sitting there spinning because what could happen this is right in the manual okay freeing a mired machine all right never drive forward okay because if it's trying to get traction at a certain point the rear tires could lock up it could end up flipping the front end up and you go tumbling over backwards you don't want that to happen so let me read this to you attempting to free a mired machine can involve safety hazards such as the mired tractor tipping rearward the towing tractor overturning or the toe chain and tow bar failing and recoiling from its stretch condition back your tractor out if it gets mired down in mud unhitch any toad implements get them out of the way dig the mud out from behind the rear wheels put boards down there you get the point i'm just telling this is a big safety thing never really even crossed my mind but it's something you definitely want to know before you get into that situation so this one is pretty sweet really pretty simple and straightforward but i found it pretty interesting all the same okay every six years or six thousand hours okay so for most of us never for being honest never never gonna do it never gonna have to if coolant is checked annually the service interval can be extended to six years six thousand hours flush and replace at that point now i don't know about you but i find that to be pretty incredible and the same thing can be said for vehicles you know trucks and and all sorts of other machines too but these service intervals are extending further and further even regular engine oil changes you know or every 200 hours in these so i just find it pretty incredible they're quite low maintenance and it's moving into the lower and lower maintenance ski there's certain things you want to do i want to make sure you know about that and so while some of these can be delayed for as long as you possibly want others like the one i'm going to tell you about now need to be done on a very regular basis like my dad always used to say i'm hard on you because i love you okay so i'm not going to stop telling you about this lube shuttle grease okay the most important way to protect your machine why because it's the one thing they have to do most often on your machine keep it greased okay and if you have an easy way to do that not dealing with one of those traditional grease guns that leak all over the place you can see it right here what's it say rethink greasing no plunger to pull back no air gaps no leaking grease no wasted grease no waste of time you've got the steel cover on the top there you undo that you take it off that's just to protect it you know and you got grease tubes here all right you can see there's no there's no grease leaking out there there's no mess here at all you just take it off and you need to replace it you can even refill these things if you want but you get five percent off discount code gwt i'm telling you greece is your friend okay so uh put it on there take care of it go to the description below in the video or go to my website you'll see where you can buy this stuff get five percent off discount code gwt okay seriously another important safety tip here kind of crazy i'm telling you you just never would think about this kind of thing we're talking about the rops okay you got it in a folded position right here now what does the manual tell you if you have it in a folded position say you need to go underneath the tree something else like that into a building whatever else it might be well it's going to tell you get that rops back up into the fully upright position as soon as possible but while you have it lowered you do not want to have your seatbelt on okay do not use a seat belt with the wraps folded according to your manual always reference your own manual in case it tells you something different but what happens if your rops is in the fully up position well as you might imagine you want to have your seat belt on if the rops is in the up position okay so again you want to keep this up just as much as you possibly can and if so keep your seatbelt on if you have it down take it off so kind of my hypothesis behind that it doesn't really come out and say that in the manual here but if the wraps is up then it's definitely gonna do what it's designed to do which is keep it from actually rolling all the way over it'll tip on its side and it'll just kind of lay there right so if you are strapped in here then there's not really a chance for you to roll out and get crushed underneath something here but if the rops is down then it's not going to protect it from rolling over right so if that's the case i think anyways if you don't have a seat belt on then you have a better chance of hopping off or quickly getting out of the way instead of being crushed by it as it rolls over on that note make sure you check out these safety videos about ballast weight okay these kinds of things are going to help keep you grounded keep you in place duallies wheel spacers liquid ballast rear ballast all sorts of stuff loading your loads low everything you can do to make sure that kind of situation does not occur you know just when i thought i knew everything about trailering a tractor you'll learn something new right here in the manual close fuel shut off valve if your machine is equipped really you got to turn the fuel off if you're going to transport your machine on a trailer additionally okay i hate this one i hate even knowing this is in here and i don't know if i can follow the rules it says position machine on trailer so the hood or engine cover opens from the rear of the trailer okay that means for most of these you got to put it on backwards i really hate backing on tractors on the trailers i like to drive them on i like to back them off that's just what i like doing what do you guys think you're going to back them on or drive them forward okay a couple interesting ones right in your loader manual pay attention now we've talked about it before but it becomes official now that we've located it in the manual okay so leveling in reverse say you're grading out a drive something like that go golden reverse something like this maybe a little more maybe a little less is about the maximum pitch that you want to have the max maximum angle on your bucket there okay to avoid damage to the loader or bending the bucket cutting edge while leveling in reverse position the bucket less than 40 degrees below level okay and when possible put it in float we've talked all about that you guys know what that is now let's flip-flop that what about going forward not in reverse leveling or scraping and forward okay what you want to do you want to have this bucket almost completely level or just slightly raised up to prevent that damage to the bucket edge there to your cylinders you know to jamming something up you never want to go too fast either and again use float when possible now you know okay now check this out this is pretty sweet and i'm going to tell you the r4 tires that really common tread pattern i don't think that that's going to have this option here but you get an ag tire like this you see all these bolts right here how this inner wheel this plate here is really separate from the outer wheel of the rim right here that gives you up to eight different rear wheel positions okay that is insane okay and and think about this i'm gonna flip over to the other page here the narrowest position it shows on here is 51 inches wide okay and the widest position it shows on here is 75 inches wide that is a two foot difference from from narrowest to widest position now it does list an r4 tread pattern here let me show you so maybe there is such a thing that exists and i just don't know about it i don't know if you can see that or not but it's right down here you can see the r4 tread pattern on there but check out your manual because no matter what you have you're going to have at least more than one position and that's going to really help some of you with that lateral stability that you need which asked about it all the time you know i put dualies on my little 1025 r there to help with that stability i've talked about wheel spacers all sorts of ways so get yourself that liquid ballast in here everything you need to do in order to get that center of gravity down low and that without y to just make your tractor and your machine stable but some of you you need to have narrow or wide or different space in there to get between rows or whatever the case might be so pretty cool to know also on your front wheels as well you're also going to have an offset plate so you'll be able to have a narrower stance or a wider stance but it does say note this okay you cannot use the loader with the wheels in the wide position okay so i got to be honest i don't like this one right here but i still found it interesting because it is the opposite of what i do and that is removing material from a pile okay i know i know how can there be a problem with that right but approach and enter a pile with a level bucket okay pretty straightforward if the pile is high remove the top first okay so you got your big pyramid shape pile of dirt or stone or mulch or whatever it is it's telling you if it's a high pile i don't know how high high is but if it's high take the top off first well first of all you scoop into a the top of a pile it's just going to push it off the other end right part of the reason i like to go low is because it gives you something a little backstop there you know you can push into it scoop what you need out and pull it back this is telling you to pull off the top first and i don't get that so what do you guys do top bottom does it matter and to be honest with you i can't really figure out what the downside would be just to pull on the bottom of the pile it's not like we're talking it's a stray vertical pile here and if you pull the bottom out the top is going to collapse down on you you know a natural pile of dirt is going to be kind of a pyramidal shape you know or a triangular triangular shape with a tapered side slope going this way where you're not just going to collapse everything in on you right am i forgetting something here am i missing something what's going on well those are 10 fascinating pieces of information i found buried inside our owner's manuals what gems have you found that are hidden share those below make sure you leave a comment give me a thumbs up give me a thumbs down if you haven't
