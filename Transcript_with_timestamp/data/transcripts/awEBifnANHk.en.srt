1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
we're here in the Willamette Valley on

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,940
Dickman farms and we're at the

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,500
Confluence of a couple of fields it's an

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,500
excellent opportunity to talk about crop

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,380
optionality so if you look to my left we

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,000
have a field of tall fescue this is a

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,699
grass seed so all of this will be

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,260
separated and all of that material will

9
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,680
turn into the type of grass seeds you

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,840
buy at Ace Hardware over here we have a

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,000
wheat field so this is all growing wheat

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,039
and then behind me you have a series of

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,439
onions so when you think about crop

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,059
optionality functionally you want to

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,860
rotate between the type of crops you

16
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,660
have on a single field when you have

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,280
several Fields next to each other this

18
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,800
provides an excellent opportunity to

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,140
move from one crop to another and manage

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,780
that all in one area so rotating between

21
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,020
drops on an annual basis allows you to

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,280
then resist that buildup of both disease

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,280
pressure as well as pest pressure
