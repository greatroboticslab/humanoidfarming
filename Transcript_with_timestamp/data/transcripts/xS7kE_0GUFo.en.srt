50
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,960
in perfectly straight lines with exact

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,719
spacing between rows ensuring that each

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,440
seed is planted in the optimal location

53
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,280
this not only makes planting more

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,040
efficient but also allows for better

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,920
crop management throughout the growing

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,519
season by using GPS to guide their

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,160
tractors farmers can avoid overlap

58
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,360
making sure no part of the field is

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,640
underused or overplanted this uniformity

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,640
is key to maximizing the use of land and

61
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,879
improving overall productivity the added

62
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,920
accuracy also reduced es the time spent

63
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,000
on reworking fields or correcting

64
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,440
mistakes this means less fuel less time

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,200
and more precise farming for larger

systems farmers can control when and

75
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,159
where water is distributed across their

76
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,040
fields ensuring that every plant gets

77
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,599
the exact amount of water it needs this

78
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,519
system can be combined with soil

79
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,640
moisture sensors which monitor the

80
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,519
soil's water levels in real time and

81
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,400
provide feedback to the irrigation

82
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,360
system as a result the system adjusts

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,879
the water output based on the specific

84
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,000
needs of each section of the field this

85
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,959
reduces Water waste and prevents over

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,760
irrigation which can damage crops for

87
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,720
Regions facing drought or water

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,280

89
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,040
GPS guided irrigation systems ensure

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,200
that every drop of water is used

91
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,879
efficiently saving resources while

92
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,680
promoting healthier crop growth farmers

93
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,959

technology shines especially when

99
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,280
combined with drones in the past farmers

100
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,120
would have to walk through their fields

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,599
to inspect their crops for signs of

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,799
disease pests or nutrient

103
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,360
deficiencies this was timec consuming

104
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:12,200
and often not very accurate now with

105
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,319
drones equipped with GPS and

106
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,160
