23

example. 11% of the cultivable land

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,119
receives 50% of the available water. Out

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,680
of 225 lakh hectares of arable land in

26
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:54,320

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,160

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:15,959

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,800
wells. However, excessive use of

34
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:23,080

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:32,800
Groundwater levels have dropped so much

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:36,959

Continuous cut trenches are dug out 1 to

81
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,759
excavated soil is collected on the down

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,240

83
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:43,600
trenches help in reduce runoff, help

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,720
conserve the soil and reduce the speed

large quantities of water then the soil

87
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,160
water actually percolates into the

88
00:06:51,800 --> 00:07:00,960

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:05,199
