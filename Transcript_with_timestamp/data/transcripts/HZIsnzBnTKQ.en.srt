only achieve a regenerative food system

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,560
if the nutrients from our food scraps

68
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,040
and other organic materials are cycled

69
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,720
back into our soils and farmers and

70
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,440

uh we at the million acre challenge work

161
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,759
towards regenerative agriculture using a

162
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,560
combination of five levers which are

163
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,639
represented in our five working groups

164
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,919
and you can see them here on this slide

165
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,000
um farmer engagement scientific research

166
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:19,560
creating of business case for

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,039
regeneration working on State and local

168
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,599
policy and also participating in U

169
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,800
National discussions about state and

170
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,919
local policy and creating consumer

171
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,120
demand for regenerative agriculture via

172
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,120
public Outreach so and of course as all

173
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,720
of you know because you're here today on

174
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,199
Farm composting is deeply important and

175
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,160
woven through all of these layers um and

176
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,639
these working groups with the potential

177
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,840
to increase Farm profitability provide

178
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,639
significant ecosystem services including

179
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,759
potentially reductions in greenhouse gas

180
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,520
emissions and contribute to farm

181
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,960
resilience in the face of a changing

182
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,720
climate which we feel every single day

183
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,639
at least on my farm um so as you all

184
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,400
know composting this is our mission uh

185
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,080
and our vision for the million acre

186
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,000
Challenge and composting is both

187
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,720
critically important to this mission and

188
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,720
vision and also scientifically and

189
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,400
technically complex which is why the

190
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,039
million acre challenge partners are so

191
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,879

appreciate the opportunity to uh talk

249
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:47,440
about on Farm composting because I think

250
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:51,760
it's important so let me get rid of

251
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:55,480
myself and start showing you my slides

252
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,480
which are great deal more

253
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,680

good sounds good okay great thanks so um

256
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,519
I'm going to talk about the fundamentals

257
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,720
of on composting and composting

258
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,480
generally um we have an hour that's not

259
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,320
a lot of time to cover the Waterfront so

260
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,639
I'm going to do this uh more or less

261
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,880
best as I can um I took a look at your

262
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,200
questions that you put in ahead of time

263
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,639
I think that will ask I will answer a

264
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,760
bunch of those um and some I will only

265
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:36,040
touch upon and then others uh you'll

266
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,560
have to wait for the other webinar

267
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,079
speakers who will address them in a bit

268
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,360
more detail but uh I'll be glad to

269
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:45,279
answer questions at the end to get into

270
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,320
more detail as

271
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,120
needed okay so uh what am I going to be

272
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,279
talking about today uh why on Farm

273
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,160
composting matters I'll give a brief

274
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,399
overview of the process and mostly by

275
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,399
example of what uh other Farms have done

276
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,720
show you the methods and equipments

277
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:06,959
involved in composting again it's just a

278
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,200
sampling given the time we have um we'll

279
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,360
talk about site requirements and en

280
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,040
environmental factors but here's where

281
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,760
the more or less comes in I'll be

282
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,920
spending more time on the the methods

283
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,959
and Equipment then I will be on site

284
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,519
requirements and environmental

285
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:28,399
factors okay what I won't be talking

286
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,120
about in much depth at all is composting

287
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,079
farmw test ities for vermac composting

288
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,000
on

289
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:40,600
Farm uh Community Based

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,480
composting and the compost how to use it

291
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,760
um how to make the quality you want how

292
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,839
to sell it and won't be getting much

293
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,279
into economics but again I'll be glad to

294
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:52,399
answer questions at the end and in

295
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,920
general details and specifics will be

296
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,480
missing because of the time but if

297
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,480
you're interested in at least three of

298
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,320
those topics uh composting animal

299
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,079
mortality Community scale composting and

300
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,680
Verma composting there are some great

301
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:05,519
references out there for you to gain

302
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,760
more

303
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,959
information um the one on the upper

304
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,920
leftand side is available from the

305
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:14,880
online from the cor Cornell Waste

306
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,760
Management Institute I think it's free

307
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,480
and the other two are books uh well

308
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,320
worth the investment and you'll be

309
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,360
hearing from James mcqueeny later on in

310
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,199
the program and then of course this has

311
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,839
been my big project is taking the on for

312
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:33,079
composing handbook expand in it and

313
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:37,639
updating it and um creating a new

314
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:39,720
handbook and this is just about done uh

315
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,160
the chapters are with the publisher they

316
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,880
think they could get it out by the end

317
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,160
of the year let's have our fingers

318
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,320
crossed um especially Before Christmas

319
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,320
I'm sure would make a great

320
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:56,560
Christmas um and that's the introduction

321
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,759
so what does composting

322
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,560
do in a nutshell basic basically

323
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,680
composting takes Raw Feed stocks like

324
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,759
this and many other types of feed stocks

325
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,519
these happen to be called potatoes from

326
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:16,399
um a farm in um Central

327
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,680
Washington and turns it into this from

328
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,040
something that's difficult to handle

329
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,759
doesn't have an immediate use to

330
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,120
something that's a lot more that's

331
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,800
easier to handle and does have a good

332
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,560
use so this compost being spread here

333
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,680
was made from

334
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,920
these very same well not the very same

335
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,680
but made from cold potatoes also and

336
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,560
other Packing Shed PS uh along with

337
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:42,000
dairy minor to become an input for this

338
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,000
particular

339
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,440
farm so why does on Farm composting

340
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,959
matter

341
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,839
well basically because composting and

342
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:57,759
compost matter they play important roles

343
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,920
not only in agriculture but in society

344
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,199
General and

345
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:07,399
composting and compost on

346
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:10,440
farms um Farms are an exellent place for

347
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:13,759
both so if we can take do a lot of the

348
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,519
composting on farms and Farms can accept

349
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,839
a lot of the compost that's

350
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:22,120
made um we are solving a great number of

351
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,560
problems so on Farm composting matters a

352
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,560
lot because compost and

353
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,360
compost uh the first reason the probably

354
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,639
the most important reason that

355
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,240
composting matters is that is the

356
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,319
compost which can greatly improve soils

357
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,680
and improve plant Health again you're

358
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:45,319
going to get a another uh womin RC U

359
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,000
presentation on this so I'm not going go

360
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:50,720
in any depth but in a picture this is

361
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,399
what composting does for the

362
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:58,040
soil and in words from the same um from

363
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:02,199
Dr Gan um these are some of the benefits

364
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,199
of compost to soils and

365
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,240
plants particularly on farms composting

366
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,800
also has a place in manure management

367
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,480
increasingly um Farmers have uh some

368
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,040
difficulty handling manur as animal

369
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,360
numbers increase and land doesn't

370
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,319
necessarily increase along with it um

371
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,160
it's easy to get in a situation where

372
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:26,480
there's too many nutrients for the

373
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:29,720
farm uh manure can be difficult to

374
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,519
handle um it has more volume more weight

375
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,360
more water than compost and that could

376
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,800
equate to more trips to distant fields

377
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:42,240
to apply it uh in an agronomic

378
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:45,360
manner um whereas compost stores well it

379
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,120
doesn't have to be applied right away uh

380
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,480
and it's exportable and it's exportable

381
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,880
because it handles easily and therefore

382
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,199
more people want it or more people

383
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,000
willing to take it from the farm and

384
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:01,360
even people willing to pay for it so

385
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,079
potentially depending upon the farm

386
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,439
situation um compost can can be a

387
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:09,679
benefit to minor

388
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,039
man okay and then there's the potential

389
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:15,760
for added Revenue to the

390
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:18,000
mar Revenue can come from uh making

391
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:23,039
compost by selling the compost that's

392
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,360
made or by being paid to take uh waste

393
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:29,039
and residu from off the farm so this

394
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,799
picture shows both this is not a farm

395
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,919
this is a company that takes advantage

396
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,080
of both of those revenue streams they

397
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,880
sell compost they charge for bring in

398
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:42,280
inred in farm situations that could be

399
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,799
difficult um in some jurisdictions if

400
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:48,400
you do either of these on the farm that

401
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:51,240
is sell compost made from waste from off

402
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,080
the form or sell compost at all or

403
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,919
taking off Farm waste uh that

404
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,000
jurisdiction may say well you're no

405
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,039
longer Farm that's not always the case

406
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,840
depends upon the state in particular in

407
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,960
some cases you could do both and still

408
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:09,400
retain uh your your farm

409
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,919
classification in other cases uh you

410
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,480
could do one or the other better not

411
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,240
both and that's usually the common case

412
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,159
so you can sell

413
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,960
compost um from feed stocks that you

414
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:24,440
collect on the farm or even off farm

415
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,919
feed stocks and you're still Farm or you

416
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,440
can bring in green waste but not sell

417
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,120
the compost um and you'd be still a farm

418
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,840
usually it's the bringing in off Farm

419
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,360
materials that's a little more allowed

420
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,880
and where the revenues U are more easily

421
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,840
captured in this case it takes a pretty

422
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,919
good effort sometimes to

423
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,280
Sol um and bringing in off Farm waste um

424
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,400
there were a lot of people who might be

425
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,640
looking for a home for their waste and

426
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,440
residues uh and farms are a good place

427
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:00,039
to bring it it just brings some

428
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,559
cautions and we'll talk about that

429
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:06,600
one of the reasons that route is a

430
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,559
little easier is because um we recognize

431
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,799
that it's not so easy to get rid of

432
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,520
waste anymore particularly organic waste

433
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,880
don't want to put them in Nill and a

434
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,320
good number of states the slides from my

435
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,080
colleague Matt cotton good number of

436
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:23,520
states uh starting 40 years ago started

437
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,280
Banning art trimmings from lfi that's

438
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,600
when we had a landfill crisis and more

439
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,440
recently um a number states are

440
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,520
beginning to ban uh Food wids they'll

441
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:38,760
call it or Organics generally New York

442
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,320
State being the most recent to um to

443
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,679
implement a Statewide ban uh for food

444
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,120
and that presents

445
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,320
opportunities uh for Farm to Tak in

446
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:53,440
these materials and pay get paid to do

447
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:59,360
that um so you know

448
00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:02,760
food is the new trend and it's because

449
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,600
of its impact on climate change so when

450
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,679
food is brought to the landfill even

451
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:10,720
with a landfill with a a um methane

452
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,320
collection system it still makes methane

453
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,039
and that methane escapes and that's

454
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,320
because food breaks down so quickly at

455
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:19,520
the landfill face um it it emits its

456
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,080
methane

457
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:26,000
before methane clutch system has a

458
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,840
effect has chance to to start collecting

459
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,840
and methane is a poent greenhouse and

460
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,840
thirdly there's better options for food

461
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,720
than than throwing it l first being um

462
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,600
try to make use of it uh as food for

463
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,039
people and then food the animals and

464
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,840
then finally can be composted or sent an

465
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,880
analytic

466
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,120
digestion but all of those are better

467
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,159
than land so the push to start taking

468
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,200
food waste out of the landfill though is

469
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,200
mostly due to climate

470
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,360
change and then compost has some

471
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:03,240
benefits as far as uh cration sticking

472
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,280
to the climate change theme um this

473
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:10,679
slide is from uh Jeff Greek I think I

474
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:13,360
saw Jeff's name on on the list um so

475
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:17,240
this is where compost have been used on

476
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,960
rangeland or pasture in uh Marin County

477
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,120
in

478
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,760
California and uh the researcher has

479
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,039
shown some pretty good benefits so

480
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,640
here's just an

481
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:28,799
example um oh let me go back that's the

482
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,559
previous Slide the squares indicate

483
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,080
where cows are grazing on this land that

484
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,600
they receive compost and they seem to be

485
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:40,200
preferentially grazing on those plots

486
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:44,640
where composts was uh used versus um the

487
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:47,679
rest of the pasture lamb where was no

488
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,240
compos um but more directly this is a

489
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:54,919
slide of the soil organic

490
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,400
matter uh several years after a single

491
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,919
application of compost was made so the

492
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,520
red bars are are the plots that had

493
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,880
compost and you can see they generally

494
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,559
show pyur oranic matter compared to

495
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,240
control plots which didn't receive

496
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,440
compost but the big story here is that

497
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,279
this is not an annual application of

498
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,640
compost that that the soil organic

499
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:19,600
matter is responding to but a single

500
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,000
application that happened in two 2008 so

501
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,640
that one application has many years of

502
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,640
impact and this project is still going

503
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,640
on

504
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,120
uh so sticking with the climate change

505
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,520
theme um another colleague of mine uh

506
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,799
Jane Gilbert led a team that looked that

507
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:42,520
tried to put a number on the V carbon

508
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:44,600
sequestration value of compost alone

509
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:48,400
it's available in this publication from

510
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,480
the iswa again I think that's free uh

511
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,440
and they placed a value on it just for

512
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,400
carbon sequestration of

513
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,919
$59 per fresh ton of compost that's of

514
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:02,360
the compost and not of the waste meaning

515
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,360
it's not a Dr kind of compost

516
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,840
that's there's some value there so all

517
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,919
good great unfund composting will great

518
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,240
what's the

519
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,600
downside well it takes work it takes

520
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,279
work it takes time you got to put money

521
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,080
into it you need space to do it

522
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:22,600
investment in equipment investment in

523
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:27,360
land maybe investment in

524
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:29,400
controls um so it's not free and the

525
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,919
hope is that it'll pay for itself either

526
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,080
in uh the value of the compost or the

527
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,279
service you provide um but it does take

528
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,279
an

529
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:44,559
effort and then there also the hassles

530
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:47,200
related to mostly odors okay um so this

531
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,760
is a sign I came across uh where a

532
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,760
compost was trying to expand a farm

533
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,960
composter uh into new land and there was

534
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,159
lots of

535
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,240
neighborhood opposition to that mostly

536
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:03,440
because there had been odor issues

537
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:06,120
before um so composting isn't welcome by

538
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,240
everyone it's generally welcom by

539
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,919
everyone until it get comes to your

540
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,880
neighborhood and then there's an issue

541
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,799
these things are controllable um I

542
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,799
shouldn't say controllable these things

543
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:21,039
can be made better by a number of

544
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:23,960
practices that composters can do

545
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,399
including um becoming more active

546
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,880
participating in the

547
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:30,279
neighborhood um but this is one of the

548
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,960
things that any composter May face even

549
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:37,919
on a farm but the sign's wrong sign

550
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:40,520
should say this say yes composting and

551
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,919
it is farming it's very compatible with

552
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,799
farming it's consistent with farming in

553
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:48,880
fact I would even argue that composting

554
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:52,000
is inherently farming um by its nature

555
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,840
because you're you're using natural

556
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,799
processes to produce a

557
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,279
product um that and you're husbanding

558
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,720
microorganisms to do that

559
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:05,760
and um it's a radical idea but I would

560
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,440
suggest yes if you're composting you're

561
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,440
automatically

562
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:16,080
F so um that's the why let's look at the

563
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,520
how the composting process Le part of

564
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,799
the house I'm going to go through this

565
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,720
fairly quickly uh because a lot of you

566
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:23,960
are composters already I know much of

567
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,279
this uh these are the ins and outs of

568
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,799
the composting process the direction of

569
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:31,640
the Arrow show whether it's an in or out

570
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,440
basically what we put in are feed stocks

571
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,559
the microorganisms are there although

572
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,440
some people add special microorganisms

573
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:42,039
to do that the oxygen comes in on its

574
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,720
own um although again in some cases they

575
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:46,480
have to make an effort to do that and

576
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,200
the water is well and the outputs are

577
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,600
water vapor carbon dioxide and heat all

578
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,640
good things and then there are some bad

579
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,840
things odors and other gases that people

580
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,240
might object check to but the main

581
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,559
output is complex which is a value added

582
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:07,279
product of the feed stocks that

583
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:09,320
go and here's the trend of a compost uh

584
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,960
a composting process okay many of you

585
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,279
have seen this graph or something like

586
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,320
it temperature tells a story of what's

587
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,520
going on during compost and temperature

588
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,799
does that by by the fact that it's a

589
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,720
direct result of the decomposition

590
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:26,080
that's taking place of the microbes

591
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,960
action so as heat is released from

592
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,080
decomposition temperature goes up

593
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,600
and uh accumulates and heats up the pile

594
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,840
and it it basically reflects how much

595
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,600
heat is being

596
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,200
generated okay so there's several stages

597
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,240
there's this accelerating stage in the

598
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:47,919
begin beginning when temperature heats

599
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:50,039
up quickly this long stage um hot hot

600
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,640
and Rapid composting where we spend most

601
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:56,559
of our time um and then a final stage

602
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,039
where compost cures and

603
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:01,919
matures and and that's reflected by the

604
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:05,159
lower temperatures going on there's a

605
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:09,559
few other temperatures to uh take note

606
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:11,360
of one is the the the point at which a

607
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:13,760
mesophilic process turns into a

608
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,760
thermophilic process this is not a very

609
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,399
important point it's just an academic

610
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,880
matter really and it's not it's not a

611
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:23,799
fixed Point anyway the microorganism

612
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,039
cell don't see this line and don't know

613
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:29,000
where it happens uh it's just that

614
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:30,760
thermophilic microorganisms can um

615
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,480
withstand higher temperatures and they

616
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,000
do most of the work through most of the

617
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,360
composting process and mesophilic micro

618
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,399
don't they can play different

619
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,039
roles um so mesophilic for example

620
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:45,360
mesophilic

621
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,320
microorganisms uh are more active in

622
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,679
that curing and maturing stage and

623
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,679
they're mesophilic some mesophilic

624
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,720
organisms are the ones that turn ammonia

625
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,240
into nitrite and nitrate so that

626
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,159
transformation happens

627
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,760
basically we're in a thermic for the

628
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,600
w a more important line is this one and

629
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,240
that's the pathogen

630
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,720
threshold um or at least that's the

631
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,440
pathogen the standard pathogen thres

632
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,480
regulations

633
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:20,399
often dictate that pathogens and wheat

634
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,960
seeds have to be killed depending upon

635
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,840
the feed stocks and the situation you

636
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,440
have to make sure you've followed

637
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,960
pathogen reduction process and in the US

638
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,919
we call that

639
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,120
uh process to

640
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,679
further process to further reduce

641
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,440
pathogens

642
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,519
PP uh outside of the us we may just call

643
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,480
it sanitization or

644
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:45,960
or or homogeneization

645
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,720
um but it generally happens it's

646
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,600
generally defined at this 55 degre

647
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,600
Celsius or 100 which is 101 degrees

648
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:59,279
fahren at this point so normally the

649
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:02,080
regulations say when they apply is that

650
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,799
have to hold the composting materials

651
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,320
above that temperature for a certain

652
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:08,720
amount of time for static processes and

653
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:13,559
processes that are contained in the

654
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:17,080
vessel that's 55 degrees C uh for three

655
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:19,399
days uh for windr which are smaller have

656
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,600
a more a larger surface area and they

657
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:24,919
get turned it's actually 15 degrees and

658
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,840
it has to be turned five times within

659
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:32,960
that time span within that 15 degre

660
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:36,760
times or it has to be turned five

661
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:40,440
times and uh and during the five times

662
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:43,640
it stays above 55 de now outside of the

663
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:47,320
us some regulations require have raised

664
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:50,200
this passage threshold to 60 degrees and

665
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:53,240
even 65 degrees in some places which can

666
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,720
be a challenge depending upon the but

667
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,360
basically is 505 so that's an important

668
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,960
one and that's also where we see are

669
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:06,519
killed actually most wheat seeds are

670
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:09,240
killed below well below 55 um 131 even

671
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,840
at at 120 degrees Fahrenheits Mo most

672
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,760
wheat seeds can die um but if you want

673
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,200
to be sure um the higher the temperature

674
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,240
the better and and keeping the pile

675
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,399
moist during those hot temperatures also

676
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:26,640
helps to destroy some

677
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:28,640
seeds okay just as a clarification those

678
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,000
dips on this curve really you're to

679
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,279
represent one one pile maybe turned or

680
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,880
water it's an immediate loss temperature

681
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:38,399
but it

682
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,399
recovers okay and then there's a curing

683
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,640
stage at the end where uh the process

684
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:47,559
continues it's de decomposition is still

685
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,640
going on but it's at a much slower pace

686
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:51,519
so this curing pile doesn't require the

687
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,039
same

688
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:57,440
attention um or effort as the active

689
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,600
composting stage it's an important stage

690
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,960
a lot of things happen in curing

691
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,559
temperatures lower again those

692
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,919
mesophilic organisms fungi begin to come

693
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,360
back uh in greater numbers during curing

694
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,919
and

695
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,799
continue turning this partially

696
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:18,120
composted material into

697
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:21,320
compx so it's an important stage but

698
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:24,039
it's requires less attention and

699
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,320
actually less time

700
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:30,200
as so here are some of the key factors

701
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:33,039
that determine how well composting

702
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,000
occurs um it needs to be moist the

703
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:40,320
organisms live in in the moisture within

704
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:44,559
the compost pile and the 50 to 60%

705
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,799
moisture content um seems to be uh the

706
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,360
optimal it has to have a good mix of

707
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,960
nutrients particularly carbon and

708
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,120
nitrogen I recommend higher carbon

709
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,480
nitrogen

710
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,600
ratios um than most people do if go by

711
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,639
the book we're talking about 25 to one

712
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,399
or slightly larger I like to say more

713
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:09,559
because the more higher the carbon

714
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:13,360
nitrogen ratio is the better that a p

715
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:16,799
windro tends to aate and also this it

716
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:20,880
slows down a process bit as the carbon

717
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,679
nitrogen ratio raises above 25 to one

718
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,480
process slows down um if you're in a

719
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,039
hurry that's not good but if you're not

720
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:31,120
in a hurry and um want a little more

721
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:35,440
leeway to manage the process properly

722
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,440
having a higher C ratio isn't bad um

723
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,240
however the downside of high seeden

724
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,120
ratio is that carries over into the

725
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,559
compost making compost High ratio and

726
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,519
that that does have

727
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:52,399
some bulk density refers to um the

728
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:54,840
weight per unit volume um but is turns

729
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,840
out the bulk density is a pretty good

730
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,639
indicator of the processed conditions

731
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,799
generally both the

732
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:05,120
moisture um condition and how well how

733
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,600
much for space there is open for space

734
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,799
there is and so um it's a good indicator

735
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,240
of how well a pile will aate whether

736
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,760
you're using fans or passive variation

737
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,480
and should stay below 100 th a thousand

738
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,159
pounds

739
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,559
cub and and

740
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:28,279
temperatures um again try to stay in

741
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:30,200
that ideal range above where the pass

742
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:31,960
Hill but below where the microorgan

743
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,399
being seem to suffer and that seems to

744
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,760
be about

745
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:40,200
160 okay there's some other parameters

746
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:43,799
that are important but um they're not as

747
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:46,440
important in terms of control what we do

748
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:49,279
oxygen is clearly important but in most

749
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,960
cases composters do not spend a lot of

750
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:55,200
time measuring it they use temperature

751
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,399
as an indirect gauge

752
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,799
instead so let's take a look a little

753
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:03,159
bit more at each one of these again uh

754
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,279
there's there's a range where moist

755
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:07,000
where there moisture content is just

756
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,879
right you get a little higher it's too

757
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,919
wet materials get heavy pors get fill

758
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:14,720
with water it can't aate and then a

759
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:16,000
point where the process slows down

760
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,599
because there's n enough water for the

761
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,879
microorganisms to

762
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:25,200
inhabit uh so that sweet sweet spot is

763
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:27,760
is above 50 below 65 you get below 35

764
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,599
it's way too dry and nothing will happen

765
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,879
and it's thir

766
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,919
stu um so the challenge in composting is

767
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:38,679
depending upon where you're composting

768
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:40,760
where you are is keeping it moist in ARR

769
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:43,359
regions this is a constant strugle

770
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,960
because it's not easy to add moisture

771
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,240
evenly uh throughout a

772
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,359
pile a good way to do it is to add

773
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,599
moisture while you're turning um but

774
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:54,720
that means you've got to carry water

775
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:55,639
with with with along with you as you're

776
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,640
doing the

777
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,880
turn so keeping it moist is

778
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,960
important um keeping it dry keeping from

779
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,359
getting too moist is also important so

780
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,119
here's pictures of these fabric covers

781
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:10,240
that are used to keep out

782
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:13,440
precipitation this is not necessarily

783
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:17,240
the only way but it's a good picture of

784
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,520
um of an attempt to keep it from uh

785
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:23,599
getting too moist really the best way or

786
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,280
the most common way is to uh turn it to

787
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,040
try to drive off some of that moisture

788
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,560
especially on the sunny day um but in

789
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,680
some places keeping it from getting too

790
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,760
dry is the challenge in other places

791
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,760
keeping it from getting too

792
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,680
moist oxygen really is the key to

793
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:45,640
composting you know that's what the we

794
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,440
want aerobic oxygen rich conditions in

795
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,319
the pile because we want aerobic

796
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,640
microorganisms to do the work because

797
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:52,880
those are the ones who do it most

798
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,280
quickly most completely and with the

799
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,880
least amount of odors um 5% is

800
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,520
considered a minimum that's a big bare

801
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,800
minimum but generally the goal is to try

802
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,640
to keep it above

803
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:10,800
that and normally we don't monitor from

804
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:13,920
oxygen um again we let temperature tell

805
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,200
the story um and then we just array as

806
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,839
best we can um and oxygen is delivered

807
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,359
to the to the pile by Iration and

808
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:26,720
there's two primary ways of eration uh

809
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:29,359
windr and passive piles aate by passive

810
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,079
aration basically what's happening is

811
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,560
inside the pile it's a little warmer

812
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,480
than it is in the environment around and

813
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:40,359
that warm air uh leaves the

814
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:44,160
pile uh and then it creates a vacuum and

815
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:47,520
cool air cool oxygen rich air replaces

816
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,920
it uh diffusion is another way that

817
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,359
oxygen gets in and CO2 gets out of the

818
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,760
pile but defusion is a very slow process

819
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:58,160
relying on that doesn't provide nearly

820
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,319
as much air and oxygen as

821
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,599
these passive air movements and these

822
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:04,480
passive air movements are very dependent

823
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:07,280
on first of all generating temperatures

824
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,640
inside warmer temperatures inside but

825
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,760
also uh how easy the air can move in and

826
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,000
out and that has to do with the airspace

827
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,920
within the P both

828
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,640
density uh we can air with more

829
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:26,640
certainty by putting a fan and some duct

830
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:29,160
workor within the pile um using pressure

831
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,400
to blow air into the middle of it and

832
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,079
then hopefully it's distributed evenly

833
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,560
and the cool fresh oxygen rich air goes

834
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:40,760
in the middle cools the pile keeps it

835
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:44,119
from getting too hot and also brings in

836
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:47,040
oxygen the primary way of using Forest

837
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:48,760
Iration especially on Farm on farms it's

838
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,680
a method called the air rated static

839
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:54,400
pile method this would be a diagram of

840
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,800
that rated static piles do not get

841
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,119
turned on a regular basis um they may

842
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,079
get turned

843
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:06,440
occasionally um once or twice and the

844
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:09,480
Iration system has to be um taken out

845
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:12,000
disassembled and reassembled when when

846
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,319
returning uh or it's built into a floor

847
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,480
and you can turn on top of

848
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:21,640
that um but this is a picture of the AA

849
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:24,280
sta could also suck air out of the pile

850
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,760
change the direction of these arrows um

851
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,040
that would be used when we a little bit

852
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,760
more concerned about

853
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,880
odors um because you concentrate the

854
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,280
exhaust from the pile at one point and

855
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,079
that can be directed to an odor

856
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,880
treatment system like

857
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:42,920
pile but positive pressure uh systems

858
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:45,880
like the one showing here um are

859
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:49,240
generally easier to handle they use less

860
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:51,440
energy and um they are the most common

861
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,520
I'll show you some pictures of these

862
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,280
later okay so I haven't talked about

863
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,160
turning yet in regard to ation so what

864
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:02,079
does turning do well doesn't really aate

865
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,760
it at least not in the long term here

866
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,599
are the functions that turning it does

867
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:11,800
charge the pile with fresh air and

868
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:15,680
oxygen that oxygen is lasts only briefly

869
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:19,040
an hour maybe two hours at Best the

870
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,079
Turning is not really does not really

871
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,880
provide

872
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:25,960
irration what it does is it releases the

873
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,119
gases that are crapped inside mixes

874
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,640
things up so it redistributes nutrients

875
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,839
and moisture it breaks up air

876
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,200
channels improves

877
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:39,440
consistency in some cases it does fluff

878
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:42,359
so it reduces the density of the

879
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,960
material in the wind drill uh making it

880
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:46,920
easier for air to flow in and and out by

881
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,160
passive

882
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,640
variation but in other cases it doesn't

883
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,200
in other cases it shreds particles apart

884
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,119
and after turning you end up with a a

885
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,920
windo that's less dense than

886
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,240
so it depends on the situation and

887
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,240
turning brakes apart

888
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,839
comes so that's primarily what it does

889
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,839
and because of that generally

890
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:14,040
invigorates the process always see a

891
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,880
burst of activity

892
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:19,200
after part of it that oxygen that it

893
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,119
builds in for a short time but a lot of

894
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,920
it are those other you mixing and

895
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:27,440
churning um I kind of compare it to

896
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,040
making a stir fry on the stove and

897
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,640
you're actually doing the stirring to

898
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,760
distribute things around the pan a

899
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:37,200
little bit more and make things more

900
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,200
even that's the turning

901
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,319
point you can Envision what's going on

902
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,240
within the composting pile at a

903
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:49,359
microscopic level and it might look

904
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:53,040
something like this um you've got these

905
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:56,119
particles of biodegradable organic

906
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,599
materials um they're breaking down and

907
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,400
this moisture film kind of clings to the

908
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,400
edge of it and that's where the

909
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,040
microorganisms are in that moisture film

910
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,920
and they're breaking down the particle

911
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,880
from its surfaces outward and the

912
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,960
nutrients tend to dissolve into that

913
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,000
moisture film and the

914
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,920
microorganisms um gain the nutrients and

915
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,440
the

916
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,359
moisture um where's the oxygen well

917
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,319
immediately most of the oxygen in those

918
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:27,680
core spaces that you're seeing on the

919
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:30,599
left and it has the oxygen has to used

920
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,280
into the moisture film to get to the

921
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:36,240
microorganism um so it's important to

922
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,880
remain to maintain pile that has those

923
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,400
four spaces we call them free air spaces

924
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,720
because they're not filled with

925
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,599
motion um so that the oxy can first get

926
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,800
into the interior Pile in order to fuse

927
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:51,760
into the liquid film we want to avoid

928
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,839
the situation on the right as much as

929
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,599
possible where particles are clumped

930
00:41:53,839 --> 00:42:00,200
together there's no free a space um and

931
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:04,200
no and it's more difficult for oxygen to

932
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:06,760
fuse into that moisture so we want to we

933
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:09,880
want to encourage the left hand side of

934
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,880
this diagram rather

935
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,400
than and what determines that in part is

936
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:19,880
the bulk density bulk density

937
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,119
reflects whether we have these particles

938
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:26,280
all packed together uh without free air

939
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,880
space and a lot of moisture or whether

940
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,599
it's

941
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:34,119
fluffier and so uh we shoot for a bulk

942
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,200
density in that's 700 to 1,000 pounds

943
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:37,760
per

944
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,720
cubic and it's pretty easy to measure bu

945
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,079
density all you need is a pale on the

946
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,040
scale there's a standard method of doing

947
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,319
this by filling a pale certain amount

948
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,079
dropping it from a certain height keep

949
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,760
filling the pil and keep dropping it

950
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,880
until you get to a certain point and

951
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,000
then you weigh it and You' got the

952
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,240
weight for a 5 gallon pale and you can

953
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,680
convert that to pounds go it's easy to

954
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:03,280
do the reason I show this slide is

955
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,480
because bulk density is an easy and and

956
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,319
very general measure to determine um the

957
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,680
conditions in the p and it's a good

958
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:15,119
one pile height it's often the question

959
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:18,559
uh what's the right height for a pile I

960
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:21,160
like to measure um pile Heights in

961
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:25,280
Calvin this is Calvin you see in the

962
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:28,880
picture this pile is maybe two Calvin

963
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:33,319
High the reason I measuring Calvin is

964
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,599
because to me feet is a bit too impris

965
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:38,000
we're talking about p height what's the

966
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,839
difference between a three foot high or

967
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,680
four foot high pile or

968
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:45,359
even six and eight foot high pile not

969
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:48,640
much so I like to refer to pile Heights

970
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:51,920
and Calin um and so in general maybe

971
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,640
three Calin is a Max and if you want to

972
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,359
do the conversion Calvin's about six

973
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:59,400
foot tall that's the point we don't need

974
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:00,880
to be to% size uh as one of my

975
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,920
colleagues says there's really no

976
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,800
decimal points in

977
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:09,040
compx um but in regard to windro size

978
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,920
maybe the best rule of thumb to go by is

979
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,559
you have to drive onto a

980
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:17,079
pile um to get it to the top to stack it

981
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:21,520
then it's too

982
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:23,000
big but generally the pile sizes are

983
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,880
determined by the equipment you're going

984
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,720
to be used to making cont you're using

985
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,280
wind Turner the wind returners are going

986
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:33,200
to dictate the power but if you're using

987
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,640
loaders you can go a lot higher and so

988
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,440
this rule of thumb of not driving on the

989
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,359
pile to determine the

990
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:44,119
pile the way to go next factor is feed

991
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:46,559
stocks feed stock all brings all of its

992
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:49,480
character to the compost pile and

993
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:51,280
basically feed stocks are what determine

994
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,480
how the composting process is going to

995
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,359
go how it's going to behave and feed

996
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,720
stocks primarily determine the character

997
00:44:56,359 --> 00:45:00,720
of the compos itself so if you have

998
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,960
nutrient Rich feed stocks you'll make

999
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,559
nutrient Rich comp you have nutrient

1000
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,839
poor feed stocks you'll make nutrient

1001
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:08,440
poor

1002
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,119
comp uh Woody feed stocks make Woody

1003
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,400
comp you get

1004
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:16,079
it and feed stocks with contaminants

1005
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,599
will make comp you can do things to

1006
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,240
improve that really it's the feed stops

1007
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:22,400
that

1008
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,599
determ sometimes you get feet stocks

1009
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,440
that are adequately balanced or compost

1010
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,599
without doing anything like these y

1011
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,359
triming on the right sometimes not like

1012
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,440
this manure in the bottom left um that

1013
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:37,960
needs some amending before it'll compost

1014
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,599
that and so what we do is we mix

1015
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,640
ingredients together ingredients that

1016
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:44,680
don't have enough nitrogen with Medi

1017
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,440
ingredients have too much nitrogen

1018
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,640
ingredients that are wet in with

1019
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,079
ingredients that are dry to try to get

1020
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,720
get these conditions I talked about

1021
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:57,520
early and russan leaves and grass and

1022
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:59,480
food are good examples in uh in the

1023
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,720
backyard composting world we talk about

1024
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:05,079
these low nitrogen materials as Browns

1025
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:08,839
and these high nitrogen materials as

1026
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:11,200
greens and the high nitrogen materials

1027
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:13,680
most often are wet not always but most

1028
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,480
often are wet and the the low nitrogen

1029
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,839
materials most often are dry so

1030
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,400
combining them together with the right

1031
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:22,599
sedan ratio also tends to improve the

1032
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,839
moisture that here's an example of a

1033
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:27,760
composting

1034
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:29,599
recipe um on a farm using fish waste

1035
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,079
James mwe is going to talk about this a

1036
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,920
lot more so I'm not going to go into it

1037
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:39,559
there's examples of nitrogen Rich feet

1038
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:42,400
stocks poultry manure fish waste food

1039
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:45,800
grass and you want to combine those with

1040
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:50,079
nitrogen poor feet stops like fall

1041
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:53,040
leaves straw uh horse beding brush

1042
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:55,880
things of that nature I cross out carbon

1043
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,960
and put in nitrogen po because uh we

1044
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,960
often refer to things as as carbon

1045
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,079
sources but really carbons in everything

1046
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,880
even in the

1047
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,760
nitrogen High nitrogen materials

1048
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,359
everything all organic material has

1049
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,400
roughly the same amount of carbon it's

1050
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:13,119
the nitrogen that

1051
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,440
determines whether it's a carbon Source

1052
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,800
or not

1053
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,000
really okay the next factor is

1054
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,640
temperature talked a lot about that

1055
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,960
already um there's temperature range

1056
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:27,559
that's ideal for composting it tends to

1057
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:32,839
be between 120 and uh

1058
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:35,559
um 140 degrees fahit but at 160 it

1059
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:38,720
doesn't suffer much above 160 start to

1060
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:42,280
suffer more but we want to get to that

1061
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:45,920
130 level to kill pathogens and wheat

1062
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:47,079
seeds Okay the thing about temperature

1063
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,480
the most important thing about

1064
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:51,119
temperature the composting process is

1065
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,839
that you can consider temperature

1066
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,319
composting Soma talked about this

1067
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:58,640
already the release of heat is direct

1068
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,599
result of the process so watching the

1069
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,559
temperature reflects the release the

1070
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:06,040
Heat and the microbial activ so it's the

1071
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:09,000
most important parameter to monitor to

1072
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:12,240
tell us what's going on and then time is

1073
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,520
the last thing it takes some time you

1074
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:17,079
can't really Rush the microorganism too

1075
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,680
much usually we need at least about a

1076
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:23,040
month to make stable compost for General

1077
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:26,160
use um more often it takes two to six

1078
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,559
months and if you relaxed about it or

1079
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,440
have tough Fe stocks it could take a

1080
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,040
year or

1081
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,680
more and it depends on the beat stocks

1082
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,920
how you intend to use the compost and

1083
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:39,680
how stability stable it needs to be when

1084
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,160
you're using it the

1085
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:45,680
methods and it's really the

1086
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:47,559
management once you determine it's it's

1087
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,480
the management more so than the method

1088
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:50,480
that determines what you

1089
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,400
not and then you watch all these things

1090
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:59,440
to make sure it's gone and the sensory

1091
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:04,640
OB ation includes

1092
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:07,200
OD okay let's move on to equipment and

1093
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:11,000
methods I'm going to use examples to go

1094
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,000
over different Farm scale

1095
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:15,559
composting so the most common is turned

1096
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,119
windr and that's what you'll see the

1097
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:18,200
most pictures of and that's probably

1098
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:22,359
what you have in your mind when you

1099
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:25,000
think about comp a long narrow pile of

1100
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:27,200
material that gets turned and churned

1101
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,040
every now and then

1102
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,680
the main advantage of Windrose is that

1103
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,960
it's simple it's easily started and

1104
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,839
managed anybody can do it anybody almost

1105
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,760
build a window in their backyard Pile in

1106
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:40,799
their backyard and start composting or

1107
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:43,240
in their back

1108
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:46,920
40 really don't need any special

1109
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:50,000
equipment and that's the reason most

1110
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:52,599
people so here's an example of a farm

1111
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,079
who compost de cattle manure with some

1112
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:57,599
waste from grocery stores and and some

1113
00:49:55,079 --> 00:50:00,079
from food processing facility or all

1114
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:03,000
vegetables in that case and they simply

1115
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,040
make window RS with um a skid steel

1116
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,160
loader that has an oversized

1117
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:11,280
bucket um makes the windows and turn

1118
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,480
every now and then okay fairly simple

1119
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,960
when the

1120
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,160
turn that's really a a a composter

1121
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,799
specific

1122
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,760
situation uh and preference um but it

1123
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:26,960
doesn't require much more than a skid

1124
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,920
steer in this case um there are some

1125
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:33,160
involve probably to move materials

1126
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:36,000
around the farm but so this is all

1127
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,200
involves here's another example this is

1128
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,480
a horse

1129
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:44,400
farm um that's using it adding its horse

1130
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:46,520
minority yard trimmings um that it was

1131
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,040
getting from the municipalities I don't

1132
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,280
think this

1133
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:53,760
operation I think it's closed down years

1134
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:55,760
ago but basically just to show you how

1135
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,280
they manage it they use an excavator as

1136
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,720
their primary

1137
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,280
uh turning device just every now and

1138
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:05,839
then move piles with the bucket on an

1139
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:08,799
excavator and I also use that to build

1140
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:12,359
piles their their main objective here

1141
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:14,799
was to compost the yard trimers um the

1142
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:17,359
horse farm is basically just an excuse

1143
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:19,760
to have an off farm when you're

1144
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:22,400
composting your trimmings um you're

1145
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:25,760
going to need to grind them up if you're

1146
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,160
taking any brush and then because

1147
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,799
there'll be a lot of wood still in it

1148
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:32,359
when you're done composting you'll need

1149
00:51:28,799 --> 00:51:33,920
to screen out the oversized materials

1150
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:36,880
and in this case they use the traal

1151
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,119
screen that probably hired out both

1152
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,960
sides of that they hired in the grinder

1153
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:45,440
and hired out screen

1154
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:49,040
time uh here's another example of a

1155
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:51,160
windro u turned operation on in this

1156
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:54,000
case the farm compost manure with the AR

1157
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:58,559
jimes and also some food processing

1158
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:01,559
waste um and and they turn they build

1159
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:05,160
their windows with a loader and turn

1160
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:07,960
them with this tractor power Turner like

1161
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:11,319
tractor uh Powers the Turner both by

1162
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:13,280
pulling it um it's used for travel and

1163
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:16,680
also through the the

1164
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:19,559
PTO uh it drives the Turner

1165
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:21,680
itself and you can see they have fairly

1166
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:25,079
wide aisles between wind grows to

1167
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:28,480
accommodate the traffic on both sides

1168
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:30,839
although um you could actually stack two

1169
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:34,000
windows closer together you don't need

1170
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:37,799
an aisle for the tractor on both

1171
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,000
sides this is still that same form um

1172
00:52:37,799 --> 00:52:42,400
they do make an effort to water their

1173
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,160
windr their windro Turner has nozzles on

1174
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:48,079
it so they can add water while they're

1175
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:51,400
turning and they have a tank wagon that

1176
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:54,240
they pull behind the Turner um which

1177
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,799
feeds the nozzles on the front because

1178
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,720
they're handling our trimmings this uh

1179
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:02,000
Farm also does some screening they own

1180
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:05,319
the satellite screen they use to

1181
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,799
make Dr rink yes just wanted to flag we

1182
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:11,440
have about 20 minutes left 20 minutes 20

1183
00:53:07,799 --> 00:53:14,000
minutes for my part for the presentation

1184
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,880
before okay to leave to leave time for

1185
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,920
Q&A okay thank you Linda

1186
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:24,359
um again this is another example of a

1187
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:27,280
farm that uses a window Turner trctor

1188
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:30,200
assisted windro Turner in this case it's

1189
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,880
uh uh sparms and Idaho so their Dairy

1190
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:35,680
manure is from the outside lots and it

1191
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,920
tends to be dry um they add some bedding

1192
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,839
to it to improve the the composting

1193
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,680
situation and they have a their Turner

1194
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:49,240
has needs a tractor for travel but it

1195
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:53,839
has its own engine to power Turner

1196
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:56,280
itself um they have a a to mounted Manor

1197
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:57,079
spreader um that they build the piles

1198
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,799
with

1199
00:53:57,079 --> 00:54:03,240
with um and because it's an Idaho

1200
00:54:00,799 --> 00:54:05,240
because the material starts out dry and

1201
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,839
they get very little

1202
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:10,400
precipitation um they add water

1203
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:13,000
regularly and they use a tractor toi to

1204
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,160
do that right after they do this it will

1205
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
come through with the Turner and mix

1206
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,000
that water into the

1207
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:25,920
window okay so those are turn

1208
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:31,119
systems um the other is areast static P

1209
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:35,079
diagram that um atic piles more reliably

1210
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:37,680
keep um the contents of the pile eroded

1211
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:39,760
because we're forcing air into there it

1212
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,799
also provides a level of temperature

1213
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,400
control using that air um to cool down

1214
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:48,240
the pot so you get more process control

1215
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:50,359
with area St pot another important

1216
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,040
advantage of it is you taking all these

1217
00:54:50,359 --> 00:54:54,839
material that might have been in a

1218
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:57,839
windro and pulling them all together

1219
00:54:54,839 --> 00:55:00,720
into a wider higher pile so we have a

1220
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:04,799
lower area reir that means if you need

1221
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:07,640
to cover it it's more easily done

1222
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:09,000
than and these advantages particularly

1223
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,599
the low area

1224
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,200
requirement um

1225
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:18,200
have driven the conversion of a lot of

1226
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:21,000
windr composting facilities on farms

1227
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,960
included or a static

1228
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,920
piles because it

1229
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:29,280
hasn't but with a static piles you have

1230
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,880
to add some um energy and

1231
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,480
Engineering so it's still pretty simple

1232
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:38,079
you have a a pipe which serves as an air

1233
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:41,480
duct hooked to a blower with some

1234
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:43,480
control mechanisms that Force air into

1235
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,839
the pile these photos are from a

1236
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,119
wastewater treatment plant that

1237
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:49,960
composted biosolids but I could have

1238
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:52,280
told you this from the farm and it would

1239
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:55,160
have looked realistic this just could be

1240
00:55:52,280 --> 00:56:00,960
inside of a barn so it's still simple

1241
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:03,280
enough we on our f um this particular uh

1242
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:06,079
composter has very simple controls it's

1243
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,880
an on and off timer so the timer spends

1244
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:11,960
it some time on to aate the wind dra and

1245
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:17,359
cool it off and some time off to let it

1246
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:19,960
rest and do its thing and uh the timer

1247
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:21,720
settings would be adjusted uh manually

1248
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,920
based upon the temperatures for the

1249
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:27,079
operator

1250
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,799
same there are more compc Control

1251
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:32,520
Systems where uh the blower might come

1252
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,799
on and off based upon temperature

1253
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,920
feedback there's on there's a

1254
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:39,119
temperature sensor in the pile that

1255
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,720
sends a signal to the controls and turns

1256
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,799
the blowers on and off it's still fairly

1257
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,520
simple and then they're very

1258
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,920
sophisticated controls where the the fan

1259
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,559
runs

1260
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:52,359
continuously and the temperature sensor

1261
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:55,839
turns the the air flow rate up and

1262
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:58,240
down and this is that same application

1263
00:56:55,839 --> 00:57:01,599
so the the equipment they use are that

1264
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:04,359
blower and um this loader to build piles

1265
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,920
and take piles apart and then they have

1266
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:09,240
a mixer which mixes in the biosolids and

1267
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:12,119
the wood chip amendment that they use to

1268
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:15,119
create the right Iration conditions the

1269
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:16,680
right free air space and bulk density

1270
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:20,200
for that

1271
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:22,960
prod and this is just an an an augur

1272
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:26,240
based Turner like many uh Turners on

1273
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:29,119
Farm like many mixers excuse me this is

1274
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:33,039
an augur based mixer like many on Farm

1275
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:37,160
mixers that are used to mix feed

1276
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:39,760
RS here's a a different version of an AR

1277
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:42,559
static pile before we saw individual

1278
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:45,200
piles this is called an extended piles

1279
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:47,960
where each batch of material is built on

1280
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:51,200
the side of another to extend the pile

1281
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:54,280
and each batch is called cell and the

1282
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:57,200
cell may have its own a irration pipe

1283
00:57:54,280 --> 00:58:00,280
and you can see here um one blower is

1284
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:03,280
feeding numerous cells through a

1285
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:06,039
manifold um so this is on a farm this is

1286
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:10,079
a farm that used to compost by Windrose

1287
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:12,079
and found the the advantages of an area

1288
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:17,039
stat P will to

1289
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:18,799
converge this Farm uses um a fairly

1290
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:23,319
durable pipe it's highdensity

1291
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:26,720
polyethylene pipe um as the duck work um

1292
00:58:23,319 --> 00:58:28,680
to avoid damaging the pipe

1293
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,920
when breaking down the piles they

1294
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:34,359
actually pull the pipe out using a

1295
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:38,079
tractor and chain this is this is the

1296
00:58:34,359 --> 00:58:41,280
most common way of of running areas that

1297
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:43,039
a piles map is with durable pipe that

1298
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,240
gets pulled out before the piles get

1299
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:47,160
broken down the other option is to have

1300
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:51,200
a loader operator who's really good and

1301
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:53,240
can avoid pipe as much as possible um

1302
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:56,920
but more and more people are doing this

1303
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,920
pipe BL me

1304
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:03,240
okay here's another area static pile uh

1305
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:06,200
again this is Farm they're composting

1306
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:08,079
dewatered Dairy Manor solids and they

1307
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:12,200
decided to build a building to house the

1308
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:13,760
composting system and compost U the

1309
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:16,440
solids in these

1310
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:19,599
bunkers uh the bunkers have a positive

1311
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:22,440
variation system in the floor uh I don't

1312
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:25,880
recall whether the it has pipes on the

1313
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:30,119
playing on the floor or narration system

1314
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:31,960
that built into the floor um but uh

1315
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:34,599
nevertheless it's positive airation

1316
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:37,440
system air blowing up from the floor

1317
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:40,000
these materials here's a picture of the

1318
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,079
Iration systems on the bottom left the

1319
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,799
blowers and the pipe that are feeding

1320
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:51,240
each of these uh bunkers and each bunker

1321
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:54,359
has their own system um that person

1322
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:57,079
shining back in the light um he's not an

1323
00:59:54,359 --> 01:00:00,880
angel although to me he has his name is

1324
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:05,160
Peter Moon he designed this system um

1325
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:10,160
Peter is uh a very good fellow know

1326
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:12,200
he he specializes in irated sta systems

1327
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,520
and he do does a lot of his work on

1328
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:17,760
farms helping Farms to uh make an area

1329
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:20,000
static pile system fit into their

1330
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:23,839
farming operation he's put a lot of

1331
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,720
systems on farms um all over the country

1332
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:29,160
and even outside the country in fact

1333
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:31,880
this is is a Peter Moon uh design system

1334
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:34,400
uh this is a farm that uh compost the

1335
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:36,640
yard trimmings from the community and

1336
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,480
its own Farm waste and it also gets some

1337
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:42,280
waste from a hotel that it's associated

1338
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:45,599
with um it's not a lot it's not a large

1339
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:48,319
scale system um they do this uh under

1340
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:53,200
cover in these bunkers uh in this

1341
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:55,559
building each of these uh bins holds

1342
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,680
batch uh there are bins on both sides of

1343
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:59,319
the building

1344
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:04,039
and so they have one two three they have

1345
01:00:59,319 --> 01:01:06,440
about uh 8 to 10 um of these base which

1346
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:09,880
to work with uh when they're done in the

1347
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:12,839
base U piles sit out and the material

1348
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:16,039
sits in passive piles to cure so a

1349
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:19,280
fairly simple system their arated system

1350
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:21,599
looks like this um so you can see the

1351
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:26,359
plum on the bottom

1352
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:28,520
left um so the the air gets gets

1353
01:01:26,359 --> 01:01:30,200
delivered into this Plum it's covered

1354
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:35,039
with the slatted

1355
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:38,720
boards um air moves up through this the

1356
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:40,880
um spacing between the boards and up

1357
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,920
into the floor the floor is covered with

1358
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,799
a layer of wood chip to keep Vines out

1359
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,079
of the irration system and to help

1360
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:50,880
distribute the air from the irration

1361
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:54,680
plum pop through the materials and on

1362
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:58,319
the right you see up um the shed the

1363
01:01:54,680 --> 01:02:02,319
blower shed uh where the pipes are

1364
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:03,680
directly to the various uh um base and

1365
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:07,640
also the control

1366
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:10,319
system yeah fairly simple

1367
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:12,039
controls uh here's another example of an

1368
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:15,119
aerated static pile this one has a

1369
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:17,200
little different twist uh for one thing

1370
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:21,760
this is a negative variation

1371
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:24,799
system um so this is continuous bed

1372
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:27,400
of dairy cattle manure mostly from heers

1373
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:29,440
and calves so it's fairly highly beded

1374
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,839
it doesn't need need to be mixed with a

1375
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,559
lot of amendment to have the right

1376
01:02:30,839 --> 01:02:37,160
quality composing and they just build

1377
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:40,640
these in strips okay and then start

1378
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:42,160
ating them the air gets pulled down

1379
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,039
through the bed and this is what it

1380
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,799
looks like underneath okay the aration

1381
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:49,720
systems in the floor the floor is

1382
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:51,720
covered with uh with wooden planks that

1383
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:54,480
have poles drilled in it beneath the

1384
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,760
wooden planks in is a trench the

1385
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:00,039
narration pipe that occas occasionally

1386
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:04,279
delivers or sucks air down through the

1387
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:06,760
wooden planks and into U

1388
01:03:04,279 --> 01:03:10,480
manifold what's interesting about this

1389
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:13,319
system is they use it for heat recovery

1390
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,920
so here's the part we've seen at least

1391
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:17,599
uh in the composting building air moves

1392
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,359
down through the compost and then

1393
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,920
there's a manifold that's the blowers on

1394
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:23,480
the other side of the manifold that's

1395
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,559
what's sucking the air through the

1396
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:32,240
compost and then the blower Del the air

1397
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:36,559
to this heat exchange um this is a a

1398
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:40,440
bolt tank on one end and just a a large

1399
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:44,559
conduit maybe a foot long of PVC pipe on

1400
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:47,720
the other uh the hotar goes in the one

1401
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:50,000
end where the conduit is as a gas

1402
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:52,559
there's heat pipes in the middle heat

1403
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,799
pipe has refrigerant in it that the

1404
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,920
refrigerant evaporates on the hot end

1405
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:58,799
and then um

1406
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,400
condenses in the bulk tank where it gets

1407
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:03,000
cooled down and heats the water in the

1408
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:07,520
bulk tank and then that water is

1409
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:10,440
delivered to uh floor for facility

1410
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:13,319
heating um one Farm have you have used

1411
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:15,000
this to heat floors on their calf beds

1412
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:18,720
and you can pull off some hot water out

1413
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:22,200
of this um several Farms are doing this

1414
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:25,359
there's a a company called agrolab

1415
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:27,119
Technologies based in Vermont that is

1416
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:30,079
doing a lot of the Some Farms in New

1417
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:34,960
England um they have since moved away

1418
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:37,920
from this uh heat pipe type of heat

1419
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,000
exchanger and develop others some that

1420
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,400
you that they're starting to mount on

1421
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:47,319
these skits that can be move from Farm

1422
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:50,920
to farm so uh an interesting and

1423
01:04:47,319 --> 01:04:54,920
intriguing twist to compost just another

1424
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:58,440
reason to compost is to recover that

1425
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:00,720
heat not being done a lot but in some

1426
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:02,599
places uh why

1427
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:05,559
not

1428
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:07,960
so the next method of composting would

1429
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:09,680
be within this giant category called

1430
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:12,000
contained or in vessel composting

1431
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:15,200
systems where the composting environment

1432
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:18,279
is closed within a container or vessel

1433
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:21,559
some of these are being done on farms by

1434
01:05:18,279 --> 01:05:24,480
far uh it's mostly window RS and are

1435
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:27,119
static piles but there are places for

1436
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:30,880
these on certain farms under certain

1437
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:33,720
conditions okay almost all of these

1438
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:36,680
are require a second stage of composting

1439
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:38,880
that is the vessel is only first part of

1440
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,760
composting where it's most important to

1441
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,440
have that

1442
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:46,039
inment and almost all are situation

1443
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,960
where company's selling this vessel to

1444
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:52,520
you and they also support it but there's

1445
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:55,000
at least one example and probably more

1446
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:58,000
where it's homemade so this is a farm

1447
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,960
build in closed arated box might it

1448
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,599
might be called a tunnel or box

1449
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:05,000
composting system in other places and in

1450
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:07,240
this case it's handling dairy cattle and

1451
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,559
you can see a picture of the inside on

1452
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:12,319
the right there's positive varation in

1453
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:15,279
the floor uh the air taken out the

1454
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:17,079
headspace is Rec recirculated a bit fed

1455
01:06:15,279 --> 01:06:20,039
in with some fresh

1456
01:06:17,079 --> 01:06:22,039
air what this does give you is a just a

1457
01:06:20,039 --> 01:06:24,839
little bit more control both of odors

1458
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:26,680
and the process I'm not sure on a farm

1459
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:30,079
this is Justus

1460
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:32,279
um but this farmer um felt that he could

1461
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:34,240
pull it off by building it himself and

1462
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:37,079
he also wanted to recover the heat so

1463
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:39,319
there's some heat tubes in the top of

1464
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:40,920
this vessel in the top of this tunnel

1465
01:06:39,319 --> 01:06:43,920
that are just circulating air through

1466
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,559
the composting space circulating water

1467
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:50,000
through the composting space and picking

1468
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:53,480
up some heat and using it to u to feed

1469
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:57,640
this uh radiator that blows warm air

1470
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:58,920
into their shop across the way so just

1471
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:01,319
another

1472
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:04,279
example um this is less than an example

1473
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:07,200
and just a point that these types of

1474
01:07:04,279 --> 01:07:09,319
invest systems are called agitated Bays

1475
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:12,079
they're like windr only they have solid

1476
01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:15,200
walls and there's an automatic Turner

1477
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:17,559
that runs through um without an

1478
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,079
operator that turn the material in these

1479
01:07:17,559 --> 01:07:22,160
bays and also move it along doesn't just

1480
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:24,400
turn the material in place tends to pick

1481
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,880
it up and shift it so there's a material

1482
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,520
handling advantages here here most of

1483
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:32,039
these when they're on

1484
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:35,240
farms are um used for poultry minor

1485
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:36,880
because um poul is a little more

1486
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:40,400
difficult to compost because of the odor

1487
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:44,079
and high nitrogen content um and many

1488
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:48,400
cases it's not mended with with low

1489
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:52,359
nitrogen so some a lot of this is

1490
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:54,279
targeted here's a commercial system um

1491
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:58,119
okay it's called an earth system by the

1492
01:07:54,279 --> 01:08:00,000
Green Mountain Technologies company um

1493
01:07:58,119 --> 01:08:02,640
this is a small

1494
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,480
scale could call an agitated Bay or an

1495
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:10,440
agitated vessel but um it's one of its

1496
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:13,039
Target uses is on hor Stables who have

1497
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:17,400
um hor Bing that they want to turn into

1498
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:17,400
compost and this can be done on

1499
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:24,040
site drums uh drums are another type of

1500
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:27,159
invest system uh key thing about drums

1501
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:30,640
it's a very short compost most drums

1502
01:08:27,159 --> 01:08:32,799
handle material from 3 to six days and

1503
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,679
then it goes out and the advantage of

1504
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:37,960
the drum is it gets the process going

1505
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:40,199
quickly and it contains the material

1506
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:42,560
when it's most odorous okay so here's

1507
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:44,520
four examples all but the one on the

1508
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,480
upper right hand side are on farms the

1509
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:49,839
one on the upper right hand side is at a

1510
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:52,000
college but again it could be a farm uh

1511
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:56,199
and so they put the materials through

1512
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:00,000
quickly and then stack them in windr or

1513
01:08:56,199 --> 01:09:02,159
piles or area static piles to finish the

1514
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,400
composting except the one on the bottom

1515
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:09,080
left really is just recycling manure

1516
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:11,880
beded manure to recover the bedding and

1517
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:14,120
re so these drums are used in a lot of

1518
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:17,040
cases for that but there're another

1519
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:20,159
legitimate invest system for

1520
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:23,560
CLS how am I doing on time now

1521
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:26,279
Lind um we've got like six minutes left

1522
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:29,839
six minutes okay let's talk quickly

1523
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:33,080
about the site um the characteristics of

1524
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:36,400
a site so here's a farm the farmsteads

1525
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:37,480
up top that that hypothetical situation

1526
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:41,239
is looking

1527
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:43,960
to um to compost on site and they're

1528
01:09:41,239 --> 01:09:46,400
kind of identified this piece of land as

1529
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:49,880
a potential compost area so what do we

1530
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:52,480
need to know to see if this is a a a

1531
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:54,320
legitimate site a feasible site or not

1532
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:57,320
well we've got to look at a couple

1533
01:09:54,320 --> 01:10:00,000
things about the site is the land slope

1534
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:02,640
uh which way does water flow uh when it

1535
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,040
falls on the site in this case there's

1536
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:08,560
sort of compound slope down in in each

1537
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:10,080
of these directions right so it' be

1538
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,080
straight down

1539
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:14,960
diagonally um other features of the site

1540
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:18,280
that you need to identify which

1541
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,920
direction is the prevailing wind I

1542
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:23,159
don't I don't put too much importance in

1543
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:25,760
prevailing wind direction in most cases

1544
01:10:23,159 --> 01:10:27,920
because the wind changes so much in

1545
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,800
almost every site it glows from every

1546
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:33,719
direction um often enough that

1547
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:36,120
prevailing wind isn't a good predictor

1548
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:39,640
where odors are going to go most of the

1549
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:42,679
time but still it's good to know there's

1550
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:45,280
a creek near the site that's important

1551
01:10:42,679 --> 01:10:48,199
because we can't be too close to that

1552
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:51,880
residences very important because that

1553
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:53,960
might be uh oder impacts there and we

1554
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,880
want to know the distances from these

1555
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:59,320
things there are regulations that

1556
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:02,199
determine how far at a minimum you need

1557
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:03,120
to be from these things I can tell you

1558
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:05,840
those

1559
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:08,080
minimum separation distances between a

1560
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:11,440
composting site and residence they're

1561
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:13,679
not enough to um prevent odor impacts to

1562
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,960
those resen you need to have good

1563
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:18,120
management as well but these are some of

1564
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:20,360
the things you need to identify where's

1565
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:22,920
the water which way is the lands slope

1566
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,840
where are the residences and other other

1567
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:27,239
people that might be impacted where's

1568
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,239
the wind

1569
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:33,600
so this particular Creek is about 300 ft

1570
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:36,679
from the edge of the composting site

1571
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,880
that's not bad most regulations would

1572
01:11:36,679 --> 01:11:40,840
say that's within

1573
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:44,440
limits it would be

1574
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:46,520
buildable um there's a gravel road

1575
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:48,600
access to a composing site is important

1576
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:50,639
in this case there's a gravel road that

1577
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,719
connects the comple site to The

1578
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:55,280
Farmstead which is where the materials

1579
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:57,679
going to come from Mostly Manor so

1580
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:00,600
that's another important feature of the

1581
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:02,920
site um so when you identify where you

1582
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:06,120
going to do the things on your site

1583
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:10,679
based upon this uh I might mention on

1584
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:13,320
this particular site um I might

1585
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:16,920
discourage this composter from from

1586
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:19,560
choosing this site largely because not

1587
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:22,120
how far the residences are from the site

1588
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:25,760
but because few of them are directly

1589
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:27,719
downhill so on on a cold clear night

1590
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,800
where you get a temperature inversion

1591
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:33,880
and not much wind um you get the

1592
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:35,960
condition where air from a composing

1593
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:39,520
site that might that might be on a hill

1594
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:43,239
or Plateau as this one is would drain

1595
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:45,560
down downhill um and collect in low

1596
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:47,600
areas and cause odor that way this

1597
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:50,400
particular site is susceptible to that

1598
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:54,040
because of where the residents are uh

1599
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:55,800
and the the cold perhaps odorous air

1600
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:58,920
could collect in that

1601
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:00,480
uh in that stream gra so then you can

1602
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:03,360
look a little closer and decide what you

1603
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:05,320
can do and where you can put things uh

1604
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:08,000
and then from these Circle diagrams

1605
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:10,840
which is our way to start you can start

1606
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,239
doing a more detailed design maybe to

1607
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:16,159
scale but those are the features of the

1608
01:13:13,239 --> 01:13:19,040
site again water is going to be

1609
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:21,280
important um increasingly important

1610
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:24,560
because water that runs off the working

1611
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:28,880
areas is fairly heavily polluted um it

1612
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:31,480
has a lot of solids in it that um and so

1613
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:34,239
runoff carries a lot of organic matter

1614
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:36,760
has a high bod level and could um become

1615
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:38,679
odorous over time so what you want to do

1616
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:41,960
is first of all you want to

1617
01:13:38,679 --> 01:13:45,120
keep clean runoff that would tend to run

1618
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:46,719
onto the site from running onto the site

1619
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,840
you want to divert it around the site

1620
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:52,120
and that's what these features circled

1621
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:55,199
in blue are they're dkes or BMS and

1622
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:58,159
channels that are are intercepting the

1623
01:13:55,199 --> 01:14:00,840
run on in this case in diverting it

1624
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:03,080
around the site and then you want to

1625
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:06,600
keep the water that does fall on the

1626
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:09,159
site on the site by collecting it and

1627
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:11,840
then concentrating it or treating it if

1628
01:14:09,159 --> 01:14:14,440
NE necessary and so you would put it in

1629
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:16,880
a pond or an infiltration area never

1630
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:20,760
directly into a stream because it's

1631
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:22,880
fairly strong in organic so you need to

1632
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:25,679
capture it contain it treat it if

1633
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:30,040
necessary reuse it that's the best way

1634
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,880
to do it um but need to control water on

1635
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:33,520
the

1636
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:36,280
site as I said earlier most of the

1637
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:38,840
strength of the water is in its um is in

1638
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:40,800
a sediment that it carries so an easy

1639
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:43,760
way to improve the quality of the runoff

1640
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,920
water is to get sediment out and that's

1641
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,520
fairly easy you can use compul filter

1642
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,400
socks that are shown in uper right hand

1643
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:53,760
corner or filter BMS of compost or wood

1644
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:56,639
chips uh or actually a constructed

1645
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,920
sediment basin to do that but it's

1646
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:01,159
better to keep that if you're storing

1647
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:03,960
water in a pond it's better to to take

1648
01:15:01,159 --> 01:15:08,040
out the the siment before it goes to the

1649
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:11,159
pond so the pond does itself doesn't get

1650
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:14,239
motus uh common question is you need a

1651
01:15:11,159 --> 01:15:16,480
paveed site and I would say really for

1652
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:18,719
for sure only if the regulations require

1653
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:21,800
it that's rarely required Farm

1654
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:23,920
situations but it might be some cases

1655
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:26,600
and if regulations don't require it then

1656
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:29,880
probably you don't need PVE site but

1657
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:32,960
it's an advantage to have one um so even

1658
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:34,960
though it might be costly uh it can be

1659
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:37,320
worthwhile for instance in this picture

1660
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:40,000
this is you know what happens in in the

1661
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:43,199
spring when the snow melts around the

1662
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,320
site at least on a day like today um

1663
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:47,000
this operation could work they have an

1664
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:49,639
an asphalt

1665
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,800
path okay

1666
01:15:49,639 --> 01:15:55,400
odor odor is going to be a problem

1667
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:58,199
there's a lot of things that can do um

1668
01:15:55,400 --> 01:16:00,360
when composting generates odors because

1669
01:15:58,199 --> 01:16:03,080
materials decompose the composting SE

1670
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:05,239
it's it's inherent connection

1671
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:07,159
decomposition odors are going

1672
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:09,000
to but you don't necessarily have an

1673
01:16:07,159 --> 01:16:11,159
odor problem you don't have an odor

1674
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:15,400
problem till the odors are

1675
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:17,840
emitted um and then they travel to

1676
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:20,440
someone who's G to to

1677
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:23,040
OBC so there are several stages in an

1678
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:25,840
odor in the atomy of an odor problem

1679
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:30,360
where composting facility can

1680
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:32,080
intervene um to lessen that odor and

1681
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,920
make it acceptable to the neighborhood

1682
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,199
and

1683
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:39,080
Community um and one of those is

1684
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:43,080
befriending the community and others are

1685
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:46,280
more um operational on the compost

1686
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:48,760
side okay so here are some odor

1687
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:51,280
management uh practices I'll call it the

1688
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:52,440
greatest hits isolated site is the best

1689
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:55,520
thing you can

1690
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:57,199
have keep from overloading the site with

1691
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:58,880
the organic materials because the more

1692
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,480
organic the more materials there are on

1693
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,480
the site that can generate odor the

1694
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:06,960
stronger the going to be contain or

1695
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:09,440
enclose odor sources if necessary but

1696
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:12,120
then there are there are simpler U

1697
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:15,000
measures like prompt handling of feed

1698
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:16,400
stocks follow good composting practices

1699
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,719
maintain

1700
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:22,840
grocy um CDN ratio moisture Contour

1701
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:26,159
where there should be and

1702
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:29,800
air a few more Ely turning watch when

1703
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:33,000
you turn not just how often but turn

1704
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:35,560
only when needed because when turning is

1705
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,120
done it's a quick intense release of

1706
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:41,840
odors uh one of my favorite oor control

1707
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:45,360
measures uh certainly uh well Su to F is

1708
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:49,239
you use a bio cover okay the bio cover

1709
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:52,679
is nothing other than a layer on top of

1710
01:17:49,239 --> 01:17:55,360
a pile or window that's generating odors

1711
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:58,679
it's a layer of material

1712
01:17:55,360 --> 01:18:01,080
uh mostly compost or pre compost before

1713
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:03,120
it's screen that still has some Woody

1714
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:05,560
material in it and you just put it on

1715
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:07,679
top and it's simple containment and what

1716
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:11,520
happens is the air moving up through the

1717
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:14,600
top of the pile is it is absorbed and

1718
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:16,440
water is condensed in this layer and

1719
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:19,440
much of the odor is contained not all of

1720
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:22,679
it and broken down in this layer so a

1721
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:25,520
very simple uh underused method of Odor

1722
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:27,080
Control

1723
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:32,480
so I know I went through all that kind

1724
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:34,239
of fast um six minutes is probably up if

1725
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:36,679
you want more

1726
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:39,320
information uh The Institute for local

1727
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:42,199
self reliance is having

1728
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:44,679
uh it's webinar and I believe they also

1729
01:18:42,199 --> 01:18:49,239
have an online course that you can take

1730
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:51,239
to learn more about it I teach um with

1731
01:18:49,239 --> 01:18:53,639
uh my partner Matt cotton of foundations

1732
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:56,080
of Composting class it's a one-day class

1733
01:18:53,639 --> 01:18:58,800
we teach this at the beginning of the US

1734
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:01,280
composting Council conference every year

1735
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,639
uh this year it's in Austin um and I'm

1736
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:08,040
sure we'll be teaching on January fourth

1737
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:12,000
that mass man there is Matt um teaching

1738
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:15,880
if you want even more training um there

1739
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:19,679
were a number of multi-day Hands-On

1740
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:21,440
training programs around uh Maine has

1741
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:23,280
had one for a long time I don't know

1742
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:25,840
when they're starting theirs up again

1743
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:27,400
but the US compost or excuse me the

1744
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,280
compost research and Education

1745
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:34,360
Foundation runs a five-day

1746
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:37,679
course um around different parts of the

1747
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:39,199
country um and it's been fairly popular

1748
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:42,639
here's an idea of the

1749
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:45,159
curriculum um for you to get some

1750
01:19:42,639 --> 01:19:46,560
Hands-On training if you'd like uh the

1751
01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:49,520
composting facility tours are

1752
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:51,560
particularly good that's why I

1753
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:54,920
highlighted okay I think I made it

1754
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:57,800
within time so thank you very much I

1755
01:19:54,920 --> 01:20:00,080
apologize for rushing through this um

1756
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:02,440
but that's the time we have and

1757
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:05,320
hopefully I can answer unanswered

1758
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:05,320
questions for you

1759
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:11,679
now yes exactly that is what we are

1760
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:14,520
going to do so thank you Dr rink for a

1761
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:15,920
great presentation um we have been

1762
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:21,080
collecting some questions as they've

1763
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:23,639
been coming in um so starting with a um

1764
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:26,639
clarification on the hot stage of

1765
01:20:23,639 --> 01:20:29,560
composting the graph that you showed uh

1766
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:32,400
indicated it might take 1 to n months

1767
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:34,120
for the active composting phase um but

1768
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:36,480
the person usually hears two to three

1769
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:38,960
weeks during that phase before before it

1770
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,760
moves into finishing or curing any

1771
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:45,040
comments on

1772
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:46,440
that if if you have an A A A close to

1773
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:50,080
ideal

1774
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:54,000
process um you can do that in two to

1775
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:56,520
three weeks um you can you can make

1776
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:01,760
compost that is ready to move into the

1777
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:05,000
curing phase with an ideal process and

1778
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:08,159
suitable feed stocks but in my

1779
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,719
experience uh in order to get Most Feed

1780
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:11,840
stocks to the point where it can go to a

1781
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:14,520
curing pile and should be piled without

1782
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:17,159
turning takes a lot longer than three

1783
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:20,040
excuse me three weeks more like two

1784
01:21:17,159 --> 01:21:22,880
months at a minimum again it depends

1785
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:24,639
upon the feed stocks slowly composting

1786
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,840
feed stocks feed stocks that may have

1787
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:30,639
gone through some decom some uh

1788
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:34,239
stabilization already it could work for

1789
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:35,400
example um the standard method for

1790
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:38,000
composting

1791
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:40,719
biosolids um which was developed by the

1792
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,520
USDA at the Belville research station

1793
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:43,480
sometimes it's called the Bel aat static

1794
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:47,480
pile

1795
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:49,719
method typically recommended composting

1796
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:52,840
under ation for three weeks and then go

1797
01:21:49,719 --> 01:21:54,600
to curing for a month bio first of all

1798
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:56,520
biosolids has already been through

1799
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:59,440
aerobic digestion process so it's

1800
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:00,400
partially stab but even then I don't

1801
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:03,920
think

1802
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:06,679
biosolids can be stabilized in three

1803
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,679
weeks I think it needs longer that's my

1804
01:22:06,679 --> 01:22:11,840
personal feeling I think if you're going

1805
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:14,560
for three weeks you're rushing it but if

1806
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,400
you're doing that you need an ideal

1807
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,920
process certainly for a

1808
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:21,280
station

1809
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:24,600
uh uh a fairly large amount of bulking

1810
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:25,840
agent that allows the Iration to be uh

1811
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,679
evenly

1812
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:31,639
distributed

1813
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:33,960
um and um the right seat end ratio and

1814
01:22:31,639 --> 01:22:35,840
so on I think three weeks

1815
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:38,560
push that's great and that actually

1816
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:41,920
leads into another question how do you

1817
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,920
recommend getting good free

1818
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:48,679
airspace um the best way to get free air

1819
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:52,440
space is to mix the materials to a bulk

1820
01:22:48,679 --> 01:22:55,600
density uh of less than a th000 pounds

1821
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:58,560
per cubic yard by

1822
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,280
adding dry bulking materials wood chips

1823
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,800
would

1824
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:05,080
be um the best is usually the best

1825
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:08,400
choice because they're chunky they have

1826
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:10,639
good structure they stand up in a pile

1827
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:12,800
um they don't compress they don't glose

1828
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:15,600
or structure as they

1829
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:18,480
decompose um in fact they go through the

1830
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:20,960
composting process almost unchanged and

1831
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:22,960
if you're not using them for mulch um

1832
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:25,400
you would end up screening them out wi

1833
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:27,960
chips are the best amendment of pick to

1834
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:30,600
mix with other materials to get that

1835
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:33,480
three a space don't have wood chips you

1836
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:35,920
can do it with other bulky materials

1837
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:40,239
like corn cops would be great peanut

1838
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:42,719
hols would be great um chop straw um

1839
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:44,600
even sawdust but if if you use sawdust

1840
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:46,960
you're going have to use a lot of it and

1841
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:49,719
probably dry the material out too much

1842
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:52,440
more and then add water back um the

1843
01:23:49,719 --> 01:23:55,440
chunk of your material about which of

1844
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:55,440
stand

1845
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:03,600
uh there's a question about whether you

1846
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:08,000
can make good compost using a large

1847
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:10,920
static pile that doesn't get turned much

1848
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:15,159
um and is also not actively

1849
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:18,080
arated yes you can make good compost in

1850
01:24:15,159 --> 01:24:21,440
a large static pile um some people make

1851
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:23,800
good compost in very large static piles

1852
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:25,000
um I use the term massive passive for

1853
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:27,679
those

1854
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,520
um so what you have to do in that case

1855
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:31,880
is

1856
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:33,840
weight um the key to making compost when

1857
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:39,520
the conditions aren't good so like in a

1858
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:43,920
large pile that isn't AED much um is a

1859
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:47,400
weit for time to do its work so I I

1860
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:50,159
showed that picture where uh passively

1861
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:53,159
irrated piles heat up inside and that's

1862
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:55,440
the main way to aate well in large piles

1863
01:24:53,159 --> 01:24:57,600
if there's not a great deal of air flow

1864
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:59,760
through that thermal effect then you're

1865
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:02,199
relying on diffusion and it's going to

1866
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:06,360
take diffusion a while for that oxygen

1867
01:25:02,199 --> 01:25:08,960
to creep into the the pile and uh and

1868
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:11,040
the organisms to uh decompose the

1869
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:12,760
material so yeah you can use a large

1870
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:15,280
pile

1871
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:18,159
um and you just have to take longer to

1872
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:20,800
do it that in itself is not a problem

1873
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:25,440
the problem with large piles and waiting

1874
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:27,199
for them is that it um greatly increases

1875
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:30,320
the risk of spontaneous combustion

1876
01:25:27,199 --> 01:25:34,520
occurring in the pile for that reason I

1877
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:36,600
don't recommend it um but I can pretty

1878
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:39,800
much say that if you have a large pile

1879
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:43,400
of actively decomposing material and you

1880
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:45,800
leave it in place without moving it in

1881
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:49,600
within a month or two um you're going to

1882
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:51,080
get fire and that could be serious so

1883
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:54,760
although yes you can make compost in

1884
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:57,840
large piles without Force variation um

1885
01:25:54,760 --> 01:26:02,040
you're increasing the risk of

1886
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:05,520
fire great okay and then uh question

1887
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:07,639
about the Biol layer and whether six in

1888
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:10,480
say something like six inches of wet

1889
01:26:07,639 --> 01:26:13,040
straw would work as a Biol layer or any

1890
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:16,119
other recommendations for easily

1891
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:18,719
removable materials to use as a biolayer

1892
01:26:16,119 --> 01:26:20,679
well once you're making compost you'll

1893
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:23,480
have compost at your disposal to use as

1894
01:26:20,679 --> 01:26:25,040
a biolayer and that's the best one um

1895
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,800
it's better if the compost has some

1896
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:30,920
paracity to it that will

1897
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:34,440
allow the the passive air movement that

1898
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:35,520
is already curring to to to continue on

1899
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:38,600
through the

1900
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:41,440
biolayer um but just finished compost

1901
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:45,080
will work and a 6 inch six four to six

1902
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:47,639
inch layer will do of that um if you if

1903
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:48,719
you have a screen and Screen overs will

1904
01:26:47,639 --> 01:26:51,639
work pretty

1905
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:55,320
well um my next suggestion would be a

1906
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:58,199
mixture of compost and wood chips um

1907
01:26:55,320 --> 01:27:00,119
next after that would be just wood chips

1908
01:26:58,199 --> 01:27:03,440
uh straw would work the problem with

1909
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:06,119
straw is is it t it becomes matted down

1910
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:07,360
when it gets wet and it can become a

1911
01:27:06,119 --> 01:27:11,199
barrier

1912
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:13,840
irration um so that would be the problem

1913
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:16,080
with straw but I think as a containment

1914
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:21,679
me mechanism it would it would contain

1915
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:24,000
odors it would just um make the Iration

1916
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:26,440
condition within the pile chop straw

1917
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,880
with be better than

1918
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:31,040
UNS awesome thank you for all those

1919
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:33,080
options uh and the last question that

1920
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:35,520
I'm going to ask before we do some final

1921
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:38,040
polling and close things up uh I think

1922
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:39,040
is an important one it's about uh curing

1923
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:41,480
is always

1924
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:43,080
discussed um as an important phase of

1925
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:45,400
composting but what's the actual

1926
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:48,679
downside if any of spreading a pile of

1927
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:50,400
on the field that is not completely

1928
01:27:48,679 --> 01:27:53,159
cured

1929
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:58,000
um the downside of spreading material

1930
01:27:53,159 --> 01:28:03,520
that is not completely C is that

1931
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:06,840
um it has it still has um some compounds

1932
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:09,320
the compost still has some compounds um

1933
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:11,639
that are phytotoxic that that would hurt

1934
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:15,320
hurt the plants but if you're merely

1935
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:18,280
spreading compost on top of a of a um a

1936
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:22,320
field let's say during the fall or

1937
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:26,440
winter or um onto a fow field uh it

1938
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:28,320
shouldn't be a problem so so um that's

1939
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:31,320
where I said the intended use of the C

1940
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:34,760
post is important in fact if you're

1941
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:36,760
spreading compost on the field um Navy

1942
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:38,560
stability is not that important all and

1943
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:41,400
you can cut it short you don't even have

1944
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,400
to cure it uh depends entirely on its

1945
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:46,199
use if you're putting compost into a

1946
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:49,400
potting media it has to be very stable

1947
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:52,719
if you're incorporating compost into a

1948
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:56,119
garden it has to be fairly stable but

1949
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:58,719
spreading it on a field especially when

1950
01:28:56,119 --> 01:29:02,280
um the field is not growing anything at

1951
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:05,119
the moment fine go ahead and do it

1952
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:08,960
saving yourself time and

1953
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:10,920
money awesome so I'm gonna call it there

1954
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:13,360
with the questions but thank you all for

1955
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,639
submitting them and um I hope that some

1956
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:18,440
of the other ones that you all submitted

1957
01:29:15,639 --> 01:29:22,199
will be answered in F future sessions uh

1958
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:25,520
but before we go uh just a few more

1959
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:25,520
quick polls

1960
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:32,000
first one being as an

1961
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:34,560
overview of the fundamentals of on Farm

1962
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,320
composting this webinar had too much

1963
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:39,960
information the right amount of

1964
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:39,960
information or not enough

1965
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:47,280
information giveing you all just a few

1966
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,280
more

1967
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:56,000
seconds all righty it's always good to

1968
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:58,080
see this that a vast majority say the

1969
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:02,280
right amount of information so thank you

1970
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:05,440
Dr rink for doing that um next

1971
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:07,920
question uh are there any questions that

1972
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:09,760
this presentation that were not answered

1973
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:13,400
by this presentation any questions you

1974
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:13,400
had about on Farm composting

1975
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,760
fundamentals I realized that it often

1976
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,560
take some time to digest this

1977
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:25,159
information before you realize what

1978
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:27,040
questions you still have so hopefully um

1979
01:30:25,159 --> 01:30:29,119
yall will get some answered in future

1980
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:33,199
sessions as

1981
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:33,199
well okay couple more

1982
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:44,920
seconds so we're pretty e pretty split

1983
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:46,840
um but majority says no great uh we are

1984
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:49,239
considering doing like a live Q&A at

1985
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:52,560
some point um if that's of Interest let

1986
01:30:49,239 --> 01:30:54,679
us know and invited back some of the

1987
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:57,040
presenters from the series so let us

1988
01:30:54,679 --> 01:31:00,639
know if that's of Interest final

1989
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:03,960
question um do you plan to participate

1990
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:07,560
in any of the other webinars in this

1991
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:07,560
series yes no

1992
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:16,920
maybe just a couple more

1993
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:22,520
seconds all right vast majority says yes

1994
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:24,719
say yes that's fa fabulous for us to

1995
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:27,280
know and we're so glad uh the series is

1996
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:29,119
designed to sort of build over time um

1997
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,480
and hopefully we'll get to answer all of

1998
01:31:29,119 --> 01:31:32,080
those questions the burning questions

1999
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:35,400
you have about on Farm composting and

2000
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:37,679
compost use so thank you so much Dr rink

2001
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:39,639
uh for your great presentation and thank

2002
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:42,199
you all for participating and we'll look

2003
01:31:39,639 --> 01:31:46,920
forward to seeing you at the next

2004
01:31:42,199 --> 01:31:46,920
webinar okay thank you all
