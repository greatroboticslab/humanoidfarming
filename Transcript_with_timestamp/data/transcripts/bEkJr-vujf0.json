  "text": "hi this is Stacy from the adviser I'm very excited today because we have sander veny here today and he is an amazing individual he has a really amazing story to tell and he right now um he he was going to go and become a veterinarian back in the day and he found his true purpose in life and he's going to share that purpose with you and how he took his purpose and made it into a reality and so sander tell everybody a little about yourself and what you do thank you Stacy yes so when I when I was younger I've always had a deep love for animals so it wasn't a surprise to me or my parents like that I wanted to do something with animals growing up that was always a North star for me so then I wasn't sure if it was farming veterinary medicine and and as soon as there was any sort of doubts my parents like you got to go explore veterinary medicine make sure that like that you go down that road first because it farming is tough so you can't have any doubts in your mind when when things start getting tough in farming and uh when you have bad days stuff like that you can't live a life with regret and what ifs and stuff like that so I went to the veterinary medicine route I went to University of wealth and I did everything that I need to do to get my application ready and instead of sending it in I changed my mind I came home to the dairy farm instead so then that was 2010 when I graduated and basically we farmed together my parents for four or five years and then 2015 we moved our our cows into a new Dairy facility which was very exciting because I found it endlessly frustrating in our old dairy facility because that Barn was built in in 1987 and they didn't really know much about how a barn should be built for a cow to thrive and they didn't they didn't Thrive so it was endlessly frustrating for me being as passionate about animals as I am so when they we moved the over to the new barn the cows thrived they did better they they produced more milk they they lived longer they had better body condition they seemed happier like it was it was amazing but right around that same time as the cow's Health improved ironically my own health um took a hit and my hormones crashed and I had to look around like what am I doing wrong what am I missing why all of a sudden now is at the age of 25 has my testosterone crashed to nothing basically to like 9-year-old man levels and then I started looking around and I was questioning everything I was questioning the Health Care system because I was bouncing around from Doctor to doctor and no way was able to figure out what was that actually wrong I had doctors telling me that I need to just accept my condition and move on stop trying to look for things that I can change or improve or things like that it's just I just need to accept it and and move on with my life and naturally I wasn't willing to do that but then it took me about six years though to finally figure out enough things where I was able to improve my own health to the point where my hormones returned and um and then but that same time I was questioning my life I was also questioning the way we farmed and as I was looking for ways that I could improve the lives of our farm animals and do things better and going down that rabbit hole is what led me to regener culture is uh it's a lot a lot of the goals are aligned when it comes to trying to improve animal welfare and the the goals of regenerative agriculture and and getting the cows back outside in the environment where they can have a positive impact on the environment and so where we are now is like I I have my commercial dairy farm which I still have lots of plans lots of dreams of transitioning that to regenerative agriculture as well but in the meantime I'm trying to build that customer base and I have the pasture turkeys that I have on our pasture that fall behind our Grass Pad beef is kind of mimics the the ways that the the massive herds of Bison used to roam North America and then there'd be Birds fallowing behind there and they complement each other really well which is a common theme in regener of Agriculture where you're kind of treating your farm like an ecosystem and it's a lot of give and take and and and uh a lot of complimentary traits between the different animals and and the goals of uh of producing food on your farm you know I I don't think people realize how common um you know problems with hormones um how many people go through it how many people go through low testosterone or low progesterone or they have low estrogen or their estrogen is too high and people are really imbalanced in our society and it does it could start at any age when people think about um low testosterone they immediately associated with later in life but it's not really true like I started having problems with my test testosterone at age 39 and I didn't even know what was going on I just started getting symptoms out of the blue and you know I went to the doctor and my doctor was the same as yours you know just you know didn't have an answer yeah just take birth control you'll be fine and I'm like I'm not taking birth control you know and then later on I I went to other doctors that were more natural and you know and they you know did test and they figured out what was going on but a lot of it you know in our society people don't realize what a lot of it has to do too with the foods we eat you know in America cuz you know especially you know a lot of foods are injected with hormones and you know nowadays you see children at the age of eight starting to develop breasts and starting to go through menstruation at an early age because they're injecting you know they're injecting the chickens with hormones and they're injecting certain animals with hormones and and they're injecting you know cows with hormones and those hormones are going into your body and they're changing in the whole chemistry of your body and you know and like we discussed before you know everybody's body is different we all come from different DNA so you know for some people going through you know low testosterone at a at a young age is can be normal and it does it can happen at any age you know and that's what people have to be aware of and you know problems like you know low liido or erectile dysfunction is so common in our society worldwide it's just not talked about but you know as we were discussing before you were talking about regenerative egg and you were talking about how the different foods and how you know eating certain foods and and how to take care of the animals and and take care of your bodies can play such a huge role can you explain a little bit more about agre AG um regenerative a you know and explain to people what it is and how it could have such an impact on your health very simply regenerative agiculture is just farming in a way that maximizes soil health and that's in contrast to just trying to maximize profits or maximize efficiency but if you take that like a a layer deeper a little more complex what you're really trying to do is you're trying to create a thriving ecosystem of microorganisms in the soil and it's a you have when it done properly you have a a very complex food chain of these microorganisms you have your bacteria you have your fungus you have protozoa Nemos arthropods and it's a real it's a crazy amount of biomass underneath the soil that we don't even realize is there but when you have that and it's done correctly what you what the plant then can do is that it can excrete a sugar into the soil and trade those sugars for nutrients so then you don't need the synthetic fertilizers because the plant can ask for nutrients from the microorganism in the soil and they'll go out and they'll mine these nutrients from the rocks and from the silt and sand and then they'll they'll trade those and then they'll be able to for the sugars that so that the microorganisms can Thrive that that's their food source and it's um and like what's really important in this whole system like a keystone species is the micro risal fungi which is basically a long filament that actually embeds into the root of the plant and reaches out into the soil and transports these nutrients and these sugars and um what actually happens is is when we're when we use these synthetic fertilizers or we use things like large equipment to drive over our land these fungus are the first to die off they're very sensitive so we have to be careful with how we treat our land but then what we can do is is we we we follow these five principles of soil Health which are very important because you can if you follow these five principles then you you you don't have this negative impact on the soil and you don't you don't kill all this diversity in your soil because if you don't have that diversity you end up being addicted to synthetic fertilizers there's really no other way to grow crops because without this this uh relationship between the microorganisms and the plant the plant can't get the nutrients without fertilizer and it's not just the fertilizer and the nutrients that the plant is missing it's missing the defense chemicals from all the all the the the insects and stuff like that so then if it doesn't have these defense chemicals from these healthy insects will then becomes vulnerable for pests and then you end up spraying with pesticides and it's the same story with weeds if you don't have the diversity not only of the microorganism but also just the the plants that are are living in the soil you it's the one of the main downsides of these monocrops is that you're missing that diversity it's missing in the soil and the nature doesn't like that monocrop so then that's when the weeds come in you start spraying for weeds and then and it's it's a a vicious cycle really and yeah it's a hard thing to break free from and when you're following five these five principles which is like you need the biodiversity you need to minimize the impact that you have on your soil you have to have armor on the soil in the form of plants or pasture or whatever else and you need to have living roots in the soil all year around and the last thing is you need animal impact and if you have those five things you can have that diversity where you you can break free from that addiction and then you can have that beautiful relationship between these microorganisms and the plants and it's not just oh now I don't need synthetic fertilizer it's it's it's a much you end up with a much more nutrient dense food because you can never fertilize for absolutely everything that the every micronutrient that the plant wants and needs that it can find in the soil you can never fertilize from all those tiny micronutrients so like you end up with much like with food that has less nutrients in it for that reason so it's it's it's a it's a beautiful system and the end result as as a nutrient healthy nutrient-dense food you know it's it's pretty amazing because it it seems like when you do regenerative you know agriculture it seems like you're for one you're balanc in your gut because you're you're you know you have the good bacteria the bad bacteria you have the healthy soil and you're you're you know that helps your digestive system work which entail helps everything it helps you know because gut health is really related to everything including your brain and you know the fogginess the way we think our Clarity you know overall health and that's one of the components that it seems like it really helps and you know CU When you think about it you know if when if you if once you start adding those pesticides and those weeds and all those toxins into your body your body doesn't know what to do with them so it stores them and it stores it in our body and what happens is is that our body you know our our our organs become sluggish it affects the way you know we feel it you know it could cause illness you know after after so long and people are going to the doctors they don't understand why they don't feel good and it all has to do with the root cause of how the food is made how it's grown how it's taken care of and people are getting sick all over you know the United States and and I don't know what the regulations are in other countries but for the United States there's so many illnesses and and illnesses the percentages have grown and grown and grown and so many people you know have realized that a lot of it has to do with gut health leaky gut syndrome not having enough of you know good bacteria versus bad bacteria and it all has to do with a lot of the way we take care of ourselves we take care of the food that we're growing and it's it's really you know it's really hurting our society it's you know we talked about you know our hormones and we talked about you know gut health and and and illnesses and it's really it all draws back to really we need to have concern of how we are growing our food and really how you know what we're doing because it's affecting our society as a whole and it's really it's it's destroying the healths of people you know Nationwide and and and any other countries that are doing similar things absolutely and and like there you're right there there's a um a huge issue with autoimmunity in our day and age today and a lot of it comes back to the food we eat but also like a lifestyle of Sanitation where we're obsessed with um putting alcohol in our hands and cleaning everything making everything perfectly clean disinfected and and um and it starts with the food and like the soil because like the soil we Farm it in a way typically with commercial agriculture where it's it's almost a sanitary soil there's bacteria but there's such there so so devoid of life it's almost like a sanitized growing environment and then it's this those this lack of diversity comes up through the food chain so the plants don't have a healthy microbiome on it as well so then it's like because there's not the microbiome there's a void there so then there's as soon as you have something growing some coli or some some sort of unhealthy bacteria it'll explode in population because there's not the competition of the healthy BAC the healthy microorgan orms on that food so then it becomes even more important that we sanitize our food so like yeah it's and and like like people talk about too like how it's important like you eat your food dirty food and stuff like that with some dirt on it so you have those those microorganisms but like it's not that simple because you got to make sure it's the right dirt it's the dirt with the healthy diversity the healthy ecosystem of microorganisms in it and then and then we can like fix the whole the not only the food system with the with the microbiome and but also just like our our our culture of Sanitation because like it's it's incredibly important because if you look at our body we are more bacteria than we are human we vessels for carrying this this diverse population of of bacteria in our Po in in our in our body so we have to be careful too with like a lot of these pesticides and and and herbicides or sprays that we put on our food or or sanitize our hands with or whatever else is like it might not affect our human cells but like it could very well be affecting our microbiome and and issues yeah you know and and they they've come out with you know information about you know everyone with you know hand sanitized especially during covid and everybody's using it but you know too much hand San hand sanitizer is not good for you you know it's really we the germs are good for you you know people don't realize it but we need germs we need to grow you know our antibodies we need we need you know just like when they say take a probiotic you should be taking a Prebiotic too because good bacteria versus bad bacteria you need both you need both in your body and you know people don't realize that and then you know in America we have you know chickens are getting shot up with nitrate and they getting shot up with all these different you know chemicals and things and and you know we as a society really need to try to go more the pure route like you were talking about regenerative egg and and be able to have a cleaner you know way of living because if we don't we're we're going to our our country healthwise is going to be destroyed it's already you see stats of of how much you know PE illnesses have gone up in so many different categories and the question is why you know and you know our society is not looking at what they're putting in their bodies and we were talking about before the show you really need to treat your body as a temple and maybe you can expand on that explain to people why it is so important that we just don't throw things in our mouths and we just don't take anything that we see over the counter you know but we we treat our body as a temple yeah it's something that uh I believe in very strongly is because like you you gota look after your meat bag is how I like to think about it because like it's it it it makes you more effective at everything you do in life makes makes me a better dad a better husband it makes me a better farmer gives me more energy more clarity and thought allows me to dream of of directions I want to take my life like like with with more Elites and make an impact on agriculture and improve animal welfare and and and and also like move bring the the movement of regenerate agriculture forward like it all that health is is absolutely critical to uh just to be ourselves but like 100% ourselves not just walking through life and and and waking up and and hitting the snooze button and going through life as as a zombie and just hit being on repeat like it's it's absolutely critical yeah and like and the food that we eat is a big part of that it's um it's we almost gota like it's it's we gota go back to eating a a simpler diet kind of it's like it's not all these complex ingredients and packages stuff like that it's like it's just your one ingredient and and uh and and that's real food and then the Step Beyond that is like the food that you eat that's simple it's just one ingredient is just your Whole Foods it's nothing packaged A Step Beyond that then is like okay now that I've made that massive leap away from processed foods the next step is okay now the food that I'm eating is that top quality food is that also food that's raised in a way that makes it it's it's nutrient dense it's healthy and it has it's not only healthy but it's it's improves welfare or and improves the environment like it it's it's a it's treated in a way that is that is is is healthy for the whole ecosystem as us as a whole and our planet as a whole oh 100% I I agree with you totally and and and it you know it's a lifestyle change it's not just something you're going to do temporarily and then you know okay you know like just like people go on these fad diets yeah after a while they get sick of doing it and they go back to their old way of living it's something that you have to incorporate into your life and and and stay consistent you know I don't think of you know I don't look at it as as a things as a diet I don't look at things as you know this is the way it has to be I I call it a lifestyle change do you want to be healthy do you want to feel good do you want to prevent illness from occurring do you want to sustain your illness that you have right now do you want to keep it at a level where you could be productive and happy you know do you want to be a ble to live life the way you you've always dreamt of being do you want to have goals in the future and be able to reach those goals well people don't realize it but it all stems back on how we take care of ourselves and what we put in our bodies and it's so important that people realize that every little thing whether it's a supplement a vitamin you know the food that we eat you know whether it being natural or processed you have to really think about what am I putting in my body and how is that going to affect me and you know and and make it so natural that you do it so consistently that you don't even have to think about it anymore it's just you you're just doing it you're just doing it you know and I think people have to really seriously think about that how is it affecting their life people have stomach issues and they and they're not digesting food well and they're going to a gastrologist and I'm having all these problems oh what are you eating well I had a pizza yesterday and then I you know in the morning I had a bowl of cereal and had like you know you know this enormous amount of sugar in it you know and and you know people don't get it but we really have to focus where we're getting our foods and what we're putting in our mouths and and think about the more natural way of living and how that could benefit us in the long run I think what are your feelings about that I yeah I completely agree and we have to be careful that we're not trapped by normal like all the normal ranges for your blood all the normal diet that can't be what's causing you that's that's a normal diet for you to be eating but you know what it's also normal to die at the age of 60 75 80 from a cardiovascular disease cancer and all these chronic diseases that um are arguably preventable with a healthy lifestyle and exercise and a healthy diet and like you gota almost beware of normal because if you really look at what normal is that's not a happy road to walk down I don't want to start losing vitality by the age of 65 because that's retirement age and it's normal to have a sore body and an achy body and a and and be incapable of doing the things that I want to do with my life now and it's it's normal to now take a step back and no longer have Big Dreams because that that's what normally happens like beware of normal and and it starts with every single day with your daily choices like are you eating the with the normal diet that's leading people down this road this that this unhappy Road really are you making the normal choices that's going to lead you down that road as well or should you now do an overhaul of your pantry and have instead of your your packaged food for snacks you have some piece of fruit or something like that like has some healthy habits and it all comes back to habits yes and like it it becomes easy Once you these you form these healthy habits these the these things that become normal for your your new life where you're cooking your own food you're buying food from the perimeter of the grocery store and like you're having simple snacks that are just one ingredient there's nothing in a package and you don't stop and and buy that take out because it's convenient it's like it's now normal that oh I can just fast like you can fast and not eat for a couple days and and you'll be fine it's crazy and and and like you don't have to stop as soon as you have a hunger pay you can you can drive and you can wait till you come home you can have a piece of of fruit and then you can cook something up that's healthy right these are all habits that you can form and then like you said it's not a diet it's a lifestyle it's it's a way of life where you it's in in where you do this long term for the rest of your life and then so you can go down a road that's abnormal that's abnormally amazing abnormally healthy with lots of Vitality yes and it's so true and you know it's it's all it's all mental how you know what we put in our head and how we react to things is how we feel if you start taking care of your body and you're and you start feeling good you're in your head you're going to feel young you know and that in itself because we're all Connected Mind Body and Soul it's all connected so if you're taking care of your body you're feeling good you're feeling young you know and it's in your head I feel great I feel like a 30-year old you could be 65 but you feel like you're 30 you're going to act like you're 30 you know dream then too you're going to keep making Dreams yeah if your body feels good your mind feels clear then you can keep having those Big Dreams even when you're 65 when you're normal to be retiring like you could have Big Dreams still you can you could strive for an amazing life exactly life does not end because the the quote unquote you know in our normal society you retire at 65 well that means you know life is over you have to sit on a couch and you know watch soap propers all day no you know it's all how you perceive it you know it's how you take care of yourself it's what you put in your mind it's you know you could change the way you think the way you live the way you everything you know all by you know creating that healthy lifestyle now you know I want to just tap into you know talking about the harmone issues because I feel like it's such a huge issue you know especially in the United States and all over because I've spoken with people that are just not from the United States all over the world that have had these issues have contacted me you know having you know low testosterone having low progesterone having low libido and and going through erectile dysfunction and they just don't know what to do and you know you see on the counters like a lot of times you'll go into food stores or you'll go into you knowes and you'll see tons and tons of bottles you know all you know boost your testosterone do this you know great muscles and blah blah blah blah and you know and all this stuff and all these promises you know but it you know there are there are you know a lot of these things are not good for you and when you when you know our whole body is run by hormones so you have to be very careful just like we talked about treating your body like a temple when you play around with hormones you have to be really really careful you know I I want to a functional medicine doctor you went to a natural path you know we we were monitored by a profess professional I know that I had to take consistent blood tests and you know they had to make sure everything was leveled properly and because you know what if you have too much of something it could throw your whole body off in many ways and you know I don't know how you feel but when you went to the Natural path that was the finally you know everybody else told you don't worry about it just live with it you know suck it up you know but what was the turning point when you went to that that natural path that helped you you know get your life back in that area of your life the real thing that the naturopath gave me was optimism because everywhere else I spoke with it was it was just hormone therapy hormone replacement therapy and and there was never any T of Lifestyle it was just these are the drugs that you should take and you should accept that and move on and and the the unique thing about the naturop path is like they they said I asked them like this is what what I'm dealing with this is what the doctors tell me do you think I could fix this and they were the the only people that said yeah you could you could totally I I they saw a road to recovery and like it gave me a glimmer of hope when I wasn't really getting much of that from anywhere else so and they help me with like with like a little more concrete things too like I had digestive issues and along with dig digestive issues is is I had a B12 deficiency because you I couldn't absorb those B vitamins from my food yeah so took some B12 for a short period of time and that helped a little bit um and then they also like pointed out to me like hey these are probably the foods that you're are reacting to you can try avoid these certain foods that are causing you to to flare up your immune system and have this inflammation throughout your body and I tried that too and and it definitely helped and then uh I it just got me down walking down that path and I started reassessing everything as far as health like my sleep habits like I was definitely um I grew up in a household of of of three brothers and um and and no sisters and and and a hardworking dad so it's like it was a real the environment of just like go get it and work hard and and um to H the consequences kind of thing like you're now go fight for the for the future that you want to have like I was all for it like that that mindset came naturally to me as the way I grew up you that grit and that hard work and push through and tired doesn't matter I can I can handle it kind of thing and um and that's just it it came so naturally to me and I think that's part of the reason why I struggled I didn't have this opposing Force this whole other part of my personality wasn't being wasn't being developed to the same degree as the hard part of my of my personality the softer side of myself I I was not developing to the same same degree and and that's a real inflection point in my life when I when I got sick is like what am I missing and then that's when I started looking at these Sofer sides of my personality and surprisingly enough exercise for me was part of that because it felt like a form of self-expression yeah exercise before because I had a physical job any sort of exercise was a waste of energy that could be energy that could put to getting work done physical work like taking the time to to really focus on myself and like and like improve my my my movement pattern so that I wouldn't have all these achy joints my body hurt and like all my joints hurt I couldn't walk without pain anymore I couldn't even run at all anymore it was so restricting all this pain that I was constantly trying to force my through force myself through my day through all this pain and discomfort and just tired and brain fog and and it's it's just like it it's it's tough because it's not one simple feeling or one simple diagnosis or one simple issue that you're having it's like you said the hormones they affect your whole body so it's it's a long list of insignificant symptoms that add up to like I feel like an old man yeah and have my energy levels like my immune system is not working I had warts in my thumb and like I tried treating it it wouldn't go away it would just spread right and then so like yeah I I was focusing all I was trying a lot of different things things that really helped was like really improving my diet simplifying my diet get eating those whole foods and uh getting enough meat in my diet made a difference too because I got sick the the vegan movement was massive and it seems hypocritical as a Dairy Farmer to try the vegan diet but I was desperate I was willing to try anything so I did and and there's things that uh did improve with with like my diet did improve to some degrees because I had a lot of the whole plant foods but I really started feeling much more Vitality when I I started adding a lot of those animal products back in and and eating a lot of meat and a lot of dairy raw dairy because I'm one of the few people in Canada that can have raw dairy because I produce it myself it's legal for me to consume it and because like the the pasteurized more processed Dairy I was reacting to right it was it the thing that was triggering my immune system but I can drink liters and liters of raw milk without issues so that's added that back to my diet and that really helped as well as well as fasting my hormones never returned for six years straight and and it's frustrating because I was I constantly was building these healthy habits and my hormones haven't returned yet and it's almost can be tough to keep going when you're in that place but it's like when you're sick you almost have to push your body to the extreme and and to to allow it the permission to to relax and recover and allow you to bring your hormones back but like for me is like the last triggering moment that allowed my body to relax was I did a prolonged fast the first one I ever did after that it was it was two and a half to three days something like that I'm never really too picky dogmatic about it or too strict but it's like two and a half three a that and after that my hormones improved they came back and I wasn't taking hormones anymore and it never gets old being healthy like because like you can you can have all sorts of Dreams in your life but like as soon as you get sick you only have one so like it's such a a weight lifted off my shoulder and uh to to be healthy again you know I it's it's it's wonderful once you start feeling better again because I I went from you know being so young and feeling so old I couldn't even get myself out of bed I was so fatigued and I I couldn't focus my moods were all over the board everything was changing about me and you know it was amazing because like you know there are so many tests out there now they got DNA tests they got hair tests they have certain food you knowest test where they could tell you you know what foods you can eat what foods you can have moderately and what foods you need to stay away from because your body might not be agreeing with certain foods but you're not having a physical reaction you know you're not getting bumps or a rash but you're you're getting all these symptoms inside and you don't understand why but your body is not agreeing with the foods that you're putting in your body and you know I I did for me personally I did hormone therapy and then they tested all my vitamins and they tested all my um you know what I was lacking and they put me on certain supplements and they put me on certain vitamins that I was deficient in and I also started to do different supplements that rejuvenated the cells in your body and because the old the older you get and when you start to go into like the par menopause and you start to slow down your libido your body is not the same anymore and your cell production is is slower everything is starting to get deficient and you know I was taking pomegranate I was taking the the you know both both extract and and the and the and the pomegranate itself and that helped with the Rejuvenation of of cells and and a lot of other little things and just eating certain foods and like you said sleep people don't realize it but sleep is a huge factor and so is stress learning how to cope with stress and I love how you brought up about exercise because exercise is not just about you know gaining muscle strength you know you could let out a lot of steam and you can and it makes you feel good about yourself and it really can help you you know it makes you feel good about yourself you get less you know it takes that stress level down and you start to feel more focused and it it also gives you a good you know um view of the day like wow I accomplished this I got this done I feel good you know and you know it puts you on a different pathway of of mentally thinking so you know I think exercise and and and sleep are two major factors because I I started to make sure that I got I Incorporated enough as sleep and some people don't even realize it but when they're going through this stuff a lot of people suffer from insomnia so then you know there's different ways that you could focus on to try to help with insomnia that are natural that are out there as well but sleep is important you need those eight hours of sleep and and just a little bit of exercise and walking around a lake or just you know going outside and taking a walk down the road things like that is is all you need you don't have to be like w lifting you know 60 lb weights and you know going on the exercise bike for an hour and a half you could be doing simple things and they could have a huge impact on your body so I think it's like you know I learned what my body needed and I learned what my body didn't want and once I started staying away from what my body didn't want and I started incorporating everything that I needed I started feeling the change was that something similar you know that that you felt as well yeah for me it's the same but different like it's uh like I was saying before like like the path with the natural path like it's uh they told me the B12 they told me the foods I needed to avoid and those things helped a lot um but eventually the B12 didn't make much of a difference anymore as I was trying to like had less inflammation and stuff like that and the things that made the biggest impact on my health was just the very simple things like like like the sleep like and my sleep's not perfect now I got four young boys and they keep up hours the day and night and um but it's it's I have enough other healthy habits I think that now I I'm able to handle a little bit of uh lack of sleep but I prioritize my sleep whenever I can and I I have the Naps when I need to and um and I'm getting through with with not as much sleep as I would like but like for me the big things was just like and and there's clues in your life as far as what to focus on um for example like the things that you dread the most quite often that's a hint like why do I dread that for example like when I was in in the depth of of of uh of feeling like an old man like I was almost fearful of being cold which is a problem because I live in Canada it gets pretty cold yeah I I dreaded getting out of the shower and it's like my bi is often cold I have um in my family there's a a long line of of rhinos like where you're your blood circulation shuts off in your extremities and it gets a little bit cold then it gets extremely cold because the blood circulation is shut off painful and and uh you can have all sorts of damage to to your to to your skin and stuff like that with a lack of blood flow but like that's something I struggle with constantly and it got to the point I almost had symptoms of anxiety around going outside and and and and doing the work that I need to do on a daily basis so I started doing cold showers and believe me the amount of stress that I felt getting that water is is insane but I stuck with it and like I learned so much about my body in the meantime not only did I get healthier and and um because like the the benefits that people often talk about like I Revitalize the mitochondria in my body because the mitochondria are the heat producing parts of your cells and like and like like they produce heat and energy so I had more energy throughout my whole day because of it but like also things like once you get into that cold water you have to try to control your your stress response control your breathing and I was never really aware of my breathing before right and and so like when I took what I learned trying to get into the cold water and to to what stressed breathing felt like and how to control that and now what relax breathing feels like I started noticing I'm just working just do my normal work throughout the day I'm I'm stress breathing for no reason right to your body that's stress yeah it's throughout your whole day just the way you're breathing you got to breathe into your through your diaphragm into your belly and I was breathing up in my chest constantly just shallow breathing and that's signaling to my body that that we're in a stressful situation when I wasn't I was just going about through my daily routine and and like so that was a huge hint like why I'm so fearful and and almost anxious of the cold it's like that's a Direction needed to go and that made a massive difference bigger almost than a lot of other things and then like in fasting I was like it I never it never occurred to me as I especially when I was younger but like growing up and like I'm I'm six feet tall I had huge grow Spurs I couldn't do without food I need to grow and and fuel my body kind of thing and like and then later on in life I gotta feel the work I got to do I got a physical job it never occurred to me to do it fast but when I did like I said that was a triggering event that brought my hormones back and and not only that it's surprisingly easy and later on I I listen to other people about fasting you take some salt while you're fasting it curbs your hunger and it keeps your strength up so I can do a physical job I can pick Stones all day fasted as long as I have enough salt if I start feeling shaky and weak I consume a little extra salt and I'm good to go again like it's and it's like the power that you feel realizing that you control over your diet because if you're out traveling whatever else that you you know I can go two three days without food no problem right so I don't have to eat this Convenient Food that's around at the airports or wherever else or or or at a party something like that and you're feeling some H things like you can you can wait you won't die yeah exact yeah there like there's really much focusing on simple things and looking at my own life for hints of what I should focus on first but like the really the simple things like eating the Whole Foods getting some doing some some some exercise it doesn't have to be crazy like you said like the most important thing about exercise is doing it consistently so just do what you love and for me more like the like the the animal type movement stuff like that just felt freeing for some reason and it wasn't in a masculine way it was much more in a softer way that just the self-expression only in an artistic way but for me it built my body it got me strong it was easy for me to stay consistent and is a lot of healthy body move movements which applied really well to my physical job surprisingly enough to um all the critics especially my father out there seeing me do exercising saying like why you wasting all your energy because like allow me to learn how to move properly move at least less joint pain less body aches and things like that so then yeah it made a made that made a really big difference too and all these all these habits that that I focus on one at a time then you make a habit around it becomes becomes easy and normal to do those things on a day day to-day basis and now you maintain those habits becomes much easier so like building those habits and and then uh for me like the the final straw was was the fast that's great you know what when you brought up the breathing I you know that is so important like when I started to learn how to do slow breathing and I took some lessons and they taught you how to control your stress how to control your body through breathing wow what a difference it made you know you can be anywhere you can be anywhere and if you are conscious of the way you're breathing you can change the way you feel you can change the way your mind is thinking you can change the way your body is feeling just by the way you're breathing you know people have done like you know I've showed people how to do methods of of relaxation breathing and as they're sitting in their seats at work when they're all stressed out and you know it's amazing how impactful it's so important to know how to breathe CU most people don't pay attention but if we're in a stressful situation or if we're not feeling well we should focus on our breathing I think and really learn the right way to breathe and that's something people should look into I think what do you feel yeah it's it's always like if you told me that 10 years ago I thought that sounds hokey I'm not gonna worry about that like it made a big difference in in uh in the the average stress I felt throughout the day just and it's not just like yes you you got your breathing and like being able to focus on that but it's just like the the awareness of what relax breathing feels like and what stress breathing feels like that was massive for me just having that awareness yeah and like so like for me that was the biggest impact I got from cold exposure is just the self-awareness of what stressed feels like and what relaxed feels like yeah it's I don't I don't naturally have that much self-awareness I'm not really very naturally very self-critical and and is good some bad things to that like I'm not really I don't I don't feel the impact of of uh of pure pressure the same way some other people do but like yeah it the downside like I I I could be horribly stressed and have no idea that that awareness made a big difference and and just yeah like being aware and then being able to change your breathing because you practiced relax breathing and just be able to switch over and like for me too like other things like that I I learned that techniques that I also use during those stressful cold uh periods is like I would smile even though like I'm I'm struggling I would just force a big smile on my face and it's like it's hilarious some of the research that are out there people just putting pencils in their mouth which kind of f forces a smile and like you feel better like it it works yeah like you wouldn't think so and especially people especially like myself are just like go getters it's like yeah like I don't got time for that kind of hokey stuff but it's like it does it it makes it makes a difference it makes a difference and I feel like you know I hear people use that excuse I don't have time I don't have time but we do have time you know all you need is five minutes of the day 10 minutes of the day somewhere if you can spare 15 even better but all you need is a few minutes here and there and just little tweaks can make such a big difference in your life something better than nothing and then what I always tell myself is that it's never a lack of time that's your issue for not making this change it's a lack of priorities like how important is it maybe you got to something in your life that's very important to you like you got a wedding coming up and you want to get a healthy body or like you have your your kids or your grandkids or or or a massive dream that you might have like chasing your dreams or creating that business like and like that's that's that's a real thing for me I'm trying to improve the lives of farm animals like it's like you gota tie these little habits that you say I should add this to my life I don't got time or but it's not that at all it's a lack of priorities like what can I give up like I don't golf anymore don't play video games forever but like it's like it's like things that you can give up or like or you look on your phone it it gives you a a number every so often of the average amount of time you spend on on your phone screen day like cut that in half and you can have hours more time exactly exactly you know I you hit it right on the nose it's really just an excuse because you don't prioritize what's important in your life and you have to really think about what's important to you you know what do you really how do you really want to feel how do you really want to look how do you really you know when you wake up in the morning you look in the mirror are you happy with who you see are you happy with the way you feel and then you got to start just stop making excuses and just make little you know prioritize your time just a little better and all you need is just a few minutes and miracles could happen it's not going to happen right away of course you know but baby steps you know that's part of the problems because usually the things that we need to give up give us immediate gratification and the things that we're trying to add in requires that delayed gratification but those but that that that delayed gratification the impact is massive so like that's the problem so you got you got have a lot of self-control in your life to to make that happen but if you if you stick to it it it pays back for sure oh it definitely does it definitely does now if you had to give a couple takeaways before we go what are some important factors that you want people to realize from this whole conversation because we tapped into a lot of important things and we you gave such such great advice today thank you so much for all the great advice you gave but if you had to like sum it up what are some things that you just want the audience to realize from this conversation big big picture is yes you need to look after your body look after yourself to make yourself more effective at everything you do and I think just just thinking now like if you are in that place where you're sick your body has an amazing capacity to heal and I think that that is I think maybe the the biggest takeaways like your body can heal if you get out of the way and stop feeding it junk and stop Doom scrolling and stop sitting on the couch like these simple habits that you hear is is not rocket signs every basically everybody know knows what you got to do to be healthy like you got to sleep enough you got to exercise just a little bit it doesn't have to be a whole lot it's just start that habit eat your Whole Foods stay on the prim and the grocery store and then like and then from like once you get those those those core habits in place like those those simple things in your life then you can really go into the weed with it and then you can like you can really focus on like the quality of the food I'm eating is is it regenera raised do I know the farmer and stuff like that can I get more in touch with the food I'm eating and like really respect your food and stuff like that like you can keep going down those roads with exercise too and like and like meditation and like you can keep it's endless the way you can go but just start with those those few simple habits that can make a massive massive difference oh yeah for sure and I gotta I got to be a testimony to what you just said because I did those things and my my health and even my mentality did did a whole turnaround so everything you just said is so true 100% true now before we go can you tell everybody your website where they can find you and some of the services that you offer absolutely yeah uh my my farm is moral eats um m o rat ts.com is our website and what we're trying to do with this business is like I'm trying to improve the lives of fire animals through supply and demand supply and demand is so so powerful and uh it's it's a bigger and more powerful way to make an impact than writing those comments on social media and stuff like that or or or anything else really supply and demand is so powerful and getting your voice heard so like that's what we're trying to do with moral eats and the best way to get in contact is like through our through our website you go and you sign up to our email list that's our favorite way to contact people and educate people and keep them up to dat of what we're trying to do with more Elites and and our mission of improving the lives of firan an and furthering regenerative agriculture because like the thing beautiful thing about email is like I don't have to rely on the algorithm to put my my my information in front of you it's like it's in your inbox either you delete it or you read it yeah so there so it's like but then beyond that oh and like and if you live in Ontario where is where we Farm like we will if you sign up to our

sharing all this valuable information I think you really you know explain through all the things that you share today how important it is to you know really focus on what we put in our bodies how we take care of our overall health you know and really about putting oursel on a pedestal because it's time that people show each other not just show other people but show themselves some self-love because really you know without taking care of yourself you'll never be able to take care of the people around you so you really have to focus on number one and then you could focus on whatever else is important in your life but you know health is so important and it really goes down to what how we're treating our bodies and what we're putting in our bodies and you know and it's so important that we really like we talked about create that healthy lifestyle you know and make it you know break those bad habits and start creating those good habits and just making it a part of our lives so you
