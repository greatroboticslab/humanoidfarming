1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,659
all right guys what is going on today we

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,850
are talking quick hitches for your

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,529
tractor we're gonna try to keep it brief

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,570
free today just explain what these quick

5
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,370
hitches are how they can help you why

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,660
they're so popular we're gonna try to

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,679
hit a lot of highlights about quick

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,330
hitches and just give you some

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,130
differences in some similarities to help

10
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,900
you make a better decision I'm going to

11
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,060
attempt to answer why you may want a

12
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,529
quick hitch for your tractor but let's

13
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,180
be real this is just what I had an

14
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,160
inventory here okay so there's four

15
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,750
different manufacturers right here these

16
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,730
are four different quick hitches that

17
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,140
all essentially do the same thing for

18
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,180
you this is not a complete

19
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,469
representation of what's on the market

20
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,570
right now it's just what I had in

21
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,820
inventory at the time I always want to

22
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,590
provide objective information and that

23
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,210
can be challenging being a dealer for

24
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,270
just some of these quick hitches here

25
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,680
because obviously I'll make money if I

26
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,660
sell you the ones that I represent right

27
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,579
however part of my business model is to

28
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,870
sell things that are a good value so

29
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,520
whatever dollar amount that you're

30
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,260
spending you're getting a very good

31
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,640
value for that dollar amount otherwise

32
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,590
it just doesn't make sense to me why

33
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,109
would you want to buy it I say all of

34
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,059
that to say I try to be objective some

35
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,650
of this is subjective I just can't help

36
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,030
it but I want to give you an honest

37
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,890
assessment and I'll just give you my

38
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,600
opinion on why I sell these certain

39
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,409
quick itches and I don't the others some

40
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,630
of them I just don't have the

41
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,920
opportunity to all I want to do is

42
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,990
answer some of those questions and let

43
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,520
you make that decision we're gonna get

44
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,020
started here in just a second but really

45
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,000

have good works tractors calm all right

57
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,380
here we go okay so i want to start off

58
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,180
by saying there's one thing i'm not

59
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,920
gonna talk about and that is how to hook

60
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,659
up a quick hitch to your tractor or hook

61
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,490
up a quick hitch to your attachment i

62
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,140
have done some other what i think are

63
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,820
pretty good videos about that i'm gonna

64
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,740
post links above here so at some point

65
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,570
this video here if you want to watch how

66
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,430
to use a quick hitch or how to hook it

67
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,540
up to your tractor click on one of those

68
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,159
links and you can check that out as well

69
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,680
after you're done watching this video

70
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,180
it's an easy process to do but it's kind

71
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,439
of a process in and of itself and i

72
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,970
don't want to take time away from just

73
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,649
kind of going over what these are in

74
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,450
general here and answering some specific

75
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,550
questions about them okay

76
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,680
first up let's go over the similarities

77
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,050
here now you're gonna see all these look

78
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,330
extremely similar and they should and

79
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:25,180
there's a reason for that there's an a

80
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,980
sae specification that controls the

81
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,390
dimensional spacing of these quick

82
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,860
hitches and so there's going to be

83
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,690
tolerances within there that they have

84
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,250
to conform to so every quick hitch you

85
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,340
see here in every quick hitch on the

86
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,599
market should conform to that a sae

87
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,190
specification if you don't see where it

88
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,349
says that and occasionally I might not

89
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,000
put that in my description as well just

90
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:44,590
ask a question to the manufacturer or to

91
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,480
me or to your dealer and they can

92
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,209
confirm that it was built in that a sae

93
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,860
specification oftentimes you're going to

94
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:53,200
hear about compatibility issues between

95
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,120
quick hitches and attachments that don't

96
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,230
match together they don't meet they

97
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,900
don't fit together like they're supposed

98
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,950
to and on a rare occasion even I will

99
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,170
have that happen with either an

100
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,700
attachment or a quick hitch so within

101
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,890
this specification it's a pretty tight

102
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,360
parameter that these quick hitches and

103
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,400
the attachments all have to fit within

104
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,840
and so you have a spacing measurement

105
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,730
that's going to be between these lower

106
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,959
links down here and then you also have a

107
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,930
spacing measurement that's going to go

108
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,340
from the lower links to the upper link

109
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,079
so you will see that all these quick

110
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,970
hitches are gonna have bolt holes that

111
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:23,709
are on the top link okay to allow you to

112
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,660
adjust it up and down that's gonna aid

113
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:27,790
in compatibility and flexibility with

114
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,470
the attachments so I said on occasion I

115
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,000
do have something that doesn't match up

116
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,799
well there it's a quick hitch or the

117
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,900
attachment or a combination of both the

118
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,209
match just isn't there and so again with

119
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,889
these tolerances being so tight and so

120
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,810
narrow with everything having to fit and

121
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:43,180
match up occasionally you are gonna have

122
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,530
an attachment that doesn't quite just

123
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,730
fit the bill you know and so you can

124
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,470
accomplish that by a couple of ways

125
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,150
either shave off a little bit of

126
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,579
material sometimes even just a little

127
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,870
bit of paint or you can simply send it

128
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:55,030
back get a new one and hopefully that

129
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,760
cures the problem however I'm telling

130
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,709
you 99 out of 100 probably more like 999

131
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,599
out of a thousand times I don't have an

132
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,069
issue with this okay I brought the

133
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,400
camera down low here that way you can

134
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:09,549
see what I want to talk about next and

135
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,150
that is gonna be the cross bracing or

136
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:15,639
the support between the top and the side

137
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:19,150
as you can see pretty chunky and beefy

138
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,769
on some of these okay these black ones

139
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,349
here you can see in the corners there a

140
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,449
lot of chunky bracing the imesh doesn't

141
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:26,430
actually have that kind of

142
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:29,069
same a little bit of racing but not the

143
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:32,219
same amount this is a land pride up here

144
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:33,719
okay and you can see there's some cross

145
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:36,389
bracing there just a thin plate of steel

146
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:38,159
on the far side alright and so all of

147
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,650
these quick hitches will be rated for at

148
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:43,229
least up to 40 horsepower if not higher

149
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,779
I've used them on many four series

150
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:47,550
tractors without issue so I think you

151
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:51,569
know as with a lot of farm equipment

152
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,310
they are also term over built before

153
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:54,509
what they're gonna be on and I don't

154
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,949
really think you're gonna have much of

155
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:58,529
an issue unless you are really just

156
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:59,490
pushing the limits of your tractor so

157
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:00,930
the difference there in the cross

158
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,490
bracing just shows you one of the ways

159
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,259
that these quick itches can be

160
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,090
constructed differently while remaining

161
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,819
within the same dimensional tolerances

162
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,740
of that ASAE specification one of the

163
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,000
other big ways that they can vary is by

164
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,409
weight and that's what we're gonna do

165
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,819
next we're gonna go ahead and weigh each

166
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:16,560
one of these quick hitches and we'll

167
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:17,729
show you how much they weigh you know

168
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,449
what before we weigh these we're gonna

169
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,129
go ahead and give you a little

170
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,620
background information on these quick

171
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:24,810
hitches here so number one these are all

172
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,219
category one three-point quick hitches

173
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,979
okay so they're not going to be category

174
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:31,199
two no limited cat1 so like the smaller

175
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:33,180
land prides are not included in here

176
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,110
this is all apples to apples to apples

177
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,460
to apples as best as possible okay so

178
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,009
now let me tell you about each one of

179
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,539
these quick itches here in particular

180
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:44,430
mountain on my 1025 here is gonna be a

181
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,439
work saver quick hitch this is

182
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,930
manufactured in the USA and Litchfield

183
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:51,089
Illinois okay so now for the sales pitch

184
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,409
so there's a few reasons why I like

185
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:54,089
these work favorite quick hitches and

186
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:56,430
why I choose to sell them I can sell a

187
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:57,870
lot of different manufacturers I really

188
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,889
love selling these work saver quick

189
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,779
hitches so reason one they're gonna

190
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:05,129
include a set of these bushings these

191
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,960
bushings are required they're gonna go

192
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:08,159
on the bottom pins of any attachment

193
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,379
that you put on your three-point hitch

194
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,789
okay so you really want to have a set of

195
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:12,990
these bushings for every attachment that

196
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:15,419
you're gonna hook up to your three-point

197
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,979
hitch yes some guys will take these off

198
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,839
and put them on to the next attachment

199
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,399
however that really defeats the purpose

200
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:22,649
of having a quick hitch in the first

201
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,990
place which is efficiency so the work

202
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:27,060
saver is gonna include linchpins here

203
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,860
while the I match for sure includes

204
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,479
cotter pins these are just a nice

205
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,729
convenience to have if you're attaching

206
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,959
and detaching your quick hitch a lot of

207
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:35,610
folks just leave their quick hitch on

208
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,030
and never comes off but if you need to

209
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,040
attach it to a non

210
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,390
package compatible attachment you want

211
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,620
to take the quick hitch off or maybe

212
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,930
have a backhoe you want to put on

213
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,820
something along those lines it's nice to

214
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,100
have a really easy pin to work with here

215
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,020
versus the kind that once you kind of

216
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,370
deform it it's a real pain to kind of

217
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,510
work with and get it back together to go

218
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,640
through the hole and you got to use the

219
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,870
wires you know what I mean so it's just

220
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,220
a nice convenience it's not the end of

221
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,710
the world they'll both get the job done

222
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,510
but just a nice touch by work saver work

223
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,820
saber includes what's called a floating

224
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,320
top link or floating top link adapter

225
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,210
something along those lines you'll hear

226
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,190
it called multiple things and so this

227
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,440
opens up the versatility so if you do

228
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,540
have some non quickhitch compatible

229
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,640
attachments you can put this in place of

230
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,560
the top hook that's on the quick Ajit's

231
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,330
elf and get a lot of flexibility there

232
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,190
up and down that kind of thing so I'll

233
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,840
show you what I mean so the last reason

234
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,270
I really like these work saver quick

235
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,670
hitches is that they include this extra

236
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,890
bracket here called a top link adapter

237
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,260
and you can put this on you can take off

238
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,790
that hook which I've done here you can

239
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,190
take this hook off okay that would

240
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:38,200
normally go right in here and you can

241
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,240
put this on and this is a floating top

242
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,130
link adapter here and it allows you

243
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,400
almost infinite adjustment to hook up to

244
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:47,230
a top link on an attachment okay so if

245
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,820
you have a specifically a non-quick

246
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:51,340
hitch compatible attachment or something

247
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,680
that just has a really goofy top link to

248
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,330
it you can put this on you can actually

249
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,980
shorten your draw bars as much as

250
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,410
possible so this kind of angles in so

251
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,940
it's not sticking out extending way

252
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,460
beyond the vertical point if you don't

253
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,770
want it to and make it work so this is

254
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,170
also included with the work saver quick

255
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,520
hitch so a nice bonus from work savers

256
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,290
the fact that they're manufactured in

257
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,200
Litchfield Illinois right here in the

258
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:16,630
USA okay so this one here is Al and

259
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,760
pride QH 15 it came in on an L Series

260
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,170
Kubota a while back this kind of kept it

261
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,010
on hand so folks you'll see what they

262
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:25,510
are and you'll see it's got the multiple

263
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,240
holes in the top link which is a great

264
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:31,380
feature as well to adjust that top link

265
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,060
up and down or the top hook I should say

266
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,860
very similar construction to the others

267
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:39,430
you'll note that difference there in the

268
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,280
cross bracing underneath take a look at

269
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:45,130
the backside here so you can see that

270
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:48,760
look on the far side and then right

271
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,850
there okay this guy here is the popular

272
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,990
John Deere I match

273
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,579
the nice thing is you can get these in

274
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,070
green I can't sell the work savers in

275
00:08:54,579 --> 00:09:02,920
green unfortunately take a look at the

276
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:07,839
cross-bracing there okay again multiple

277
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:11,259
locations to adjust that top hook very

278
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,970
similar construction this guy here is at

279
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,170
our River this is very similar to a

280
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:18,660
Harbor Freight quickhitch

281
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:20,709
okay good channeling their cross bracing

282
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,440
really the rest of its similar in

283
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:27,970
construction again he had the adjustment

284
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,190
there for the top hook okay so we're

285
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,839
gonna weigh these now I put this piece

286
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,120
of steel here simply because they're

287
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,069
u-shaped and I want something to open up

288
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,459
at the top up here let the legs hang

289
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:43,329
down and hopefully rest on here and then

290
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:47,220
I zeroed out the scale so 0.0 right now

291
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:47,220
with this piece of steel on here as well

292
00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:01,870
okay so the land pride QH 15 weighs in

293
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:09,310
at 68 point four pounds next up here is

294
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:15,279
the John Deere I match okay sixty five

295
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:18,790
point eight pounds okay this one here is

296
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:22,209
the Tar River quick hitch this is

297
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:29,319
similar to a Harbor Freight okay you'll

298
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:35,649
see 50 6.0 pounds okay last one up here

299
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:38,279
is the work saver quick hitch 71 point

300
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:40,329
two for the work saver quick hitch okay

301
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,800
alright so those kind of results are

302
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:43,329
ones that speak for themselves you can

303
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,279
see what the weight is you can see what

304
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:46,870
you're paying for then right so weights

305
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,670
kind of speak for themselves right you

306
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,110
know I mean you can kind of tell with

307
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,089
more cross bracing you would think that

308
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,880
the work saver would weigh more than the

309
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:57,130
I match and the land pride however the

310
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,579
work saver looks very similar to the tar

311
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:02,439
river but what was there there was a 15

312
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:03,760
16 pound difference between the work

313
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:05,840
saver and the tar river

314
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,130
the work saver ended up being the

315
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,690
heaviest out of the bunch there so

316
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,460
perhaps that's attributed to more cross

317
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:13,970
bracing perhaps a little bit thicker

318
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,870
steel something along those lines okay

319
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,490
so I'm going to go ahead and grab a

320
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,200
critical dimension here on all of these

321
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,570
which is a centerline to centerline of

322
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,490
the lower link points here I'm really

323
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,260
not worried about lower to upper because

324
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,450
all of these again have the adjustable

325
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,430
positions here so you really have a lot

326
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:31,040
of flexibility with them they're more

327
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:33,350
concerned about left to right on the two

328
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,010
lower links let's see what the work

329
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:40,850
saver reads here we're looking at about

330
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:44,030
twenty eight and a quarter next here

331
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,770
we'll do the land pride and again this

332
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,370
is very approximate you know don't hold

333
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:49,250
me to it

334
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:53,270
but we're very close here 28 and a

335
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:55,790
quarter-inch now let's do the John Deere

336
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,370
I match the John Deere I match is about

337
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,490
28 and a half Center to Center let's

338
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,620
take a look at the tar river there tar

339
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,260
river is 28 and a half as well Center to

340
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,640
Center okay so what we can see here is

341
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,800
they're all within a quarter inch and

342
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,200
that's again I'm just put it down and

343
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,580
run the tape across I'm not exactly I'm

344
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,690
trying to get close to center to center

345
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,400
there but it's not this is not

346
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,990
scientific okay this is just to get you

347
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,640
close enough and I can tell you that a

348
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,890
quarter inch is close enough for this

349
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,110
measurement here okay so now let's touch

350
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,970
on cost or price and I really don't want

351
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,370
to put specific prices in here

352
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,990
because this video lasts for years and

353
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,360
years and prices fluctuate and change

354
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,010
over time however I can say that if

355
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,380
we're gonna compare new to new - new -

356
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,180
new - new I don't know how all four of

357
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,040
them across the board new I can tell you

358
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,450
that that tar river similar to a Harbor

359
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,560
Freight is going to be at the lowest end

360
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,570
price point okay this can be the

361
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,100
cheapest one you can get then you step

362
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,410
up to another tier which is really where

363
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,640
the work saver and the I match and the

364
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:53,780
land prides and a lot of the more

365
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:56,030
quality more robust manufactured quick

366
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,670
hitches are gonna be at and I can tell

367
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:00,920
you that what I found is the land pride

368
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,720
is the most expensive with the I match

369
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,370
following closely behind it and then the

370
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,160
work saver being actually the cheapest

371
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,560
among those three and so again you get

372
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,360
the work saver with that floating top

373
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,480
link adapter which sometimes is valuable

374
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,550
sometimes not

375
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,170
that you get that extra set of bushings

376
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,390
and you also get the convenience of

377
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,710
those pins which some of them come with

378
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,910
and some of them don't but it's just

379
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,640
nice to know that the work saver does

380
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,140
and again those work savers are made in

381
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,130
the USA right in the Litchfield Illinois

382
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,990
which is a bonus

383
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,430
I know buddies aren't all the options

384
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,080
but I thought four was a pretty good

385
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,730
representation at some different levels

386
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,410
and price points and manufacturers

387
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,790
especially some from the major

388
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,300
manufacturers out there with John Deere

389
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,910
and Kubota

390
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,800
and their sister companies or partner

391
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,970
companies with their attachments so I

392
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,130
felt like it was a pretty fair

393
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,630
representation hey make sure you leave a

394
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,580
comment below I'd love to hear from you

395
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,660
I get things wrong sometimes we all

396
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,010
learn something new every day when we

397
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,750
get smarter but some of these things

398
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,920
speak for themselves today and I'll let

399
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,550
you make your own decision on the right

400
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,550
quick hitch for you
