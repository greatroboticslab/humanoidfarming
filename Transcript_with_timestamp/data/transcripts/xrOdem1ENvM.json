  "text": "all right guys uh welcome back to this channel uh if you're new please enable you subscribe to this Channel and uh check out for great content on this channel of everything you need to know about P farming profitable P farming and not just Pi farming alone we'll still be bringing to you lot of great content on several other agricultural Venture well in this video we want to talk about uh the best breed for commercial Peak farming what are the best breed you need on your farm if you're going to run a commercial Peak Farm this is a question on the mind of several individuals and uh because honestly I can tell you that um if you can get it right with your genetics with the right breed you are 50% good to go in your of course there are other things to still pay attention to but at least having uh the right genetics plays a very big role in uh in getting uh a good and a profitable pig farm now uh first of all let me start with saying that ensure that you don't buy breeds that you don't know what they are or what type of breeds they are make sure any breed you get on your farm you know exactly what they have I see that how there lots of people just see pigs and all that matters to them is just that these are pigs and uh pigs are just pigs and uh if pigs are pigs then we can just get them I think that's the mindset of of some people obviously because you see that they just see p somewhere they don't know their origin they don't know their genetics and they just get them that's a very poor way to start Peak farming I would never advise you to start your Peak farm with any breed you don't know what they have what type of breed they have don't get diminished breed I've often said this on the farm on sorry on this channel don't get diminished breeds on your farm you are starting with on the on the wrong tone because those breeds will not convert well for you make sure you get good breits now this right on this video I'm sure you can you can remember if you have been watching this channel you can remember uh certain uh time when we release vide on these uh animals if I want you to look at their sizes you'll be so surprised this is less than a month on this farm and you can see how uh robust these guys are are so their their conversion is so much is so massive you know I've always told you that the key to Pig farming is feeding them right you need to feed your pigs right these guys they they feing on the what we more like the feeds that's what they are on right here and I've told you already that when you are feeding your piglets especially your piglets you want to feed them at libidum and I explain to you that that means you want to ensure that they always have feet in their troughs that you can see they just they keep eating and eating when they want to drink water they get to the nipple Drinker to drink water they they go back there they they heat as much as they need to heat this is less than a month about less than a month and they are so they have they've grown so massive so to my own surprise personally so this is the African uh South African large white right here and we got them from a very reputable Source the woman is extremely diligent when it comes to uh uh Pig farming you can if you get to a farm you would love it so much she did it very well she constructed the pens very well and she's not really growing pigs for fattening she's doing them for she sells the piglets majorly so these pigs were gotten from the F so uh types of the best breeds for you to use on for in short best breeds for commercial Peak farming now the top one that is most common not just in Africa in this in the in Africa but even around the world the top one breed is the large white breed large white breed is so common it's so common and it's one of the Exotic uh breed that uh is very good for uh commercial Peak farming the large white the large white uh in another video I will tell you the characteristic of the large white but the large white is uh known for a very large liter size they are very prolific they give bir to a lot of to lots of piglet and uh they are also you know they are strong they are they they are resistant they have good resistance so people it's so common lar whes are so common this also are the large white this is also the large white right here this is the large white breed we have here so I will tell you the characteristics in subsequent videos this is the large white so major majorly on on this Farm is U the large white breed now another uh the second uh breed that is extremely very good for commercial Peak Farm is the land the landra pig is uh very good also for commercial pig farm the land R uh and the large white I would make a video to tell you the difference between them and which one you should prefer on in in in stocking In Stocking them to your farm so the large white number one the land race number two the land R also is very prolific and has uh it also Hardy that means it's as good resistant so it's uh it's very uh advised you can get the large rise on your farm now another uh breed that uh you can also get is the Hamshire the Hamshire breed is also a common breed that you can get now uh I'm I'm seeing more of what I'm talking about here is for the African because uh you need to understand that these breeds are majorly uh sometimes suitable based on location there are some of them that can work in almost any location but not all of them there certain breits you don't want to bring to certain climates so but I'm talking from the African side of things and these are uh that's where I'm making this video from but obviously we have other different types of pig breed that some may do very well in certain other areas that uh may not do well in the African side so so the large white the land R the amsh that's uh those are three breeds that I would really advise you to think about if you want to get into U Pig farming now there's a there's one that uh I would really really advise you should consider and that's the tn70 the tn70 is one of the latest uh Pig breed out there and when I say latest I don't mean like yesterday but you know it's one of the recent uh modifications that occurred recently in the Pak farming world and it's a cross of both the large white and the L that's the tn70 and uh you can imagine taking the C of both the large white and the land and see how great that breed will be the tn70 is so massive it's so beautiful and uh very prolific so uh I would really advise that if you want to get your hand on PE farming and you're looking for what breeds to get you can consider getting the T 7 now uh another um Pig breed that uh is also very very suitable for commercial Pak farming is the curo the crock the the the crock is very is also very massive it grows very big very very big and uh we will be stocking obviously we we stocking lot of great breeds on this Farm very soon we're working on that uh one of the breeds we aim to bring to this Farm is the crock the Cambro we want to bring the cro because it's also very very good when it comes to breeding it's very good when it comes to um um breeding and when it comes to fattening so you can even maintain a Pure Line of the crock if you want to or you can decide to cross breed uh uh heat now many of these Pak breeds I've mentioned the large white the land R the am the t7 the cro one of the great thing about them is that they are very good for cross breeding purposes so you want to have this breed if you are interested in crossbreeding programs and uh if you if I will advise you on what kind of V what kind of me pig you should have on your farm if you are going to be doing the crossbreeding purposes well I would if you have the money I would advise you to go for the last Peak breed I'll be mentioning here and that's the D Rock breed the dck breed is the last um breed that I advise you to go for commercial Peak Farm now I'm not sure I would advise you to have uh to to go for the Pure Line of the Dr bre and just be breeding just a Pure Line alone well if you want to be selling uh to other Farmers that mean if you want to run a breeding Farm a a more like a just yeah like a breeding Farm where you you you more interested in just selling the piglets to other Farm well you can go for the Duro line and just be wearing the dck alone of course there is a demand for the Duro B majorly the dur bra in this side of the world because the D bra are very very uh excellent when it comes to um cross breeding they they they put in their genetics so much on other breeds that and you know one important characteristic you need to know about drug breed Pig breed is that they grow fast and large you know he one thing to grow large but take time but these guys grow large and they grow fast so they attain that level of largess in record time so is the reason why you may want to get them on your farm because they will pass on trait to your crossbreed animals so on the hybrid animals you produce from maybe the Duro and the tn70 or the large white they would have that characteristic of growing very fast which is what you want if you are running a cross breing program because you want to be able to fatten those animals in record time also latest 6 months you want to send them out of your farm so the Duro breed is an excellent um B that you should have you can have on your farm but it's on the high side is very expensive so if you but if you don't want to use a durug bre you can use any other um Pig you can use a tn70 b to make your other this thing or any other U maybe the large white b or any you want to do it so it's uh these are the uh best breeds I would recommend for commercial pig farm in this side of the world now there's one last breed I will mention which is Uprising and that's the patrian breed the patrian breed is uh is also a fast growing Pig it's uh it's more it's not so new but it's getting the Limelight newly that means it's just coming into the Lamplight newly and not so many farms have the pan breed but a breed that it's getting increasingly common in this side of the world so uh um very soon I'm sure it will it will become much more common and people will be able to get them easily so this are this will be all for the video best Peak bridge for commercial purposes if you want to start a pig farm commercial pig farm you should look out for uh this breed I've talked about to either run a pure breeding line or a cross breeding line any whichever one the program you want to make you are free to use any of these breed to do them all the breeds I mentioned are very excellent when it comes to uh reproduction they give birth to a lot of piglet and they are very Hardy they are resistant they have the right characteristics they convert well and um all these Bri I mention are the pure breeds obviously I'm not talking about a diminished breed the pure breeds are the ones I'm referring to here and uh would not advise you to run a dck Pure Line uh because obviously you if you are going to be fattening for the market because if you're not going to be selling The Offspring to the to to the uh other Farmers you don't want to because you may not be able to sell at the price that the uh the matur Duro will come out with you may not be able to get buyers for that in the market you know I mean in the slaughter house so I'm not saying everywhere in the world I'm talking about this side of the world because other sides of the world the the Dr breed is more common that means you can easily get the Duro breed but in this side of the world is not yet as common so it's still more like a very expensive animal so if you are raring the Duro bre for Market purpose it may not pay you so much because you may not be able to sustain that uh uh the the price it to be going out with but again if you desire that it's still up to you thank you very much if you're new to this Channel
