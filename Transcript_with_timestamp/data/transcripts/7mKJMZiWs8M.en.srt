00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,400
hi there welcome to the channel so in

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,640
this video today I'm going to be showing

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,120
you my favorite method for starting

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,840
tomatoes from seed indoors this has no

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,719
potting up involved we are using some

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,800
Solo cups but not the double Solo Cup

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,880
method this method will give you strong

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,359
healthy tomatoes that will flourish once

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,080
you plant them outside in your garden so

10
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,920
I'm going to go through the steps on how

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,279
I have had success in getting strong

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,279
healthy tomato plants ready for the

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,559
garden so let's get

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,399
started so as you can see here we got

15
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,879
the Solo cups you see lots of videos and

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,640
people having great success using just a

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,480
plain old Solo Cup and I'm going to be

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,920
using these right from the get-go we're

19
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,320
going to be starting the seeds in these

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,879
cups I've gone through them and drilled

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,320
holes in the bottom because you always

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,280
want to have that good

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,280
drainage you have any Nursery pots that

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,640
are like that 4 in size the larger size

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,519
that you want to use those will work

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,839
good as as well so you've seen a lot of

27
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,240
videos The Double Cup method which I

28
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,560
have tried in the past and I understand

29
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,119
you know how it is kind of neat how you

30
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,439
can just water in the bottom put your

31
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,400
cup in here I've done it but I find that

32
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,159
once you get a whole tray of these set

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,799
up in that Double Cup method you got

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,720
them you know under the lights and when

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,360
it comes time to watering it it becomes

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,079
very finicky in my opinion you got to

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,799
pull each one out lift water you have to

38
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,640
you know make sure you don't overwater

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,240
it and drown your plants with too much

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,680
water sometimes people put small stones

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,000
in there and stuff to try to avoid that

42
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,079
again to me that's a little finicky so

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,240
what I've been doing that works great is

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,280
I just use the the bottom watering

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,560
method make sure you have a tray like

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,479
this that's got you know about a 2 or 3

47
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,600
in uh Rim around it so it contains your

48
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,079
cups you know keeps them from falling

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,000
off

50
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,439
so as you can see here you can get a lot

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,960
of these Solo cups into one of these

52
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,920
trays I'll leave a link to them down

53
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,160
below as to where you can find them on

54
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,000
Amazon something like this that you can

55
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,800
just get from the dollar store one of

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,519
these turkey uh Roasters disposable

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,680
these work really great for holding a

58
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,360
whole bunch of plants it's got the nice

59
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,360
you know 3 or 4 in edges that'll hold

60
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,000
them in place okay so one of these will

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,200
work good as well so the first part of

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,879
my method is how you fill up the cup

63
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,040
here and what we're going to do is just

64
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:40,840
fill it up halfway starting off with

65
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,800
some seed starting mix you want to make

66
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,200
sure you moisten it ahead of time so

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
that when you put it in here you got

68
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,599
moist soil cuz when it comes time to

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,319
bottom water it'll Wick up better if

70
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,959
that soil is moist I've done it with dry

71
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,080
soil and then try to moisten it by

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,840
dumping water into the tray and it it

73
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,040
doesn't work very well cuz sometimes the

74
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,200
the seed starting mix is very dry and

75
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,280
Anor robic and it just doesn't absorb

76
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,360
water so make sure you got some

77
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,239
moistened seed starting mix so this is

78
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,920
not potting soil this is seed starting

79
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,200
mix and I'm just going to show you how

80
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,120
I'm setting up one of these it's

81
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,319
actually a little bit early here for me

82
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,599
in Zone 3 Saskatchewan to get my

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,480
tomatoes going so for most of us that

84
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:30,280
are in the cool growing zones like zone

85
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,560
five and down our last frost date will

86
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,799
be early May to miday here in Zone 3 I

87
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,760
like to hold off till the end of May

88
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,400
before I put my tomatoes outside just to

89
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,400
avoid those late spring frosts that we

90
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,879
seem to get a lot of so about 6 to 8

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,920
weeks before your last frost a is when

92
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,360
you want to get your Tomatoes going so

93
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,319
there's no benefit in starting them

94
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,439
early you just end up having to look

95
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,799
after them indoors and they become

96
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,360
overgrown and these cups become too

97
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,239
small for them so it's best to keep it

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,120
at 6 to 8 weeks before your last frost

99
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,319
date so I am just filling up the cup as

100
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,000
I said halfway with the moistened seed

101
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,879
starting mix make sure you pack it down

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,239
pretty good so that it there's no air

103
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,880
pockets in

104
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,440
there so the reason we're only packing

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,880
it halfway is we are going to plant our

106
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,160
seeds here put them under the grow

107
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,639
lights let them start uh sprouting I

108
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,680
usually put in two to three seeds so

109
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,440
that we have you know a good chance of

110
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,720
germination and then having to thin them

111
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,720
out to to one plant will become

112
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,639
necessary once they get past that two

113
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,120
Leaf

114
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,880
stage and then you just let them grow in

115
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,160
this cup and as you will see that I'm

116
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,880
going to show you here that you just let

117
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,440
them grow until they start to get above

118
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,240
the rim of the cup so I'm going to show

119
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,919
you

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,199
here that I'm just going to be putting

121
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:05,080
in two or three of these seeds on the

122
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,320
surface of this soil here and once I get

123
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,560
them in place I'll cover them up with a

124
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,520
little more of the seed starting mix and

125
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,080
that's all we're going to do for

126
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,160
now so I put about a/4 inch of soil on

127
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,800
top of those tomato seeds and then added

128
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,680
a light layer of vermiculite that just

129
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,560
helps kind of retain the moisture and

130
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,759
help prevent damping off which is that

131
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,240
green mold and stuff that you sometimes

132
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:35,520
see on your soil that can kill off your

133
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,120
seedlings so instead of the two cup

134
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,360
method where we're going to be watering

135
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,600
each of these cups individually all the

136
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,880
time I just water right into the tray

137
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,039
here I add a two or three inches of

138
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,160
water and it'll soak it up I find a

139
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,960
little easier to control how much water

140
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,680
your tomatoes are getting with this

141
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,319
method of just pouring it into your tray

142
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,120
directly I'll put you know a couple

143
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,120
inches in there every day or two

144
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,440
whatever it doesn't soak up in an hour

145
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,639
or so I'll pour off just so that I'm not

146
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,639
overwatering them you can also do

147
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,280
spritzing from the top just to keep the

148
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,039
top moist but I try to avoid that until

149
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,599
the tomatoes start sprouting because I

150
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,120
don't want those seeds to become

151
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:19,880
displaced when I'm spritzing them but

152
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,720
you can use this as well so I just find

153
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,000
over time over that six week period that

154
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,639
you're going to have these tomatoes in

155
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,319
your house and you have to look after

156
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,280
them I just find the watering directly

157
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:34,199
in to the tray is a lot easier you have

158
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,520
this underneath the lights it's easy to

159
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,960
pull out add a little bit of water push

160
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,759
them back in so this is recommended you

161
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,160
have a grow light or something because

162
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,599
these are going to be down below the

163
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,720
surface here they're not going to get

164
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:50,400
much sunlight if you have them in a

165
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,919
window so I'd recommend you know a grow

166
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,599
light over top of them for that initial

167
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,560
time where they are sprouting so the

168
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,000
potting up process is a lot simpler

169
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,680
because you're only going to be just

170
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,879
adding more soil to the cup so I just

171
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,400
took this clip from last year so that I

172
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,960
can show you what the potting up method

173
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,840
looks like so this plant is about 4

174
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,319
weeks old and as you can see it has

175
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,400
grown up above the rim of the cup quite

176
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:21,560
a bit now so what you want to do is just

177
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,560
trim away any of those tiny leaves that

178
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,759
are below the rim of the cup and you

179
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,680
will see that there's a lot of tiny

180
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,400
little hairs on the stem of your tomato

181
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,319
and those once we cover them up with

182
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,479
some soil will turn into Roots so that

183
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,680
will help give us a really strong root

184
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:40,599
ball so once you've trimmed away any of

185
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,199
those leaves that are below the rim of

186
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:46,560
the cup we're going to fill it up now to

187
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:50,440
pretty much the top of the cup with

188
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,520
potting soil so we won't be using any

189
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,919
seed starting mix now we've switched to

190
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,280
potting soil so that there's some food

191
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:59,840
in that soil and it will help feed that

192
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,800
tomato plant so this is what it looks

193
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,599
like now and it is ready to go back

194
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,319
under the grow lights or by this point

195
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,720
you might have some Sunny windows that

196
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,759
you can put your plants into which is

197
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,800
usually what I do move it out to the

198
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,639
garage or out to your

199
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,759
greenhouse and then here is what the

200
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,240
plants look like at about that four to

201
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:26,520
six week stage you can see I have some

202
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,159
beautiful strong healthy tomato plants

203
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,560
here and usually in the next couple

204
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:34,120
weeks they will be ready to go outside

205
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,519
and start hardening off I just want to

206
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,839
show you another closeup here of what a

207
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,440
good root system this cup has and I did

208
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,240
trim a little bit more at the bottom

209
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,279
just to get some more air in there so

210
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,000
that those roots don't become root bound

211
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:51,959
and that extra layer of soil now that we

212
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,480
filled up the rest of the cup with those

213
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:57,120
will fill up with roots as well and this

214
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,640
will be a beautiful strong plant ready

215
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,600
to go out to the Garden so that's kind

216
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,360
of the the basics of this method that I

217
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,160
find is a great way to be able to plant

218
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,880
tomatoes in one container and one

219
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:13,519
container only you still are technically

220
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,959
potting them up and helping them grow I

221
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,760
find the one cup method is a lot less

222
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,399
work and a little faster if you got a

223
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,040
lot of plants you got to water every day

224
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:24,640
and check on I find just being able to

225
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,360
water right into a large container like

226
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,760
this is much easier and faster and a

227
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,600
little easier to control so depending on

228
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,000
where you live and when your last frost

229
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,560
Aid is I hope that when it's time to

230
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,519
start your tomatoes that you'll give

231
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,640
this method a try I'm very confident

232
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,480
you're going to end up with very strong

233
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,560
healthy tomato plants that when you put

234
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,560
them out in your garden is going to give

235
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,160
you a bountiful amount of tomatoes

236
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,440
