00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,880
hey everyone today we're planting garlic

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:11,920
I'll be using both store-bought garlic

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,200
and 12 cloves of elephant garlic from

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,800
this year's Harvest we'll be planting

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,840
them in two different types of garden

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,640
beds one is a no dig bed and the other

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,119
is hul culture we're going to compare

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,679
which method works better so what's the

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,599
difference no dig gardening is exactly

11
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:32,239
what it sounds like no digging instead

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,800
We Lay compost and organic materials on

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,320
top of the soil to build it up naturally

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,920
protecting the soil structure on the

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,160
other hand hugle culture is a raised bed

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,840
technique that uses decaying wood and

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,280
organic matter as the core of the bed

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,039
the word hugle culture comes from German

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,359
and means Mound culture this technique

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,879
helps retain moisture and adds nutrients

21
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,160
over time as the organic materials break

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,440
down I'm planting the garlic on

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,440
September 28th 2024

24
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,280
sewing each clove about 4 in deep and

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,080
spacing them roughly 7 in

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,320
apart normally I'd water them in after

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,320
planting but today the ground is already

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,280
quite wet so I'll just rake over the

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,119
soil and leave it as is now it's just a

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,680
waiting game to see how these two

31
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,759
different methods perform will the no

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,320
dig bed do better or will the hul bed

33
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,119
come out on top only time will tell make

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,119

35
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,720
Harvest and comparison video thanks for

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,300
watching and I'll see you in the next

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:02:00,689
