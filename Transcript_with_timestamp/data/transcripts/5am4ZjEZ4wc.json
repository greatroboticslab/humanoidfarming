  "text": "foreign [Music] hello and good morning on a saturday morning i am super glad that you guys have joined me here today i cannot believe how many of you have showed up already to watch this about bleach it's one of the questions that i get asked the most and i'm super excited that we get to have this conversation here today now one of the things that i'm most famous for is giving you tips and techniques and today i'm going to give you the tools and hopefully i can go through every single one of the tools that we have that are linked below so that i can explain to you why we use them and then how to use them properly and then answer any of the questions that you guys have so before we get started i'm going to play a pre-recorded uh snippet and this snippet is going to show you how we use bleed it's going to answer a lot of questions up front it's also going to probably spark some questions for you and so my goal for you is that we get all of your questions answered in the short time that we have here today i really respect your time and especially that you showed up on a saturday morning so i'm honored i'm i'm delighted to get to spend this time with you and so uh we will jump over and we will watch that pre-recorded clip now and then i will jump back in and we will answer your questions and we'll rock and roll through this whole thing so uh here we go don't do it very often but when you do you want to make sure you have all the personal protective equipment that you need and you have a proper system in place and that once it's clean we're going to maintain it with just regular everyday cleaning chemicals and we don't need really strong cleaning chemicals most of the time but if you do have a shower like the one we're going to clean today we do need bleach and here is the process the first thing we're going to do is start with personal protective equipment i've got a bib apron on that covers all of my clothing to protect it from any spray we're going to be using a spray bottle from any spray getting on my clothing and then also my shoes so as part of our personal protective equipment we are going to wear shoe covers now we never wear shoe covers in the shower except when we're using bleach and that way it keeps it from getting on our shoes we're also going to wear a pair of gloves the gloves are going to keep any spray from getting on our hands and we are going to wear a face mask to protect us from breathing in any fumes now quick tip once you are ready to spray you're going to hold your breath while you're spraying when you have to take a breath dip out of the shower take room temperature breathing because it's an enclosed space and if you breathe in the fumes it will make your eyes red and it will be hard on your breathing okay so we are still gonna wear a face mask but we're gonna breathe outside the shower when we spray we're going to hold our breath inside the shower okay all right next thing is i have personal protective glasses that i'm going to wear this will keep any spray from getting inside my eyes all right so now that we are personally protected for climbing inside our shower before we do we're going to remove the bath mat if in the event we end up spraying anything on the floor and then we step out onto the bath mat it's going to ruin that bath mat so we want to make sure we remove the bath mat before we climb inside the shower now once the bath mat is removed i have two terry cloths and these terry cloths are folded in half i'm just gonna lay one down right where i'm gonna step out so my foot will step on one of these on each side as i climb outside the shower okay and i will have my shoe covers on but anything that touched the shoe covers i don't want to transfer that onto the floor and i don't want to transfer it onto the customer's carpet or anywhere else in their house so as i step out of the shower if i have bleach on my feet i'm going to step on a terry cloth the shoe covers are going to come off i'm going to wipe off the bottoms of my shoes then we're going to be good to go all right the next thing i have is a great big old bath towel and you say what is the bath towel for well we're going to use ozone for this project and this is an ozone generator right here the ozone has three oxygen atoms that are connected to it so it's a molecule of a light blue gas and ozone is also known as smog and so what's going to happen with this ozone generator is once we spray the bathroom down we're going to have a lot of fumes inside the bathroom so we're going to let ozone go into the air and create a pocket of ozone around my bathroom and then it's going to decompose all of the bleach smell and then once all the fumes and all the smells are gone then we're gonna go back in and we're gonna clean the bathroom okay so we're gonna spray it first we're gonna leave for about an hour and a half that's where this bath towel comes in so what i'm going to do in order to keep ozone and bleach fumes from circulating throughout the house we're going to turn off the air conditioning and we're going to turn off the heat and we're going to turn off the ventilation so we're just going to create a packet of ozone and bleach inside the bathroom all right here's where the bath mat comes in i don't want any person plant or pet inside my ozone chamber so i'm going to take my bath towel and i'm going to open it up and i'm going to roll it sideways and i'm going to plant it below the bottom of the door and that way when i close the bathroom doors and it's on the bottom of the door no ozone can escape and i'm going to turn the ozone machine on this is perfect for a master bath it has a timer on it and i'm going to set the timer for 30 minutes so 30 minutes of ozone then once the ozone dies down i'm going to let it set for about an hour and that way all the ozone can disintegrate out of the air okay now for the bleach part we're going to climb inside the shower we're going to spray the bleach and this is just an empty bottle i've just got regular straight bleach the regular straight bleach goes inside the bottle we're not diluting it we're going to use it full strength okay the full strength is what's gonna make your eyes turn red if for any reason you don't wear the glasses and you're inside reading the fumes okay so this is the reason that we're gonna do such personal protective equipment and then also our spray all right so once we have the spray we're gonna spray the shower from top to bottom and we're gonna let it just set we're not gonna agitate it we're not gonna scrub it we're not gonna anything we're just going to spray the entire shower down okay there's a catch the only part of the shower that we're not going to spray is all of the hardware that's the faucet that's the faucet head and it's the rim around the glass because we don't want our bleach to eat all that up okay so no hardware and no chrome or no bronze or anything gets sprayed with the bleach we're going to come in after we're done and we're going to use a steamer for that now in chemical safety we know that we can't mix anything at all with bleach so we're not going to come in with another cleaner after we're done we're going to come in we're going to hose the whole shower down and we're going to be done with all the bleach once we're done with the bleach we're going to come in with a steamer this is just water okay tap water we're going to use on the shower itself now in order to clean the glass because we have not sprayed the glass with bleach what we're going to do is just use a steamer pad and we're going to use steam and we're going to clean the walls with the steamer pad then we're going to clean the grout with the steamer and you'll notice on the steamer there's a little tiny head it's very skinny that will fit with the grout and so with the grout we're just going to go up and down very lightly very easily with the steam and then we're going to go ahead and steam the rest of the walls down we're going to squeegee the wall down we're going to scrape all the water towards the center of the floor and we're going to be done with our shower so instead of it taking us hours to do we're going to do this setup which is going to take a couple of minutes then we're going to let the chemicals and the bleach do all its work then we're going to go clean the rest of the house when we come back everything will be nice and tidy but we'll wash everything down and then we'll just do the steamer quick quick steam up job and then we're going to be done with the project and then we can go ahead and clean the regular bathroom it's just a regular bathroom so we still have the bathroom to do but here's the secret when you go to a customer's house if you're a professional house cleaner you're going to do this process at the very first of the job that way you can be cleaning the rest of the house then when you come back the bleach and the ozone will have already done its job and then you can go ahead and clean the bathroom just as you would normally clean a bathroom and the whole bathroom is not a deep clean project all right so i hope that set the stage and we did get some excellent questions that came in so thank you so much for your participation this one is from laura and she said so straight bleach will just clean my soap scum let's be very clear about what bleach is bleach and this is the one that i'm referring to today and there are different brands of bleach and stuff on the market but this is the one that we're going to reference today bleach is not a cleaner bleach is a disinfectant and so we're going to treat the bathroom after we do the bleach so the bleach is going to be like the first step and the reason we're going to do this is because if you are a house cleaner and i don't know are you guys house cleaners are you guys homeowners if you're a professional house cleaner type house cleaner in the comments if you are an airbnb host and you sanitize between guests type airbnb host in the comments and if you are a homeowner type the word homeowner and then i will kind of know who's here and then we can guide our comments toward that but if you are a professional house cleaner and you show up at a customer's house and you're doing a walk through when you get to the customer's house and you walk in the bathroom and you see like a really icky bathtub and it has the soap scum and it has the build up or maybe the tub has backed up and there's like all this gunk in the tub the first question we want to ask is how did it get that way and so once we determine how did it get that way it will help us determine what the gunk actually is so if it's soap scum that that we're probably going to use a degreaser for right because the soap scum is what comes from body proteins and it comes off our bodies it is um the gunk the dirt the the germs that we have that we've washed down the drain it's other soap products that we've used either shampoo or conditioner or things like that that have mixed with water and they either set on the side of the walls or they splashed on the sides of the walls and then they got stuck because they weren't rinsed off properly so once we know what we're looking at that's going to help us determine how exactly we clean it now if you go into a customer's home and the tub is backed up and i say the tub is backed up you usually see a ring around the tub and what that suggests is that there's hair clogged in the drain and so as the water was trying to go down the drain it did not drain properly therefore it backed up and it created that soap scum where there's body proteins and dirt and grime and shampoo and stuff like that that has settled in the tub and then it slowly drained and as it drained it didn't have a chance to rinse off the sides of the tub or the shower therefore it's stuck in the bottom so if that's what we have we may have to use a de-clogger which also has a really potent smell so if you are in a shower for example and the one that we just looked at had some of that serratia marcescens which we call pink slime and that is very toxic to our bodies and we don't want that in our showers at all and that's where the bleach comes in so once you're aware of what it is you might just determine that you are going to use bleach now we do not use bleach very often i want to make very very clear that bleach is a specialty product it's used for special cleaning situations okay and i have links below so that you can see what i'm talking about but i really want us to be aware this is a specialty product and should be treated with the utmost respect and we can't we can't get mad at bleach for what it does because it's it's very strong and it's very designed for a very specific use i want to stop for a second and say that for every chemical that exists on the market there's what's called a safety data sheet and that is designed by the globally harmonized system and it's now man mandated it's it's worldwide that every chemical must be provided by the manufacturer a sheet there are 16 sections on the sheet and the very first section will tell you the manufacturer and their phone number and if you have any questions about the product whatsoever you can call the manufacturer and there's like a chemical safety person that will answer the phone and they will answer your questions so that's always really good to know the second thing that's really important to know is if there are any hazards associated with the product it will also tell you that as well and that's in section number two of the sixteen sections if you go to section number nine it will tell you where on the ph scale the product lies now seven is right in the middle and that's neutral zero is all the way over to the side and those are going to be your acids all the way over to your side on 14 that's going to be your alkalines so we have acids neutral and then alkalines and so every number you go from seven in any direction it's going to be ten times stronger than the number before so number eight is ten times stronger than number seven number nine is ten times stronger than number eight right all the way down bleach this particular bottle of bleach is 12.5 on the ph scale so that is really really really strong we're not talking about just a couple numbers away from seven we're talking about a couple of thousand numbers away from seven right it's very strong on the logarithmic scale all right so that said how do we use bleach when do we use it why do we use it i know it gets really kind of like should we use it at all it does have a purpose and so if you know how to use it you're not going to be scared when you do use it so a couple things that i want to talk about while we're still talking about bleach is bleach first and foremost i don't know if you ever noticed this or not but it comes in a jar that you cannot see through and this is to protect it from sunlight so that it stays stable so even if you pour it into another container it must also be a non-see-through container just like hydrogen peroxide for example comes in that brown container that's a plastic container that you cannot see through it's to prevent sunlight from coming through so all bleach containers will come in this really durable thick plastic it's not a regular plastic container this is a heavy-duty durable plastic that it won't eat through and that also the sun can't see through did you know that that's a fun fact right how cool is that okay so the next thing that's really interesting about bleach is most of the time depending on the size of the jug and really really every bleach container that i've that i've purchased has this wide lid that is typical of gallon jugs so if you are using this for regular cleaning and we saw a lot of people using this for regular cleaning during the pandemic and i don't mean to clean things but to sanitize and disinfect after they've cleaned things so it's a two-step process but what they did then is they were asking lots of questions on how do i measure the bleach right how do i how do i know that i got the right amount of bleach so that's a really great question so in our um in the links here let me see if i can find this there is a um there's uh and let me remove this here uh where's that question i've got homeowners here i've got house cleaners hey nick hey anna this is so exciting if you guys will type in q before your question then i will know if you're just saying hi to me and those of you that have questions because i do want to come back and i want to answer all your questions we've got house cleaners in the room we've got airbnb hosts we have lots of homeowners this is so awesome so i'm super excited all right so this is a pump spray that we use in professional house cleaning and the cool part about this is is this little adapter right here holds one ounce of clorox or one ounce of cleaning solution so if we buy any of our concentrates or we buy a gallon container which is what we have here you can just remove this lid and you can put this in here and one pump will be one ounce and so if we have a 32 ounce container let's say that we were going to use this this is the one that we used in the demo this is 32 ounces so three pumps would be one part to 10 ounces of water and so that's how we would do it for a 32 ounce container we would do three pumps and that's for regular sanitizing disinfecting spray so if you were going to use it to disinfect like we did during the pandemic you would use three pumps to a 32 ounce container and so this is very helpful for measuring but the thing that i like best about this is it's scalable and so if we have employees for example that we have sent out to do their own measuring of cleaning chemicals we don't want them to use it straight if they're going to use it as a disinfecting spray for flat surfaces for example right so we want to make sure that it's measured properly so that's the reason why i included this here also these are kind of hard to find and so i i'm really keen on having these and so i just wanted to recommend these to you if you have a jug and you'll notice that this one where the lid goes it's a little bit longer than the jug itself because this is plastic you can just cut that off so that it matches the size of your jug and still reaches to the bottom so there's a helpful tip right there all right so the next thing about the bleach when we're using the bleach um if we're using it to clean out a shower like the one that i mentioned when you get to a customer's house the very first thing that we're going to do like let's say that this is the first time that you've cleaned the house and if you don't use bleach and you don't have a system you're probably going to end up spending a lot of time and energy going through the house making sure that you are cleaning the house doing a regular maintenance or deep clean and then you're going to end up spending a lot of time maybe an hour or so trying to clean those icky showers so the very first thing that you want to do is you want to budget your time properly because time is money right so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to treat with bleach then we're going to get out of the room and then we're going to go clean the rest of the house while the bleach is doing its job and so the first thing that we're going to do is we are going to use straight bleach if you have a really icky shower now what we're looking for in the shower is we're looking for mold and we're looking for that pink slime and so if there's anything that's stuck on the bottom that's just like really nasty and you're like oh no it's going to take me an hour to clean the shower and you'll start recognizing after a minute like it's one of those showers okay the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to go to the sink in the bathroom to the sink in the bathroom and over the sink we're going to pour the clorox or pour the bleach into a spray bottle that we can use and i do have and i do recommend a funnel the funnel the purpose of the funnel is that we will not spill it on the customers countertops or um i don't know on ourselves or any of those things this is a regular funnel and i just cut the end off so that it flows quicker through the jar instead of it comes down to a little tiny point and it then takes forever to to put it inside but when we're done with this you remember how i said we can't leave it inside the container we're not even going to take it out of the bathroom inside this container so what we're going to do is we're going to take this to the customer's house just like this it's got a lock lid on it so it's not going to spill in our car it's not going to spill on the cleaning caddy and i think this is the only product that we actually carry in its original container to the customer's house all the other chemicals can be mixed in our inventory and we just take a bottle of spray or whatever so many things have happened and i don't want to run the risk of the lid coming off or this leaking in your caddy or getting dumped over or anything and i will stop for a second and say these are phenomenal spray bottles and they've got the lock lid where you just unscrew it and it can go from spray to stream depending on what you need so i really like the container but for we don't want to leave it inside the bottle for a couple of reasons if we leave it inside the bottle around the edge where we have sprayed it's going to crystallize and it's going to crystallize on the inside where it gets sucked up the hose and into the sprayer just because of the nature of what bleach is so then when you go to spray it next time you're going to do the pump thing 20 times and nothing's going to come out not only that but because sunlight has gotten through your bottle if you leave the inside the bottle it will have oxidized some and it will not be effective and then you'll be using your bleach and you'll be going like well just use it the other day how come it's not working that's why it's not working and so you want to make sure that when you are done spraying that you pour it back inside the bottle now the exception is you can wait until it does its job when you come back in the bathroom because we're gonna leave the bathroom while it does its job you can just leave it inside here for a minute when you come back then you will pour it in before you go to the next step of cleaning so these are our tools for that icky icky icky bathtub okay i'm glad we got that taken care of okay now um another thing that i want to mention while i'm on the bottles before i move on and i should mention this um if you're using a bottle like this nobody except you knows what's inside and i really want to stop for a second say that responsible cleaning means that you need to label all of your containers and because we're going to be the only one in the bathroom and we're going to be the only one pouring this in here it's okay if we don't label it for this one job before we leave the bathroom we're going to empty this out back into the original container and we're only using straight bleach so it's not diluted with anything okay but for your other bottles and this is a note for your other bottles for your other bottles we need to have a label and this needs to be in your care custody and control a hundred percent of the time if someone else takes the lid off and they dump this out and they pour something else in whatever is inside the bottle that you use whether you're a homeowner or an airbnb host or professional house cleaner whatever is in your hand if you sprayed it it's inside your care custody and control and if you sprayed something and somebody switched out the chemicals on you the insurance company will not cover it if there's property damage and that's because you are in control of your chemicals so i cannot stress the importance enough of you gotta know what's inside your bottles i love these bottles because we do use lots of concentrates as professionals and so as professionals this is uh this is a bathroom product that we use but i have a label here and we use a lot of the odoband products and otoban is phenomenal where they provide the labels for you on their website you just download them print them and then put packing tape over it and tape them on your containers and you'll notice that here if you look up closely this is the dilution ratio so if i have a 16 ounce container i have one of these pump sprays and if i'm doing a heavy duty cleaning check it out this is where it gets exciting then i would check this box which is i have it i have it here for for the 32. so is it 1 ounce for 16 or is it 1 ounce for 32. so you have a choice and so by doing that this is the heavy duty version because it's only this would be two pumps for 32 ounce right and then one for 32 would be for your maintenance clean so you can use the same chemical for maintenance or deep clean all right that leads me to my next topic when we're cleaning a bathroom with bleach that's going to be considered a deep clean or a special product a special project that is not a maintenance clean okay on a maintenance clean we do not bring the bleach into people's houses that's a special product it's a special job it's a special everything and you need special personal protective equipment when you use it and so we are not going to bring bleach with us on a regular maintenance clean got it okay cool all right now that said for maintenance cleaning we'll talk about that after i answer some of your questions um and we do have some questions here which i'm super excited to answer thank you guys so much um smokey of stormwind says i would recommend using some sort of a mask n95 a respirator and safety glasses if you plan to use a spray bottle for bleach also clean the spray bottle with soap and water to stop the pump from getting blocked yes all of those apply all of those apply now if for any reason you decide that you don't have uh respirators and you're not using the n95 you can use a regular mask this is not gonna protect you from fumes okay what we're gonna do is this if you go inside a bathroom this is on a deep clean you're going to go in a bathroom and you have one shower one icky shower spraying it down is going to take you about 60 seconds that's it 60 seconds so what we're going to do is we're going to put the mask on and the mask is for us the mask is to remind us that we are inside a shower and while we have it on we are not going to breathe you're going to dump yourself inside the shower you're going to grab your spray you're going to hold your breath and you're going to spray the shower down you're going to step out of the shower you're going to turn your head and take a breath but you're not going to be breathing the fumes inside the sharks that's a really tight tiny closed space right then you're going to get out of the bathroom so for 60 seconds most house cleaners and the reason that i say this is most house cleaners will not carry big respirator masks with the big you know we're not we're not going to be spending all day in there we're going to spend less than 60 seconds spraying the walls down and then we're going to bolt okay so it's going to be quick in quick out and we're done all right um and i love this question because we do have to think about safety protective equipment one of the things that uh uh and anne says odoban what is your experience with this cleaner it smells nice and it says disinfect but being a bleach fan i'm doubtful um okay so it does do a phenomenal job for disinfecting and i think odoban is one of the few products on the market that is grossly mis-marketed um they're a phenomenal company they've been around for 30 years they are all their stuff meets all of the epa regulations and it is on the safer choice most of their products are in the the safety choice uh what is it safer safer choice products that are registered by the epa and the ap epa when they register those products they don't just register the regular product they register every single ingredient of those products and then they determine whether or not it meets uh its competitors brands that have more toxic fumes and stuff like that otoban is a phenomenal product today we just happen to be talking about bleach and because bleach will like bleach your clothes and it stains things and you know people are scared of it and it smells bad and all that stuff and i'm not knocking the product because there's a very good use for it and when used properly you can be safe all right so that said um uh denise said i'll jump in here real quick denise said former custodian and homemaker now wear white t-shirt if you can to prevent bleach stains absolute absolutely label put it on a high shelf uh yeah that's a great a great suggestion and if you are a homeowner and you have that ability that's awesome some house cleaners that are professionals are required to wear their uniforms while they're cleaning and so in this particular situation they may not be able to wear a white t-shirt if that's the case what we do want to do is we want to wear our bib apron and the bib apron is the one that i recommend is adjustable and this allows you to put it on over your head and then adjust it so that it fits you perfectly and get it up tight over your clothes like scooch it up near your neck so that it covers you and it doesn't get any of your clothes this one also goes all the way down past my knees almost like three quarters past my knees down almost to the the floor um and the thing i like about this is it is water resistant so it will repel water and it's it doesn't absorb so fastly into your clothes if you get some bleach on it it will stain but it's not going to stain your clothes and so i really like it for that reason these are fairly inexpensive um but i do recommend that you wear something to protect your uniform for the very same reason i recommend and this is this this goes against everything that we've trained before but i recommend that when you are doing bleach and a shower that you also wear shoe covers now we wear shoe covers as house cleaners when we're inside someone's home because we want to prevent ourselves from tracking in dirt from outside and so if we are at a customer's house and we are um we are wearing our shoe covers when we get inside their house that's cool but we usually take them off when we get inside the shower and the reason for that is when you get inside the shower we don't want to slip and fall right but for this particular situation we're not going to be climbing inside the shower unless we absolutely have to what we're going to be doing is we're going to be reaching inside the shower we're going to be spraying and then we're going to be dipping back outside the shower again so this is for our feet in the event that there's any overspray we don't want it on our nice expensive shoes and so i do recommend these shoe covers while you're doing the bleach application okay so for for this particular time we're not going to take the shoe covers off when we go inside the bathroom we're going to leave them on and i recommend the kind of shoe covers again i've got links below so that you guys can learn more about this you can add some to your card if you want um i have gone through all of the products that i'm sharing with you today and i found the very best prices for these products and i will i will tell you i do make a commission if you buy them and that's not why i'm here you're going to buy them anyway i want you to buy the right ones and i want you to understand the products and then i want you to save some money at the same time okay and if you can do something else without spending the money i will tell you that as well but i want you to buy the right stuff the first time there's nothing more that makes me sad that people buy a whole bunch of stuff and then it's the wrong stuff either they bought the cheap version and it fell apart or it was not it wasn't quality and it didn't do the job or they bought something that they got price gouge done right so i just want to tell you but to have the ones with the treads on the bottom that's a non-slip protective protection and so for all of the shoe covers that you buy these are not the cheapest on the market but these will prevent with the non-skids these will prevent you from slipping like on hardwood floors or whatever we buy one kind and we use them for all of our cleaning so if you're on ceramic tile floors if you're on hardwood floors if you are cleaning anywhere in a customer's house this is going to prevent your shoes from tracking in anything from outside and some house cleaners have asked me the question so i'll just answer it now should we take our shoes off when we go inside a customer's house and the answer is absolutely not because you are on your feet as a house cleaner all day and so if you're cleaning from sun up till sundown that's a lot of time that you're you're putting pressure on your back your hips your knees your spine you need the support that good shock absorbers can provide from really great quality athletic shoes and so the shoe that i use is a i believe it's an excursion a trail excursion it's a cross cross shoe between a trail running shoe and a running shoe and so it's got a lot of shock absorbency in it it's got the high arches it's got a really flexible toe box i'm not here to sell your shoes but you need to be wearing shoes when you're cleaning house so even if it's your own house if it's someone else's house if you're cleaning for an airbnb please wear your shoes and then just cover a shoe cover to protect your your feet so that you're not upsetting a homeowner that's like i don't want to use my house or whatever you need to wear shoes to protect your back your spine your hips and your knees okay so i'm glad we said that yay i feel so much better already all right one more piece of personal protective equipment while we are talking about the shoe covers is i want to talk for a second about gloves and gloves are really important i always wear nitrile gloves and i like the nitrile gloves better than the latex i find that over the long haul they are um they they they work with more house cleaners some house cleaners have latex allergies the nitrile seems to just be a good middle of the road glove that you can wear and i like it because they're really durable they don't rip as easy as some of the other brands that i've seen and the thing that i like about them is if i'm running my hands across a countertop i can feel the grit with my fingers with the gloves on and so i can tell like oh is this dirty or is it clean even without looking at it like sometimes you go to clean something and you hit like a a piece of gunk and you can't tell that there's gunk this allows you to to sense that while you're wearing these gloves this will also protect your hands from getting bleach on them okay and it's really important because even if it's just an over spray and you're using that that motion with a spray bottle it can leak and it can get on your hands and it can eat through your hands because it's a very strong chemical right and we want to be sensitive to chemicals especially if we're cleaning all day all right i'm going to stop for just a second answer your questions and then we'll jump back in uh marilyn says best product found for the bathroom is clorox cleaner and bleach spray and done okay yes that is awesome maryland also says if you have hard water stains in the toilet and you've tried everything endless chemicals didn't work you can clean without chemicals if you want get some gloves and like grit wet dry sandpaper and go to town so we're not going to talk about cleaning toilets today because we are going to talk about bleach but i do want us to be really really cautious and that's that's an excellent tool thanks for recommending that um i do want to recommend that while we're using bleach again to be very painfully clear that this is a specialty product not to be used by anyone unless they've had proper training on your team so if you are bringing house cleaners in it is your job as a professional that you do provide personal protective equipment um one of the personal protective equipment that we also recommend are safety glasses and these safety glasses are really great because they wrap around your eyes and it will prevent you if you are spraying that any back spray would flip inside your eyes so it's not going to completely cover your eyes like if you were to have goggles that were sealed which would be awesome if you covered those two but that's like the respiratory mask most people are not going to go that severe your basic tools that you are required by osha to have are enough that will remind a house cleaner that you are in an environment where you must be careful and it's that being on high alert and that situational awareness that protects us it's going to help you protect yourself from spilling stuff you're going to be very careful about where you stand you're going to be careful about if you lean up against a shower that you've just sprayed you're going to be careful about all of those things and you want to make sure that you're very careful and the personal protective equipment from top to bottom and that's your eyes your face mask your gloves your shoe covers your apron you are from head to toe you're covered and so that's just going to be an awareness to you that i'm i got to be careful right i'm doing this bleach project all right uh smoky of storm and says and if you're using bleach you want to protect your skin and your feet from bleach it can make skin start to peel if exposed for a long time yes that's true we want to prevent prevent all of our skin from touching it and we want to especially prevent our eyes getting it in our eyes on the safety data sheet going back to the precautions it is very harmful to your eyes and if you do get it in your eyes you want to stop what you're doing and you want to flush it with water all right so that said i want to jump over to what is the process of using bleach okay so once we've showed up and i said already this is a special project right if you are going to a customer's house for the very first time and you know you're going to do a bleach this is a special project so you need you need to bill for it you need to bring your special training your special equipment and your special caddy that has your bleach and then also your ozone generator this is an ozone generator we need to talk about this for a second it's about the size of my head and so you can see how big it is it's really not that big at all it comes with a three prong plug and so it fits into a regular outlet um can you see that and then this is the other side of it so it's a little plug that fits into the back of this right here all right and then there's a big fan on the back here which is going to help circulate the air and on the front there are different timing timings so you can set it for 20 minutes 30 minutes 60 minutes 90 minutes all the way up to three hours and then it has a hold button down here so you can see the hold and you can turn it on and leave it on if you need it but for most circumstances like if you're in a master bathroom and you're going to be using bleach probably 20 or 30 minutes will work now let's talk about ozone for a second and what is this this is an ozone generating machine and the purpose of having an ozone generating machine is that it's going to remove the smell from the bleach that is what causes us to go like that if we breathe it okay but ozone also does that to you ozone also creates its own nasty smell so if you've ever been outside and there's like lightning and you go outside and you smell that it just kind of smells like a musty dirt smell and you're kind of like like that that's ozone so having bleach and ozone in the same place is just like double nasty right so what we're going to do is we're going to create a ozone chamber and then we're going to get out of the bathroom while it does its work now here's how ozone works um regular oxygen that we breathe is o2 and it has two molecules of oxygen okay that's normal everyday oxygen that we breathe the ozone which are little short rays from uv that come from like the light of the sun that is o1 and so like when lightning strikes for example it connects to the the regular oxygen molecules and now instead of having o2 you have o3 and the o3 is a really unstable oxygen so what happens is it kind of like fights to get back to its equilibrium which it dissipates one of those oxygen molecules and as a result of it it's kind of cool but what it does is it grabs the odors the the molecules that have odors in them and it breaks it down and decomposes it and oxidizes it then it goes back to normal so what we've discovered over the course of time is that by having an ozone generator we can use it for cleaning chemicals like bleach so this becomes a really great powerhouse and the reason this becomes a special project because when you go to a customer's house and you're bringing extra equipment you got to pay for the extra equipment you have to know how to use the extra equipment it's extra training because it's not a regular process that we're going to do like when we're regularly cleaning a customer's house right so there are rules and regulations for using an ozone generator so if you are going to clean a customer's house with bleach and you bring your ozone generator you also have to bring a couple other things so one of the things that you're going to bring with you is a bath towel and i have um added a couple of bath towels down here and it's because you need a really heavy duty durable bath towel it doesn't matter what kind it doesn't matter if it's old it doesn't matter if it's stained it doesn't it doesn't matter um but it's going to be a great big heavy duty durable thick plush bath towel and you're going to lay it down and you're going to roll it sideways so that it will cover the bottom of an entire door and what we're going to do is we're going to block off all of the air that's circulating in the room now you'll notice in really fancy homes especially they've got these huge palladium windows in their bathroom and all that's in all this beautiful light they've got these big tubs and big showers but they have really poor ventilation in many homes because those windows do not open and so they might have a little fan which they're required by law to have that meets the builder's code but the builders the the fan in the bathroom often doesn't have proper ventilation and then in the next room they might have a bedroom or something and if the windows are not open it's common to get all kinds of mold inside these really fancy expensive showers and so if you're going inside one of those bathrooms what you're going to do is you're going to close off the bathroom you'll go inside you'll spray the bathroom with bleach and then you'll close the bathroom off and you will turn on the the ozone generator and then you're going to leave and go clean the rest of the house while it does the bleach part and while it does the ozone part okay so what happens is in this ceramic that inside this machine it has a ceramic plate and this electrically creates that ozone it's just like lightning and it creates the ozone which is like a smog and it has that really awful nasty smell to it we don't want that smell circulating through the house because now you've got bleach and you have ozone that would be circulating through the house and so the rule of thumb is if you're going to use an ozone machine get everybody out of the house okay don't use it with people plants or pets inside the house because it's not healthy and it can be toxic to plants for example it can kill your plants as far as people and pets it's just going to make you sick it's like when you breathe fumes and you get that feeling in your lungs it's the same kind of thing so we don't want that to happen as far as um us breathing that uh smokey if stormwind says uh used to use ozone generators when guests would smoke in the rooms it gets rid of cigarette smoke smell and it works awesome that is so true and i'm so glad you brought that up thank you so much there are lots of airbnb hosts that use the ozone generators between guests to get rid of stinky stock smile or if there is uh like if they did smoke or if they smoked marijuana or something on the property there were no smoking policies sometimes even if they vape or if they burned incense it can be really nasty smells that you're not accustomed to i know another one is cooking with curry curry has a really strong smell and so if you have an airbnb and then you come in to clean and you find that whoa somebody loved curry while they were here and they did lots of cooking and it's that the smell has lingered this is a great way to get that out of the air for airbnb hosts and one of the reasons it's so popular with airbnb hosts i'll share this with you it is also really really popular with flood and fire restoration companies and for the reason that if there's been a fire in the house and the smoke alarm goes off even if there wasn't a fire but there was lots of smoke for example if something overheated or something you know burnt pizza or whatever it is um the smell of that can get stuck on things like oil paintings and you can't grab cleaning solution and go spray oil paintings and get the smell off you can't do that and so it the smell the stink and the smell will get embedded into like fabrics and wall hangings and drapes and carpets and furniture and clothing and if you have a basement for example let's say if you have a carpeted basement that is close to um the the cement floor oftentimes it can if it rains or it's moist outside it can absorb a moisture that's in the cement and it can bring that into the the basement where there's not a lot of circulation and then it will smell bad and you have these musty dank smells you can grab an ozone generator and you can turn it on and you can create an ozone chamber and then you can lock the door and leave and while you're gone it can do the ozone the ozone thing uh the ozone we want to leave it for about 20 to 30 minutes and then the ozone breaks down it's got like 50 life every half hour so the next half hour it's going to be 50 percent less potent as what it was before and then the next half hour it's going to be 50 of that then the next half hour it's going to be 50 of that so it breaks down over two or three hours and then it doesn't smell like anything at all so it's like coming in after a rainstorm and everything has broken down properly and then you're not smelling it so that it's not um it's not you know hurting your lungs or any of those things so uh one of the things that i do want to mention if you are using it as a as a smell as a smell replacer as a smell destroyer just be aware that it's not great for people plants or pets and if you are going to use it while you are at a customer's house the proper way to do it is to lock the bottom of the door if you look in any room of your house if you if you are in a room right now where there's a door if you look in the bottom of that door you'll probably notice there's about this much underneath the door where um air can get through that's what you want to block with the towel so that nothing comes through so the towel is going to be on the outside of the door the the ozone chamber is going to be inside the bathroom you're going to turn the ozone on inside the bathroom you're going to put it at about vanity level so that it circulates evenly through the room you're going to turn off any air conditioning and any heat if you can if you can't let's say you're in an apartment complex and it's central air and heat you're not going to be able to go in and like oh hey can like everyone in the building turn off their air well while i use the ozone you're not going to be able to do that right nor nor should you so um one of the things that i've linked to below are magnetic vent covers and the typical vent you'll if you look there's probably one in every room by builders code there has to be a vent in every room so there's probably one in a small room there are probably two or three in a large room and so one of the things that we want to do is we want to put a magnetic piece over the top of that vent just to block it and when you put them up near the vent or on a floor vent it usually smacks on and there's a lot of metal there so it holds it in place the ones that i've linked to are i believe they are uh 13 by eight or something and the average vent is five and a half by 12. so this is going to over over cover it it's going to do its job and then if you have a big big vent you may want to put two of them on there just to cover the central air so that if the central air is on it's just going to block those while you're doing the ozone thing and that's going to protect you it's going to protect the smells circulating through the house because there's nothing worse than having a really strong bleach smell and then really strong ozone smell while you're trying to clean somewhere else in the house that that too will make you sick so we don't want to do that uh let's see uh we have we've got so many folks here hi glide and glow hi denise hi nick smokey wins anna violatex uh juliet you guys i'm so excited that you came to spend some time with me today this is so cool and i just i really appreciate your comments and thank you maryland as well okay so one of the things that i want to talk about is if you are inside the shower there's one more thing i want to mention when we talk about towels and it is um terry cloths we're going to use terry claws and i use the white ones especially if i'm doing bleach for the the fact that uh if for any reason i spill something it's white this goes back to the the conversation about having a white t-shirt if you're using a white terry cloth it's not going to stain as bad when you step out of the shower if for any reason you stepped on something in the shower and you stepped out whatever you step on is going to be the customer's floor we want to make sure that before we do the process we remove the bath mat take it outside of the bathroom we don't want to risk getting any bleach whatsoever on the customer's bath net where the shower is when you step out of the shower you're going to step out onto your terry cloths and so now you've got your shoe covers on and you're stepping onto a terry cloth that's going to absorb anything so that if you step out on the customer's floor you're not going to get any gunk on the customer's floor i do recommend before you leave the bathroom that you take those shoe covers off and then when you go outside the bathroom that you get another set of shoe covers for the rest of the customer's house we don't want to risk at all under any circumstances having gotten bleach on the bottom of your shoes and then tracking it anywhere in the customer's house because you are responsible again it's in your care custody and control and if you use bleach you're 100 responsible for whatever happens so if you have to wipe up any bleach and i'm not kidding even wiping up even wiping up the bottle the side of the bottle if some spilled on the side of the bottle and you have to wipe it up you want to make sure that it is a hundred percent wiped up before you take this bottle and put it back inside your cleaning caddy you do not want to stain your cleaning caddy you don't want the bottle to leak anywhere in the customer's house so if you've used this bottle to spray bleach in a customer's house you're going to want to rinse the bottle from head to toe and then dry it off with a terry cloth and that way you're covered and then there are no surprises so as part of the training that we do for all of our employees or if you're an airbnb host and you work in airbnbs you want to do the same process there's nothing worse than having a really nice dark carpet in a bedroom right off the side of the bathroom and then you walk out with your supplies and you leak bleach on it or something and then you got to buy them a new whatever it is a new carpet a new rug a new whatever so it it's your responsibility you got to be super careful all right let's see do i have any questions about the products that we've talked so far denise says yes please don't mix bleach with fumes like ammonia it's toxic and deadly i think that goes without saying but i'm so glad that denise brought that up we don't mix anything with bleach ever we don't mix anything with bleach ever let me say that again we don't mix bleach with anything ever okay so you can dilute bleach and we use the word dilute you can dilute bleach with water and that's technically mixing but we're going to use the word mixing we don't mix with anything because we want to know and we want all of our employees to know that mixing bleach like denise said can be deadly and every single year there are house cleaners and homeowners that go to the hospital because they've mixed bleach with something because in the back of their mind oh it did such a great job with this and this does such a great job over here if i mix them it will be twice as good right not twice as good twice as stupid and i have to say that because we are not for the most part we are not chemists and i'm really really keen on this you if you are not a chemist and you did not go to school for chemistry and you are not in a lab situation where it's a controlled environment where they have eye wash stations and they have you know emergency ventilators and all this kind of stuff to protect you if something goes wrong you have no business no business guessing on your own like oh this is this is not like cooking where you're mixing a couple of ingredients together we're talking about really specific varieties of chemicals that have been tested in controlled environments for a very specific task okay and so with that in mind we have to we have to respect the bleach which is very very very strong i love the clorox company for the the things that they've done i just want to stop and give them a shout out uh during the pandemic uh clorox had to kind of retool all of the stuff that it was doing and it became a pandemic awareness about cleaning sanitizing and disinfecting and the clorox company went to task and they started producing clorox and bleach in 55 gallon drums because 155 gallon drum would clean 14 000 hospital rooms and the hospitals were overwhelmed with people that were rushing to the hospital because of the of the covet virus and so because of that their attention was how do we serve and so in a place where it was tough i mean remember in the at the beginning of the pandemic how nobody nobody could get cleaning supplies you would go to a store and there would be like nothing nothing there's nothing there you couldn't get the cleaning supplies because the shipments had stopped so all of the the chemical uh products that they used to make clorox and all the stuff that they all the all their processing had come to a grinding halt as well and they were paying exorbitant fees to try to to stay in mass production and create the stuff that they normally do and so they were charging the same prices they weren't doing any price gouging whatsoever and they were working overtime literally around the clock 24 7 to try to provide enough clorox that it would support the the people that were doing all the disinfecting and all the cleaning and all that stuff and so i really applaud them because they jump through enormous hoops that cost them millions of dollars in order to be able to satisfy that need and granted they're a public company i mean they're they're here to make money but the things that they did went so far above and beyond just regular customer service and to be able to just ship out these big 55 gallon drums to help the hospitals and to try to keep everything sanitized to protect our health so i'm a really really big fan of the company and i love the fact that even though they have this very strong chemical that they were able to provide service now one of the things that's really cool about the clorox company because we got asked a lot of questions during the pandemic about can i use this on my hardwood floor to disinfect my hardwood floor guys can we have a conversation for a second about hardwood floors why are you disinfecting it like most people don't eat off their hardwood floor like the hardwood floors for walking on and if you walk inside a house and you take off your shoes for the most part and you're wandering around your own house um you shouldn't have like really dirty floors and if you do you can sweep and mop them but we don't need to be spraying bleach on our hardwood floors and during the pandemic i saw so much property damage of people that used bleach the wrong way i got calls from churches and they said you know people came in and they sprayed bleach all over the wood like where people put their hands when they kneel down to pray or the racks where the the hymnals are um they said they sprayed them on the the cloth which are those velvet pews and then they would leave it on for 10 minutes hoping that it would disinfect and it ruined i mean bleach is bleach it's gonna bleach it's gonna take the color right out of that but it did it bleached the pews it ruined the velvet it ruined the wood it ate through the varnish on the church pews the church benches they mopped the floors with bleach i mean you're not gonna believe the kind of property damage there were people going inside office buildings and for the few people that were still working before the the stay-at-home mandates there were people that were spraying like these really nice office desks with bleach and leaving it on there for 10 minutes it would just eat through the varnish and then like they're like oh no what did i do and then the offices would call me and the churches were calling me and i'm like well the good news is your your cleaner is insured right i'm sure like you hired a reputable cleaner and they're like oh no like the church was like no no we had parishioners that volunteered and then i was like oh no this is on you i mean like you're not you're not covered right and as a as a cleaner we had to have like these emergency conferences and tell all of our cleaners this is in your care custody and control and if it comes out of your spray bottle and you are paid to be the cleaner you are also being paid to know how this works and this is the reason why i say bleach is a special project it requires special training special equipment and i mean you're going to be bringing with you stuff that we don't bring to our normal jobs right if you're going to be doing an ozone job you're going to be bringing with you special equipment and so for that you should charge a special fee and if we do a special project like if we have a couple of showers that we're doing we'll just bundle those together and we'll add that maybe to the first cleaning but that's going to be an extra 100 or so to come in and treat that whole shower but it's going to cost them a hundred dollars anyway because if you don't use the bleach then when you come in you got to get your little scrub brush and what are you going to use cleanser or something and then you're going to have to clean that and it's going to take you an hour an hour and a half to do it anyway right so you might as well do the first time and kill those micro organisms that you find with the pink slime and the mold and all that stuff i'd rather treat the customer the right way give them the right kind of cleaning and then they might have to pay a little bit more but they're going to pay a little bit more anyway right if it takes you an hour and a half to clean their shower why not have it just take the normal amount of time but you you cleaned it the right way and you were able to kill that bacteria so that's my that's my that's how i feel about that ah okay so i've got a couple of comments here hi jay hi romy denise you guys it's so good to see you on a saturday morning this is fun uh violet violet xoxo xoxo says uh people today think you can just use bleach for everything scary how people go bananas using it that's true that's true it is it is scary how people think it's good for everything and like i said it's a maintenance i mean it's a special project and then we do maintenance cleaning after that so i get asked the question a lot especially if we've done a a deep clean on a shower which is a special project and we use the bleach i get a lot of questions where people say um after the bleach how do i maintain the shower and it comes down to training your customers how to clean their showers properly and so whether it's a bathtub or whether it's a shower that has a glass door that we have to squeegee at the bottom uh one of the things that i recommend and i'm i'm a really big fan of this there's a product and it's a mallory um do i have one here i do check it out i have one here if it is a scrub sponge that has a nylon net over the top of it and then on the other side it has a squeegee and this has a really long handle i'm not a fan of the long handle but this is the only way i can find it this is actually found in the automotive department and this is designed for getting bugs off the windshields of cars now sometimes you'll go to a gas station and in the little thing with the water in it you see these this is phenomenal and this is the best tool that i've ever seen for cleaning your bathroom shower and then squeegeeing it down and so i've linked to this below and here's how i use it i grabbed the one that i hope this is not gross i grabbed the one from my bathroom this morning and it's older so it's kind of a little bit you know used and it's wet but um what i did is i just took a pipe cutter and i just cut the the handle in half so that it's more user friendly for my shower okay and so what what i do then after i am ready to replace it like if i'm ready to replace it it just unscrews like this so then i can unscrew the short little handle and i don't have to keep recutting it because i can only get it you can only buy it with the long handle anyway um this is phenomenal so going back to the question we had about the soap scum how do you get rid of the soap scum hang on i just dropped this there it disappeared and i'm back i use in the shower dawn dish soap so this is what don dish soap looks like most of you are familiar with it i know in the european continent it's called fairy so fairy or dawn this is what we use and i love the blue stuff i think it's just great i i have added to the links here also a pump container and it doesn't matter what kind of pump container that you use any kind of pump container will work um but i think it should be clear and this is my own personal preference for this reason i can always see at a glance how much i have am i getting close am i getting down to the bottom you know i can see if i can see it's also um anybody that's in the shower and this one goes in my shower so i'm the only one that's there if you share a shower with someone else you may want to put a label on it so they know what it is and put the the tape over the front of it so that other people would know that um what it is right because that's just chemical safety wise but i like the clear container for this reason so after a shower this is how you do a maintenance clean on a shower after you've already done the bleach you just put a little couple of drops on the top here while your shower is wet this goes back to the concept of uh you know how when you soak a pot and pan like it has gunk it's caked on the bottom of it and it's not coming off with the scrubby and how you like fill it up with hot soap and water and you put dish soap in it this is the same concept so you're inside the shower it's hot it's steamy you've got nice hot water in there and it's been going for a couple of minutes everything in the shower is loose so if you have a whole shower door full of soap scum a little bit of dish soap on the side and this is a sponge with a scrubby but it's not going to scratch the glass so then you can use this and go back and forth along the sides of the shower glass and you want to go up and around the corners and around the handles and because this is a scrubby it's not going to scratch but you can also go around the hardware you remember how in the video i said don't use the bleach on the hardware which is going to be your faucet your shower head on a hose the metal rim around the doors we don't want to use bleach on that because it will eat away the finish we don't want to do that but you can with this go up and down all the hardware and around the faucet you can grab the shower head on a hose and go up and down on both sides and clean it with the soap just imagine if it was a pot in a pan and you were using dish soap so it's like the scrubby with the dish soap has the same exact effect and the dish soap is a degreaser so back to the question about the soap scum it removes the soap scum so for regular everyday cleaning you just clean the walls with the soap and your sponge then you use the shower head on a hose and you hose the entire shower down when you're done with that you turn the squeegee over and then you just squeegee the walls now your shower looks brand new and when you get to a customer's house the customer has done this process the showers are going to be super easy to clean and if we train our customers to do that it's going to save them a lot of money because it's not going to take us a half hour every single time we come to their house to clean their shower and so with this this is safe for use on fiberglass it's safe for ceramic tile if you have like a ceramic tile shower like the one we saw in the video it's safe for shower glass it's just phenomenal so while this was designed for automobiles and the bugs and the tar and stuff it's fantastic for showers and so i'm a really big fan of this all right so with that um i think i think i've covered everything i didn't cover everything oh my goodness i forgot okay i have one more thing to tell you when we get out of the shower and we've already done the whole process with the bleach and we use the ozone generator and then we left for a little bit i forgot to tell you what happens when we come back when we come back into the bathroom we're not going to mix remember how we said we're not going to mix bleach with anything there's residue of bleach in that shower because we just sprayed the whole entire shower from top to bottom with bleach so there are still there's still residue of bleach we're not going to be bringing in any other chemicals to put inside that shower okay not cool so what's going to happen is when we come back in the room is going to smell nice it's not going to smell like bleach it's not going to smell like ozone we've been gone for a couple hours we cleaned the rest of the house we're going to come back in now everything's going to be sort of tidy like all the gunk in the in the shower is pretty much going to be gone it's just gonna look like oh no somebody was in here and they did some weird stuff and now they left right you're gonna remove the towel remove the the things that are sitting in front of the shower you're gonna remove the bleach you're gonna remove you're gonna pour the bleach back into the container you put all your stuff away and that goes in a special kit okay you're going to put all that stuff back away inside that kit you're also going to bring a steamer this is a handheld steamer it's one of my favorites this is the bissell steamer and this steamer is really great for a whole lot of non-chemical cleaning and i like to use it in addition to the bleach because it's just steam we're talking about just water to combat whatever we just did inside the shower okay so the bleach is going to get most of it out we're going to come in with our steamer now this steamer i love this steamer for a couple reasons it comes with this kit and this kit has 25 attachments in it and it has everything from the attachments that you use for the barbecue grill to the grout brushes that you use if you're doing grout i showed you one of the grout brushes inside the video but it has just a whole bunch of attachments this also has the attachment that the little bonnet goes on that i showed you inside the video where you can use it to remove soap scum with nothing but the steam and a couple things about the steam we're just going to use regular water we're not going to use vinegar in here we're not going to use essential oils we're not going to use anything but water and i get asked this question a lot because i don't know people are tempted to add other stuff the steamer is designed to remove 99.9 percent of bacteria with just the steam it's the heat of the water that makes it so sanitary right it's like boiling something remember back in the days where a kid would drop the the binky or the pacifier on the floor and we would boil it in water the reason we did that is because the boiling of the water would disinfect and it would it would kill the germs by the time the kid is one why you just pick it off the floor you blow it off and you give it back but in the beginning when they're new we would boil them so that there's no germs right this goes along the same concept and the thing that i like about this unit is because it's just water um we're not mixing anything it's it's easy to use when you're done with the job and you dump the water out we always store it with the door open and that way the air can circulate and dry it out so that it doesn't build bacteria inside our reservoir okay so a couple rules about using a steamer and this has a really long cord one of the reasons i really like this unit it has a super long cord so that i don't need to bring a extension cord an extension cord with me on the job but the other thing that i like about that steamer and i just happen to have this with me is it also has another adapter where you can use it as a regular mop and this just pops off so that you can use this and attach this to the handheld unit so if you have to go up to the top of the shower and you're going to steam off you remember how you've probably seen some of these these online hacks where there's like gunk on a shower head and people take like vinegar and they put it in a bag they try to tie a twisty around it and leave it overnight this is all kind of weird stuff if you're using a steamer and this is a great way to do this you just attach this to the steamer head it goes something like this and now you have a long stick so it allows you in a tall shower even to go up to the top of the shower head on a hose or the shower head and you can steam that and just by steaming it you can remove all of the gunk so it's a seamless process then when you go to mop the floors there's a little tongue and groove here and the tongue and groove just fits right inside here i don't know if you can see it but anyway it just goes like this and once it snaps in place you hook that on and then you can go ahead and you can mop and steam like your ceramic tile floors and again no chemicals are required and so this you can use is either a damp mop a dry mop or a steam mop and so i love it for that fact because a lot of times like if you have hardwood floors or you have luxury vinyl plank flooring and you don't want to use steam because of course you don't want to use it unless you absolutely have to for like dog puke or you know whatever um this gives you the opportunity to to do that clean up with the damp or the dry mop and so there are lots of opportunities for using it but i love the steamer because it has so many uh different utilities and the steamer we do carry on a regular maintenance job with us we do carry this with us but it's also one of our best and favorite tools for the special projects that we do because like if a customer wants you to to clean out their freezer when you unplug the freezer you've got five to eight hours of defrosting before it's actually gonna um make itself you know what do you call it defrosted and so you can go in here after it's unplugged and don't hit the coils directly but you can hit all the areas in the shelves around it and the as it drops it's going to air out all that other area and you can do it in about i don't know a tenth of the time so we use this for a lot for the the defrosting of freezers and stuff like that you can also use it on ovens inside ovens if there's somebody with chemical safety uh chemical sensitivities you can also use this for that uh in the video you saw we also used it to clean up the rest of the shower if there's any residue in the shower after we've already rinsed it come in we're gonna rinse the shower with the shower head on a hose then we're going to use our steamer for the last little bit of whatever we have to do in that shower to get it clean so for using bleach bleach when you absolutely have to make sure that you take your precautions and make sure that you're wearing your personal protective equipment make sure that when you come into to do the after cleaning when you get ready to do the actual cleaning because again bleach is not a cleaner it's a disinfectant what you're going to do then is you're going to just going to use your steamer and that way you can use any of the attachments that we have that will do the job for what you need so if you decided before you started the job that you have um that you have some mold or something on the walls you may want to go over it with a steamer attachment that is designed and this is what this looks like that it's designed for the grout so that it just gently removes all of that and it steams it and disinfects it as as you go so let's see we've got uh some questions here and i wanna i really wanna make sure that i get all these answered uh jay said i had to report our housekeeping depart for spring bleach in the air after cleaning a room in my hospital oh that's not cool i'm sorry that that happened again it comes down to just being aware there are a lot of people that don't know the rules i know during the pandemic we had a lot of people that didn't know the rules and so they were they were using and misusing bleach and uh back the back back to the clorox company they made sure that during the pandemic when people were spraying bleach on floors and leaving them on floors they came up with a clorox wipe it would go right over like a swiffer duster for example and it fit the swiffer dusters perfectly so you can use existing tools that are out on the market they weren't even selling new tools this was just stop whatever you're doing you know with mopping with the bleach and use these wipes that have a limited amount of chemicals on them and it's it's not a bleach um it wasn't a bleach situation but it was like 99.9 sanitizing of the floors and we determined that that was good enough because for most people 99.9 was sufficient for flooring unlike jay we're not doing medical procedures on our hardwood floors in our homes for the most part and so i mean i hope not at all unless you know i i hope not at all so these these tools that we use it comes down to are you are you working smart not hard and are you learning the proper tools and techniques and so that's what this whole um dog and pony show is today to let you know about the the proper ways that we're using this all right i want to open this up for questions do we have any other questions here um i i see lots of people saying hey how you doing and hey how you doing back uh nestor and denise and uh pam pam says could you please explain the difference between clorox anywhere hard surface cleaner pet friendly which i can't find anymore and clorox hard surface cleaner commercial grade uh so i don't know without looking at the safety data sheets the specifics between those two products and one of the things that i want to pay attention to is clorox can only be used on sealed surfaces and so it's not designed for porous surfaces and so how do you know if you have a sealed surface so if you take some water and you spray it on a surface like let's say that you spray it on a porcelain sink and it beads up on the porcelain sink it doesn't sink in then you know you have a sealed surface and it's okay to use the clorox spray and the clark spray would be the dilution version that we're using inside a spray bottle and this is three one ounces to 32 ounces of water so we're diluting it and that would be the equivalent of one of the ready-to-use sprays and that's something you need to be aware of if you go to a store they have concentrates and they have ready to use when i buy a gallon of bleach like this this is a concentrate and so this is what we're talking about diluting and so diluting this is we're not going to use it full strength except in those icky showers and exactly how i explained it that's the only way we're going to use it and for the rest of everything else that we use it for i think it's going to be a diluted version um if you buy a ready-to-use spray you're going to go in and there's like a spray with a fancy bottle and it says clorox bathroom spray or something that's a diluted version it's going to be the equivalent of the three pumps and the rest of it is water so you're mostly paying for water and they have different varieties some smell like you know lavender some smell like lemon they have different scents that some are made for the bathroom some are stronger what i recommend is that you read the labels and then you make sure you only use it on what it says because here's something that most people don't know when you use a cleaning chemical and you use it as is directed by the manufacturer you're good and if you use it for other things and i see a lot of tick-tock hacks don't get me started on tick-tock hacks but i see tick-tock hacks where people are like mixing chemicals and stuff and they're using it inconsistent with the way that the manufacturer intended it not only can that be toxic but if it ruins the surface or it plugs the toilet or it ruins whatever it's not under warranty it will completely void the warranty on whatever you have whether it's flooring whether it's an appliance whether it's the fridge a sink a stove a cabinet a countertop whatever if you use the products inconsistent with the the manufacturer's specifications they will not they will not stand good for it they're not responsible and so don't try to call them and say oh i used your product and it ruined sentences you're supposed to know better so um yeah please don't use the tick tock hacks most of them are just for entertainment only and i hope that nobody ever gets hurt from the damage that's caused by those all right so i i said that okay let's see do we have any other comments here uh someone's here said to mix bleach with thick toilet cleaner and leave it to sit on grout uh no we're not going to do that i don't know who said that but we're not going to do that we just agreed as a as a collective group that we're not going to mix bleach with anything we might dilute it with water only but we're not going to mix it with anything we're certainly not going to mix it with toilet bowl cleaner one of the things that we have to be painfully aware of and this goes back to the ph scale again 7 is neutral all the way over to the side the zero are the acids and all the way over the other side we have 14 which are the alkalines when you mix a product like clorox this is a number 12 and a half and you mix it with something all the way over to the other scale that's an acid and it does clorox does react to acids and so what happens is you are creating toxic cis situations where either the fumes are going to be so strong they'll knock you out and i promise you this there are people that are hospitalized every day for making stupid things like that and i say stupid because they're really really really stupid decisions please do not mix chemicals do not mix it with toilet bowl cleaner toilet bowl cleaner is a one or a two on the complete opposite end of the scale and while you think it might cancel each other out because it neutralizes you know acids to alkaline the mixtures are so toxic they can be fatal and so if if i could implement or impart one piece of wisdom do not mix anything with bleach bleach bleach is very very powerful all on its own it doesn't need anything else the only thing it needs is extreme caution got it okay cool all right do you guys have any other questions uh if not i'm gonna let you guys get back to your day i loved spending my saturday morning with you and we're gonna do this again next week so that we can cover new tools and and answer some of your questions there so if you have any questions now is the time to ask them jump in here tell me what you have to say uh violet so excellent says people today think you can just use bleach for everything oh i already read this one this was awesome yes it's true and no you can't please don't uh denise said i think spring bleach in the air was to fake people out into thinking it was cleaned at all a lot of people do that they'll spray stuff with a strong chemical smell and i want you to be careful please be careful with chemicals if you're in the house cleaning industry as long as i have been 20 30 years your body has chemical sensitivities and you have to be really painfully aware that there's only one version of us so please protect your lungs please i know i know for a couple of years it's been really unpopular to wear a mask and there have been people that have been really polarizing on both sides of it like you know we've been wearing masks for 30 years and this was long before the pandemic if you're using strong chemicals please wear your masks it has nothing to do with a pandemic and everything to do with your lungs protect yourself and if you're going to use like a really strong fume like for an oven cleaner for example which is on that side of the uh the ph scale really close to the top and super strong you're going to need an ozone generator for that room when you leave you don't want the family coming home smelling a whole house full of fumes that are going to affect their lungs right like let's protect each other let's take care of ourselves and let's protect each other all right that's it for today i'll let you guys get back to your saturday thanks again so much for joining me i've really really enjoyed our time together and like i said we'll do this again next week all right with that um that's it see you soon you",
