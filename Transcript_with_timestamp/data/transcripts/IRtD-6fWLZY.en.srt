1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,049
hey everybody rob greenfield here and

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,020
today I'm gonna share with you some of

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,389
the most easy and abundant foods to grow

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,309
for those of you that are in a colder

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,250
climate so this applies to people across

6
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,470
much of the northern United States

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,080
northern Europe and around many climates

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,970
around the world so if that fits you and

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,680
you want to grow a lot of food in your

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,960
garden and have a lot of food on your

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:38,940
table then this is definitely the video

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:41,520
for you a lot of you know me for my year

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,260
of growing and foraging 100% of my food

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,450
we're literally everything that I ate

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,239
for a year was either from my garden or

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,160
foraged but I did that in Florida in a

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,219
very hot climate where I could grow food

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,530
year around a lot of people saw what I

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,000
did and they thought oh you can only do

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,180
this because you're in a warm climate

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,640
but the truth is warm climate called

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,700
climate as long as you work within your

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,960
region you can grow an incredible amount

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,369
of food and a lot of the most

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,310
self-sufficient people that I've ever

26
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,189
met live in cold climate places like

27
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,200
Wisconsin or Ohio or New York so there's

28
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,270
so many foods that you can grow it's

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,520
just about growing what grows well and

30
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,030
abundantly in your area so when I'm

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,100
talking about easiest and most abundant

32
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:29,729
easiest means they grow really well it's

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,740
hard to kill them even if you have what

34
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,509
you can Center a black thumb there's a

35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,369
good chance you'll be able to grow these

36
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,909
and walk away feeling like you have a

37
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,610
green thumb and then abundant means that

38
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,680
they produce a lot of food but there's a

39
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,049
second part to that and that is that

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,670
they produce a substantial amount of

41
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,799
food on your plate and that they'll

42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,810
actually be able to fill yourself up and

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,060
fill your pantry up to get through the

44
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,520
winter because that's the key in the

45
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,460
colder climates if you want to grow a

46
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,250
large portion of your food it's that you

47
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,530
produce as much as you can during those

48
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,310
growing months during the growing season

49
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,610
and then you store it in jars in

50
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,110
freezers dehydrating it and such in

51
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,750
order to be able to make it through the

52
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,270
winter

53
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,460
with the food from your garden so these

54
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,410
foods are gonna help you drastically

55
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,730
reduce the number of times that you need

56
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,420
to go to the grocery store and

57
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,010
drastically increase the nutrition and

58
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,610
the abundance that you're getting

59
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:34,120
straight at home or on your farm right

60
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:38,650
where you are I have to start with the

61
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,810
potato one thing that a lot of people

62
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,300
have the hardest time with is calories

63
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,100
now I wanted to show you this potato in

64
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,080
particular it might look crazy too a lot

65
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,780
of you but this is a potato that has

66
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,660
been stored in the pantry for about six

67
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:56,350
or seven months now I'm in southern

68
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,930
France and it's mid-may and this was put

69
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,590
into the pantry in around October or

70
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,470
November

71
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,290
so these store for a very long time so

72
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,410
as far as your calories go potatoes are

73
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,120
gonna be one of the most calorie dense

74
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,910
producing a large bulk of your food and

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,510
they store really well so this knocks

76
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,680
out two really important things and the

77
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,480
potatoes that are left over that you

78
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,000
don't eat this one right here

79
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,489
could be planted to produce more so that

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,530
is the wonderful potato the second one I

81
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:29,230
want to share with you is pumpkins and I

82
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,489
am in love with pumpkins not just the

83
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,920
ones you see that you make

84
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,350
jack-o'-lanterns out of there's many

85
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,810
different shapes colors and sizes of

86
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,000
pumpkins this is just a beautiful one at

87
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,709
the farm that I'm staying at pumpkins

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,019
are amazing because they store a really

89
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,709
long time again it's May and this is

90
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:49,900
from the last season and it's just as

91
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,720
good as can be and you can also eat the

92
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,060
seeds you can eat the skin in a matter

93
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,579
of fact I will take the entire thing

94
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,850
except the stem and blend it up into a

95
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:04,450
soup so pumpkin and different winter

96
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:08,200
squashes they provide a lot of

97
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:10,690
sustenance nutrients and a lot of them

98
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,560
are very easy to grow grow the ones that

99
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:17,680
are adapted to your climate now next I

100
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,220
want to share summer squashes so

101
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,810
zucchini this actually is more of a

102
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,830
winter squash but it looks kind of like

103
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,100
a summer squash so I'm using it now

104
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,950
zucchini

105
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,450
these are truly amazing I've traveled

106
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,090
through Washington through Wisconsin

107
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,250
through New York all across the northern

108
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,650
United States and people tell me that

109
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,840
they have so many zucchinis that they

110
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,090
have to try to give them away but they

111
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,250
can't because everybody has so many of

112
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,050
them they get huge you can eat him when

113
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,670
they're giant or you can eat them when

114
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,900
they're small if you want them to be

115
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:54,970
more tender so zucchinis are a a must

116
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,700
for a huge amount of sustenance and

117
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,400
being extremely easy to grow the next

118
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,760
one I want to talk about is beans and

119
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,460
beans are truly incredible you can

120
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,800
either eat them fresh right off of the

121
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,740
vine or the bush there's there's pole

122
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,720
beans and there's bush beans you can eat

123
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,560
them fresh you can wait for them to dry

124
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,540
on the vine to have dried beans like you

125
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,130
would buy at the store like your pinto

126
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,670
beans or your black beans or your

127
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:27,820
lentils or you can can them these are

128
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:30,400
canned ones for example and another way

129
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,130
to store them is freezing them so the

130
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,190
freezer is a really great way to store

131
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,350
food it generally costs only a few

132
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,540
dollars a month to run a deep chest

133
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:43,120
freezer and you can store a few hundred

134
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,240
pounds of food so again one of the most

135
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,300
important things in the colder climates

136
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,140
is storing the abundance canning is one

137
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,480
way to do that

138
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:56,860
freezing is another and then there's

139
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:59,020
also drying as well and then jams I'll

140
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,480
show those as well there's also the

141
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,640
pantry for things like potatoes and

142
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,140
carrots that can store in the pantry so

143
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,080
there's a lot of different ways to store

144
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:10,960
your food and that's the key beans are

145
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,060
very easy very abundant and I also want

146
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,240
to mention peas which are kind of my

147
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,130
runner up to beans but very easy to grow

148
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,260
for a lot of people some people have

149
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,320
problems with them and they're not

150
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,480
nearly as filling as beans but peas are

151
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,370
another really great crop as well all

152
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,560
right the next one is carrots this is

153
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,840
definitely a favorite for me although to

154
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,600
be honest I just love all foods that

155
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,300
grow really abundantly and easily I mean

156
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,810
so this is a great video for me to be

157
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,600
filming because this is my passion

158
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:46,380
but carrots now these carrots have been

159
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,270
stored in boxes of sand in a cold pantry

160
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,030
again these have been stored for about

161
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,970
six months so they're not your fresh

162
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:58,230
super crisp ones but let me give this a

163
00:06:53,970 --> 00:07:02,480
bite that's still pretty crunchy and

164
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:05,280
these are about six months stored well

165
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:10,260
it's actually uh Wow they're even sweet

166
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:13,290
still nice not as flavorful is some

167
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,169
carrots that I've had but sweet so these

168
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,930
can be stored they can be canned as well

169
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,480
I love to make carrot juice I mean

170
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:23,040
that's one of my favorite things so

171
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,200
carrots that's an important one and I

172
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,860
want to mention with carrots beets now

173
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,990
for a lot of people beets are super easy

174
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,310
some people beets have been a challenge

175
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,620
so I don't necessarily consider them the

176
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,750
most easy but I have to mention them

177
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,450
because they can be very abundant for

178
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:42,240
some people they're very easy but if you

179
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,770
grow beets you have to eat the greens if

180
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,140
you're wasting the greens

181
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,510
you're wasting some of the best

182
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,810
nutrients and taste they're one of the

183
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:53,729
most incredible greens if you ask me

184
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,090
they're they're absolutely my favorite

185
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:59,729
or one of my top favorite greens so

186
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:01,860
carrots and beets to continue on I want

187
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:05,400
to mention a few more root vegetables

188
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:08,039
and that would be radishes and turnips

189
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,510
so radishes are one of the easiest foods

190
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:12,060
to grow and you can actually harvest

191
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,700
radishes in about 30 days the small

192
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,610
radishes they're one of the fastest

193
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:20,340
growing crops that there are and you can

194
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:23,640
grow daikon radishes which get really

195
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:26,310
huge and I grew a lot of daikon radish

196
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,710
in Florida and then turnips turnips can

197
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:32,419
be pretty easy to grow as well they are

198
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:34,950
a nice root they go really well with

199
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,669
potatoes and beets and carrots baked

200
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,650
together

201
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,390
I love baked turnip living off of your

202
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,909
garden doesn't mean living without

203
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:45,839
flavor in fact it can mean a really

204
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:47,940
delicious garden full of flavor this

205
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,580
food can be grown right here and you can

206
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,020
harvest it within moments before you're

207
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,340
putting it on your plate so you can get

208
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,490
some of the most

209
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:59,910
delicious foods that you'll ever eat but

210
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,280
I really like in order to have that for

211
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,410
me there's some key ingredients onions

212
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,170
are one of them herbs are as well which

213
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:10,080
I'll get into pretty soon now onions can

214
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,800
be extremely easy I want to say that you

215
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,600
might have a hard time getting those big

216
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,790
giant onions that you would get at the

217
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,620
store that's not something that every

218
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,080
gardener or beginner gardener will be

219
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,910
able to get it's more likely that you'll

220
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,760
be able to be successful with small

221
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,400
bulbs and the other thing that's really

222
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,860
one of the easiest is bunching onions

223
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,680
and you can eat the greens now you can

224
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,600
eat the Greens of all onions as well and

225
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,140
actually if you eat just the right

226
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,840
amount you get a crop of green onions

227
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,080
and then a crop of the bulbs as well so

228
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,660
the smaller ones are generally easier

229
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:53,310
for beginner gardeners another one that

230
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:55,410
I want to mention is garlic now garlic

231
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,720
is super important to me it's a

232
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,000
wonderful medicine it adds an incredible

233
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,760
amount of flavor for some people they

234
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,230
found garlic to be super easy it's a

235
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,970
little bit more of a challenging one

236
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,070
because you plant it in the fall and

237
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,920
then harvest it in the late spring it

238
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:14,190
sits under the snow for the winter so

239
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,960
that makes it not quite the easiest it's

240
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,720
a little more challenging especially for

241
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,750
beginners but it can be pretty easy with

242
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,840
garlic this is a clove pop that in the

243
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,000
ground starts to sprout and then you've

244
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:30,150
got garlic now if you're not successful

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,410
with the bulbs you can grow it just for

246
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:36,780
its greens and you can get really really

247
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,630
productive abundant greens out of garlic

248
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,630
and they're very strong that was quite

249
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:45,030
strong just like garlic so onions and

250
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,280
garlic those are also extremely

251
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:50,640
important for preserving food when

252
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:53,640
you're canning and adding to soups

253
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,620
those really fill out the meal and add a

254
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,810
whole lot of flavor I want to talk to

255
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,060
you about greens now and greens are

256
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,290
where you get a lot of your nutrients

257
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,840
they're one of the things that makes the

258
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,790
most sense to grow locally rather than

259
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,370
having them be shipped they take up a

260
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,279
huge

261
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,410
amount of space and they really are just

262
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,720
one thing that does not make sense to be

263
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,300
shipping long distance so this is kale

264
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,980
right here and some of the beginner

265
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,580
greens that are really easy would

266
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:25,839
include kale arugula lettuce mustard

267
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:28,839
greens Swiss chard spinach and amaranth

268
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,290
those are seven of the easier ones to

269
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:31,120
grow

270
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,310
amaranth what's really special about

271
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,320
that is it's often self seeding and once

272
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,660
you get it going you'll have amaranth

273
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,510
coming back time and time again so

274
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:44,080
greens are one of the most nutrient

275
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:47,710
dense foods out there and if you can eat

276
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,930
greens every meal you are you have the

277
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:52,690
ability to change your life if you're

278
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,440
not eating healthy and they make a huge

279
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,100
difference

280
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,070
now greens are generally what you're

281
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,890
going to be eating during the the months

282
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,230
during the the growing season a lot of

283
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:08,610
people don't preserve their greens so

284
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:12,970
much you can and one of the greens

285
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:16,230
that's easiest to preserve is sauerkraut

286
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:19,029
so this here isn't exactly sauerkraut

287
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:22,120
this is more like preserved cabbage

288
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:25,540
sauerkraut though comes from cabbage and

289
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,320
you can store away jars and jars and

290
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:31,330
jars of sauerkraut it's just salt

291
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,490
cabbage and not even water and then you

292
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:35,500
can add in other things if you want like

293
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,740
herbs but literally just salt and

294
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:42,880
cabbage stores easily for through the

295
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:46,029
winter and it's delicious add so much

296
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,890
value to your meal the fermentation of

297
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:50,230
it through wild fermentation actually

298
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:52,660
increases the nutrient value of it

299
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:56,020
so cabbage is one that grows pretty well

300
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:59,709
stores and makes a really value-added

301
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:02,980
food to add to each of your meals can't

302
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:04,529
say enough about sauerkraut and if

303
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,900
you're interested in wild fermentation

304
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:11,320
check out Sandor Katz's book called wild

305
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,760
fermentation it is a must read if you're

306
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,950
going to get into the storing and

307
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,570
fermenting of foods alright next I want

308
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,430
to talk to you about herbs these add

309
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,050
incredible amount of flavor to your

310
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,990
meals you can make teas with

311
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:25,149
and they are often one of the absolute

312
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,160
easiest things to grow so some of the

313
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:32,019
herbs that I'm gonna mention are basil

314
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:35,410
dill cilantro oregano rosemary thyme and

315
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:38,110
mint here is basil this is being grown

316
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,700
in a greenhouse to get it started I want

317
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,589
to mention one thing about basil and

318
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,660
that's that it likes heat so this is

319
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:46,450
more of the peak of the summer if you

320
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,430
try to grow this while it's cold in the

321
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,410
beginning of the year you're gonna have

322
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,120
a really hard time and that's an

323
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:55,510
important thing growing the right things

324
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,790
at the right time of the year now

325
00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:01,630
another herb that I want to mention this

326
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:03,430
one is just I mean for a lot of people

327
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,640
it's a problem because it's so

328
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,860
successful and it reproduces so well

329
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,769
that it takes over a garden so when I'm

330
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:15,459
talking about easy and abundant mint is

331
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:17,800
the picture plant for that it reproduces

332
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:21,910
through these roots and they just spread

333
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,500
through the soil so all you have to do

334
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,260
is take some roots from a friend's

335
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,320
garden put those down and those will

336
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:32,500
produce mint so mint is is definitely

337
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,510
one of my top recommendations and it can

338
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,270
end up being a problem so if you do

339
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:39,279
plant it I mean for me when I was a

340
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:41,440
beginner gardener I said any plant that

341
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,620
becomes a problem is a friend of mine

342
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,600
and I still generally feel that way one

343
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,209
thing I want to mention about herbs and

344
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:54,660
that is some herbs grow really well from

345
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:57,550
seed like for example coriander cilantro

346
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:01,209
these are really great to plant from

347
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,640
seed now on the other hand mint is a

348
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:04,930
difficult one to start from seed so for

349
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,940
the ones that are difficult to start

350
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:10,930
from seed I would recommend buying those

351
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:14,350
as already started plants from your

352
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,779
local nursery or another gardener or a

353
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,930
plant sale or something of that sort so

354
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:21,970
herbs galore there are so many I just

355
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,190
named seven but there are a lot of other

356
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,750
easy herbs to grow as well now I want to

357
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,459
talk to you about fruit trees which are

358
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,829
totally different from a lot of these

359
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,449
crops most of these are annual crops

360
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:33,230
that you have to plant again and again

361
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:34,880
each year if

362
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,250
you can invest in fruit trees you're

363
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,610
investing in your future you can plant

364
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:43,100
fruit trees and now the thing is you are

365
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,440
investing in the future to start getting

366
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,150
a lot of apples might take a few years

367
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,190
before you get your first apples and

368
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:52,730
five years before you start to get a lot

369
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,180
but you'll have apples for decades to

370
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,240
come

371
00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:00,200
so fruit trees that I recommend apples

372
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,120
pears plums mulberries and cherries

373
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,750
those are some of the easiest ones to

374
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,700
grow in those more northern climates

375
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:11,120
apples can store just like this through

376
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:14,240
the winter you can freeze them you can

377
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,760
make jams there's so much that you can

378
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,800
do with your fresh fruits and you can

379
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,020
also just enjoy incredible amounts of

380
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,000
them during the season so fruit trees

381
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,830
are definitely a must

382
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,980
you can plant those around the edges of

383
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,990
the property and make use of that

384
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,580
vertical space with fruit trees it's

385
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,230
starting to rain here in the garden so I

386
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,240
got a cruise through these but we're

387
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,860
getting towards the end keeping along

388
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,560
the lines with fruits I want to mention

389
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,840
some berries raspberries and

390
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,990
blackberries generally are the easiest

391
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,900
and those can go crazy and become a

392
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:50,450
problem for a lot of people blueberries

393
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,830
on the other hand need acidic soil so

394
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:55,100
for a lot of people they are not a

395
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:58,280
beginner strawberries also can be pretty

396
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,530
easy however generally raspberries and

397
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,360
blackberries are more abundant than

398
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,100
strawberries so raspberries and

399
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,310
blackberries are my two biggest

400
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:09,140
recommendations for berries but I just

401
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,570
want to say there's a lot of other ones

402
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,540
out there gotta mention June berries

403
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:16,520
also called Saskatoon or service berries

404
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,000
are really great one as well right here

405
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,860
I am holding black berry chutney and

406
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,020
jams are an incredible thing to make out

407
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,080
of your raspberries or your blackberries

408
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,210
you can store lots and lots of jam so

409
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,000
that is a really really great thing

410
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:34,100
about those berries okay next thing I

411
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,460
want to mention is tomatoes tomatoes

412
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:40,160
grow super abundantly for so many people

413
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,020
and with tomatoes you can make huge

414
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,240
amounts of sauce I've just realized how

415
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,090
many times I've said huge and abundance

416
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,590
over the last 20 minutes or so but

417
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,600
that's what we're talking about plants

418
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:54,289
that produce a huge amount I just said

419
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,539
it again so tomatoes one that I

420
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:58,549
absolutely recommend in abundance at my

421
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:01,250
friend's house this weekend we just

422
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:03,679
planted over a hundred tomato plants for

423
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,529
a family of four it's a lot of tomatoes

424
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,110
but tomatoes are I mean most people love

425
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:12,230
them hot pepper is another one this is

426
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:14,000
something that can often grow in huge

427
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,450
abundance and be very easy

428
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,760
I took one seed from my friends serrano

429
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,130
pepper plant and that produced over a

430
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,710
thousand serrano peppers just from that

431
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,990
one seed another thing that I want to

432
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:30,440
mention sometimes this is a little bit

433
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:32,720
harder but cucumbers for making pickles

434
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,029
alright I've got two last ones for you

435
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,070
and these are perennials and with that I

436
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:39,380
want to mention that I really recommend

437
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,960
perennials these are plants that grow

438
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,970
for a year year after year after year

439
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,000
rather than things that you have to

440
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,919
plant each year like carrots so rhubarb

441
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,850
is one of the most incredible perennials

442
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:56,600
you plant rhubarb and about in a produce

443
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:59,029
for about twenty five years really

444
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,549
recommend rhubarb and then lastly we're

445
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:03,649
gonna finish it off with Jerusalem

446
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:05,750
artichoke also called sunchokes and

447
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:08,240
these are another one where if you don't

448
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,850
contain them they can spread through

449
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,580
your garden and they can become wild as

450
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,500
well they produce a huge amount I just

451
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,899
said huge again they produce an

452
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,590
incredible amount of food and they're

453
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:24,890
very tasty and I cook them basically

454
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:28,010
like a potato so there you have it that

455
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,770
is about 40 of my top recommendation for

456
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,840
the easiest and most abundant foods to

457
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,730
grow in your garden I just want to say

458
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,429
there's a lot more out there

459
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:40,399
I picked a lot of the common foods that

460
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:43,220
people have a lot of experience with and

461
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:45,500
and recognize because it's easier to get

462
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:47,380
started with that rather than plants

463
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,640
that you might never heard of like

464
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,909
gooseberries which grow well in northern

465
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,190
climates are like Moringa kale and

466
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:57,890
America took and Chaya which are more

467
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,960
southern climate so I just want to say

468
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,920
that I did kind of pick things that are

469
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,870
more known but there's

470
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,830
a lot of unknown foods that grow

471
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:09,230
extremely well I want to say try your

472
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:12,350
best to get your seeds locally locally

473
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:14,630
adapted seeds will grow much better in

474
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:17,000
your area because they are adapted to

475
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,880
that area and then buying your plants

476
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,320
from local nurseries that are using

477
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,600
varieties that have been grown in the

478
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,480
area for decades helps a lot

479
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,700
also for support join a community garden

480
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,470
if you you know feel like you have a

481
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,990
black thumb it would be incredibly

482
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:36,370
helpful to be around other people and

483
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:39,620
then also volunteer at farms and Gardens

484
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,750
that way you can be learning and you can

485
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:44,090
be helping at the same time and the

486
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,400
amount of knowledge that you gain by

487
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:48,710
volunteering at gardens and farms is

488
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,980
pretty priceless I hope that this video

489
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,840
has really inspired you to grow a lot of

490
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,300
food this year and the years to come

491
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,970
start small don't feel like you have to

492
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,730
grow all 40 of these crops this year and

493
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:03,170
add on each year as you start to get

494
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:04,670
better and better I'm excited for you to

495
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,340
get that there and start grow up some of

496
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,990
