00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,110
hi guys this is Megan from the blog

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,150
Wilson Thompson calm and today I want to

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,370
share with you guys some ideas of things

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,050
you can do before you have your

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,330
homestead do you have the home stink bug

6
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,549
but you are maybe still an apartment or

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,740
a city and you really can't do anything

8
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:17,730
but there is some thank you too

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,170
I'm going to share with you some ways

10
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,330
you can start and plan out your

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,650
homestead while you're still in any

12
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,539
situation that you're in there's so many

13
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:30,150
things that you can do before you're on

14
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:31,619
a ton of land to start homesteading when

15
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,620
we first got married we lived in an

16
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:38,070
apartment for the first year and I had

17
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,440
grown up right for the last like five or

18
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,210
more years of my life I had lived on

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,270
hope so did my parents and we raised

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:50,280
made me chickens and Barbados sheep and

21
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,530
we had milk goats laying hens and like

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,270
all these different things and so then

23
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,520
when I was in the apartment when we

24
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,989
first got married I had this really

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,520
strong urge to start homesteading but I

26
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,510
didn't think I could and then I started

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,859
learning about all these things that

28
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,769
really are home state but that you can

29
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,240
do in an apartment or anywhere so the

30
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,070
first thing you can do is to educate

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,880
yourself start reading everything that

32
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,380
you can get your hands on about

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,689
homesteading feet about gardening

34
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,040
orchards making a ultra types of farm

35
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,170
animals animals that complement each

36
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,360
other rotational grazing you can start

37
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,680
deciding what animals you would like to

38
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,850
have on your farm which ones will you

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,290
start out with make sure you are

40
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,759
knowledgeable about what kind of speed

41
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,380
that they'll need and minerals and

42
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,869
supplements and all the things that for

43
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,369
animals might also be a good idea to

44
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,259
read up on purchasing leave

45
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,030
dealing with wells lipstick pink and

46
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,320
housing options for books as you get

47
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,030
yourself on this enough so that when you

48
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,290
go to buy your dream homestead you know

49
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,119
what you're looking for and what you're

50
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,770
doing the next thing is use the space

51
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,950
you have to start I'm sitting now if you

52
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,619
have a really small backyard

53
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,329
space to garden or compost and probably

54
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:49,280
even raise some sort of small livestock

55
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:51,289
like chickens or rabbits or quail or

56
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,549
even some miniature goats I know that if

57
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:55,280
you're in a city it might be a little

58
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:56,840
frowned upon to have like goats bleating

59
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,460
in your backyard but rabbits are

60
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,710
something that's really really quiet I

61
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,679
think ylr - so depending on where you

62
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:06,219
are and how thick your ears are you can

63
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:08,539
find them nested extra quiet to have fun

64
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:10,310
we're an apartment then you can do some

65
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,590
container or vertical gardening you can

66
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,450
even do some countertop composting with

67
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,209
the focaccia box learn some home study

68
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,190
skills canning cheese-making sewing

69
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:21,829
cooking from scratch fermenting they

70
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:24,769
send your countertop things like kefir

71
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:26,510
and Kucha and we can start a bread there

72
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,519
is just a ton of things you can ferment

73
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,560
and I'm totally impossible you can learn

74
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,420
how to make buttermilk make your own

75
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,010
toothpaste there is pretty much just no

76
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,569
end to these amazing and practical

77
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,190
skills that you could be learning and

78
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:38,810
these skills are definitely going to

79
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,519
help you out when you are when you are

80
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,680
under homestead the next thing is to

81
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,209
create a budget are you saving for your

82
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,069
down payment on your dream homestead now

83
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,780
so that when something comes available

84
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:49,639
or you're in a position where you could

85
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,170
move that you're able to actually buy

86
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,480
something what about money for fencing

87
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,160
or animals or tools start living now by

88
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,019
creating a budget that allows for this

89
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,819
even if your homestead is years down the

90
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,530
road find a home setting mentor or

91
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,150
several mentors find someone that is

92
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,230
living the life that you want and ask

93
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,609
them if you can help out on our

94
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,720
homestead I learn about all the things

95
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:07,459
that they're doing they can teach you

96
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,350
all about planting gardens and

97
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,790
maintaining them in animal husbandry and

98
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,709
they could probably even help you with a

99
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,359
lot of the indoor skills like canning

100
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:15,470
this mentorship and having practice on

101
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,940
someone else's from said will give you a

102
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,980
really big head start create your own

103
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,109
there are so many people who possess a

104
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,760
wealth of knowledge about all of this

105
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:24,560
stuff and why not try to glean some from

106
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,370
them and then my last tip is to decide

107
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,900
where you want your dream

108
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,400
do you know where you want to settle

109
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,590
down what areas do you like the best

110
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,150
what areas have the best homesteading

111
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,769
land I know around here that there's a

112
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,090
lot of areas I have the key areas of

113
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:37,530
land but they're really Rockets they

114
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,209
would be the best for gardening unless

115
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,040
you're doing raised beds there's other

116
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,620
areas that have like the best pasture

117
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,150
land and rocky areas don't really make

118
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,220
the greatest pasture land as well as

119
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,480
treat areas good establish the community

120
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,890
as much as you can you can grow a

121
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,200
farmers market to meet all the different

122
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,330
local farmers and learn where their

123
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,769
homesteading and growing things and just

124
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,000
make sure that it's the right place for

125
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,900
you because once you start your

126
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,760
homestead you're going to want to say

127
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,829
that for a long time especially when

128
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,500
Xena guards planted animals are a little

129
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:07,110
easier to move by gardens thank you you

130
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,610
built all these reasons is that soil and

131
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,069
so I'm gonna just make sure that you are

132
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,629
ready for more permanently whatever

133
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:14,340
dream you have your mom said you can

134
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:16,169
totally start now there's so many ways

135
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,789
you could do it so I hope that this was

136
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:19,229
helpful to you guys for maybe some ideas

137
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:21,090
of things you can do now if you're

138
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:22,800
interested in learning about any more of

139
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,419

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,680
follow along because if I share of all

141
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:30,720

143
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:46,479
