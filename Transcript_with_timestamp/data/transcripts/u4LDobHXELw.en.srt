2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:11,250
we have a couple of questions but I sort

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,170
of tried I'd like to start with the some

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,350
of the points a few of our presenters

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,320
alluded to particularly about sample

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,350
custody and how quickly to get the

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,750
sample from the collection point to the

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,689
analysis and what does that if how does

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:36,870
that how important is this to the sample

10
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:39,780
eternity I mean if you'd like to get

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:45,770
started you know it definitely is

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:48,180
something to keep in mind I guess that

13
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,039
goes back to protocol you know some of

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,620
that just you know knowing that there is

15
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,289
probably gonna be some effect as you

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,460
maybe hold it or not but if you use it

17
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,930
consistently that's gonna help you out I

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,340
[Music]

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,159
banish to see what Carl in my cap you

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,840
know their market they might have some

21
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:12,420
Carl you well to acknowledge that when

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,250
you pull that manure sample out from the

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,840
rest of the manure you change it fireman

24
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,400
so it's going to start changing a little

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,200
different than the manure and the pond

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:32,640
is changing so that that's a concern but

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:34,799
I guess from my perspective I'm just

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,799
like my last slide where I had you know

29
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,070
that perfect sampling is not it's a

30
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,049
perfect sampling is unachievable but

31
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,579
good sampling is the process of getting

32
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:49,259
better over time so you know that's I

33
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:51,570
guess that's where I would put my focus

34
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,250
on is doing the best we can and

35
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,290
acknowledge there may be some

36
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,170
imperfections that are open for

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,990
improvements in the future so you know

38
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,930
go Roarke yeah I'll just I would just

39
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,149
add that that preference is is to get

40
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,780
that at least refrigerated as soon as

41
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,280
possible

42
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,209
don't leave it laying on the dash to

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,920
pick up for a week and then here we do

44
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:16,020
most of the samples come into the extend

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,500
in office where they're put into a

46
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:23,849
refrigerator transported to the lab once

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,430
a week and up here in Raleigh so so yeah

48
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,680
certainly it would be nice to put them

49
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,330
on on Ison or in it at least in the

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,069
cooler out of this direct sunlight until

51
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:37,160
you can get them refrigerated

52
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:39,540
yeah well the follow up on that is it's

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,370
recommended in Arkansas part of your

54
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,769
county office first as they wind you

55
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,780
when do you expect to be sipping a

56
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:48,840
mailing something out so you may want to

57
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:52,110
keep it refrigerator at home for a day

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,360
before you get it to any office and and

59
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,970
they'll they'll actually mail it out we

60
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,769
don't we don't have transportation for

61
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,470
texting mail to the center to the lab

62
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:06,120
let's be sure and label it appropriately

63
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:08,459
yes in your home refrigerator have a

64
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,660
specialized refrigerator and it having

65
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,140
my comment about when you fill the

66
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,360
bottles you pull them up 1/2 to 3/4 full

67
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,700
for I have 500 mil bottles of what we

68
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,709
use because you want to leave some room

69
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,290
for a good gas expansion you don't want

70
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:28,380
the tops to blow out and the post office

71
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,790
so there is one of the points that and

72
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,340
one of the questions raised is the

73
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,500
statistical analysis or sort of an idea

74
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,750
so variability in all of our

75
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,250
presentations today that variability is

76
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,019
the name of the game

77
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,180
so you're sampling you're trying to add

78
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:46,410
as many samples as you can to the

79
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,970
variability - so the good question

80
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,470
specifically what are the typical

81
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,530
statistical methods that you're relying

82
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,870
on in order to either analyze that

83
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:59,069
variability or to reduce that

84
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,780
variability in general so I kind of like

85
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:03,780
to start that a little bit so some of

86
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,120
the it's a personal experience some

87
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,560
people sampling has to do with just

88
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,910
increasing the number of samples and

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,720
seeing how that changes to me

90
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:16,079
essentially so that sort of almost like

91
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,760
a simulation where you're adding more

92
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,130
you're seeing how you are shifting the

93
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,530
mean typically this is how we reach the

94
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,470
to the rules of thumbs that we typically

95
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,660
have 8 to 10 samples and it varies

96
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,030
species to species but

97
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,670
I'm wondering any of the presenters if

98
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,370
they'd like to kind of contribute or

99
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:39,120
comment on this particular aspect of

100
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:44,280
mineral sampling well I'll just say from

101
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,470
a lagoon liquid standpoint the their the

102
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,770
the top water is relatively well mixed

103
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,690
and so it's not difficult for us to get

104
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,520
a representative sample simply by

105
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,530
walking around the lagoon and taking

106
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,840
grab samples but we also we're using

107
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,270
that same liquid that's being pumped

108
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,370
back to the barns to flush the barns so

109
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,520
most of our producers simply collect a

110
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,950
sample from the pipe as they're pumping

111
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,100
water back to the pits and that's and

112
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:14,730
plus there they are sampling relatively

113
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,760
frequently so they have a long-term data

114
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:21,090
set of lagoon analysis and it really

115
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,880
doesn't change significantly there is

116
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,130
some seasonal variabilities but it's not

117
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,600
a tremendous amount and the way the

118
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,360
records are done for their land

119
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,440
application it's essentially a checkbook

120
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,360
method that so they've got the fields

121
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,780
how much will they pump and then how

122
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,500
much the analysis for that so at the end

123
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,960
of the day when they entered all that

124
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,580
information in it comes out with a total

125
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,610
plant available nitrogen that's been

126
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:54,600
applied applied to that field now how I

127
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:57,480
would agree with mark that the top water

128
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,970
is fairly uniform and where I have my

129
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,330
concerns from a sampling of a holding

130
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:05,880
pond is where is the solids deposition

131
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,570
pattern because as the manure is

132
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,669
discharged into the pond from the pipe

133
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,680
there's a tendency to be right at the

134
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:16,590
end of the pipe there's kind of a clean

135
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,960
area where the flow of water flushes the

136
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:22,680
manure or solids away but then you start

137
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,320
getting a solids deposition in that area

138
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,050
and it's kind of a sweep then you move

139
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,780
farther away from the pond you'll have

140
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,850
the deposition will fall off and the

141
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,710
silence level will decrease of course

142
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,180
the whole ballgame changes the next time

143
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,120
they come in and they pump out or they

144
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,530
agitate so that's part of the sampling

145
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,520
process when you go around the

146
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:48,120
and why I like to use a clear PVC pipe

147
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,790
is that gives me an opportunity to

148
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,670
visually see that solid step and also

149
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:57,850
you can tell a lot just by the

150
00:06:53,670 --> 00:07:00,730
resistance to insertion with the probe

151
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:03,100
as you go in and one time that I've

152
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:08,170
sampled pretty regularly I make them I

153
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:10,720
have the advantage of their wonder kind

154
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:12,340
of dock kind of out in it so it gave me

155
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,060
an opportunity to walk out the end of

156
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,250
the dock carefully yeah get the samples

157
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,960
from there and that actually happened to

158
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:24,820
be towards the end of where they had a

159
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:26,650
solid accumulation typically that's one

160
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,950
of the nice things that with that the

161
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:33,700
survey the remote control boats and and

162
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:36,850
sonar in that picture that I showed if

163
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:40,390
you can see that where that sludge is

164
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:45,280
and where you need to be guide that

165
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:47,560
sampling yeah from a historical or time

166
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,320
trends so to speak and Carl's slide kind

167
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,990
of we had a question on this point but

168
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,400
also one of the slides you presented on

169
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:58,000
accumulated data between oh five and

170
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,390
2010 from Allah and I'd like to kind of

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,669
open that question to our panel here and

172
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:05,620
in terms of your observation so

173
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:09,520
anecdotally some of the values are

174
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:12,880
changing diet changes in genetics so

175
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,430
changes in the manual nutrient values

176
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,310
that you are seeing or observing or sort

177
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,080
of key takeaways on that front compared

178
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,810
to the typical book value that we have

179
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,229
established the the anecdotal on the

180
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:28,030
poultry side is yeah there's changes

181
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:30,220
over time because our poultry industry

182
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:33,099
has gone from rebuilding the house

183
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,140
completely every after every flock to

184
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,539
you may not read bed the house

185
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:40,479
completely if you know it may happen

186
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,580
every third year so just just the carbon

187
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,010
editions in extraction and litter

188
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,890
management has changed manure over time

189
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:50,560
on the liquids

190
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:53,230
I've had several occasions where I would

191
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,220
have an integrator a producer raising

192
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:58,000
for an integrator who

193
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,800
come names at Carl explain why my manure

194
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,250
used to be this way and now it's like

195
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,319
Hamlin oatmeal in this Daleks were the

196
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:08,139
only thing we configure is it was a diet

197
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:10,120
change of course the diet changes are

198
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:17,819
driven by the least-cost rations as well

199
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:21,819
as nutrient balance so Mort and I don't

200
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:24,699
have a lot of data to support it but

201
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:26,949
certainly anecdotally talking with folks

202
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:29,230
in the swine industry the feed rations

203
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:30,730
have changed and now as folks are

204
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:33,569
starting to clean out legumes we are

205
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,730
seeing there indications that that's

206
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:38,920
true and if you if you just start

207
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:42,279
stripping away layers you can see higher

208
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,069
concentrations of phosphorus zinc and

209
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:48,550
copper in the in that sludge so yes I

210
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:49,810
think there's evidence of that I think

211
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,970
we need to do a better job of

212
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,220
quantifying that and my mood and I've

213
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:58,089
talked about how do we do that and

214
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:01,000
setting up some sampling plugins sludge

215
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:04,209
sampling protocols to kind of try and

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,970
address that yeah I think the key

217
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:10,420
take-home wound justice discussion is to

218
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:13,300
just read the variability means you

219
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:18,639
really need to be developing a farm

220
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:20,829
specific database of what your sample of

221
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,689
what you're applying and really give

222
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,370
some thought in terms of what what are

223
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:27,850
you doing and why are you doing it and

224
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:30,930
what's the best way to do it well I

225
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,370
would say that also reinforces some

226
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,889
earlier discussion about sampling

227
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,709
beforehand because we've have had some

228
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:40,809
instances where folks a dredge sludge

229
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:43,949
put it out based on what they thought it

230
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:46,629
was going to be and based on their

231
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:48,459
initial sample turns out what they

232
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:52,209
actually dredge was different than that

233
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:54,970
and they've over applied both phosphorus

234
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:58,029
and copper zinc and a few few instances

235
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,550
and to the point that some folks are

236
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:05,490
reluctant very reluctant to accept

237
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,490
sludge application now on fields

238
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:13,279
well I'd like to thank our presenters

239
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:15,970
for this really informative material on

240
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,970
your sampling

241
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,379
