4
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:50,160
rice is an important staple of Southeast

5
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:52,470
Asian diets if you need a primer have

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,380
different variety they use their own

7
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,030
farm safety which is you don't know the

8
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,700
name we just call from one to another

9
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,120
farmer what duration more than hundred

10
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,620
days so far more can just only one cycle

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,250
cambodia has relied on a few traditional

12
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,720
varieties to take longer to mature to

13
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,780
improve yields the international rice

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,659
research institute or Erie has developed

15
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,340
a new variety for convenient armors this

16
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,500
race has been engineered to withstand

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,210
droughts

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,920
additionally it's shorter growth cycle

19
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,710
means farmers can plant and harvest

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,360
three times in growing season improving

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,680
output by 33%

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,720
I hope so it is the cop15 right key we

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,570
use the soft curation right key

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:41,010
and it's all its agent at us and it's

25
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:45,170
home above our three months well new

26
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:48,810
breakout rapidly dementedly high the

27
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:51,540
volatility figure find out insects haha

28
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,070
so it is a very good buy T because it's

29
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,460
not

30
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,200
you know it's a foot with those it's

31
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,790
none further protected to which human

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,760
deities can grow any time of the year

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:06,360
and also its types or duration and so

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,880
that we can save a lot of water in in

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,190
the Mekong River dirt Delta which is the

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,350
major rice producing area ninety percent

37
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,570
of what what is producing that region is

38
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,320
exported and this is exported to

39
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:21,300
Philippines Indonesia and to African

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,000
countries many of the writers writes

41
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,220
importing countries so it's very that's

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,140
why it's been its role in the regional

43
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,480
food security in Southeast Asia is very

44
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,790
important if something happens in that

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,920
region many countries will be affected

46
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,989
when it comes to food security rice

47
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:45,780
farmer income has increased by fifty

48
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:52,260
five percent a significant benefit for

49
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:54,480
Cambodians women farmers we are working

50
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,000
to promote the rice variety which is

51
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,840
mainly stressed torrential the drought

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,500
flap and also pest problems

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,840
and usually the variety that induced by

54
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,660
farmer which is very long duration and

55
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,090
low year and also the quality is not so

56
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,570
good but the variety that we are just

57
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:18,959
recently released it's very very good

58
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:22,500
and also very short duration and farmer

59
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,230
has very willing to get it it was

60
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,799
obviously the crop very much tolerant to

61
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:31,130
drought and especially also to the any

62
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,150
pest problem life from plant hopper

63
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,100
innovations like this are helping

64
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,620
farmers earn more income and see their

65
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,710
families and important steps to reducing

66
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,710
poverty and improving food security

67
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:58,550
