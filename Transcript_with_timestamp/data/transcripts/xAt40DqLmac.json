  "text": "[Music] i'm a fourth generation farmer here uh we've we've uh in 2012 was really bad i'm seeing 2012 maybe even just a little worse in 2012 right now already feeding hay if you have to purchase hay which we're going to purchase probably 600 bail this year uh you're already seeing a 65 to 85 dollar hay and you know it's some of that hate it was built in the media that's what scares me the quality of the hay that we're gonna have to purchase because there's nothing else growing you look here and it's just burn up everywhere but what i what i hope in the the positive in the future will be i hope we see like we did in 13 some higher priced cattle if if we can stay hooked and get by this drought um i think i hope we see some hard cattle i don't think we'll see them as high as we did in 13 but if if we can get higher than where we was and for sure where we're at now i think it's a positive uh you know and in the future if we knew that we was going to get rain we would know that we how much was going to have to buy but it's just hard to tell if we're going to get it when we're going to get it it's been in the future we don't get it we had rain here since i think june 8th we finally got two tenths of rain about five days ago it was gone in 30 minutes you know so hopefully it will get better but that's kind of my positive is i hope the cattle market if we can make it and don't have to sell out i think the cattle market should be a little better being a rep for the sale barn there i see a lot of people you know uh they call me a lot ask what what i should do what what should they do you know want to know a lot of perspective about what's going on but uh say four weeks ago we had 80 head of cows next week we had 180 something ahead the next week we had 590 something ahead of cows not just calves but cows when you see that many cows coming to the sale barnes problems and there's a lot of people selling out right now which when you demand that the man comes in of that very that many cattle it is going to dry the market down uh we're seeing a drop of ten dollars a k uh you know 100 on cows right now from from 80s in the low six low 70s and upper 60s and we did have a special wing sale this last week is one reason you've seen a lot of the big calves big groups but the reason is also is they're not going to hold until fall like me i wean in the spring i sell them in the fall i i back around my own cattle and with that people's not keeping cows and calves are keeping their calves and wind calves as long because the the commodity prices are high right now grains high you know corn i seen took a little bit of a drop that might help a little bit but people just can't afford to feed their cattle because they know that there's not going to be enough hay to feed what they don't have to keep we're supplementing a lot right now i mean i'm not a salesman for any feed company or anything but we're using liquid feed we're using salt mix to you know that salt mix and let it meet some of the dryer but motor grass or dryer hay get something out of it stretch what you got don't sell out unless you just have to uh but use some supplements you know and and the best thing to do is if you do have to buy hey get it tested if your quality of hay is good you don't have to supplement but this year i'm afraid we're going to get a lot of hay that is just either too dry when it's bailed so uh it's not going to have the quality go to your county extension agent get it get it tested they can tell you if you need to put anything if you need a better supplement or liquid feed or something to get them by and just to stay in there hey i've i went through 12 we had another small winter deal you know where we fed a lot of hay i mean i've been through some droughts not like a lot of the old timers but if we can make it through i feel like the cattle market's going to get better after this i mean this is something that happens every 10 or 12 to 14 years you know so just stay in and and supplement where you need to just don't get a lot of overcost in it [Music] you",
