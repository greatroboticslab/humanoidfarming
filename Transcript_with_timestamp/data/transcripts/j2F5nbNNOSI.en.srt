1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,799
when someone talks about monster grass

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,720
one nation which pops up in anyone's

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,639
mind is China saves tradition or

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,040
religion bamboo trees Earth at the heart

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,240
of the agriculture sector in China in

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,280
both the traditional as well as

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,320
modernized farming bamboo trees are

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,900
amazingly cultivated by Chinese farmers

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,820
and the results are super amazing China

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,680
is blessed with the best geographical

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,019
location friendly environmental

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,119
conditions massive Manpower and varied

13
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,980
Innovative techniques all these factors

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,800
suit the best for cultivating bamboo

15
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,600
trees and masses amazingly China is the

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,020
largest producer of bamboo trees and

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,640
almost half of the 1250 species could be

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,920
easily found in China's Diversified

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,840
bamboo production interesting isn't it

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,480
what techniques are used by Chinese

21
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,860
Farmers to grow bamboo trees which China

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,899
is the best choice when bamboo

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,820
production is talked about let's take a

24
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,379
deeper dive to know how China tops the

25
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,340
list when the bamboo Plantation is in

26
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,440
the picture

27
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,899
why is bamboo highly preferred

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,760
cultivation by Chinese Farmers one

29
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,559
fascinating fact that not only amuses

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,840
China but the entire Globe is that

31
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,720
bamboo is highly strengthened elastic

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,280
and as wear resistant characteristics

33
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,320
once cultivated these bamboo grows

34
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,720
swiftly and it'll take almost three to

35
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,400
five years to get mature these bamboo

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,720
trees mature with high yields and

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,159
throughout the process of their growth

38
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,380
they need very little care and

39
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,240
management the next appealing fact about

40
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,799
these bamboo trees is that the end

41
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,259
product can be used for Endless things

42
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,360
by human beings this bamboo can easily

43
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,159
substitute wood in the long run and all

44
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,380
of us are aware that human beings are

45
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,000
heavily dependent on recognizing and

46
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,759
exploiting natural resources for

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,320
survival being said this not only China

48
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,540
but the entire world has the most

49
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,400
prominent agenda of harvesting in

50
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,979
utilizing bamboo in the agriculture

51
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,259
sector however the method of cultivating

52
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,000
harvesting and utilizing varies on the

53
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,320
quality as well as the end user of the

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,880
bamboo

55
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,060
you might be surprised to know that

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,220
there are about 1 250 species of bamboo

57
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,259
in the world some prominent bamboo zones

58
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,020
in the world are Asia the Pacific the

59
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,299
Americas and Africa nevertheless 80 of

60
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,000
the species of bamboo can be spotted in

61
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,860
East Asian southeast Asia now jumping on

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,319
to why is China the best area for the

63
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,480
bamboo Plantation the major benefit for

64
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,340
China is its perfect location it is

65
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,200
situated from the subtropical Zone to

66
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,879
the temperature zone and some of its

67
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,800
parts like Yin and Province are in the

68
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,360
tropical zone so these zones are

69
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,520
particularly within the reach of the

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,560
East Asian in Southeast Asian Monsoon

71
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,239
regions and hence with these super

72
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,340
geographical conditions in natural

73
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,860
environment most of the bamboo species

74
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,780
can be spotted in China so because of

75
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,420
this advantageous location an amazing

76
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,280
climatic conditions China is ranked as

77
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,440
the largest in terms of species as well

78
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,599
as the diverse growing area for bamboo

79
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,879
plantations widely named as bamboo

80
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,620
kingdom is home to more than 500 species

81
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,840
of bamboo and this is the first country

82
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,060
in the globe to cultivate such an insane

83
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,340
amount of fish species of bamboo which

84
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,500
parts of China are planting bamboo trees

85
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,239
not only natural forests but also

86
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,400
man-made forests have bamboo plantations

87
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,140
in China from the southern part of the

88
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,879
tropical Zone to the northern part of

89
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,800
the temperature zone which eventually

90
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,620
reaches the Yellow River Valley have

91
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,319
diverse species of bamboo plantations

92
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,780
beets Hills Plains mountains Alpine or

93
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,000
sub-alpine altitude every part of the

94
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,519
region has bamboo plantations and these

95
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,519
areas are spread in 24 provinces other

96
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,680
provinces namely Hunan Guangdong guangxi

97
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,900
and Hainan are situated in the Southeast

98
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,819
tropical Monsoon region and have mostly

99
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,459
sympodial types of bamboo plantations

100
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,560
apart from this majority type these

101
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,780
provinces of a gigantic bamboo forests

102
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,360
and in that giant areas you can easily

103
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,480
spot bamboo species like denzio calamus

104
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,980
bambusa shizostakayum and encephalos

105
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,780
takayum chymonic calamus giganticloa

106
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,879
trisostakis neocinocolamus and others

107
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,040
though coming to the Central and Eastern

108
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,200
parts of China from the yangte cover to

109
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,700
the subtropical region this region is

110
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,799
highly influenced by East Asian

111
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,959
subtropical monsoons and because of

112
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,720
these natural climatic conditions one

113
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,760
can majorly spot monopodial and symposal

114
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,220
bamboos when talking about Genera

115
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,080
philistakis is the majorly spot Genera

116
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,000
in this region counting the total

117
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,000
Reserve volume of bamboo plantations in

118
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,819
China accumulates to a massive 150 to

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,620
170 million tons the natural as well as

120
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,900
man-made forests that majorly have

121
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,880
bamboo plantations are a massive source

122
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,919
of income for the country the investment

123
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,380
is quite low and compared to its outputs

124
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,600
so by analyzing the current situation in

125
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,800
China it is pretty obvious that there is

126
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,660
a great potential for further

127
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,240
development in the country especially

128
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,400
for bamboo plantations being a major

129
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,780
producer of bamboo it's important to

130
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,940
concentrate on every step of the

131
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,500
cultivation of crops and we already know

132
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,000
China's briskly shifting from

133
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,040
traditional techniques of the

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,259
agriculture process to contemporary

135
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,880
techniques so let's Glimpse what are the

136
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,860
Innovative techniques used for bamboo

137
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,660
farming at the beginning of spring

138
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,580
season which starts in March and goes

139
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,680
into July seeds of bamboo plants are

140
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,360
threshed getting these bamboo seeds is

141
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,580
pretty difficult so from The Limited

142
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,380
availability of seeds Farmers tried to

143
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,300
propagate as many bamboo plants as they

144
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,460
can as these seeds are rare and

145
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,560
sensitive some extra care is needed like

146
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,479
preventing them from drying out getting

147
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,240
too much direct sun or from getting too

148
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,800
cold as well after this process the

149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,419
seeds are spread on the farmland and

150
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,880
undergo a special watering process

151
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:19,440
within three months or so these seeds

152
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,419
grow up and now they'll be mature enough

153
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,520
to shift from the Earth to the Plastics

154
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,620
until they're strong babies it is

155
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,120
advisable that these plantations take

156
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,100
place indoors or in Greenhouse

157
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,060
cultivation for a few years for the best

158
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,580
results

159
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,740
at the stage these bamboo plants need to

160
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,660
be placed in Plastics as after growing a

161
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,180
bit more it'll be easy for shifting to

162
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,800
other areas and just in a few days these

163
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,780
saplings are big enough and in proper

164
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,520
shape to get cut after cutting and

165
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,199
cleaning one of the bamboo sticks and

166
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,479
then those remaining grown-up plants are

167
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,820
transferred into big plastic bags with

168
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,440
roots for further propagation the upper

169
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,539
part of the bamboo is slightly cut into

170
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,639
three different parts and in those three

171
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,440
different parts Farmers dig a hole in

172
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,660
that entire piece of bamboo is half

173
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,180
buried in the soil you might be thinking

174
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,680
why the pieces of bamboo have a hole the

175
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,600
reason is while burying the piece into

176
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,639
the land those holes are filled with

177
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,800
water to keep the soil and the bamboo

178
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,660
piece moist within just a few days of

179
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,340
proper care and management The Roots

180
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,320
grow underground and the plant grows

181
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,479
slowly and steadily the next method

182
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,699
which is usually used by the farmers is

183
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,380
to propagate bamboo trees by Roots this

184
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,300
might sound absurd at first but

185
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,639
surprisingly this is the most effective

186
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,500
method of propagation and yes this

187
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,419
method is traditionally proven and is

188
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,880
the most effective natural strategy to

189
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,919
grow bamboo the underground expansion of

190
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,720
roots gradually produces new shoots

191
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,419
which basically come out into towering

192
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,340
poles here the farmers need to be extra

193
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:43,500
careful as they need to figure out if

194
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,600
it's running bamboo or clumping bamboo

195
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,520
because both the types of bamboo have

196
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,960
different varieties of fruits take into

197
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,600
consideration that if it's running

198
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,000
bamboo then it rhizomes grow parallel to

199
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,919
the ground and outward once these roots

200
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,500
grow upwards they will send fresh shoots

201
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,120
and eventually a new sapling however the

202
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,160
method of growing Roots is not the same

203
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,080
as the clumping method and also at the

204
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,819
same time is not advisable more

205
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,220
preferable propagation method through

206
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,080
Roots is running bamboo the next method

207
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,300
for the cultivation of bamboo plants is

208
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,979
through a method of tree branching in

209
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,840
this method the knee butt and the

210
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,880
existing plant is slightly cut in a

211
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,800
plastic bag full of soil is tied with a

212
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,900
rope around the small cut

213
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,819
Now The Roots will automatically grow in

214
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,099
the soil and farmers will be ready with

215
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,900
a new entire plant once enough fruits

216
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:30,060
are grown that extra bud is entirely cut

217
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,319
down and planted in the plastic bag for

218
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,419
further process

219
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,580
this method is pretty easy and with this

220
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,979
farmers can get more and more plantings

221
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,900
from the existing bamboo the next method

222
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,060
China's Farmers prefers to dig the

223
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,740
entire cut out plant in the soil so in

224
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,900
this method some of the species of

225
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,460
bamboo also grow in a Grove once the

226
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,560
small piece of the existing plant is

227
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,599
cultivated in the soil it starts growing

228
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,699
roots and finally the farmer could carry

229
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,979
out the existing process for the amazing

230
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,840
successful mature bamboo plant since

231
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,880
agriculture is adopting modernized

232
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,280
farming one more Buzz technique is the

233
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,020
tissue culture method this method is a

234
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,000
scientific approach to growing bamboo

235
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,880
trees and the results are super amazing

236
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,800
even if the yield gained is reliable so

237
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,080
be it propagation of bamboo from Roots

238
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,060
bamboo cultivation growth through the

239
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,039
Grove or the modernized tissue culture

240
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,139
method one thing which remains constant

241
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,060
is China remains number one in the

242
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,400
number of species and the yield producer

243
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,259
bamboo no country at this point is also

244
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,180
near China when bamboo trees are in

245
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:29,160
consideration so these were some of the

246
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,500
interesting facts about China and its

247
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,000
bamboo cultivation techniques so what

248
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,919
are your thoughts in China and its

249
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,899
massive bamboo production is China

250
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,000
cultivating large amounts of bamboo by

251
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,979
some other method will this bamboo be an

252
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,140
