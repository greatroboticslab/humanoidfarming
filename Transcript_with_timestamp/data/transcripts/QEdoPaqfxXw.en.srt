00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,279
hello guys you're welcome to the channel

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,960
my name is ya and this is ashco TV the

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:09,679
official YouTube channel for AA house

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:14,440
Commodities now guess what I have always

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,320
say that Agri business is very very wide

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,199
and

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,359
Broad now I posted a video in in which I

8
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,599
was

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,960
saying that maze planting season is

10
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,960
here talked a lot about maze

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,719
farming now something you should also

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,920
know is that maybe you don't want to go

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,320
into the farming maybe you don't want to

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,879
be a farmer right but you still want to

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,640
invest in maze or in Agri business in

16
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,640
the direction of

17
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:53,239
farming in this video I'm going to show

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,320
you three very important tools that

19
00:00:53,239 --> 00:01:00,199
farmers really need almost every maze

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,719
farmer in Ghana needs this um this this

21
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,439
equipment one way or the other at least

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,280
two of two out of three of them every M

23
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:11,640
farmer needs them or needs the services

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,200
of these um tools okay now these are

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,200
also avenues that you can go into it you

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,840
can buy and rent to these Farmers all

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,079
right there are three that I have

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,360
identified very critical ones three of

29
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:28,320
them and I'm going to explain to you

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,920
what they what what they does and what

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,360
um you can get from it when you decide

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,759
decide to invest into them get them and

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,720
then rent rent them out to maze Farmers

34
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,079
let's get into the video right now the

35
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,759
first the first tool that I want to

36
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,960
recommend to you that you can go into

37
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,799
you can buy a number of them and

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,640
actually rent out to Farmers is maze

39
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,560
planter yes maze Planters okay now what

40
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,640
is happening is that these maze Planters

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,079
they are able to help the farmer plant

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,680
in straight

43
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,440
rows okay plant in straight rows cuz if

44
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,039
you look at it the the only alternative

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,480
apart from using these planter is the

46
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,000
manual planting okay and what happens is

47
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,160
that you're not able to get the rose

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,080
very very well you're not going to get

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,040
you don't get um straight rolles when

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,840
you use the manual you know planting but

51
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,760
with this Planters with this mechanic

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,080
Planters you are able to plant in

53
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,280
straight lines and in equal

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,360
distance take note of it straight line

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,000
and equal distance sometimes you able to

56
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,480
you know plant in straight lines but

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,319
what about the distance mind you if you

58
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,000
want to do maze farming and do it very

59
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,800
well you should take all these things

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,239
into consideration you should be able to

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,480
plant in equal distance because this is

62
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:59,040
an acre an acre has one size wherever

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,080
you go now you know that you are a you

64
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,560
want to plant a certain number of um a

65
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,159
certain number of you know plants on an

66
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,840
acre okay if you use whenever you use

67
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:16,080
this kind of mechanized you know

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:19,599
Planters you are able to do what to

69
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,519
determine how many plants how many M you

70
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,239
know plants you are going to be able to

71
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,120
plant on an acre you know by knowing the

72
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,280
distance between each of these um these

73
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,000
teets of the road of the plant

74
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,879
all right so these Planters are very

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,439
necessary a lot of um Farmers need them

76
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,159
need the services of them and a lot of

77
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,159
farmers are not able to buy them or feel

78
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,640
Rel reluctant buying them because me is

79
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:49,480
a seasonal crop after the season it will

80
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,640
be ideal for the next before you know

81
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,239
until the next season comes so most

82
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,480
farmers are reluctant about buying them

83
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,920
but they prefer rather renting them

84
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,959
remember we are not going to be able to

85
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,680
give you the price of what of these

86
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,439
equipments these three equipments I'm

87
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,040
talking about okay now what we can give

88
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,840
you is how much you can rent it for so

89
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,720
when you are able to get your price

90
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,799
whatever you you think you can get this

91
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,239
equipment

92
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:25,360
from then you also look at you know you

93
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:27,280
you match it with um the the cost of

94
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,440
renting then you'll be able to do your

95
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,960
Ms and know the profit that you can make

96
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,400
out of you know going into um investing

97
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,440
into

98
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,919
this particular

99
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,960
equipment now that being said this

100
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,600
Planters this ma planters for what I

101
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,880
know they are rented for between 50

102
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,639
cities to 100 CI per

103
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,720
acre okay 50 CS to 100 CS per acre okay

104
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,880
and then mind you this is not just one

105
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,000
acre it is going to be you can rent it

106
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,199
out to people who have 5 Acres 10 acres

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,720
you know they are a lot all right people

108
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:08,199
who do large scale farming probably have

109
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,479
Planters you understand so the small

110
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:14,639
scale farming like 5 Acres 10 acres 6

111
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,280
Acres you know 15 Acres they they are

112
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,639
they should be your target market they

113
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:23,759
are the people you should be targeting

114
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:27,479
all right so I can say that in a day you

115
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,560
can rent it out for work for 20 acres

116
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:33,120
and then you can do this for two three

117
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,160
months you know for the first season and

118
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,680
then maybe two three months also for the

119
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,639
second season so just calculate this by

120
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,280
let's say 5 months in the whole year

121
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:46,039
then you know how much you can make in a

122
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:49,440
year right owing just one of of of of

123
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:51,800
this um Planters all right

124
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,240
now now the second thing I want to

125
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,680
recommend to you the the second

126
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,479
equipment that I or Machinery farm

127
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,000
machinery that I want to recommend to

128
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,880
you

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,720
is M the land you know plowing machines

130
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,720
okay plowing machines like last um I

131
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,639
remember last season I made a video

132
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:16,560
about you know the process of

133
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,039
um our M farm and there were a lot of

134
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,599
questions about you know plowing

135
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,039
machines whenever it is Miss season like

136
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,599
this plowing machines are hot kick

137
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,880
there's no two ways about it and last

138
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:31,039
season the price for a plowing machine

139
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,479
for an acre the service of a plowing

140
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:37,479
machine for an acre was 250 CS so this

141
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:40,160
season we should be looking at 300 CS

142
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,000
for one acre now once again you should

143
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,560
be looking

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,400
at um doing you know 50 at least 50 for

145
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:54,120
a day if you have these Services if if

146
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,440
you have a list of um Farmers that that

147
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,440
needs this Services Ming around you

148
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:03,800
could do 50 acres in a day a couple just

149
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,160
multiply by at least 250 cities per acre

150
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,080
all right because um the more you know

151
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,599
people gives you work I mean you you you

152
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,479
decide to you know reduce this so let's

153
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,360
let's just say minimum 250 cities by 50

154
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:21,039
c by 50 aces in a day and you can do

155
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,400
this for like two months in a year no in

156
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,879
a in in in the first season and two

157
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,000
months in the second season we talking

158
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,599
about four months and you can do up to

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,680
50 Aces

160
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:35,960
per day now do your own calculations

161
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,599
I'll just leave it for you to do your

162
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,639
own calculations and go back to Lear to

163
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,960
to see how you're going to get this this

164
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,720
machines because we don't deal in the

165
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,520
machines of course so get you get how to

166
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,080
deal how to get these machines get the

167
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,720
get the cost get do this calculation and

168
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,400
get the possible Revenue that you are

169
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,440
going to make out of it and then strike

170
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,800
and make the possible and get the

171
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,680
possible profit that you can get from

172
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,840
buying this machines all right and I

173
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,680
mind you you're not going to do it for

174
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,440
just one year you can do this for it can

175
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,080
be there for as many years as possible 5

176
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,759
years 10 years the machine will still be

177
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,639
there and you still be making profit out

178
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,720
of

179
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,240
it now surprisingly I just remembered

180
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,879
one other Machinery which a lot of

181
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,960
people have not you know put their mind

182
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:28,240
it um onto a lot of people have not

183
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,720
considered it but it is very very

184
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,640
essential this is spraying machines

185
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,039
spraying machines now listen in the

186
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,880
village where we were doing our Farms

187
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:44,360
last

188
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:48,800
season one spraying machine was 15

189
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:51,720
CS renting it for a day was 15

190
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,760
CS okay now I don't think this spraying

191
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,360
machine cost more than 500

192
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,519
cities now this machine if well

193
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,959
maintained you can use it for up to 5

194
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,279
years

195
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:06,600
if well maintained maybe once a while

196
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:08,600
you have to you know change some the

197
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,600
some few parts of

198
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,480
it but it can be there for a very long

199
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,920
time now just imagine if you have 10 of

200
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,200
them if you have 10 of them which you're

201
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:23,160
going to buy for like maximum 5,000

202
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,640
cities and you're going to rent each out

203
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,200
for a day

204
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,839
for for 15 cities just make it 10 cities

205
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,040
to break into the

206
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,720
market how much are you going to make in

207
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,959
a month how much are you going to make

208
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,399
in two

209
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,680
months right and how much are you going

210
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,320
to make if four months you're going to

211
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,560
use it for four months in the year for

212
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,839
both seasons of the Year all right do

213
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,839
the calculation but I tell you it is

214
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,519
also very very profitable

215
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,200
right now the last equipment I want to

216
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,240
talk to you about that I want to

217
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,000
recommend that you can go into and

218
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,839
actually invest buy a lot of of it if

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,880
not one if not two you know buy a couple

220
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,519
of them and then rent them out which is

221
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:13,120
also a very very very very very hot kick

222
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:17,040
of uh Machinery in Agri business

223
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:20,000
especially in maze farming is treasure

224
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,279
the treasures this this is the machine

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,320
that what Treasures or Ser in the final

226
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:30,440
stage of your Harvest okay now these

227
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,959
machines they are in different you know

228
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,440
they are in different

229
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,120
sizes and capacities but you can get

230
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,240
some that is very very minimal that you

231
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,240
you are you you can you know use it

232
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,720
efficiently for like five to 10 years

233
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:53,399
also now the now the difference what set

234
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,000
this um tring machine apart from the

235
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:59,240
other equipment is that for the tring

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
machine you can even situate it in town

237
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,279
now because come to think of it if

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,440
you're looking at the M Planters if

239
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,120
you're looking

240
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,360
at spraying machines if you're looking

241
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,560
at plowing machines you have to be in

242
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,200
farming communities because you have to

243
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,079
be close to where their lands are their

244
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,800
farming lands are that is where you're

245
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,680
going to get them that is where you're

246
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,320
going to you know get to provide these

247
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,240
services but for the treasure for the

248
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,560
mze treasure you can bring it to town

249
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,480
because after harvest after harvest

250
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,040
a lot of these Farmers prefer even

251
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:38,519
bringing their their produce to the

252
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:42,399
house and then come and you know Tres

253
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,680
it finally all right so even if you have

254
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,639
this treasure you don't want to go to

255
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,320
the

256
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:50,040
Farmland maybe some from time to time

257
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,040
you have to go there but you can also

258
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,079
there's also an option of keeping some

259
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,680
in the house and then use it for the

260
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:59,360
services use it to service all the

261
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,240
farmers that prefer bringing their

262
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:07,120
produce to what to the house all right

263
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,680
so this is one this is another there a

264
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,839
lot of these equipment but this is the

265
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,600
three four now

266
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:19,199
four you know that I I wish you can also

267
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,360
go into you could you could get few as

268
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:24,600
for the spraying machine they are cheap

269
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,199
they are cheap relatively cheap let me

270
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,040
say it that way you know let me choose

271
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:30,320
my words carefully relatively cheap

272
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,199
we're talking about 5 00 cies machine

273
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,399
that you can rent for like 60 times or

274
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:39,120
120

275
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:44,519
times in a year and you're going to

276
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:48,000
charge at least 15 cities for one

277
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,800
day you know sometimes you don't have to

278
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,320
be a farmer to benefit from

279
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,920
farming I hope you heard me right

280
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,959
sometimes you don't have to be a farmer

281
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,639
to benefit from farming you can also

282
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,480
provide services that farmers need need

283
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,160
