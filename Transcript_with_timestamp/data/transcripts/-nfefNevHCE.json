  "text": "for small scale Farmers I know you've been wondering what are the most profitable cops that you can manage to do and earn some decent these are farmers who have less than an acre of land and most of them own one age of or what is commonly known as 50 by 100 land is becoming Scar and we are increasing in population but at the end of the day you can still make some decent profit and especially the youth who are graduating and you have small pce of this is a good way to employ yourself these are five most profitable crops that you can grow they don't require cap they don't require much knowledge they fast maturing and also they have a wet by W Market I mean you can sell them even through your immediate neighbor and regardless of the marketly imagine you still get people who buy as long as you maintain the C as minimum as possible but first let understand what is profit profit is the amount that you get after deducting your cost from the revenue you earn what do I mean I mean if you have 10,000 heads of cabbage and you sell each at 15 shs you manag to get 150,000 sh that is Le that is not profit if you had 10 produce each cabbage it means your total cost of producing the 10,000 heads of cabbage was 100,000 shs now to get your profit you take the 150,000 sh you L their 100,000 sh you get your profit as 50,000 sh that is the profit most Farmers don't know how toate this they assume once you've sold your produ that is no that is usually not the profit that iseven and when you are factoring the remember also to pay yourself assume that what you put there the energy the time and all the resources that you put there when you cultivating this crops assuming that you employed someone else who similar work how much would he have charged you if you would have charged 300 or 500 Shing that is your cost of Labor and you have to factor in to get a true value of your profit in 2025 these five crops can give you some good cash but let us be realistic by this I mean you cannot expect super abnormal profits in family there's nothing like making tens of millions in one day now profitability in agricult is you make 10% profit 20% profit the problem with most of us we are greedy and we want to have AB normal profit we want to make 100,000 from investing 1,000 that one doesn't happen so if you invest 100 and you get 200 as profit that's okay these are the five props that you can manage to do and get some good profits and number one is thiss in short this can be either P or all those types of PS and good thing with p is that they are fast maturing and then also number two they are not perishable number three you can sell to anyone after they are dry and you harvested them you can take to the local market or to the seral stores so they will still buy this makes it a good CR to do the other thing that makes it a good CR to do is the cost of producing it imagine in an a of an you only need 2.5 kgs so this will cost you roughly around 250 Shing if you put now all the other cost of producing them around 500 Shing for chemicals and maybe an extra additional cost of 1,000 you'll get a total production cost of around 2,700 and 50 if you are good at it and the season is okay and you manage to harvest around 1.5 B each weigh 90 kgs and you are also lucky to sell at 80 Shillings per kilo then you will earn 10,800 from your 1.5 back the second most profitable crop for small scale Farmers is a garden pie or what is often known as Mii Mii tend to Bel by many though they are also quite expensive the funny thing with Mii it tends to come from only one region around Yanda County but if the farmers can manage to tap into this Market there is high demand the other Supply that may be experienced around the year is also short live meaning that prices are often High above 70 shs if you are a small scale farmer with a name of anre you only need 2 kgs this one will cost you 1,800 if you add other cost of 1,500 units it means that your total cost of of production will be around 3,300 sh if you manage it well thisa can manage to give you 200 KES of Green Piece all n selling it on a market price of 4 Shing per kilo you manage to get a roughly revenue of 8,000 Shing if you L your 3,300 the cost of production you are left with a profit of around 4,700 shs and remember this is the lowest price of 40 Shing per kilo sometimes it goes to over 70 Shillings per kilo the third most profitable crop for small scale Farmers is D or what is often known as a coriander the good thing with coriander is it's fast within 30 to 35 days it's ready for harvesting and my doesn't need those expensive chemicals or even fertilizer you just plant it and manage it and that's all you have good to go and within those at least let's say 40 days you will manage to have harvested around 200 kilos from the farm if you sell each kg for 40 Shillings then it gives you a Le of 8,000 Shillings if you L your cost of 2,300 Shillings you are left with a profit of 5,700 this is a good profit for small scale farmers in a month and you canate this such that you'll always have this produce every month making you an a source of income a stable every month my fourth most profitable crop for small scale Farmers is green maze what is green maze green maze is what is known as mahindi Yak the demand for Mahia green has been on the rise most people are loving and even those who cook the very all boiled me they buy it from these people because they know how to select the best one and the sweetest one and remember the secet on this is to do the varieties that they love not all maze varieties is good for roasting we have to get this and if you're totally interested in this make sure you've watched our video on the best maze variety for Maze roers that one that once you have it they will come running for you and sure that you do the maze that they love in one of you need roughly 1 kg of this m these will cost you around 500 shs if you add your cost of production that is maybe wiing also fertilizer it will give you a total cost of 2,500 Shillings now this farmer will manage to produce around 2,000 pieces of maze or lot is often called as if he sells it at 5 Shillings each at lowest then he makes up a levenue of 10,000 Shillings if you L now the cost of 2,500 sh he makes a profit of 7,500 sh the good thing with green maze is one but you don't have to sell it green if you don't get to the market you can manage to let it dry and by letting this dry you will harvest around five bags each weigh 90 kg so if you sell each bag at around 2,000 Shillings you earn a levenue of 10,000 sharings however by letting it dry it may add an extra cost of 2,000 sharings making a total cost of production to 4,500 sh if you L 4,500 from the 10,000 Rue you are l to the profit of 5,500 sh my last most profitable crop for small scale Farmers is indigenous vegetables and by vegetables I mean man amandas we mean plant all those indigenous vegetables why they most profitable is one they are cheap to produce Imagine by less than 50 sh you have a packet of seeds that you can plant and give you a 1,000 sh then the good thing with them is that but they are not that much highly per then the other thing you can Harvest for quite some time and also you have a wider Market including the neighbors you can send to the neighbor okay so these indigenous vegetables they are good source of income they are also quite profitable if done well and by consistency you can be selling to the local grocery stores oh mama once they realize that you have it they'll always be coming to you because what they need is sustainable Supply and this applies to all these five crops once you have a sustainable supply all year around that you have mastered on these several props once they realize that they will always be coming to you",
