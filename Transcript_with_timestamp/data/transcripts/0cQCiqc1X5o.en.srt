00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,200
good day everyone you may have heard

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,480
some whispers about a new design of our

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,719
Ripper pip player well I'm glad to

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,519
present that to you today so our Ripper

5
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,080
pip play has always carried great

6
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,440
strength and this new design is no

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,960
different some of the main features you

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,240
can see is a square reel as opposed to

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,240
our round reel the reason for going to

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,880
square was to give the Reel Center lower

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,560
to the ground this makes it easier when

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:33,079
you're loading those larger rails of

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,879
pie another feature we've added on is a

14
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,480
for pocket to make it easily forkable so

15
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:40,399
there's two Fork um pockets on the

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,440
Ripper so if you got to move it from

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,120
property to property it's a lot easier

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,879
to load onto the back of a ute or

19
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:51,960
trailer we've also made our legs on the

20
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,640
Ripper more efficient and easy to store

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,680
