of gaining a great new employee for our

staff sometimes employees are a poor fit

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,190
for their positions their work does not

meet your standards their behaviors are

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,900
unacceptable or you simply can't afford

position at any time without notice and

15
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,250
without cause check that your state is

you cannot terminate employment if the

18
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,969
reason is due to one of the protected

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,489
classes under discrimination laws for

20
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:58,590
example someone's race color national

21
00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:01,469

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,479
employment for reasons based on sexual

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:13,619
orientation HIV status place of birth

26
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,930
and age over 18 the laws prohibit

27
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,759
termination as retaliation against an

28
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,220
employee who has alleged employment

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,680
discrimination or filed a sexual

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,200
harassment or discrimination claim or

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,530
who has served as a witness to another's

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,900
claim or who has reported an unfair

33
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,170
labor practice or who reported a

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,150
violation of a law as a whistleblower

35
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,040
again check with your attorney if you

36
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,540
are considering terminating employment

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,880
for the first time even in a state with

38
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,829
at-will employment laws in place it's

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,899
best to provide clear feedback to

40
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,850
employees and to document any problems

41
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,740
along the way and to provide your

42
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,530
employees with opportunities to turn

43
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,479
around their work however your decision

44
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,149
may ultimately be to end someone's

45
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,979
employment at the same time at-will

46
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,930
employment allows you to make an

47
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,210
immediate termination for any problems

48
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,409
without a warning if you choose or if

49
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,409
you have no other option

50
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,220
ending employment with dignity can

51
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,160
prevent an unpleasant scene and preserve

52
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,629
your interests as the business owner

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,310
remember that it's always painful for

54
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:24,470
the employee being fired whether they

55
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,870
were expecting it or not it can be

56
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,340
painful for the business owner too but

57
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,550
there are steps you can take to have it

58
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,860
go more smoothly first deliver the news

59
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,510
in private don't wait until the end of

60
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,380
the shift when others may also be

61
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,110
leaving work

62
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,420
try not to deliver the news by yourself

63
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,970
if there's another supervisor have them

64
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,099
join you to deliver the news say as

65
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,860
little as possible don't get into a

66
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:51,200
debate you may say I hear your point of

67
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,319
view but state that you've made your

68
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:58,720
final decision be firm and respectful

69
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,950
this simply isn't working out I'm sorry

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,599
you can remind them of what the

71
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,640
expectations were for their work

72
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,410
performance remember that we've talked

73
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,690
earlier about why it's important for you

74
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,459
to get to work on time you've already

75
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,620
had three chances to improve your

76
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,930
attendance since you were late again

77
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,930
today I'm letting you go and today's

78
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,150
your last day working here remember you

79
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,790
aren't required to provide a reason for

80
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,380
the termination but they may ask you you

81
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,239
can always say thank you for your work

82
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,340
you'll be paid for the rest of the day

83
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,950
but you should pack up your things and

84
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,170
head home now have the employee fill out

85
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:37,670
and sign a timecard or record the hours

86
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:40,459
worked already in the pay period in both

87
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:42,829
Vermont and New Hampshire any wages due

88
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,299
to the employee must be paid within 72

89
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:47,030
hours of the termination of their

90
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:48,639
employment in other states check with

91
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,920
your Department of Labor for the payoff

92
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,989
requirements most businesses find it

93
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,060
easier to provide a manual check during

94
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,220
the meeting if you're laying off an

95
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,430
employee for lack of work you can pay on

96
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,260
the next pay date collect any of your

97
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,859
business property that was issued to the

98
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,970
employee

99
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:10,639
quis equipment uniforms etc provide a

100
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,220
receipt for those items returns you and

101
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,260
the employee should both sign it include

102
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,910
the final paycheck on the list so that

103
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,329
the employee verifies that it was

104
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,340
received if the person seems upset walk

105
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,270
them to their car or let a co-worker

106
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,009
drive them home

107
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,500
if they are threatening or becoming

108
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:33,319
violent contact your local law

109
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:35,300
enforcement if asked agree to only

110
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:37,580
provide a limited reference to a

111
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,500
potential new employer you should limit

112
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,479
your information to the facts when the

113
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,300
person worked for you and what their

114
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:46,460
work entailed if the prospective new

115
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,440
employer wants to know why your former

116
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,360
employee left you can always say that

117
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,770
you aren't able to discuss it rather

118
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,970
than disclosing your reasons for

119
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:58,360
termination good luck and that's the end

120
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,360
of the lesson
