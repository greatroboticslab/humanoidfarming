[Music]

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,060
you

5
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,180
hi-yah today I'm very excited because

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,730
I'm gonna share with you a very easy

7
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,989
technique to grow lettuce even from the

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,960
letters that you buy from the

9
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:42,379
supermarket it's very easy very healthy

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,590
and he grows really quickly so let's get

11
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:44,590
to it

12
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:50,059
so in order to grow your letters from

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,610
the letters that you bought in the

14
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:53,030
supermarket you will need your romaine

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:57,079
lettuce

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:59,780
of course nice a cutting board one jar

17
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:03,820
or a total work I'm actually reusing a

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,820
memory jar to fix and

19
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:12,110
so as you can see this letters was cut

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,450
from the root here it has no roots here

21
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,550
but that's not a problem all you have to

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,220
do is keep this part from your letters

23
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,770
so we're gonna cut it now and I'll show

24
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,090
you how it goes okay so welcome to the

25
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,590
kitchen okay

26
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,810
we're gonna cut the letters at about

27
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,060
five centimeters from the end of the

28
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,790
letters and then you can say the rest in

29
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,440
the fridge after you close the end of

30
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,320
your letters you will have something

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:41,750
like this so as you can see you have the

32
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,880
ends here no roots there and what we're

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,070
gonna do now is use the toothpaste to

34
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,680
put in the letters so I'm gonna put one

35
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:52,759
here maybe another one right here

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:56,090
another one here and another words here

37
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:59,900
so we have four toothpicks just like

38
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:02,150
this and I'm gonna set it aside now

39
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:08,090
we're gonna use our jar so fill up the

40
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:11,420
tart with water all the way up now we're

41
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,040
gonna put the letters inside the jar it

42
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,780
makes sure that it's actually touching

43
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,670
the water I'm gonna fill it up a little

44
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,170
bit more all the way to the top so I

45
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,080
make sure that the water is actually

46
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,269
touching the letters mm-hmm now your

47
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,100
letters will need some sunlight to book

48
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:27,530
so make sure that you put the letters in

49
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:31,480
a place with a sunny window so it gets

50
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,480
lots of sunlight so you can grow quicker

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,419
[Music]

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,350
okay so as you can see this lettuce goes

53
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:06,200
really quickly remember to always change

54
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:08,810
the water every one or two days so you

55
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,600
keep it clear and clean now this lettuce

56
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,430
has been in water for about three weeks

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,950
and as you can see the leaves are big

58
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,990
and green I think when your letters gets

59
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,330
to this size this is the best time to

60
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,860
harvest and eat the leaves this is

61
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,330
because keeping in mind that this

62
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,640
lettuce is not getting as much

63
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,800
ingredients as she would get in the soil

64
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,750
the leaves are gonna start becoming more

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,060
bitter so the best time to eat this

66
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,680
lettuce is at this point I have read

67
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,780
that we can actually transplant this

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,910
lettuce to soil so she can get the

69
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,950
nutrients that she needs so I'm gonna

70
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,890
try it today I'm gonna try to transplant

71
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:45,080
this lettuce to soil and see if she

72
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,540
actually survived I hope that she does

73
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,940
and I'm gonna show you now how I'm gonna

74
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,680
transplant it soil and then I'm just

75
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,959
gonna show you the progress on my

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,450
Instagram account so let's hope it works

77
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,450
okay so let's get to transplanting

78
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:12,350
so first in this container I'm going to

79
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:13,910
put organic all-purpose soil now we are

80
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,130
going to make a hole further that is and

81
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:19,430
this will be about five centimeters we

82
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:23,260
take the toothpicks out like so and

83
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,260
we're going to put the letters inside

84
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:31,070
try to compress the soil guys look so

85
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,780
pretty and now I'm just going to water a

86
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:38,840
little bit so I make sure that the soil

87
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:41,390
