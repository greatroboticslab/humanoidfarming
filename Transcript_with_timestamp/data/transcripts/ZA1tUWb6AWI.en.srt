1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,160
I'm going to share with you a project

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,839
that took me 8 years to finally build

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,360
our garden trellis which hold our

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,599
climbing roses hey I'm handyman Dan with

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,400
you can build this many times over those

6
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,400
eight years I felt so much like the mom

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,920
and dad in the movie up where they were

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,279
saving up for a big vacation and then

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,840
life would happen they would have to

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,320
break open their piggy bank to be able

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,519
to pay for any bills or car repairs or

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,599
Insurance you name it this is exactly

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,320
how I felt but I kept my dream alive one

14
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,520
day I was going to be able to build my

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,320
climbing trellis and that day came

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,200
finally in the spring of 2021 so what's

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,879
with your dream about building a trellis

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,480
I wanted my own trellis for a few

19
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,840
reasons I have very fond memories of my

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,199
dad occasionally bringing home a bouquet

21
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,520
of roses to my mom and it was incredible

22
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,199
because every time he did this her face

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,520
would light up and she would always do

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,199
two things first she would run up to my

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,359
dad and give him a big smoochie kiss

26
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:00,039
kids thank you for the reference to BL

27
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,559
then she would immediately go to the

28
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,080
kitchen grab a vase put the roses in the

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,760
vase and put it on the center of the

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,600
table for it to be displayed to

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,680
everybody that walked by because of

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,439
those experiences plus others I've

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,680
always been very intrigued by roses yeah

34
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,400
but couldn't you have just planted a

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,720
rose bush our garden at the time was

36
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,000
roughly 20x 22 ft so I felt like

37
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,920
planting a whole rose bush would take up

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,360
a lot of valuable Garden real estate

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,360
meaning I wouldn't be able to plant

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,880
vegetables in that spot plus with rose

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,400
bushes I feel like you can only really

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,960
enjoy half of the Rose at a time unless

43
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,960
you walk all the way around it but

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,320
trellis would allow me to more

45
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,079
efficiently utilize my garden space and

46
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,040
by adding climbing roses to it it was

47
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,119
the best of both worlds and of course

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,079
you can use a trellis for other climbing

49
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,960
plants but that would ruin my story but

50
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,719
you've never built a trellis before what

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,320
gave you the confidence to be able to do

52
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,320
it true I had never built a trellis

53
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,200
before but when I sat down and analyzed

54
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,719
the components of the trellis eventually

55
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,680
I was like hey I could build this there

56
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,240
are only five steps to this build and

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,039
you will be surprised at how simple each

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,399
step is and after we go over all of the

59
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,200
steps of what it takes to build a

60
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,200
trellis like ours I will share with you

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,840
some amazing things that we've been able

62
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,480
to do that we never expected and it made

63
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,319
that 8-year weight so worth it we built

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,519
our trellis in the summer of 2021 now

65
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:19,879
coming up on almost 3 years later with

66
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:23,040
Winters with a ton of snow some very

67
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:25,879
harsh winds and some incredibly hot and

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,720
dry Summers our trellis is still looking

69
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:31,000
amazing so why even build a trellis

70
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,040
number one it can as a focal point for

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,680
your garden we built our trellis to hide

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,959
our ugly stuckle wall our garden area

73
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,239
faces the South and so our stuckle wall

74
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,760
gets really really hot in the summer by

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,159
having our garden trellis in front of

76
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,360
the wall it's able to actually cool down

77
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,239
that wall and hide it number two a

78
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,080
garden trellis can act as a privacy

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
screen for your neighbors number three

80
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,640
the plants you grow on your trellis can

81
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,120
bring a lot more pollinators and good

82
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,560
bugs to your garden and number four my

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,680
favorite you get a ton of bang for your

84
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,560
buck with the amount of plants you get

85
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,640
for the small amount of real estate that

86
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,000
it takes up by growing vertically

87
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,000
instead of horizontally for example our

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,239
trellis is 19 ft wide the two outside

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,159
parts are 8 ft tall and the center

90
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:19,799
section is 10 ft tall overall we have a

91
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,280
vertical growing space of 170 square ft

92
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,120
now compare this to the amount of

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,840
horizontal space that it takes up in our

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,200
garden with the Roses planted in front

95
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,640
of it and with it being a foot away from

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,239
our wall it only takes up 2 ft in length

97
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,439
and and 19 ft in width that's only 38 ft

98
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,040
horizontally if I were to lay that down

99
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,799
and compare that to how many planter

100
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,920
boxes I would need our trellis would

101
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,799
take up probably a third of our garden

102
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,680
space yeah but you do construction all

103
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
the time what makes you think I could

104
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,879
build a trellis let's break down the

105
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,280
simple components that make up a trellis

106
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,079
to hold everything up you've got the

107
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,000
concrete footings on top of the concrete

108
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,920
footings you have the vertical posts

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,319
connecting all of your vertical posts

110
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,640
together you've got your horizontal

111
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,239
beams then you've got the inner

112
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,159
structure which I'm calling the inner

113
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,760
frame and your inner frame holds the

114
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,840
mesh or lattice that your climbing

115
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,120
plants will hold on to and attach to as

116
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,599
they grow then if you want to add a

117
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,120
little bit of extra flare to your

118
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:14,319
trellis you can add some extra trim okay

119
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,600
yeah give me the steps step one is your

120
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,079
design phase one tip I can offer with

121
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,280
this is to design around your final

122
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,520
product for our particular circumstance

123
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,600
I knew that I wanted climbing roses I

124
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,600
wanted a lot of different colors and

125
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,759
kinds of climbing roses and I knew I

126
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,720
wanted it to be a big focal point in in

127
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,320
our garden I wanted our three climbing

128
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,759
roses to grow and kind of mesh over each

129
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,240
other taking a boring old stuckle wall

130
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,199
and turning it into a wall of flowers

131
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,960
amazing I know right one important

132
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,680
aspect I had to incorporate into our

133
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,560
design was to make sure that my Trellis

134
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,520
was far enough away from our wall

135
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,840
because the heat absorbed from the Sun

136
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,000
in the summer months was way too much

137
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,919
and I didn't want to cook my roses So I

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,320
placed my trellis one foot away from our

139
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,080
wall and this has allowed enough air to

140
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,240
get behind the trellis and keep the

141
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,039
plants cool step two is to place your

142
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,240
concrete footings a great structure

143
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,320
starts out with a great Foundation make

144
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,520
sure to check out with your local

145
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,440
building requirements on how deep and

146
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,400
how big to make your footings for your

147
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,360
structure I used these concrete cylinder

148
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,840
forms from our local hardware store for

149
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,320
the concrete footings and I actually

150
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,039
went pretty deep because I wanted to

151
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,680
make sure that my Trellis was going to

152
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,400
last I got these really beefy 4x4 post

153
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,319
brackets because they have a hole at the

154
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,440
bottom and they have a hole on the sides

155
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,720
and this would allow me to make a

156
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,120
t-shape with rebar firmly connecting my

157
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,680
post brackets to my concrete yeah these

158
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,440
puppies weren't going anywhere and I

159
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,160
needed this because my Trellis was going

160
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,039
to be really heavy plus all the extra

161
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,600
weight of the climbing roses as time

162
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,479
went on another thing I liked about

163
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,639
these post brackets is it had an inch

164
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,600
standoff and so my posts would be an

165
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,560
inch above the concrete and this would

166
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,720
reduce the amount of water exposure from

167
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,479
rain and snow step three is adding your

168
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,720
structural Lumber this includes your

169
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,440
vertical posts and your horizontal beams

170
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,960
the nice thing is you don't really need

171
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,440
that many tools for this you'll need a

172
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,440
drill and a screw gun a ladder and then

173
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,000
one tool I didn't have at this time but

174
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,840
I wish I did was this post level this

175
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,160
level is awesome because it allows you

176
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,240
to clamp it on to your 4x4 post and then

177
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,400
it'll tell you both directions if you're

178
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,599
level I went with redwood material

179
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,400
because of its natural resistance to rot

180
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:19,800
for my vertical posts and horizontal

181
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,800
beams I went with 4x4 material because

182
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,240
of its structural Integrity the center

183
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,280
section of our trellis is 9 ft wide and

184
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,280
I knew that a 2x4 would not span that

185
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,240
distance without sagging over time one

186
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,639
thing that will really save you a lot of

187
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,880
time and energy is to lay out all of

188
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,160
your pieces before you install them and

189
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,639
stain them it is much easier to stain

190
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,759
them when they're all on a horizontal

191
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,360
surface I placed all of ours on saw

192
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,919
horses and did two coats of stain on all

193
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,000
sides I used this valpar stain I went

194
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,680
with the Redwood tone and I used it

195
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,560
because it said that for vertical

196
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,039
applications it would last 8 years and I

197
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,680
could not be more impressed with this

198
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,319
stuff coming up on 3 years it still

199
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,400
looks amazing you can save a a ton of

200
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,599
time and hassle by not having to clean

201
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,879
out your roller every single time after

202
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,479
you paint or stain all you have to do is

203
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,560
take your roller and put it into the

204
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,440
bottom of a trash bag spin your trash

205
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,240
bag so it makes it tight and fold it

206
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,639
over and I had times where my paint

207
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,319
roller was still wet after 2 weeks and

208
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,879
this was my own personal preference but

209
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,039
I really didn't want to see many

210
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,120
mechanical Fasteners in my trellis to

211
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:26,400
connect my horizontal beams to my

212
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,039
vertical posts I used an inch and a half

213
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,120
dowel that I drilled into my beams and

214
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,039
my vertical iCal posts and I used tight

215
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,479
Bond 3 glue because it's rated for

216
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,840
exterior use to drill my dowels I marked

217
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:40,160
the center of my beams and drilled in 2

218
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,360
in deep I then matched that same hole

219
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,960
into my vertical posts the only caveat

220
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,680
to doing it this way is you need to use

221
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,199
bar clamps to squeeze the posts together

222
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,240
if you don't have bar clamps you can use

223
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,199
Fasteners I also wanted to reduce the

224
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,560
amount of risk I would have of water

225
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,680
seeping into the tops of my posts I made

226
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,199
sure that my top beams covered my

227
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,680
vertical posts at the end step four is

228
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,520
to add your metal mesh or your lattice I

229
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,440
decided to go with a metal mesh because

230
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,479
I felt like it was more durable yes I

231
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,560
could have gone with a wood lattice but

232
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,440
I didn't want to take all the time and

233
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,319
cut all these little tiny pieces I knew

234
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,720
it'd be really hard to get them in the

235
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,759
perfect X shape I was also concerned

236
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,800
about once my climbing plants went on

237
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,080
the trellis that my connection points

238
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,960
between the X's would pop so I went with

239
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,240
metal hog paneling that I got from my

240
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:29,120
local farming store it's galvanized and

241
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,080
comes in 16t Long lengths which was

242
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,279
perfect for my Center section and then I

243
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,360
could use the extra parts that I cut off

244
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,320
and put it on my side panels to attach

245
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,680
this metal paneling I first had to build

246
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,560
an inner frame in between my vertical

247
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,399
posts and Beams I made it kind of like a

248
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,320
picture frame with mitered Corners I

249
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,399
just took 2x4s and ripped them down the

250
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,000
center to get smaller pieces the list of

251
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,640
tools needed for this step are really

252
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,320
simple you'll need a drill and a screw

253
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,279
gun you'll need metal Clips to attach

254
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,399
your metal mesh and you also need a

255
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,040
reciprocal saw with a metal blade to cut

256
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,800
your metal paneling and then one thing

257
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,720
that saved me so many times was was this

258
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,480
metal platform it made it so much more

259
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,120
convenient to cover a much wider space

260
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,399
than a ladder would to attach these

261
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,600
frames inside of the trellis I used deck

262
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,399
screws by making this wood picture frame

263
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,320
inside of my posts and beams put my

264
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,120
metal mesh on top of it and then I could

265
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,279
use these clips to hold the metal mesh

266
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,279
in place the metal mesh Cuts really easy

267
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,240
with a reciprocal saw and a metal blade

268
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,000
I just used the Sharpie to mark down all

269
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,880
the points that I wanted to cut I would

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,800
recommend using gloves because as you're

271
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,600
holding the metal and the friction of

272
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,120
the blade can really heat up that metal

273
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,920
step five is to add any extra additional

274
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,800
decorative pieces to your trellis I

275
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,800
wanted to cover the tops of my trellis

276
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,920
because without these decorative pieces

277
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,760
it just looked really boxy for art

278
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,360
trellis I used 2x6 Redwood Lumber and at

279
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,399
the ends I cut out a little quarter

280
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,480
Circle to cut these quarter circles I

281
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,519
used my grandpa's Compass to put it in

282
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,320
the corner and then used it to scratch

283
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,800
the line that I was going to cut into

284
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,040
the wood then I used my jigsaw and cut

285
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,720
that Circle I did use deck screws to

286
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,800
attach these decorative pieces to my

287
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,880
trellis and and surprisingly they hide

288
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,959
really well I just made sure to make my

289
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,480
2x sixes wider than my 4x4 posts so that

290
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,399
you didn't see them behind it as

291
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,880
promised at the beginning of my video

292
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,600
what has made this trellis so awesome

293
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,320
has been being able to share these roses

294
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,880
what I love is being able to take our

295
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,279
roses and make a very fragrant bouquet

296
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,360
for our house or my kids love taking

297
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,480
them to their teachers but the icing on

298
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,480
my fictitious trellis cake was when my

299
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,000
sister-in-law asked if she could use

300
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,519
some of my roses for her wedding bouquet

301
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,040
talk about feeling so honored that roses

302
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,279
from my little Urban Garden would become

303
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,839
part of a bride's bouquet on her very

304
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,480
special day thank you so much for

305
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,560
watching until the end I really hope

306
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,200
that these five easy steps have helped

307
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,519
you feel more confident to build

308
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,800
something like this in your very own

309
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,040
garden or that you have a little bit

310
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,440
more inspiration on what you want to

311
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,880
build for yourself if you decide to

312
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,200
build something like this let me know in
