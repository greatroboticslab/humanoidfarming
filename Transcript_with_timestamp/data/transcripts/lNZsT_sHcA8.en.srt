00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,840
welcome back to Modern Agri machines

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,840
today we're diving into the fascinating

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,799
world of onion farming from planting to

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,800
harvest and finally to processing let's

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,240
see how onions make their way from the

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,400
field to your plate let's get started

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,039
onions are grown worldwide with the

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,359
largest producers being China India and

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,640
the United States these countries

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,400
cultivate millions of tons annually

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,719
providing iding a massive contribution

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,160
to the global economy not only are

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,360
onions crucial for flavor and cooking

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,640
but they are also packed with essential

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,879
nutrients like vitamins B and

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,280
C in fact onions bring immense economic

17
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,480
value to Farmers generating billions in

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,879
Revenue they're also a nutritional

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,680
Powerhouse known to reduce the risk of

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,160
heart disease and improve immune

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,680
function the process of growing onions

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,600
begins with selecting seeds nurturing

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,559
seedlings and taking care of young

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,120
plants

25
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,640
before they are transplanted into the

26
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,200
fields for large scale cultivation the

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,159
seeds need to be treated to enhance

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,840
their germination rate and resistance to

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,240
pests before sewing the seeds are

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,320
typically soaked in warm water for 12 to

31
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,759
24 hours to stimulate germination after

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,600
treatment the seeds are sewn in seed

33
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,799
trays or directly into Nursery soil

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,680
onions grow best in loose well- drained

35
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,920
soil that is rich in organic matter

36
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,200
after preparing the soil Farmers plant

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,000
the seeds or onion bulbs in carefully

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,280
arranged rows watering is a crucial

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,200
factor for healthy onion growth drip

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,040
irrigation is commonly used to conserve

41
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,479
water and ensure optimal plant

42
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,159
development once onions are growing they

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,040
need constant care Farmers regularly

44
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,840
weed the fields to prevent competition

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,560
for nutrients and use organic

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,560
fertilizers to enhance growth onions are

47
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,920
also vulnerable to pests like onion

48
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,880
thrips in diseases such as Downey mildew

49
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,960
many farmers adopt organic or

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,240
chemical-free PES control methods to

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,719
ensure healthy safe crops after 90 to

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,720
150 days onions reach maturity when the

53
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,440
tops of the onions fall over it's time

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,239
to harvest Farmers carefully pull or

55
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,239
lift onions from the ground to prevent

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,560
damage in smaller Farms harvesting is

57
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:22,560
done by hand but for larger operations

58
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,400
specialized machines make the process

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,400
