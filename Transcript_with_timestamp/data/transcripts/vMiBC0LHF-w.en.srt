1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
there are a lot of zone control valves

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,190
to choose from here at sprinkler

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,450
warehouse this video will help you

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:14,250
understand the things you need to

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:16,529
consider when selecting a valve what's

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,990
the difference between inline valves and

7
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,720
any siphon valves and how do you know

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,939
which ones to use any siphon valves are

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,010
so named because each valve has an anti

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,779
siphon device built into it to prevent

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,550
the backflow siphon inch of possibly

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,380
contaminated sprinkler water from

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,329
getting into your drinking water they

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,460
must be installed above ground to work

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,600
correctly and they need to be protected

16
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,460
from freezing weather

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,010
they are typically installed as part of

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,140
a front yard and backyard manifold this

19
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,180
makes the valves very easy to find and

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,890
service when needed but does require

21
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,649
using more pipe in your overall

22
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,570
sprinkler system design inline control

23
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,180
valves get their name because the valves

24
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,399
are buried underground in line with your

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,920
systems pipe usually in the middle of a

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,739
sprinkler zone and are protected by a

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,840
valve box because the valve is located

28
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,240
below ground and the top of the valve

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,770
box is at ground level they are less

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,380
susceptible to freezing temperatures

31
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,540
typically using inline control valves

32
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,130
require less pipe because the valves are

33
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,960
located closer to the sprinkler heads

34
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,330
and not in a manifold group like

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,670
anti-siphon valve and provides more

36
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,610
equalized water pressure within your

37
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,040
zones and when buried underground in a

38
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,070
valve box the landscaping looks more

39
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,049
natural many customers ask since inline

40
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,390
control valves don't have an anti siphon

41
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,770
protection component in their design why

42
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,049
would you ever want to install them in

43
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,970
your system with inline valves you are

44
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,820
able to protect your entire system by

45
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,770
installing a single backflow protection

46
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,110
valve between the water supply and your

47
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,000
sprinkler system this higher quality

48
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,310
backflow prevention device is testable

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,470
and can be certified as working properly

50
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,110
which means you always know that your

51
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,219
drinking water is safe and protected

52
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:58,049
although you don't need to purchase a

53
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,060
separate mainline backflow device like

54
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,450
you would when using inline valves there

55
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,040
is a drawback associated with using

56
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,840
anti-siphon valve the built-in backflow

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,149
prevention mechanism is not testable and

58
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,459
cannot be certified that is working

59
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,810
properly for more information about the

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,230
your sprinkler system watch the

located on the video page of our website

65
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,459
also not all municipalities are water

66
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,680
districts allow the installation of

67
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,420
anti-siphon control valves because they

68
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,519
are untestable make sure you check with

69
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,340
your local regulations before purchasing
