farm was earlier dug for treasure

7
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:32,169
hunting but nothing was found because of

8
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:34,780
his continuous learning through seminars

9
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:36,659
and sustainable agriculture him exists

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,589
land more productive and sustainable

11
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:41,160
through the application of

12
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:43,809
diversification and organic farming

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,109
he's burning interest to make things

14
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:50,590
better were simply irresistible the

an unpredictable weather and profit

19
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:03,250
animal integration in the farm as a

20
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,160
solution

21
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,220
he started container gardening as kami

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,679
change adaptation and mitigation

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,099
measuring floods he locally innovates

24
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:17,979
Asante formulated organic fertilizer and

25
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:21,450
natural pesticides to improve plant

26
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:24,180
vigor and depicted in sick repellent

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,490
he modified multi-story cropping by

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,119
placing container-based each eye under

29
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,159
the trellis of opal then he integrated

30
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,740
Korean pig racing into the farming

31
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,280
system and used the composite buildings

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,329
of the piece as organic fertilizer he

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,710
worked hard to establish an organic farm

34
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:46,340
established immediate de l'épée a pond

35
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,200
and learned that a local snail qahal

36
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:52,560
constitute a nutritious feed for tilapia

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,020
when mixed with rice bread the pond

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,289
water is also used for his farm during

39
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,200
dry season planting abroad twists and

40
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:04,020
legumes are used as wind breaks and a

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,489
source of green manures vermicomposting

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,440
as a source of organic fertilizer

43
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:12,630
recently the agricultural training

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,540
institute provide additional support

45
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:18,390
like sprayer vermicompost

46
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,760
facility free-range native chicken and

47
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,530
ducks and cross site visits to the

48
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,459
project's farms with similar

49
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:29,609
undertakings with this innovative

50
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,340
concept and farming experience his farm

51
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:34,889
was transferred into bit size model for

52
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,450
all interested farmers willing to learn

53
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:41,310
and adapt he became a resource person

54
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,680
his income before the technology is

55
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,430
thirty-five thousand pesos per year

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,440
derived from rice farming alone now he

57
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,459
earned more than eighty thousand pieces

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:57,299
per year organic farming takes time but

59
00:02:53,459 --> 00:03:00,230
with far bigger rewards learning doesn't

60
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:02,730
stop when technology is applied

61
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,430
technology adoption does actual

62
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,370
observations plus experience

63
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:12,530
as well to innovate equal effective

64
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,530
location to good agricultural practices
