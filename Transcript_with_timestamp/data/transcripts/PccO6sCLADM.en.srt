1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,380
the aphid one of the most common crop

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,940
pests in the world has a weakness that

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,890
scientists have now learn to exploit

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,540
when attacked by predators

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,210
the bugs release a pheromone to tell

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,950
fellow insects to scatter biologist -

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,630
proposed spraying these alarm pheromones

8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,570
directly on crops to prevent pest damage

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,340
but synthesis is costly with the advent

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,199
of genetic engineering though the

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,380
cheaper option is to modify crops to

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,560
produce the deterrence themselves in

13
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,570
2015

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,720
biologists at Rothamsted research an

15
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,980
agricultural research station in the UK

16
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,469
reported the first engineering feat of

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,570
this kind in wheat to make wheat release

18
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,070
insect pheromones the group inserted a

19
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,719
gene from the peppermint plant which

20
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,090
allows plants to produce the appropriate

21
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,860
chemical then they tested whether the

22
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,379
altered plants volatile compounds were

23
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,000
capable of repelling the pests using a

24
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,620
multi chambered ol fact ometer to

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,539
provide different odor options the

26
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,890
scientists looked at how much time three

27
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,500
types of aphids spent in each

28
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,940
environment all three species spent far

29
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,100
more time away from the areas with the

30
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,930
aroma of the engineered wheat suggesting

31
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,579
the modification successfully acted as a

32
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,110
deterrent

33
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:05,820
similarly when scientists placed a small

34
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,710
drop of the alarm pheromone made by the

35
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,689
engineered plants on aphid colonies

36
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,390
already feeding on regular wheat most of

37
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,890
the bug dispersed the pheromone has the

38
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,009
added benefit of attracting aphid

39
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,330
enemies such as parasitic wasps and

40
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,400
indeed the researchers found that

41
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,170
compared to controls wast spent more

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,439
time hanging around and foraging on the

43
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,880
engineered plants before flying away

44
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:29,159
finally the team tested the new plants

45
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,720
in the field growing plots of wheat and

46
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,240
Counting the number of aphids and wasps

47
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,070
through several seasons unfortunately

48
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,140
the results observed in the lab were not

49
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,000
repeated in the field the pheromone

50
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,159
releasing plants Harvard populations of

51
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,649
aphids and beneficial insects the same

52
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,030
size as those on regular wheat the

53
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,560
results indicate that while this type of

54
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,049
Engineering is capable of producing

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,460
pheromones the ward off pests more work

56
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,220
will be necessary to make sure they

57
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,649
protect crops in real-world conditions

58
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,060
nevertheless once successful the concept

59
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,649
might also be employed to control

60
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,399
insects that's very diseases to farm

61
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,399
animals and people
