  "text": "[Music] the landscape of the Upper Midwest has has become one of the most productive agricultural regions of North America fields of corn and soybeans reach to the Horizon in every direction this land though has spawned another kind of product completely unintended but no less profound the runoff from these agricultural operations compromises the water quality both locally and farther down the Mississippi drainage all the way to the Gulf of Mexico in fact this region is a major contributor to the zone of hypoxia in the Gulf where excess pollutants wipe out marine life the area of concern is the region of Northwestern Iowa and Southwestern Minnesota today the plow dominates a landscape where once the grass has stood well over a person's head and Buffalo roamed freely very few wetlands and Native prairies remain on the land to filter the water and slow the pulse of runoff in addition the mass conversion of the the Prairie Wetlands ecosystem to intensive farming has threatened many species of migratory birds and butterflies these species often Nest here or use the area during their cross hemisphere migration routes through adapted farming and conservation practices there are increasing points of Hope new data suggests that the level of nitrates in the water has been declining in recent years the key is to look at current practices with an eye toward historical conditions and practical conservation strategies around 12,000 years ago when the first humans appeared in North America the Upper Midwest was mostly a glacial landscape when the glaciers last receded they left behind a fertile soil glacial lakes and Wetland depressions called Prairie potholes the effects of the last glacial event are still being felt on the land we're in the prairie pad hole reg region which is mainly Glacial Hill um placed here pretty much the topography and everything you see is placed here pretty much by glacials um coming over the land and then receding especially the receding part where they gouged the landscape and and made deposit deposits in different areas this is an open landscape uh dominated by grasses and and wetlands glaciers came through this area and dug out these depressions uh the climate uh has provided the moisture necessary to maintain U the vegetation the grassland vegetation and the wetlands um interacting with with the climate and the physical factors uh glaciations uh our disturbances such as grazing and uh and fire which have maintained um the Upland system in a very early successional stage we're at kind of a major boundary in Southwestern Minnesota we're sitting on the Marine of the last Glacier that came into this region and a marine is a linear Ridge of Hills this one Trends northwest southeast and to the east of this line is a landscape that is very young geologically it's um the drainages haven't been integrated yet you have Rolling Hills a lot of wetlands Lakes sloos to the west of this Ridge is a much much older glacial landscape the difference in ag is 14,000 years to the east 400 to 600,000 years to the West so there has been a lot more time for the drainage system to develop west of here this difference in age of the two Landscapes on either side of this Ridge has to be appreciated when you're talking about Land Management because on the West Side you have this well integrated drainage system every single low spot on the land surface has been drained has been reached by headward erosion of a stream of some size and so the whole landscape is connected with the dend dritic drainage way on the east side of this line nothing is connected yet this landscape is poorly drained and it will become drained in the long run and so there is going to be the creation and erosion of streams and that's a hard thing for people who are managing the land to appreciate they want it to kind of lakes to stay looking like the Lakes they always have been they're reluctant to see Lakes fill in become marshes and shallow water environments but that is going to be the natural progression of this landscape the biggest change we see now that the state is fighting and doesn't understand is the Min Minnesota River was deeply downcut during glaciation 10,000 years ago all its tributary streams which reach into this area are still adjusting to that down cutting event and so they had waterfalls initially created at the at their Junction with the Minnesota and those waterfalls or Nick points are migrating upstream and in some cases are only 5 to 10 miles from where they join the Minnesota River so you have these deeply ins sized drainage ways that meet with kind of a sluggish looking Upland stream well eventually that gradient that that step in the gradient is not going to persist for the long run it's going to be evened out and so there's a lot of erosion there's a lot of gullying um banks are caving into the river there's High sediment load in the Minnesota and its tributaries and a lot of that is natural um farmers do contribute some of it when they ditch and tile but the bulk of it is a is a naturally vent and it's something that is still adjusting after 10,000 years when the first Europeans viewed this area in the late 1600s they found the land covered with a waving sea of Tall Grass Prairie roaming herds of bison and migrating tribes of Plains Indians those Native Americans left subtle yet lasting marks upon the [Music] land after the Civil War agricultural production hit full stride here and within 100 years came to almost completely dominate the landscape most of the wetlands were actually drained at about the turn of the century maybe up to about 1920 the mid or so people had to realize that Iowa and much of the mid Upper Midwest here the prair pothole region PE people had a difficult time even living in this area because of water they had trouble even getting around in Iowa we had probably about 2 and A2 million Acres of wetlands that disappeared because of drainage so people historically didn't like wetlands and a lot of people still don't like them today because were a real problem with people making a living off the land when they had to farm it and the people's attitudes I think have changed somewhat because they realize a lot more now what the values and functions of wetlands today producers and land managers here are starting to look for ways some of that original ecosystem might regain function the focus is on a few small patches set within the agricultural landscape one may still find a small remnant of prairie or wetland in original condition these areas serve as models and Seed sources for restoration work elsewhere generally down here over 90% of the original wetlands have been drained and are now uh used for farmland for the Tallgrass Prairie I've heard uh various percentages but generally it's well less than 1% of the original Tallgrass Prairie Still Remains and I've heard as low as you know a tenth of a percent so depending on what area you're looking at Tall Grass PR is very rare we do have some Tall Grass PR behind me we have some on uh some of our other waterfall production areas and we use that as this seed source uh in order to start planting uh those types of plants in our new areas so this is a Skipper and this is one of the species of insects that we use to talk about the quality or the health of a prairie the Skippers are incredibly specific because they're they're lay they lay their eggs on grasses and um despite the fact that it's not very showy of a species uh they really do tell us quite a bit about the quality of the Prairie this Prairie is also a very valuable resource because when you look at Iowa and the changes in the landscape that have happened over the past couple hundred years uh Iowa used to be predominantly covered by wetlands and prairies and now we have less than 1% of the Prairie uh covering the landscape that we had 200 years ago so this is an incredibly valuable resource this this site because of the genetic diversity uh and the species diversity of plants as well as other organisms that live here like insects one of the other important aspects of this Prairie particularly is that it shows quite a diversity of microhabitat TS we have the Uplands here we also have lower Wetland areas there's a a high diversity of topography and the different vegetation communities that are associated with that so it's important when we think about Landscapes and we think about areas to either restore or preserve it's important to think about getting the whole complement of these different kinds of habitat types and in many cases there are plants that are tightly associated with for example the lowlands like the wetlands uh and there are many other species of animals wildlife that are associated with each of these different micro habitats so this 160 Acres on kalor Prairie uh is especially important because it has this diversity of different habitat types well first of our our farming operation is a corn soybean operation so it it has to be economically profitable uh our whole family is conservation-minded so that part is is pretty pretty easy to work with the family on um but it has to be economically viable for our total operation before we can do them uh my parents were older and of course uh participated in a lot of the drainage of the farm and when we stop a tile and and that type of thing it has to be something that works with the total picture of the farm that's kind of how we look at it uh big picture-wise we're actually in the De Moine River on the that Watershed just a few miles north of us we go into the Blue Earth river system which goes north into the Mississippi and uh through the Minnesota River so we're kind of on a tabletop there but even our small Watershed we I don't know that I want to eat the fish out of our River when I when I see what comes down it one of the concerns that I've had is watching the scour erosion on this River and watch the channel change and and uh in my lifetime we've owned this particular farm for 34 years uh there's been a terrific amount of tile Upstream increase it's about a 30 m Watershed and uh the velocity and the speed the water comes down to us now is greatly enhanced so we're seeing more scour erosion on the on the banks and that's one of the things that I'd like to see kind of slow down and it by establishing the grasses on these Bank edges is really really working in the right direction in this immediate part of the of the uh Great Plains the northern Tallgrass per Eco region I think that we are something like 97% uh privately owned this landscape is 97% privately owned and and something like 85% engaged in cultivated agriculture so any sort of public policy that has intentions of improving water quality or bird nesting success I think has to has to include uh the land that is privately owned one of the most ambitious programs that work here focuses on establishing conservation practices on private land the Minnesota conservation Reserve enhancement program or Crap seeks to place 100,000 acres of marginal cropland in a conservation easement one of the most significant issues that we've been working on over the last several years is is trying to clean up the Minnesota River it's one of the most polluted rivers in uh United States it's in a primarily dominated agricultural landscape it uh runs from the Western edges of Minnesota actually into South Dakota all the way into the uh Minneapolis St Paul area where it joins the Mississippi River it's one of the principal it is the primary tributary to the Mississippi River and it's sought to be the number one pollutant to the Mississippi River uh in the state of Minnesota of course from Minnesota's uh agricultural landscape the Minnesota River probably is made up of all or parts of 37 counties it's roughly a watershed of 10 10 and a half million acres of land in this particular River's Watershed and roughly 10 million Acres of that land is under intense agricultural uh cropping so it's an extremely intensified agricultural it certainly includes probably uh the most significant cropping areas in the state of Minnesota are found in this this particular Watershed certainly we can't turn the clock back to prior to to European settlement we know agriculture is critical to the state of Minnesota is trying to find that balance between conservation and agriculture use and we think crep has been a great great selling tool for the state of Minnesota uh particularly in trying to achieve very significant benefits to the Minnesota River Wetland Restorations are the types of eligible crop lands that we are trying to enroll in this program and and the reason for that of course these are the lands that uh if we can get them out of crop production we can get a conservation practice on those uh parcels and protect our future resources from uh you know reducing soil and water erosion sedimentation nutrient loading into the Minnesota River and also be looking at improving and enhancing fish and wildlife habitat you know one of the reasons that we're here of course is trying to enhance our Water Resources as well as our Fish and Wildlife Resources with within Minnesota and in order to do that we have to look at trying to improve and enhance the Watershed in the Minnesota river which then subsequently will benefit the Mississippi River and on down the river down to the Gulf of Mexico and and uh issues related to hypoxia as an example at the mouth of the Mississippi in the Gulf of Mexico lies an area known as The Dead Zone or the zone of hypoxia here excess nutrient runoff and pollution from up River have created an oxygen deprived body of water no marine life can exist here in improving water quality in the Upper Midwest can help alleviate The Dead Zone additional connections extend across the hemisphere Minnesota and Iowa form critical links in a migratory chain for countless bird species some of the species Nest here some use the area to reproduce others continue their journey through here to the Arctic and then back into South America when you look at this landscape I think one of the key things that are gained not only by the producer but by myself being a taxpayer and all the other taxpayers is the fact that um this system that you see impacts people further further down the river I always think of the um my parents that live on the Mississippi that's where I grew up um this if I had more knowledge of this at the time when I was growing up as a kid I would understand better the landscape but this thing has an impact on that Mississippi River it has an impact of uh further down when you get to the G of Mexico removal of nutrients um maintaining the flash flood system that sponge effect the wildlife habitat benefit on the migratory species are all just a benefit to everybody in the community as well as farther down the Watershed Community for me um in my present position as a wildlife biologist for nrcs uh all of this uh is uh connect it uh from you know from the headwaters um from the potholes the management of Uplands uh through the uh flood plane uh repairing systems to the coastal marshes all of this is is connected so these areas get used by a a wide assortment of wildlife uh some of which stay around um for extended periods and rear their they're young either on the wetlands or in adjacent areas others which uh only occup these habitats very very uh temporarily uh in route to uh breeding areas uh elsewhere uh this time of year you see um use by uh transient Birds um that you know may have bread up in the Arctic and um such as Shorebirds and you know you see the mud flats out here which uh uh provide them access uh vegetation free access to to feed on the invertebrates that are in the in the shallow uh wat which uh would allow them to complete their migration down to the gulf uh and eventually down down to South America when we bought it it was all grassland since then we've put the basins on it that are that are here today gradually over a period of time my wife Jean and I are are very much interested in in uh in Wetlands for a number of reasons for the the wildlife of course comes with it once you put the once you put the water in the in the Wetland you have the the the wild life following and the the natural vegetation that comes along it is extremely advantageous to to not only the immediate neighbors but the the long range Downstream neighbors are benefiting from this too because of the filtration effect of the uh of the vegetation and the the mere existence of the Wetland uh between here and downstream at some point the prie pothole region in the Upper Midwest in Canada is the most productive area in North America for producing waterfall ducks and geese the birds that are going to stay here locally for waterfall are primarily malards blueing teal U shovelers Gad walls many of the uh other uh waterfall that migrate through here the uh buffalo head a lot of the diving ducks scalp canvas back redhe heads they'll go farther north and and nest in in some of those uh prey Wetlands farther north Iowa has currently has some hot spots as far as nitrate contribution to that whole hypoxia problem and and uh part of our uh solution to that problem is to be able to position our wetland Restorations within a wated or a large landscape and position them to the point where we get the maximum uh filtration value out of our Wetlands uh Wetlands placed in a watershed anywhere are good but if we can strategically place those wetlands in a position where they do the greatest benefit um everybody comes out ahead up here in the Upper Midwest one of the big issues that's come up over the last few years is the hypoxia issue and that's mainly uh having to do with nitrogen U extra nitrogen that's in the system of the uh Minnesota River and in the Mississippi of course they dumps into the Delta and anytime we can with our buffers and with our filter strips up in the Upper Midwest we definitely can have an impact on removal of some of that nitrogen before it becomes a problem in our streams while I'm sitting in the tractor cab planting on ridges or or cultivating or harvesting I often think of myself as being uh just one farmer within a wated or within a Flyway or within the northern Tall Grass per Eco region and I try to think of my role I I love of course as all farmers do to think of big yields it's just great fun to get big yields and that is what really matters to my success but I also uh get some sort of reward from feeling that the birds that are making their way from from in some cases golden Plover they passed through usually while we're planting corn and they I think that they've been in Argentina and I think that they're headed for the very very northernmost parts of North America and I think of their trip when I'm moving really slowly across the field in in the tractor and and I'm fascinated and I want really want to do what I can to make their trip as as easy as possible I like the idea of of giving the really delicate and fine-tuned attention to what I'm doing on this Farm to so that that so that that golden Plover finds what it needs on its way through but then I also want to be part of a network of information and research so that I can learn whether or not what I'm doing is creating any sort of advantage to the to the entire Flyway or the entire Watershed I would like to believe I would like to know that that this Farm is not contributing to the zone of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico farming with the mind on the larger ecological issues leads to new practices on the land small changes and tillage methods and timing can have a great effect on the landscape's overall health this Farm wouldn't be recognizable from the road passing by as being different in any way to an untrained eye from other Farms but there are a number of changes and practices that I've implemented to try to create benefits for water quality and Wildlife I've manipulated and tweaked the cropping system a little to try to make room for bird nesting success small mammals and and our greater diversity of of of Flora and Fauna to exist while at the same time hoping to achieve maximum yields maximum economic yields I'm really enjoying in my professional life trying to design a corn and soybean cropping system that facilitates bird nesting success we can use these implements to get 170 Bushell per acre corn yields while at the same time leaving a 45-day no re-entry interval in our cropping system to allow ground nesting Birds to rear Broods of young in our Ridge till cropping system the practices of the past of broadcast applications of fertilizers and herbicides are almost a part of the past we have applier fertilizers in a band 7 in deep and in a very stable form so that the fertilizer that we apply is used by the crops that we grow and doesn't end up as pollution in in uh surface water flow leaving the farm we apply our nitrogen our our nitrogen fertilizer at at uh uh the point in time when the corn needs it the most with with this rrop cultivator we just make a few littleit uh modifications to it and we band our fertilizer in typically in late May and we do nitrate nitrogen soil testing before making our fertilizer recommendations so that we are pretty assured that we're not applying more than we need and that combined with the leaving the the fields un un tilled in the fall and hopefully including the the understory crops we're really hoping to keep all of our our fertilizers right here on the farm since we've changed cropping systems and since the arrival of some new technologies that allow for the that allow us to leave this large uh no re-entry interval in our cropping system it allow us to leave un touched uh uh residue corn corn and bean stocks through the winter where we're finding that Upland sandpipers regularly nest and rear Broods right in our crop fields and I find this really really exciting and really rewarding other rewards come when agency managers link up concerned producers with appropriate government programs such as the Wetland Reserve program and the Minnesota KB when land is set aside through these programs the ecologic function may be managed using some basic conservation strategies by restoring or preserving prairies and wetlands and by establishing riparian buffers or filter strips one of the things that we're trying to think about when we look at these prairies is how in a fragmented landscape how can we reconnect the pieces how can we uh make this a better landscape for the species that we're trying to preserve in the Prairies and one way of doing that could potentially be uh by adding reconstructed prairies another way of uh putting this landscape back together could be by creating buffer systems that would connect these prairies the site that we're looking at here now is a is a glacial glacial Remnant uh this is a a prairie that was U never been had never been cropped in this case this land owner hadn't done anything to the land and so we're able to come in do some burning on it uh we broke the tile lines uh The Nature Conservancy actually owns the fee title on this now and we have the the easement permanent easement on it and so we're in a process of um of restoring the ecosystem for this particular site as far as connectivity goes of this site with other sites if we're talking about a larger area we address it here in Iowa a couple of different ways in specific programs like the wetlands Reserve program and those and related easement programs we add extra points in for sites that are that are in proximity uh either they get the most points of their touching an application is touching an established site like this or it's within a mile or two miles those types of things and we try to bring try to bring those groups of easements together because we can get a a more valuable package for for wildlife and for water quality and all those types of things if there is a segment and it's all in one land we would try to try to get a a buffer strip between this site for example and a and another one that's maybe a quarter mile away we would try to try to get that person in maybe in a CRP buffer strip and plant that down to Native grasses and Forbes and so it becomes this this uh passageway this buffer between this site and another site maybe there's another land owner that has a has a representative site too and and try to connect them all together so becomes a very connective ecosystem although it's segmented in smaller pieces than what it was naturally these alleys that are wide enough so that they're just not a carnivore trap but so that their their their uh Wildlife can actually uh can actually produce in there and can actually U pass through and safely uh we would try to get those done to have a have a good um connected um Wildlife Area the way we see Wetlands at the planning phase and all the way through it is that they're just one of the opportunities that we can use to get conservation on the land early on when we do our preliminary planning for these projects we rank them for water quality for restorability for cost of restoration and in this case U this Wetland set in a position where it created a string of wetlands U over 30 mil long where it fit into that chain and U created a situation where you cannot drive more than two miles in this chain North and South in the potholes without uh coming upon another restored Wetland or a or a prairie system so we use that as the ranking we emphasize that and we also emphasize the fact that that we took Approximately 80% of the drainage area in this particular area and filtered it through this Wetland so it had some big water quality benefits these conservation buffers that we have out here today the riparian forest buffers that are planted uh here in the river bottoms of in the flood zone areas and we're hopefully creating a practice here that will be absorbing nutrients that are moving underground in in the crop Fields here where we pick up a lot of nitrates that are picked up off the corn fields and and come through the underground streams we're also creating a lot of wildlife habitat down here and these are very fast growing species and and we're going to create some habitat that uh for the Wildlife the forest buffered uh trees are going to be creating shade habitat over the stream for the Fisheries here in in the southwest Minnesota Tall Grass Prairie particularly uh for instance the northern pike which is considered to be a lake species in a lot of cases in most cases in Minnesota but they are known to migrate up in these streams at certain times of the year uh anytime you can create your Banks a little bit more stable but also create some shade over in pockets and pools you just create a little bit more uh fish fish habitat for those migratory species where we're located here with this riparian Forest buffer is situated at the bottom of a landscape that's kind of steep for years it had had been tilled some uh it's protecting what used to be a feed lot up there that's uh could have had runoff coming through we're protecting that you got a corn crop that's being raised down here and of course in this part of the country it takes a lot of nutrients particularly nitrogen to raise that crop of corn and and and with the intense rainstorms we get we get can get some leeching down into the roots zone so uh that's going to be moving towards the stream which is only a couple hundred feet away and so anytime we can absorb any of that nutrients through a crop like the crop of grass that's located in in the buffer here it's going to be absorbing that out and taking that out of the system land owners and land managers in the Upper Midwest are faced with challenges both social and economic in addition the byproducts of an otherwise successful farming operation are threatening the ology of the entire Basin through appropriate conservation and farming practices however some solutions are being applied to this complex problem as nrcs employees we don't make the decisions for the landowner our responsibility is to provide to that landowner Alternatives resource alternatives for for those acres and then if there's programs available whether it's USDA programs whether it's uh um interior programs or or local uh Soil and Water Conservation District programs uh those types of things lay those programs out so land owners can can fit the the right decisions with a program to help them Implement those those decisions but as far as us making decisions we don't we provide alternatives to the land owner land owners that make the decision when you look at conservation planning on this site you may come out and see your eyes may focus on a basin per se but when you can look beyond the Basin and into the perspective of what the system is requiring do we need a filter system to help keep sediment and nutrient load out of uh water flow can we do that not only with one landowner but with several and when you look at uh a basin per se like this the question would be is what is on the other side of the fence what's on the other side of the hill and how does it connect with one another and can you as a conservation planner make that connection happen by providing um information assistance opportunities for land owners to get together and complete conservation practices that not only function on their land but also work within the entire system as we work with one landowner then that information can go to another land owner as we work in a neighborhood in a in a group setting and and collectively then these these good decisions result in the resulting in multiple Acres large blocks of Acres being treated properly [Music]",
