00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,359
foreign

2
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:15,059
friends this is survival doc today we're

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,920
going to take a look at my water

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,619
collection system

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,279
this is where the system starts from the

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:25,560
four gutters on my home here all four

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,560
corners have this type of device on it

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,900
the water comes down

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,460
it falls through this

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,800
device here

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,180
the water goes straight through but any

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,879
large particles of trash such as leaves

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:45,360
nuts seeds

14
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,360
they will roll off fall to the ground

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,980
the water continues to go through

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:56,340
into this four inch PVC pipe

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,140
now this has been exposed to

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,800
the Sun

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:05,040
and to ultraviolet radiation which

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,400
causes plastic and PVC to deteriorate so

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,080
I painted this PVC

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,060
and if you're going to paint your PVC

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,500
you need to ask the paint shop make sure

24
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,479
you get a type of paint that will

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,880
stick to PVC

26
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,500
my four inch tube from the front comes

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,400
all the way around

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,400
to the back

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,119
here it comes in

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,640
here's another corner of my home

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,759
water comes down into another one of

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,759
these traps

33
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,840
the two front and back join here

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,720
and they continue down

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,140
this road now this right here

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,960
is a water trap

37
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,840
I have two adapters in here

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:05,479
that fit together and close they choke

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,479
this off to a three inch hole

40
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,060
these are the two PVC adapters that I

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,739
use to make the

42
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,280
floating ball

43
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,739
shut off to capture the first runoff

44
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,239
of dirty water

45
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,080
these are

46
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,080
a four inch

47
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,319
and these are two different types of uh

48
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,420
adapters three inch it just so happens

49
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,420
that this one fits

50
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,900
right inside this one

51
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,459
so this creates a choke point

52
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,620
so

53
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,140
all I have to do is put a three inch

54
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,340
floating ball

55
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,260
in the pipe and as the water rises the

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,720
ball will float up

57
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,920
and get stuck right here and shut off

58
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:06,780
the water flow and capture the first

59
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,480
runoff which is a dirty water to a

60
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,620
to clean the dirt off of the roof before

61
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:16,739
you start capturing

62
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,300
the water then on the bottom I put this

63
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,340
clean out

64
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,080
valve

65
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,420
so this will be right in the bottom like

66
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,879
this and I'll put the ball

67
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,879
the three inch floating ball up in here

68
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,060
all right and then to uh to clean the

69
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,860
captured water out I just take this out

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,860
take the ball and let the dirty water

71
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,860
flow out put the ball back in

72
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:47,480
and put this back on

73
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,480
and ready for the next drain

74
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,620
and I'm going to glue these together

75
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:59,900
I'm going to glue all these together

76
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,900
to make sure there's no leakage

77
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,200
all right at the bottom I have a clean

78
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,159
out valve

79
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,159
or clean out

80
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,260
place

81
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,100
all right and inside this tube

82
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,100
I have

83
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,419
a floating ball

84
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,600
this is just a kids ball that I bought

85
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,340
at the toy store this is I think it's a

86
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,900
three inch three and a half inch ball

87
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,900
that goes up here

88
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,419
all right and this part of the water

89
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,460
collection system is designed to catch

90
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,740
the first runoff

91
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,620
from the roof because the first runoff

92
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,240
is going to be the dirtiest

93
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,660
all right so you want to go ahead and

94
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,880
let the first few minutes of rain wash

95
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,800
off that dirt

96
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,840
comes down here

97
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,440
comes in here

98
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,800
begins to fill up this tube

99
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,740
the ball floats

100
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,919
until it gets to right here and then the

101
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,780
ball chokes It Off

102
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,759
so this keeps the dirty water the

103
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,759
initial runoff it keeps it in here

104
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,960
all right and then at this point water

105
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:30,259
can continue on and of course this part

106
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:35,160
right here

107
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:37,380
will now serve as just a a trap to catch

108
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,759
heavier particles that as it's coming

109
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,680
through here heavier particles May

110
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,139
collect in here and of course these will

111
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:47,060
eventually be cleaned out

112
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,060
all right now the water continues

113
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,780
and it goes into my 375 gallon tote

114
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:03,360
all right here's the next place where

115
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:06,060
the water is filtered this is just a

116
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,740
standard Walmart

117
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,419
strainer

118
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,419
I cut off

119
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,880
the handle and the two little ears here

120
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:19,259
to make it round

121
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,539
this is a standard Walmart Bowl it just

122
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:25,680
happened to be the right size I took my

123
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:29,720
hacks off and saw it off the bottom

124
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,720
put this screen in

125
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,740
I ran some screws through it to make it

126
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,900
really strong because when this gets

127
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,580
dirty what you do is you take it and you

128
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,199
bang it on something like that to knock

129
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,100
the dirt out of it so I wanted to be

130
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,259
really strong I also used

131
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,360
silicone sealant

132
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,280
around here

133
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,020
on both sides

134
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,080
to hold it in

135
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:59,419
I cut this to just the right size

136
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,419
where it fits on my tote

137
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,100
so we need trash

138
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:08,100
that is not caught by the other part of

139
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,139
the system will be caught here

140
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,680
except very small particles that will go

141
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,680
through the screen

142
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,819
all right here's my tote

143
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,940
all right now I was careful to buy a

144
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:28,080
tote that did not have toxic chemicals

145
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,120
in it this was originally a food grade

146
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,479
tote

147
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,280
all right I also wanted one that was UV

148
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,620
protected

149
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,199
all right this tote originally was white

150
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,139
it was UV protected I decided to go

151
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,660
ahead and paint it black all right and

152
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,520
the reason for that is a white tote

153
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,919
allows light to come through and then

154
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,599
you have a lot of algae growing all

155
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,759
right this is one of my old rain barrels

156
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,099
of the past

157
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,580
and I found out that the white rain

158
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,580
barrels

159
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,300
as opposed to the darker ones such as

160
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,400
the blue ones there

161
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,300
the white ones allow sunlight to come

162
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,360
through

163
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,699
algae grows

164
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,099
makes the water really nasty algae grows

165
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,740
on the side the water turns green water

166
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:18,919
gets really nasty all right so for that

167
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,919
reason

168
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:25,020
I painted my totes black

169
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:28,379
and as you see here I live on a slope so

170
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:31,800
I was careful to build a good foundation

171
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:34,020
and level these totes

172
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,260
now another thing I will mention is down

173
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,260
here

174
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,440
all right this is the valve that opens

175
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:55,500
they came on the tote and this is a

176
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,820
valve that I added

177
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,480
all right

178
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,440
I wanted a standard water hose speak it

179
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,600
on here

180
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,540
I chose this particular type as opposed

181
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,519
to the screw in type because this is a

182
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,480
there's a ball in here and when it opens

183
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,060
up

184
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,600
it it completely opens up the area not

185
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,820
just a small spot where trash can get

186
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,940
lodged so I think it's important to use

187
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,339
this type as a ball in here

188
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:28,200
all right now what we started with here

189
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:31,920
with this tote these totes have a unique

190
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:34,500
type of thread on them and it's not easy

191
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,600
to get adapters for that thread so the

192
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,180
best but they are available and this

193
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,339
right here is an adapter all right it

194
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,519
was black I painted it white again for

195
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,260
UV protection where I bought these totes

196
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,880
the fella threw in

197
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,620
this adapter

198
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,860
for free

199
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,680
all right now on that what I have is two

200
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,959
inch PVC threaded that screws on what

201
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,600
this adapter does is it converts this

202
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:04,200
non-standard

203
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,839
PVC thread to a standard two inch pipe

204
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,360
thread all right so this is just the PVC

205
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,080
pipe with threaded PVC pipe available

206
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,080
anywhere

207
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,120
all right and this is a three-quarter

208
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,519
inch

209
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,240
adapter that fits in here in the into

210
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:26,880
this PVC piece to convert your two inch

211
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,899
standard pipe thread to three quarter

212
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:34,440
inch standard pipe thread then to your

213
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,440
water hose spigot

214
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,519
that's my tote

215
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,920
now on the other side

216
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,360
of my property

217
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,360
I have the same thing

218
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,680
so as you can see

219
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:58,040
I am pulling water off of all four

220
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,040
corners

221
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,789
[Music]

222
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,740
I have another

223
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,940
trout here

224
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,940
another clean out

225
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,060
attachment

226
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:39,300
with a ball in it

227
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:42,860
so this catches this much

228
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,860
dirt that comes off of

229
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,680
the roof

230
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:49,079
now my experience has been the more of

231
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,380
this dirt you catch the better

232
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,700
it would actually be better if if this

233
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,920
was bigger where I could even collect

234
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:59,100
more because it takes a lot of water to

235
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,019
wash that initial dirt off of your roof

236
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,640
so if you want to do anything with this

237
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,320
thing right here try to make it hold

238
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,320
more water not less

239
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,079
I have the same thing over here

240
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,600
and

241
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,180
with my two totes together I have the

242
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,579
equivalent of 10.

243
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,579
55 gallon rain barrels

244
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,420
now

245
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,920
the water that comes out of here of

246
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,079
course

247
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,420
um still a little dirty

248
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,720
it's great for water in your garden

249
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,880
saving on your water bill all right but

250
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,200
when if you want to drink this what you

251
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:00,180
want to do is run it through a good

252
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,720
filter and inside the house I have a

253
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,000
um

254
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,639
ceramic type

255
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,980
gravity fed ceramic type

256
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,600
filter that I got from Professor

257
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,240
McKinney

258
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,040
I believe he has the best types of

259
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,540
filters

260
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,700
now

261
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,779
I won't even filter this a little bit

262
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,579
more

263
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:22,980
before I run it through my kitchen

264
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:25,440
filter and the reason for that

265
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,600
is the cleaner you can get the water the

266
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,839
longer your

267
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,620
kitchen filter will last before the

268
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:36,660
ceramic gets clogged up with dirt of

269
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,899
course then you can take a soft

270
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,820
scrubbing pad and you can clean the dirt

271
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:45,000
off of this ceramic filters and keep

272
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,399
them going for indefinitely just about

273
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,459
but in order to keep

274
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,220
that trash off as much as possible when

275
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:55,620
it comes through here there will be

276
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,240
another filtering procedure so maybe

277
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,519
something as simple as running it

278
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,180
through

279
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,399
cheesecloth

280
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,600
just to catch the big pieces of trash

281
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:09,560
that so that they won't clog your

282
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,560
ceramic filter

283
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,160
this is a good little filter

284
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,820
that I like this is on another rain

285
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,820
barrel here

286
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,760
water comes through here runs through

287
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,720
the filter before it goes through the

288
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,399
hose

289
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,880
all right I actually have this this

290
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,700
filter is available on at many

291
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,920
garden supply places

292
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,100
is used with

293
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,440
drip systems

294
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,779
all right

295
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,779
it has a clean out right here

296
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,040
all right what this does

297
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:07,399
is the water flows

298
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,399
through here inside this part here

299
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,779
the water flows

300
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:17,760
from here through here inside this part

301
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:19,920
filters through this very fine screen

302
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,019
and then it's picked up

303
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,899
and goes back through here

304
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:27,420
all right now

305
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,440
an easy way to clean this keep trash off

306
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,320
of it

307
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,139
is the clean out valve right here you

308
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,639
just unscrew that allow some water to

309
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,920
flow through and it goes straight

310
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:40,139
through the inside which is where the

311
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,220
trash is and that's one reason I like

312
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:46,079
this filter is is so easy to clean

313
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,940
so this is one option when you come

314
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,279
right out of your rain barrel

315
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:54,240
to filter to pre-filter your water

316
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:56,120
before you take it in to use with your

317
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,740
about with your best drinking water

318
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,720
water filter

319
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,240
of course otherwise you can have the

320
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,600
water of course rain water is great

321
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,380
we're going into

322
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,380
your garden

323
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,440
here I have some

324
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,420
soaker hoses

325
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,420
and

326
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,660
using rain water saves me

327
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,300
a fortune on my

328
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,839
water bill

329
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:34,190
this is survival dock reminding you be

330
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:53,100
prepared or be prepared to be fleeced
