recommended by the agri-business hubs

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,010
the right varieties match local climate

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,160
and are adapted to low soil fertility

[Music]

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,160
for commercial production use hybrid

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,120
varieties that have

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,079
high yield and are disease tolerant you

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,960
can still use

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,520
open pollinated local variety these are

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,399
often

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
tastier and easier to store due to their

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,320
hard grains

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,840
use late maturity varieties planted at

the beginning of the rainy season

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,320
between 1st and 30th november use medium

maturity varieties

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,079

if you only have late maturity varieties

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,479
plant them very early before 20th

too little rainfall

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
poor soil moisture will lead to poor

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,479
every three to four years test soil

planting this test is especially

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,239
important in high rainfall

areas where soils are naturally acidic

59
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,480
to make sure your soil restores a ph

60
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,080
of 5.5 to 7 apply lime

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,080
three weeks before planting

62
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,520
a field with plenty of crop residues

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,480
will help the soil to stay in place

64
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,640
retain water and become more fertile in

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,160
order to achieve the benefits of crop

residue retention

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,080
discuss with your community and make

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,400
resolutions to improve

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,440

agroforestry and livestock manure

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,640
can all contribute towards improved soil

best mechanization systems for you

86
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,280
for best yields consider planting depth

87
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,239
density and spacing in good rainfall

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,640

limited application of nutrients

97
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,159

between plants

102
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,280
depends on the equipment and the amount

if you are using a jab planter plant one

109
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,760
seed per station for

110
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:15,120

each seed

114
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,919
at equal distance check the field

115
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,639
regularly until

116
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,880
week six if there are weeds lightly

117
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,960
scratch the surface with a hand hole

118
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,440
hand weeder or a cultivator

119
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,440
if you want to use herbicides you must

120
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,000
be trained on how to select

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,199
nozzles and calibrate sprayers by

qualified staff

123
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,639
you can receive more information from

124
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,120
extension officers

125
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,520
and the hub if you are using chemical

126
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,560
fertilizer four weeks after planting

127
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,360
apply urea 20 centimeters away from the

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
plant

129
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,400
covering the urea with soil will help

130
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,520
reduce nitrogen loss from volatilization

131
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,400
in dry weather

132
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,040
and runoff during heavy rain where

133
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,280
possible

134
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,440
the top dressing should be combined with

135
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,479
weeding either using a hole or

136
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,400
cultivator

137
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,199
if you are using minimum tillage

138
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,080
practices use spot application and

139
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,240
cover the area with a hole or make a 10

140
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,039
centimeter deep hole with a stick

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,080
place the urea in the hole and cover

142
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,120
loam soil

143
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,080
apply all the urea at week four

144
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,880
sandy soil apply half of the urea at

145
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,400
week 4

146
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,800
and apply the rest at week 7.

harvest can be done by hand or you can

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,440
