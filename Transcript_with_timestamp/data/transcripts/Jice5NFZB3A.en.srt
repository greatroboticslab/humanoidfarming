it's it's uh

50
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,919
my father bought the farm around about

51
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,840
89

52
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,759
but i grew up in a farm which is

53
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,479
basically next door to the farm that i'm

54
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,560
on

55
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,560
and i was born there and grew up and so

56
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,240
on so i've been in the farming business

57
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,639
for many years

58
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,400
and then i started farming

59
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,400
in 1996 with farm from my father

60
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,160
and then

61
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,840
i

62
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,400
you

63
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,720
know

64
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,720
uh we were still in the culture

65
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,039
[Music]

66
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,600
five years and a few very funny years

67
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,560
where we had you know a lot of crop

68
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,120
losses due to heat waves

69
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,720
during the the flight

70
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,520
of wheat

71
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,080
i

72
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,400
started realizing you know we got to do

73
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,080
something we got to change our methods

74
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,520
and ways of farming and that's when i

75
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,880
started doing

76
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,199
uh going from a mona culture

77
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,680
i went over to

78
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,560
i went and i started

79
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,880
doing medics medics is clovers

80
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,720
where i do the clovers in the one year

81
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,840
and the following year i will do the

82
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,479
wheat

83
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,680
on the specific same land so i went on a

84
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,840
rotation

85
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,039
and and it's been

86
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,280
brilliant it has been it's been

87
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,280
yes

88
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,000
it happened to me because it's nice

89
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,319
thing about the mix is it's

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,599
it's nitrogen fixing

91
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,560
and um

92
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,759
and you can carry so many animals on on

93
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,560
a hectare i mean i have dormers you know

94
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,720
which originate from elsa moon

95
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,680
it's a meat nice mutton

96
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,400
and

97
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,000
i run i can run four

98
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,039
twin dorma u's meaning four u's with

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,280
twins on a hectare and

100
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,280
it's it's just amazing i mean

101
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,599
the the quality

102
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,599
of sheep that comes out of there

103
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,960

104
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:00,000

you know

108
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,199
it's a lifesaver

109
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,280
and because of that um because i was

110
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,039
running the sheep with such good success

111
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,720
you know on the medics

112
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,720

mine to start my own butchery and then

118
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,560
two years ago about two and a half years

119
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,640
ago i i got to the point where i

120
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,720
applied for a license

121
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,360
and we started the friendly farmer

122
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:55,040

123
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,240

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,560
showed me hell of a lot and um

137
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,560

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,760
and i really i

143
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,760
it's been

144
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,240
it's been a long time coming that i

145
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,160
wanted to start a book sharing and like

146
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,640
i said two and a half years ago we got

147
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,320
going and we do deliveries

148
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,600
we don't have any

149
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,120
on the farm um shop where you can come

150
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,360
and buy

151
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,320
due to security reasons and so on you

152
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,600
know and uh so we do the we we do the

153
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,079
deliveries

154
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,839
um we do tape down

155
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,839
uh we do balls

156
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,640
and uh yeah it's been it's been

157
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:22,560
wonderful it really has been good

158
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,920
i certainly saw a hell of a change in my

159
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,880
soil

160
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,160
after going with the medics

161
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,519
it's amazing how much life returned to

162
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,480
the soil

163
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,600
and also with with this change that we

164
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,640
made

165
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,079
we

166
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,880
went into

167
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,519
uh

168
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,720
we started doing um

169
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,680
we got planters where we use the shank

170
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,440
so we we try and do minimum disturbance

171
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,040
of the soil

172
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,040
to try and keep as much moisture

173
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,880
as well when we are doing the week here

174
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,120
like i said the one years we the next

175
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,399
year we have medics the next year we

176
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,640
have wheat again

177
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,399
and i also do other rotation crops as

178
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,920
well i i use oats i do a lot of oats

179
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,560
and

180
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,720
some oats we do for otay

181
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,720
the other oats you know i'm at the

182
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,800
moment i'm actually busy harvesting oats

183
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,480
for seed you know for for for the

184
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,920
co-operandia

185
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,000
and uh and getting a very good yield but

186
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,000
it's important to

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
um

188
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,519
kernels in your in your oats so it's

189
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,120
very important that's why i'm doing oats

190
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,920
at the moment

191
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,800
also we have now the last four years

192
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,160
we've started with um

193
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,279
uh regenerative farming where we take

194
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,800
our swell and and we started doing cover

195
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,040
crops

196
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,920
you know obviously you know my medics is

197
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,959
is of such nice quality and it's it's it

198
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,120
grows you know in abundance you know

199
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,240
however nicely so

200
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,560
that to me is also a cover crop because

201
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,360
in the summer and when the medics goes

202
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,279
down and goes and lies down my my soil

203
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,440
is basically covered you know

204
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,240
and and we do

205
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,079
we also bring it in other cover crops we

206
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,720
do

207
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,720
a little bit of this

208
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,959
that the medics can also

209
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,839
come through and and you know

210
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,240
leave it spurs and everything and and

211
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,240
i'll find it absolutely amazing it was

212
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,240
incredible

213
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,560
it started getting its own life how the

214
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,560
earthworms came in

215
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,240
and started burrowing

216
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,920
and i always say to the people whenever

217
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,839
i walk they always say look at this look

218
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,720
at this earthworm life because those are

219
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,800
my plans those are my is what what is

220
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,200
you know doing the thing

221
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,160
and and i think i personally that's the

222
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,200
way i've gone and i'm i'm on a rate of

223
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,200
of

224
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,200
38

225
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,320
are

226
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,720
going in at about 110 kilograms of

227
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,240
nitrogen on their wheatlands you know so

228
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,320
yeah i mean that's something is very

229
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,560
easy like you know you can just see what

230
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,240
you know what lies in it and i've in

231
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,959
fact just finished harvesting my week

232
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,519
for this year and it was an amazing crop

233
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,360
i must i must say that for the last six

234
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,320
years we've really had tough times so

235
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,199
we've had chance last year wasn't too

236
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,600
bad

237
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,000
but we had a bit of of

238
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,120
the frost you know during the flowering

239
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,440
season

240
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,720
but the last six years was really it was

241
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,160
tough but

242
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,920
this year was amazing and i'm i'm sorry

243
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,040
that's great i'm happy for you but stop

244
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,040
me if i talk too much

245
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,839
no it's okay i mean we want information

246
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,160
right and um

247
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,160
my question then is you know it sounds

248
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,160
like you've you know dabbled a bit in a

249
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,399
number of different crops you know for

250
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,360
the purpose of crop rotation and when

251
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,000
you're going through these processes as

252
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,920
a farmer you know um

253
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,279
who are the people that you'd sit down

254
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,920
and talk to

255
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,959
to assist you to say like who made made

256
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,199
you say uh now you need the specific

257
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,279
crop to rotate with weed

258
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,800
wheat for example sorry um and um

259
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,199
how did you come about doing that

260
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,880
research you know um so just in case

261
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,320
maybe people in the audience are

262
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,639
thinking yes i wanna do crop rotation

263
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,240
but i don't know what to rotate my crops

264
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,720
with so how do you find a good

265
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,560
companionship with the kind of crops

266
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,480
that you're farming which first of all

267
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,240
was wheat um

268
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,320
so that you could you know rotate and

269
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,320
obviously grow your enterprise so at

270
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,560
what point did you make that decision

271
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,959
and who are the type of people did you

272
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,720
liaise with to maybe see if this idea

273
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,519
would work or not

274
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,199
yeah

275
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,639
um

276
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,040
here in the western coast you know i

277
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,079
always say in the area that you that you

278
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,320
are farming you know

279
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,320
it's very

280
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,760
what

281
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,399
do they do there is a success

282
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,399
right

283
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,480
and the agriculture the western

284
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,440
agricultural union

285
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,240
that

286
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,199
they have a very close to us about 30-40

287
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,399
kilometers away they've got a a farm

288
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,759
there where from elsenberg they

289
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:58,000
they do a whole lot of um

290
00:15:53,759 --> 00:16:00,639
trials you know doing basically canola

291
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,920
doing loop and doing oats doing the

292
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,240
medics

293
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,399
different variety of medics

294
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,959
and then the rotational crop and then

295
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,360
you have companies like agricult

296
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,240
and you have barrenburg you know that

297
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,079
come and they do it on this um on this

298
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,560
farm that is that is owned by the the

299
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,839
western cape agriculture

300
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,519
from elsenberg and and and they all do

301
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,440
their little trials there and all

302
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,320
different type of trials you know and

303
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,320
then

304
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,519
what they also do is and it's and it's

305
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,320
it's um it's called this

306
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,800
uh it's normally in september beginning

307
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,279
of september they have a

308
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,279
and the farmers day

309
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,880
everybody's interested comes along and

310
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,720
we have a look

311
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,440
what are the varieties that are doing

312
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,600
good what you know what

313
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,399
what should you do next year

314
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,480
for your area which is which to me that

315
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,920
that's that's basically where

316
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,120
we

317
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,680
you learn a lot of things you know

318
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,360
because you can see what happens and i

319
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,319
think that's the important thing about

320
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,000
it also

321
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,880
i have a company that i do you know

322
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,880
the guy helps me with my fertilizer and

323
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,880
you know what to do and so on um

324
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,960
you know and i think i think that's the

325
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,120
biggest thing of all you must minimize

326
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,880
your risk by

327
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,280
going in with the least inset

328
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,760
but the best outside you know and the

329
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,280
best quality and i think that is very

330
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,080
important

331
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,880
and

332
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,679
quite honest with you i think

333
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,919
there's a little bit of a

334
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,640
you know if you if you if you see the

335
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,080
the quality of wheat that we get from

336
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,400
from our

337
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,880
medic system you know

338
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,559
uh we

339
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,760
and we specifically i also do um my

340
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:11,039
model that is is um i try and do

341
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,840
biological farming with my fertilizer

342
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,840
where i use a chicken

343
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,679
and and then of course nitrogen and it's

344
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,160
all in the little fertilizer little

345
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,000
little chicken you know manure pool they

346
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,559
they do it in a pool form

347
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,840
and then we sew but to me the big

348
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,400
disappointment is

349
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,400
that

350
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,559
as a farmer i don't get

351
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,320
because the quality of wheat that

352
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,799
produce doing

353
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,799
farming

354
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,559
you know from the malayan i think that's

355
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,400
but i i think it's something that's

356
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,440
that's that's going to happen soon you

357
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,240
know where

358
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,600
when people are now starting move the

359
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,720
quality of wheat that they get

360
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,880
as to other wheat that has for instance

361
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,039
you know had a lot of nitrogen and so on

362
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,559
i mean it's just a better quality you

363
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,400
know yeah so hopefully that's

364
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,360
and and also

365
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,559
and also we uh

366
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,880
you know we we we in dire straits for

367
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,000
next year you know with

368
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,640
the first

369
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,200
so unbelievably high

370
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,480
so fortunately you know i'm on my system

371
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,559
of farming

372
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,679
where i go with the low insets

373
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,120
and i just bring my wrist down and and

374
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,400
and that i do

375
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,200
my friends

376
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,440
uh

377
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,360
this friend of mine who you know who who

378
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,400
does my fertilizer and then of course

379
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,360
you know we use pesticides we have to

380
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,400
um

381
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,440
and then i try and lay away from things

382
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,400
like ronda i try i don't always

383
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,880
but i try my best you know to to to sort

384
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,440
of keep that out of my system

385
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,559
yeah yeah you know typically traditional

386
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,559
farming is uh

387
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,080
sorry to interject there typically

388
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,760
traditional farming is um you know

389
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,320
heavily reliant on pesticides and

390
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,480
chemicals and fertilizers and it sounds

391
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,640
like you've obviously adopted like a

392
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,480
biological approach as you've said do

393
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,760
you think that you've seen a significant

394
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,280
amount of

395
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,080
um

396
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,919
operational reduction in terms of the

397
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,840
expenses that you would have ordinarily

398
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,440
paid for

399
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,520
when if you had gone you know the

400
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,320
traditional farming methods now that

401
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,640
you've adopted a more of a regenerative

402
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,799
farming or biological approach as you've

403
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,320
put it so do you think that

404
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,720
with going with a different approach

405
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,960
maybe deviating a slightly from

406
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,799
traditional farming methods to rather

407
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,679
care more for your soil

408
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,880
have you seen a a change in your

409
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:04,080
business operational expenses where they

410
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,080
have reduced perhaps

411
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,400
yeah yeah definitely i mean without a

412
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,840
doubt i mean

413
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,000
my diesel my you know my fuel account

414
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,600
i think has been halved from what it

415
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,720
used to be you know

416
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,120
and um

417
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,039
my fertilizer i mean

418
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,039
they used to build in here with you know

419
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,600
full of fertilizer

420
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,000
i have one truck of city city tons that

421
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,280
comes in and does my

422
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,520
and and

423
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,720
and this is amazing you know it's

424
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,520
you know from

425
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,240
from those years to now i would say i

426
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,919
think there was a reduction of about

427
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,039
close on to 40 percent in usage of of of

428
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,080
fuel

429
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,480
and fertilizer definitely yeah

430
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,799
yeah one thing from your from your

431
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,520
experience causes the shift for farmers

432
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,600
just to think slightly differently from

433
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,840
traditional farming practices is it

434
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,559
things that happen in the economy or you

435
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,200
know like high fuel prices or high input

436
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,679
cost prices or is it because maybe over

437
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,159
the years farmers are starting to become

438
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,640
uh thinking yes definitely much more

439
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,480
long-term to say how do i preserve my

440
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,559
soil and therefore how do i find

441
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,640
companion plants to

442
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,360
to ensure that my soil you know could

443
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,760
last generations to come if i'm still

444
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,320
you know producing in this one specific

445
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,640
uh farm or piece of land so what do you

446
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,120
think causes the farmers to make that

447
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,720
shift um you know to to to to to to

448
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,120
focus a lot more on the production

449
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,080
practices is it the economy is it the

450
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,440
the push from high input costs or is it

451
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,919
just do you think that farmers are

452
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,640
becoming slightly more conservative

453
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,880
rather um um

454
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,240
with regards to the environment etc and

455
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,400
you know people are starting to just

456
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,640
make certain changes

457
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,120
yeah

458
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,960
molly um i think the

459
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,640
the thing that is really hitting home

460
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,520
now

461
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,120
is is is the weather you know

462
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,240
yeah

463
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,080
it's been amazing the last

464
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,520
five six years

465
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,840
to see what global warming and and

466
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,280
i believe in global warming i have

467
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,919
experienced it myself

468
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,640
[Music]

469
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,400
we have a september month it's very very

470
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,720
important that's when

471
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,520
just after the week's flight

472
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,480
and it's it it's little it's a little

473
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,559
grey you know it must get was set now

474
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,320
and and we just haven't had september

475
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,279
months we we just don't have rain in

476
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,360
september again yeah you know lately

477
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,440
and and i put it on to global warming

478
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,880
and global warming has made it that you

479
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,840
must absolutely at all cost you must try

480
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,960
and preserve as much moisture in the

481
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:00,799
ground as possible that means you don't

482
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,799
open the up you don't open it up

483
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,760
you must turn your will as little as

484
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:09,039
possible and i think that together with

485
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,919
the cost of insect costs and everything

486
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:14,720
as really i think um

487
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,679
for me that was my game changer because

488
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,000
i

489
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,400
i just i just thought to myself i just

490
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
thought my own eyes that if i wasn't

491
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,720
going to make a change i wasn't going to

492
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,720
be on the farm for very long so that is

493
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,120
what i did and i go with the lowest

494
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,840
insets as as possible

495
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,000
and

496
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,000
and

497
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,600
at the end of the day that is what it's

498
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,200
about you know making a profit and um

499
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,720
yeah and that's what's changed and

500
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,840
incidentally you know what really

501
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,440
changed my my mind as well i can

502
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,320
remember um you know when you when you

503
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,279
drive along the fence

504
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,840
you don't

505
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,600
on the fence this is like a half a meter

506
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,080
this side half of me to that side that

507
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,799
you you never work there

508
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,360
and

509
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,880
everything that grows on next to the

510
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,320
fence you know

511
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,440
it's always

512
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,159
looks lush and if there's a little weak

513
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:15,600
kernel that falls there or a medic

514
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:18,960
it grows with so much power and why

515
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:23,840
it gets disturbed you understand and

516
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,840
that is why i say i try and just

517
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,840
as little as possible i don't burn my

518
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,919
lands a lot of people still around here

519
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,679
they burn the stubble because they're

520
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,080
doing the murder culture

521
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,080
culture

522
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,520
the writings to take place that's why

523
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,159
they got to put on like closer than 100

524
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,559
kilograms of nitrogen whereas i go i

525
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,440
don't burn it at all i don't disturb it

526
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,840
because

527
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,279
my material must go into my swell and

528
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,080
that's the only way that you're going to

529
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,080
get your carbon

530
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,200
and one content in your soil goes up

531
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,480
then the penetration of water is so much

532
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,960
better for the soil and that's what what

533
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,720
what set me going i think all those

534
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,600
things together you know

535
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,440
yeah

536
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,760
yeah my last question for you this

537
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,799
evening luffy is um you know you've

538
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,480
mentioned monoculture right and um for

539
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,799
anybody listening and thinking wow

540
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,960
there's monocots culture and this crop

541
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,640
rotation and you're farming weeds you're

542
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,840
farming medics you're farming something

543
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,159
else um in between that um all for the

544
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,320
purpose of crop rotation is it fair to

545
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,880
say that the crop rotation practices and

546
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,039
methods become slightly more expensive

547
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,360
as opposed to monoculture because in

548
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,279
monoculture you're controlling expenses

549
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,960
you know year after year you're farming

550
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,480
a single crop

551
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,480
where you can control your expenses

552
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,880
control your input costs whereas crop

553
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,000
rotation each crop requires something

554
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,760
different and it could be different

555
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,880
fertilizers etc so is it true maybe to

556
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,559
uh to think that maybe crop rotation um

557
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,240
will be slightly more expensive than

558
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,679
monoculture or does it not make a

559
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,480
difference at all

560
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,200
no no not at all especially what i'm

561
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,000
doing with my medics you know my clovis

562
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,279
what

563
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,279
i started

564
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,279
um

565
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,080
because because i let the clover develop

566
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,919
the first year the second year it gets

567
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,039
wet the third year when it's clover

568
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,559
again

569
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,640
you know it comes up naturally in the

570
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,480
winter so

571
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,039
it's a once off it's a once or thin

572
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,760
it's quite expensive the seed because

573
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,159
everything comes from australia you know

574
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,760
and so it's quite expensive to start off

575
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,000
with one

576
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,000
sort

577
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,760
you

578
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:04,000
look after your your phosphate flux on

579
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,600
which which you correct in the in the

580
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,919
year of the wheat you know where you put

581
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,640
your phosphates down and so on and and

582
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,640
and if your ph is fine then it's a once

583
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,960
off thing and it's just there every

584
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,200
second year you have this most amazing

585
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,919
medics you know that you can either

586
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,080
harvest or you can use it for

587
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,360
for your animals to graze on

588
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:31,200
oats oats to me is is also a very very

589
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:34,559
nice rotation crop

590
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,520
oats have an amazing root system

591
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,039
which

592
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,320
i think

593
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,120
it's

594
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,159
it's it's conducive to i think magnesium

595
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,720
gets

596
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,440
you know put into the swell

597
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,360
which takes a lot of the

598
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,760
i don't know what the english word is

599
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,760
for all

600
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,240
of

601
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,240
them

602
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,960
which is amazing i i like to do the the

603
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:20,399
japanese radish

604
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,279
it's it's like a whole radish a huge

605
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,360
and it breaks up your soil you know so

606
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,760
so if you have compact swellings on and

607
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,880
you do the radish it breaks the swell it

608
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,279
is it it's like a it's like a twine you

609
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,880
know that you when you when you plot it

610
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,559
it sort of does the same thing it

611
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,399
loosens up your swell

612
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,960
that's also very nice

613
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,120
and then lupins i i i forgot to tell you

614
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,640
about lupine's lupines also it's got a

615
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,559
nice pen root

616
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,039
so it also penetrates that swell you

617
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,640
know so it loosens the soil and it's

618
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,520
also a

619
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,440
nitrogen fixing you know which your

620
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,880
following yeah you know you can cut back

621
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,960
on your nitrogen

622
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,320
application to your wheat

623
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:06,080
and uh yeah that's it

624
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,799
and what is it what is amazing is

625
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,440
yeah i wish i would just one more thing

626
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,200
i wish you could see this the sheep on

627
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,440
the medic now

628
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,000

629
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,000
the man

630
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,600
i think that the

631
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,440
nice crust that they have on their legs

632
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,520
nice thick bone structures and

633
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,320
everything it's just

634
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,000
to me it's the best thing off the sliced

635
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,720
bread

636
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,200

luffy smiths from the friendly farmer

670
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,519
butchery um he's a farmer in the western

671
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,840
cape and we're speaking about

672
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,720
traditional farming methods that one can

673
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,640
adopt for the purpose of crop rotation

674
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,120
and luffy informed us that he's a weed

675
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,240
farmer but also has you know dabbled a

676
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,480
bit to medics in clover and also gave us

677
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,720
some gems about you know planting

678
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,000
radishes to improve your soil and what

679
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,960
it is it does to your soil um from

680
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,640
farming and all these have obviously

681
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,880
created a great impact in his business

682
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,159
because he has now reduced his input

683
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,640
costs um and also we all i think just

684
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,159
