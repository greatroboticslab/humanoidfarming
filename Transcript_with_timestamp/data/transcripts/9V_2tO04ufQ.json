  "text": "is the first day after our horses came home we're gonna shoot a morning routine we don't even know what our routine is yet but Sophie and I are gonna do it you have to listen to me yeah because I have stuff planned out do you have stuff Linda we feed them I put honey in our stalls to eat and then I put Willow Chino and let me bring storm out and then we put honey back up okay I did not catch any of that okay so you guys know Sam and Sophie usually do morning chores I told Sam stay in bed sleep in as long as you want and Sophia and I will do chores today because it's only three steps from our house and because I'm excited to see our horses so let's go see them I think that's the same thing so if you watched our nighttime routine then this is just basically that but in reverse we left all the doors open last night so it'll be nice and cool in here today's job I have so many plans for today [Laughter] all right we're gonna let Sophie lead because she knows what to do she knows like but they're kind of visiting so Penny doesn't love any other horse ever if she's gonna love if there's any horse in this world that she loves it's him and I'm praying for a day they're back together again here give me storms wear storms oh wow Chino you ate all that hay and you pooed he's just staring at his girl he's like I don't care about food Penny's like I don't care about my food while she cares about her food I want to see how he did in this stall did you like it storm he didn't eat much of his hay pooped in it drink some water lay down I see some some shavings in his tail we'll get him more savings today how was it Chino eat your food man so like I said this is going to be open up eventually we're just gonna like increase the horse's time on grass slowly because I don't want them to go from like 12 hours to 24 hours just like that yeah you're just let her stand right out here I can even close this door oh if she'll go to our food yeah that's your food we'll put stalls we'll put mats in there today we have a lot to do still oh yeah she can't get out from here what the heck and if she gets out she'll just be in her normal field yeah like even if you did open that while I don't know oh yeah I guess because they're not going to run out and leave their food watch honey yeah honey what are you doing honey is such a Honey hi handsome you settle down so we are watching them on the cameras last night everybody seemed happy everybody seemed fine we try to keep our routine exactly the same as we did at the old place I love those doors oh my gosh they're stunning oh what's happening wait a minute this is not you get back in there and eat your food get back in there I have to close her in oh storm no get your face away from her butt that my friends is why they put bars on the doors she let Willow out Willow goes with Chino now she's coming we know you don't want to be alone oh you could probably go out see if I had a hook here and I had your uh your rope I could probably lead you out so being able to do this I'm just going to use pennies um like being able to come out here and see what we need is gonna help so we definitely need our a hook on Storm's door so if you can't catch Willow now storm no we're not going that way this is the house of many gates you'll get you'll get used to it should I let storm out or not yet okay because he doesn't isn't in a field with with Willow so it won't go bad it won't go well storm came right into this farm and put his butt up against that wood wall and just started scratching wait storm we gotta wait for Sophie so your plan did not go to plan our brains are still sleeping it's 7 A.M or Willow she just wants to be with her girls and they will be so I've been explaining this to people but this is going to be their winter field so once rainy season happens in just a couple of weeks and just so excited poor thing so once rainy season happens um the horses will trample this to death especially right here and there will probably be like a little bit of grass down there she's still there uh oh I lost honey oh crap don't ever leave me in charge even though he tries to herd Gracie she's his best friend and you know what's weird they have the same personality oh so she just went out into that little area out there come on you can go for grass now little mini [Music] push Penny around [Music] they're both leaders in their own way she's she's like a standoffish leave me alone leader and he's uh I'm the boss of you it's kind of oh Penny must be coming into heat because this doesn't ever happen Penny does not get close to horses and storm always leaves her alone so something's going on [Music] you're crazy for saying interesting story people have been suggesting that we use this room for a wash doll and the flooring like when this stuff gets wet it's a nuisance it gets stuck on everything it is annoying but then someone today said put mats out here and I was thinking oh my gosh I don't know how that would be for winter like in snow and and stuff no I love the idea so we can put cross rails out here or we could put cross ties out here we could literally make this into the coolest washed all ever it would be in out of the Sun the hoses here we could put a shelf up there and put all of our shampoos and all of our stuff out there for summer like this could be our summer on our horses I think would love it anyway it's definitely something that I think we can do I need to get all this stuff out of here and that's going to be a job that I am working on I absolutely am working on this like I haven't been for the few last few days but I'm gonna get it all out all right so our morning routine also consists of cleaning up the bar and cleaning up the Stalls there's a lot of poop everywhere getting grain ready for tonight throwing hay for these two um but I'm not going to show all that because you guys know what that looks like because we have more morning chores to do horses are not our only chore in the morning so we're gonna do all those things and then we're going to show you our next step I do want to say that even though the horses are home this Barn is Not By Any Means finished we have like I want to put up some stands or some shelving and some hooks so that everything is Within Reach like Sophie has her bag over there and it works out perfect there holy heck it is hot today you guys anyway I want to do all I want to get it all set up so that it looks like a barn step two in morning chores is letting our goats out but apparently they got out in the night regardless Sophie did it up five these Vines will trip you so clearly they don't need to be locked up at night they were watching us with the horses they're like oh I see you there Ellie be careful yeah Ellie Don't Go Near them Ellie tried to leave her in the house she is so tiny she can sneak right out like we have a whole routine of how we keep Ellie in the house when we don't want her out here she's right staying right with me though okay she didn't get trampled she got charged these are your dogs actually because of Miss Tilly Tilly and Rosie Tilly and Rosie so I don't know how they got out but they got out hopefully the cat didn't come on Ellie Center the fence at least Ellie's gone hopefully go look and make sure because they seem very suspiciously interested I abandoned Ellie boy so see how good he is he like runs free in the barn all day all night and then during the day when we have the doors open we leave them in here we make sure he has lots of food lots of water and every time we come down to uh do the goats which is often um I come down here like 30 times a day yeah we come down here like 30 times a day but when we do come down we come and we visit him we spend time with him we give him treats today's not my day today's not my day either I'm grumpy sorry Sophie so we come and we visit Ollie and we make sure he has lots of food and water and he's got good he's all good yeah it's lots of scratches he's shedding we should get a brush and brush him he probably really love it everybody like any was never like that before so what I wanted to say is that we moved him from the other Barn where the dogs are always running in and out to down here and he is obsessed he loves this Barn he's so much more confident he runs free all night long stays in here during the day I might have to get a fan today it's hot but this Barn is way way cooler than the other Barn so much happier down here too so much happier and like someone said um he'll take care of like all the rodents and stuff down in this barn and then Ellie will take care of them from another barn oh goodness did you tie this in a knot what the heck did you do it well you're gonna have to go out there and get that open because I do not know what you did grab the scissors there's no scissors in this Barn we are going to make like a first aid kit for this Barn or a kit of things we need we're gonna get things to hang up down here we have a lot of stuff that we have to do not work to be honest I think leaving them out leaving that door open all night is probably a million times better than them trying to get through the door and hurting themselves do you want me to do it it's not my good day it's not my good day either I don't know if you guys can see Ellie watch on the other side of the gate Ellie is afraid of nothing the goats we give them they even run for me anymore yeah we give them little bits of grain to bring them close to us to make them friendly she's like I know that when I'm held I get grained hi I think you miss him so cute we're really careful about how much cream we give the boy he he's the heaviest like he he's gonna be neutered soon he's gonna get fixed really really soon Ellie's out there she came through she's like I need to get to my mom I try not to bring Ellie down here because the goats think that she's put her on this side of the gate although the door's open you're okay might I add that all these chores are done before we even have breakfast before we're even awake yesterday I noticed that penny is definitely unsettled here she doesn't understand fully like what's happening and she's nervous and she if she hears me outside she always puts her body somewhere where she's close and she can see me so she often hangs out in this field or like no matter where I am if I look out she's close to me last on the list we haven't even done like actual chores yet like clean I need to go have a drink first because it's hot it's only going to be hot later hotter later though there are a lot of things that we still have to finish on our on this area we're still making uh room for our duck and Goose but everybody wants it out in the morning there you go everybody's got water any eggs everybody's got food [Applause] [Music] hello hi Zoey you know come here come here come here dude who was that all right so she's gonna take them to their area I use this trash can and the shovel and I just scoop out their shavings during the night before they're hay they're bedding from the night before and then I dump it and it's so easy these guys need water cleaning out the deck and the goose is so easy I literally scoop it three scoops and it's out and then I dump it I am going to get them fresh water clean their water buckets for tonight also get baby chicken water also on the agenda today we're going to clean the the duck pond the little pool I know that it can get dirtier than that and be okay for decks but I like it to be clean I was paranoid I was checking out all nights on the camera look and he's lying down oh I wonder they love it Willow's in the corner and Gracie's there that looks like honey oh is that on any problems can you get a picture of that and save it for me oh is it picture she's not laying down right now I know but I wanted to see them like that's the only reason we kept that awful dirt in there is because it was a that's at 4 30 in the morning yeah I knew that they would love it like I have tick tocks coming out soon where our horses are rolling in that dirt anyway lots to do more to see stick around subscribe before more Barn Renovations because there's a lot of barn Renovations coming up on our Channel we're gonna make our tack room and that Barn so user friendly and so horse friendly that you will be shocked uh how much we've how much we've learned and how far we've come from the people who never had horses before and now we're setting up our barn so that our horses are the most comfortable they can be [Music]",
