  "text": "hey hey what's up garden friends jeff here how's everybody doing i hope you're doing well i am great kind of a rainy drizzly day out here so doing things from under the umbrella the broken umbrellas hopefully that'll provide the protection needed to do this thing and not destroy the camera sitting out here with a whole bunch of lovely plants on the table ones that i'm really excited to talk about really common plants ones that i do get questions about fairly often the and amanda villas diplodenia mandevillas both of them are fantastic plants they make great annuals they're really good perennials where they can be perennial i love these plants for their beautiful glossy green foliage their abundance of flowers these plants will flower and flower and flower they just keep growing and they're very low fuss they don't need an awful lot they don't need deadheading fertilizing should be minimal with them the pollinators love these plants and they can be used as fillers spillers climbers lots and lots and lots of versatility with how the plants can be utilized you would think that because they're pretty easy and simple to grow that that means this should be a short video there's not a tent to say about them and that might be the case i'm going to go over the quick care for people who don't want like a long video and don't need a ton of details about the plants they just know what to do with them i'll do the quick care shortly here and then it just go over like the differences between mandevillas diplodinius some tips for care and just go a little bit more in depth about some of the nuances propagation leaf drop yellowing those sorts of things let's hit that quick care for starters diplodinias and mandevillas carrie's gonna be pretty much identical for these two plants we'll talk about why later they're typically regarded as hardy zones nine and up some sources will say zone ten they don't like cold weather and frost so if you have frost and colds probably not gonna be a perennial for you maybe they will be go over that a little bit more in depth later but for part to full sun they are sun lovers but in areas with really dry air some afternoon shade might be a good idea just to help avoid the foliage getting kind of burnt up and crispy they like their soil to stay consistently moist but if you let the top inch to two inches of soil dry out between waterings that's usually okay once these are established if you're growing them in the ground they can be very drought tolerant they aren't going to be as demanding for watering if you have them in the ground versus in a pot gonna need to water them more if they're in a pot personally i don't do a ton when it comes to fertilizing these plants too much nitrogen can inhibit flowering so i just make sure that there's a good continuous release fertilizer with them when i pop them up and then usually i'll repeat that maybe three months later mid-summer give them just a little bit more of the top dressing size is really variable with these plants that's a hard one to talk about generally the diplodinies are going to be smaller with more rounded habit the mandevilla the vines those are going to vine up to 10 feet if not more like they can find more than that just depends on which type you're growing because there are a lot of different cultivars out there these are plants that don't particularly mind being pop-bound i really only re-pop these plants when it gets to a point where i've noticed that when i water them they're not really responding to being watered when it's difficult to keep them hydrated that's when it's time to repot or if you notice roots growing off the top and bottom of the pot that's another good way to tell sap can cause skin irritation so maybe wear gloves the toxicity on them is considered low but can cause problems so keep it away from curious mouths just to be safe there it is fun easy plants that's like essentially everything you need to know about growing them they're not too fussy what's the difference between a mandevilla and a diplodynia i have all of them here in front not all there are tons of different diplodinius and mandevillas but i have diplodynia and mandevilla here on the table diplodinias tend to have more of a mounded growth habit to them so if you put them up against something you can train them to climb but they're not going to climb very much whereas amanda villa like over here see nice big mandevilla that's a vine they are going to climb and climb and climb they come in all different colors and leaf shapes like you can see this mandevilla in the back is the more classic mandevilla has much much much larger leaves on it and larger flowers they don't flower quite as prolifically as the other ones that have the smaller flowers like i just showed but their leaves are so cool i really like both of them this one right here i believe is an alice dupont but i'm not positive which is just a classic form of mandavilla that's been around for a long time this other one i think it just said like pink i don't know what kind it is it's a pink mandevilla and then over here i absolutely love this one that's back here where's its tag i can show you the tag that is the sun parasol apricot which is like only kind of in focus this particular one the flowers start off this fun peachy or apricot like color it's a very light light pinkish orange and then they fade to a kind of a creamy light yellow color i enjoy that a lot because you get multiple colors on one plant there's no such thing as an ugly mandevilla or diplodinia they're all beautiful plants the mandevillas also will often times have larger flowers on them like you see back here with alice dupont that's not always as true anymore though because there's so many cultivars that have come out that have that like you see the flowers right here on this manda villa are essentially identical to this diplodonia right here see that they're basically the same flower the leaves are even pretty similar too they're native to central america and i believe parts of northern south america so those are the main differences some difference in flower size depending on the cultivar but it's mostly mandevillas or vines whereas diplodinias are more like little shrubs all diplodinias are in the mandevilla family and that's why they care on them is basically the same there will be some differences because well one's a vine and sometimes you have to take some different things into consideration with vines like if you have them planted up against the wall you don't want afternoon sun on them because they could get baked they could get kind of crispy particularly with the ones like the amabilis types or the alice dupont that have those really big leaves sometimes in the afternoon sun that can be an issue if there's a big reflective surface nearby or right behind them and then with the diplodinius sometimes their growth can end up being somewhat stringy it'll look like it wants to vine you can either cut that off to encourage the plant to keep staying bushy or you can go ahead and put a support behind it and let it do a little bit of vining but again it's not going to be anything like on the actual mandevillas those are going to vine far far far more aggressively than a diplodynia some diplodinius have been hybridized and cultivated well enough that like they hopefully won't even do that they'll just maintain their bushy shape they're plants that do appreciate the warmth they like get pretty toasty when temperatures drop below 45 degrees fahrenheit i try and make sure to cut back on the watering i'm much more cautious with the amount of moisture around their roots because they're going to be more prone to rotting if it's cool and if they're damp too much fertilizer too much nitrogen can inhibit their flowering it can also sometimes cause some discoloration on the foliage though i'll go over a leaf drop in yellow and leaves and all that here in a moment less sun is also going to mean less flowers so they can go part to full sun but the more sun they get the more they're going to flower depending on where you live afternoon sun might be a bit much for them so just keep an eye out i generally prefer these get some filtered sun in the afternoon and just bright direct sun in the morning time but my yard there's a lot of pavement and brick and lots of reflective surfaces so that's why sometimes i have issues with scorching i see these planted out as annuals all over the place where i live and they get bright bright bright direct sun all day long and they're totally fine so it's gonna be somewhat region specific that's why i said you just kind of have to evaluate your area i already mentioned they don't need to be repotted very often they kind of like to be root bound but one thing to keep in mind with them particularly with the mandevilla the vine more than the diplodynia is to be cautious about right where that root or not the root right where the stem comes to the soil when you're repotting the plant it's a good idea to keep that really well supported when you re-pop these when you pull this out from its can if there's too much disturbance in this area and in the root zone in general they're going to be far more prone to leaf drop to dropping some leaves and throw in a fit when they get repotted so it is helpful with these vines to try and disturb the roots as little as possible when repotting them if the roots are wrapped and twisted root bound then you might want to go ahead and give them a little tickle and try and loosen that up and just break up that circling habit but you don't have to go too aggressively with it just lightly try and loosen it up and that's only if it's really really like hardcore wrapped in a circle would i do that otherwise i try my best to just maintain whatever root shape is there plop it into a new pot with maybe a couple of inches of extra space on the outside diameter refill with an all-purpose potting mix that is generally fine for them they aren't nutrient hog so they do okay with that water them in and they're good to go and a little bit of continuous sweet fertilizer they appreciate that i already talked about that the diplodonius and mandevillas oh hello camera both of them do propagate very easily m cuttings from green growth put some breeding hormone on it pop it into a moist soil and they should take off or you can take the growth and wear it onto a fresh soil that maintains moisture cut a little notch in there maybe use a rooting hormone and bury where you made that cut and that should take root and the plant will take off from there and you can sever it and keep it going that way that way you don't have to risk losing the cutting it'll just keep getting some nutrient from the plant while getting rooted really simple to do but a lot of these are trademarked and owned because they've been cultivated always put a lot of hard work and time into coming up with their own varieties of diplodonia's mandevillas so it's a good idea to check the legality behind doing that if you want to propagate them particularly for resale right like somebody else owns it so gotta be careful there i've never had many pest issues with diplodonia's or mandavillas but they can't be prone to just the commonpass aphids whiteflies uh smealybug i haven't heard much about scale comment down below and let us know what problems you've had with them if any i really i haven't had any issues that i can think of as far as pests are concerned with them even when i've taken them in the house for the winter time still they generally just kept on going the mealybugs and everything else usually stay away from them however i have a lot of plants so that could just mean that i have other plants around that the mealybugs favor so that so my experience there doesn't really mean anything like i said comment down below so we can all learn together from that one the main things they had to ask about with them is leaf drop or yellowing their cold hardiness and overwintering indoors beef trap is a complicated one there can be a lot of different causes for it so i'm just going to run through all the different possibilities the different things that could be causing them to drop their leaves for starters there's root rot which would typically mean the plant has been over watered or just the roots have been overly disturbed that can cause leaf drop and yellowing as well over watering will cause yellowing correct or inconsistent fertilizing and watering that can also cause yellowing and also just excessive fertilizer that can cause issues with the foliage and the flowering as well cold temperatures that's another possibility extreme changes in temperature if you have them indoors they're near a draft that could be a problem this is really big for leaf drop and leaf yellow wings there are a lot of different causes that could be going on there's the process of eliminations figuring that one out when growing them indoors i make sure that these get as much sun as possible like basically all day long so a south south fest facing window i'm probably keeping them a foot or two away from the window especially in winter if it's really cool and drafty and i don't water them at all the same during winter as i do during the summer i just give them a little drink maybe like every 10 days or so just let it go through the pot about once and i let the top two to sometimes even four inches maybe up to 50 of the soil dry out it's one of those things you kind of have to watch the plant they'll get a little bit wilty and let you know when they need to be watered and then you can kind of learn the routine and the habit of the plant and how often you'll need to water it it'll get a little bit more leggy and kind of funky looking when you have them in the house if you have really long winters like i do but when i bring them back outside give them a cut back and get them into the sun and they pop right back out and look wonderful as far as overwintering them is concerned oh i'm almost out of memory i'm going to go through this really fast as far as overwintering them is concerned they don't like frost they don't like cold temperatures it's why they're hardy zone 9 or 10 and up but if you have really short winters like maybe just a month or so you can usually mulch about the first foot or so of stem coming out of the ground and then when the heat returns pull that back and sometimes the growth will come back out of there i know people who have had these in zone 8 like 8b and they've returned for them okay that's it lovely beautiful plants comment down below what's your experience with mandevillas and diplodinias let us know i love talking to everybody do you have favorite colors favorite varieties what do you use them for i love them for the hummingbirds i like to have them all over the place they're just all around just excellent plants they're beautiful fun and easy to grow all right hope everybody's doing well having a great day and a great life and everything just going beautifully for you and of course as always and most importantly everybody keep on growing bye [Music] you",
