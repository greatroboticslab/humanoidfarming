2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,759
We're JC and Holly Habber and we live uh

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,320
just south of Bell, South Dakota and we

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,840
started with JP's family operation. So

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,519
I'll let you start the story. Uh in

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,320
uh

7
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:32,800
2009, Holly and I got married and

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:36,640
started M&H Land and Cattle. And uh

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,920
we've been on this place for

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,600
uh since then, I guess. And uh when we

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
got married a little bit before that, JP

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,000
and his brother had operated together.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,200
And Jake and I took over the operation.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,840
Our main parts of the operation are cow

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,920
calf pair. Uh we background cattle and

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,680
we're working getting ready to feed

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,800
cattle fats and we also uh do row crops.

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,640
That's kind of GP's area. So we raise

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,960
corn, soybeans, uh winter wheat, spring

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:15,240
wheat. Uh this year we grew food grade

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:19,680
oats for Gerber baby food. Um we do hay

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:24,720
production. Um we have alalfa

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,200
uh cover crops. So this year uh well

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,080
previous years JP had had this idea to

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,759
bio strip till because in our area a lot

26
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,200
of aronomists uh push strip till and so

27
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,439
we and for the kind of ground that we

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,360
run it just doesn't really work that

29
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,040
well. um because we have have what JP

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,520
calls prairie potholes and it truly is

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,880
prairie potholes. Um and so we didn't

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,079
feel comfortable putting that dollars

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,280
and that fertilizer out there not

34
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,000
knowing that we would or wouldn't be

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,600
able to use it. So a few years ago JP

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,439
said, "Hey, what do you think about

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,680
using cover crops to try to do what

38
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,280
strip till

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,960
does, hey, I think it sounds good, but

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,640
it was really dry for a couple years

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,719
when it came time to plant them. So we

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,959
waited it out and this year it worked

43
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,599
out perfect. And so that's what we we

44
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,640
did. And so hopefully that'll that'll

45
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,840
prove out for us in in our rotation. All

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,920
right. What we have here is some noil

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,440
soil cloud here and we have some

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,599
conventional soil cloud here. And we're

49
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,239
going to run a demonstration on soil

50
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,160
aggregate stability. As we drop these

51
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:34,239
in, we're going to notice some bubbling

52
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,720
out of the no till, but not near as

53
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,680
rapidly as the conventional.

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,360
conventional till is starting to fall

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,080
apart rapidly. And so what this is

56
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,959
stimulating is is

57
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,000
a

58
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:55,280
a heavy rain

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
scenario that this soil here will erode

60
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,160
and kind of run down the furrow maybe

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,239
along with your high dollar seed or

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,280
fertilizer

63
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,599
where this is holding

64
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,280
together and actually

65
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:12,280
absorbing taking in that that moisture.

66
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,280
here.

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,879
Oh, wow. Now, look at it go.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,319
I I'm surprised that that I thought I'd

69
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,560
be able to pull a chunk out of there in

70
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,959
2 minutes and break it in half and it

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,720
would still it would be dry in the

72
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,959
middle.

73
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,959
Oh, wow.

74
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
It's pretty much it's wet all the way

75
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,480
through. I mean, there's definitely

76
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,400
moisture pretty well all the way

77
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:50,440
through. And this one's completely gone.

78
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,000
This soil can hold this soil can hold

79
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,480
moisture. And this

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,799
soil, that's what we need is we have to

81
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,760
we have to have the ability to to

82
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,680
conserve moisture. And that's a integral

83
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,599
part of that. We say especially in our

84
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,959
area, which it's true, especially in our

85
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,560
area, but I mean, you think about across

86
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,720
the nation, California, they're putting

87
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,159
water restrictions on. I mean, it's just

88
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,680
a matter of time. It moves across the

89
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,280
country. So, it really is important no

90
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,000
matter where you live. Thanks a lot for

91
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,479
uh joining us with that little

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,360
experiment.

93
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:28,160
Um, like we said, we're we're located in

94
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,360
east central South Dakota and right uh

95
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,440
south of Zel, South Dakota. And and keep

96
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,400
looking for these little guys and these

97
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,280
little guys. Uh, I'm Holly Haver. This

98
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,440
is Haven. And I'm JP. And Harley's

99
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,020
taking a nap. Stop in if you're near

100
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:56,029
Zel. Thanks,
