  "text": "hello today we are going to look in on the African night crawlers and I'm going to discuss the 10 things that I learned last year that uh probably I will not repeat in the future so as we're going through here you can see I've got a nice crop of really nice huge African night crawlers here um who don't want to be cute for the camera but what we're going to do is we're going to kind of go through things here and uh while I'm talking I'll just you know Yammer on so I would say the number one thing that I learned this year is that um too many worm bins at one point in time I think I had something like 23 worm bins and quite honestly that is too much I uh that's you know more than I can comfortably take care of um in a week or what have you so you may have noticed that I have started limiting my bins and that I am slowly you know getting things down these are not worms these are pieces of bonsai um slowly started reducing the number of bins uh just to make it a little bit easier for myself it was getting just a little bit too crazy so I have been coming in and adding about a gallon of water a week and um it still looks like it could totally use some more so we will add more at the end here just going to keep going through to see if there's any food or Bedding left and it looks like they've taken you know and eaten everything that I've given them it's a little hard to tell if they've eaten the um manure but uh from the looks of it uh yeah I can't tell if anybody knows how to tell the difference between worm castings and uh manure let me know so I would say the second thing is that um worms can eat meat and that was not in this bin it was in a mixed species bin worms can eat meat however uh in the process of eating all that meat they did attract a crap ton of flies I will put an insert of pictures and I would say after two months of not feeding meat to that bin I am still struggling to get all of the flies out of the basement and if I was to ever do it again I'm telling you I would only do it in a super deep bin and I would bury that meat very very deep um yeah so I I have proof of concept but I'm not going to say that that is something that I would do um frequently you know at all all right so number three um I think I've gone out of my way to not spend a lot of money on my worm bin but then I go back and I spend money on the garden in the way of coconut choir perlite soil amendments and it just hit me if you saw my most recent video about uh ways to help your garden um I will link that video at the end but basically what I've started doing is I've started adding some of my soil amendments that are organic that are going to take months and months to break down and I'm adding them to the worm bedding and that way the worm bends can uh work over all of that stuff and then it'll actually be ready by the time my garden needs it you know three or four months from now so I am spending more money on the worms than I used to I'm still you know recycling all of my shipping boxes by feeding them to the worms but I have started adding you know some more things that I don't normally do in the way of like azomite and things like that but if you add them to the worm bin then you don't need to really add as much to the Garden later so I am spending more money but hopefully saving money later so number four um one of the only bins that was actually uh impacted by my my trip my faded trip was that these African night crawlers and I purchased more because I lost you know most of my African night crawlers and what I've discovered is that worms can go a very long time without having new food but what they cannot do without is moisture and uh our house sitter you know was kind of on the bubble as to whether or not they wanted to you know manage any worms so I was like no no no you don't have to mess with the worms um so that was part of the deal and then when we got stuck over there there wasn't anybody to come in and actually take care of the African night crawlers uh when they needed moisture and so I did have quite the die off so they can go without food no problem moisture that's the deal breaker that they cannot do without so now that we've gone through all of this I'm gonna looks like we might have to harvest this the next time we're getting pretty full yeah there's really nothing left okay so the sixth thing is that slow food fast food might actually have more to do with the chemical makeup of the food than it has to do with the Frozen not frozen fibrous not fibrous and things like that in my bin I have experienced the slowest food it was being cranberries which you would think are soft and Squishy nope uh 10 months Ginger even pre-frozen nine months pineapple even though it was frozen it took six months and then of course apples something that everybody feeds their bin take about four months even if they're frozen for the worms to eat them all okay I'm gonna give them some paper bedding this is my normal prepared bedding that's been sitting here for a couple of months um then I'm going to add some of the manure here the seventh thing that basically I found out grit may not be necessary but it might just slow down how fast the worms are able to consume the food the bin that I had no grit in seemed to thrive quite well but I didn't have a twin bin and so maybe it could have done better I don't know but uh the no grit worked but you know was it the best choice not really because I do add grit to the rest of my worm bins okay so that's about a gallon of the uh composted cow manure I'm gonna put that over here on this side and uh for the eighth thing that I really kind of came to the conclusion is that me having a worm channel has made me a better worm farmer everybody who watches is not newbies I have a lot of people who have maybe even three four five times more experience with worms than I do and I just have this channel to kind of document my process in becoming a worm farmer and it's really really helpful that people do comment and give me ideas like hey maybe this is your problem or maybe you could do this or I've had good luck with this and honestly it's made me a much better worm farmer with you know without that feedback I probably would be not as good as I am today okay next we're gonna get some of my worm Chow I'm probably gonna give them about two cups here kind of scruff it in with the the top of the the bedding the paper bedding here I can put up on the screen what this is made out of and one of the other things that I've discovered number nine is that there's not just one way to be successful in your worm farming there are no absolutes um there are too many variables for you to say absolutely this has to happen my African night crawlers have to be in a vermi bag or a urban worm bag or something similar because they escape I live on a busy road the vibrations drive them a bit nuts and so without that my African night crawlers would be all over the floor and would be worm jerky we know people that are on my Channel or have other channels that just have uh African nightcrawlers in open bins and they're perfectly fine they don't try and Escape uh you know I think it's the vibrations that are doing it in my case but there's no perfect way to do a worm bin and so I have learned that there are many ways to be successful and there are also many ways to fail okay so let's get them a little bit of water I'm gonna put that right along the edge where the um heating pad is it seems that I'm holding moisture really well every place else in the bin except for there but I am going to give them a little bit all the way around we're kind of having a warm spell again so you never know what's going to happen okay and so then oops I'm also going to give them some vegetables they haven't had any in a while and you know variety is the spice of life I wouldn't want them to uh get bored my potatoes are starting to chit already I might have a problem there but there's you know probably five pounds of African night crawlers in here and I look in on this bin and feed them actual food about once a month even though I do come in here and uh give them worm Chow every single week and then the 10th thing that I have learned is that having a full-time job and a channel is very hard but it is totally worth it when my day job is driving me nuts and it does um I can come home change gears and hang out with you guys and my worms and everything seems a little bit brighter and a little bit better so if you liked the video about my African nightcrawlers I have a playlist for all of the African nightcrawlers right over here and if you've seen that YouTube thinks you're gonna like this video over here so if you like the video give it a muddy thumbs up if you're not a member of my worm family click that subscribe button and if you want to know what I'm doing when I'm doing it ring that Bell icon alright guys thanks for hanging out with me and my worms and everybody have a good day thank you foreign",
