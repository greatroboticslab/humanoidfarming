1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
folks was this an expensive mistake or

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,420
is it a warranty issue so that's kind of

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,040
the scenario that we're looking at here

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,139
and this is something that is an

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,400
unfortunate situation renders the

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,679
three-point hitch on your tractor

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,240
useless until you do something about it

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,539
and so customers submitted this question

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,039
to me and I I'd seen this happen

10
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:21,660
randomly over the years not too often

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,340
but you see it come up and that's going

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,519
to be where your top link on your three

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,900
point connects right back to the kind of

14
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,580
the casting or the housing on the

15
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,500
transaxle up above there so this

16
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,600
gentleman snapped off one of those ears

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,620
that hold on the top link

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,940
get a 2021 3E series tractor it was

19
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,680
still under

20
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,440
kind of that bumper to bumper warranty

21
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,760
in the two-year range s's John Deere

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,980
dealer if it would be covered and they

23
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,780
told him that physical damage is not

24
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,700
covered and so when he mentioned that

25
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,860
back to me that prompted my follow-up

26
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,660
question of well how are you using it

27
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,120
when the damage occurred so for me this

28
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,920
comes down to a use versus abuse kind of

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,660
scenario you know are you just using the

30
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,520
tractor like you normally would or are

31
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,140
you pushing it Beyond its limits maybe

32
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,140
going against something directly called

33
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,640
out in the manual or potentially is it a

34
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,920
casting defect something that should be

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,360
a you know a manufacturer's defect that

36
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,240
should be covered under warranty it

37
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,380
could be difficult to prove though guys

38
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,479
I need to have a serious conversation

39
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,700
for just a second but

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,640
most of you don't like or subscribe my

41
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,860
videos and I really don't know why

42
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,540
so if you do me a favor this holiday

43
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,799
season and uh

44
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,880
hit that Thumbs Up Button subscribe

45
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,619
I'd really appreciate it so I asked him

46
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,140
to explain what happened when the damage

47
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,820
occurred and he had a brush hog on the

48
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,520
back of his tractor and he was backing

49
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,860
up and uh he hit something he shouldn't

50
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,380
have apparently maybe going too fast

51
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,560
hard to say that's a subjective

52
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,360
scenario I suppose but it must have

53
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,520
jammed up you know just imagine the

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,579
snowblower just kind of jamming up into

55
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,960
the tractor and maybe twisting a bit I

56
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,640
don't really don't know how so thinking

57
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,340
about that that had to be a really

58
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,460
significant Force you know a snow blower

59
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,920
here is a is a rigid hunk of Steel

60
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,479
overall you know the the brush Hogs

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,160
actually have a little give those those

62
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,599
top arms they kind of give a little bit

63
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,640
and you can almost kind of wrinkle them

64
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,440
up a bit because if you're going

65
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,099
um in ditches kind of up and down there

66
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,379
it has some flex and so to really Ram

67
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,239
that into something so hard that it

68
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,379
overcame that and then still had enough

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,440
Force

70
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,300
to break off one of these ears

71
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,040
I don't know man I mean you got to be

72
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,959
out of control I feel like to have that

73
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,580
happen speaking of top links we just got

74
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,560
this cool new easy wheel haven't even

75
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,819
got it installed yet but this goes right

76
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,920
onto

77
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,840
your Top Lane kind of like a poor man's

78
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,819
hydraulic top link it's just an easy

79
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,019
handy way to do this we made we showed

80
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:48,300
some homemade versions of this before

81
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,340
but it's a discount Club member you buy

82
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,420
directly from them makes it easy to

83
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,680
spend that top link around for

84
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,819
adjustments or to hook up to an

85
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,500
attachment in fact we already got

86
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:57,480
feedback from a customer Mr Connor

87
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,519
already got his install on his tractor

88
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,440
says he loves it so so far so good now

89
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,420
the easy wheel is a discount Club member

90
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,980
use code GWT to save five percent off

91
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,739
your order now you think about a tool

92
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,900
that actually John Deere sells a box

93
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,640
blade among everybody else but you can

94
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,920
you can push backwards with your box

95
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,900
blade and kind of push things up and out

96
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,360
of the way wherever you want to go it's

97
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,220
well within the the limits of the

98
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,400
tractor to do so and so I think that

99
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,480
presents a scary situation that

100
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,940
fortunately not a lot of folks have gone

101
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,980
through but

102
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,080
he was quoted thirty four hundred

103
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,440
dollars to have that top housing

104
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,080
replaced which is just an insane amount

105
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,180
of money and now I think a better

106
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,739
alternative to at least investigate

107
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,599
first is if you can find somebody who

108
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,700
can potentially weld that back together

109
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,040
I would think for

110
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,860
10 of the cost of a thirty four hundred

111
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,480
dollar housing that you could maybe find

112
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,940
some in your area even if you had to

113
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,200
rent a trailer and everything else pay a

114
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,340
bunch extra labor just to get it over

115
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,440
there to them

116
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,840
I think that's worth investigating that

117
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,060
approach over buying a brand new casting

118
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,480
well I should back up because there is a

119
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,159
potential for this to be aluminum but I

120
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,080
I think at least that the section that

121
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,599
sits on top of the main transaxle is

122
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,640
cast either way it takes a special

123
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,459
welder to be able to have the the skill

124
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,519
set to weld cast iron or aluminum so

125
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,019
really this is a PSA to kind of dive

126
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,699
into your tractor manufacturer's

127
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,340
warranty and figure out what is covered

128
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,540
what isn't covered

129
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,699
and then that that kind of guides you

130
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,320
maybe on how you treat your tractor and

131
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,320
if you are going to be backing up or

132
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,840
perhaps using certain attachments that

133
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,460
could cause more stress in that area you

134
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,960
now know ahead of time and how to maybe

135
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,479
take it a little bit easier and again

136
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,340
this is such a random occurrence and I

137
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,960
started doing a little looking up to see

138
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,280
who else has had this issue and if I

139
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,139
could find it on any Forum threads

140
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,180
there's a couple on Green Tractor talk

141
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,120
on 2 Series and three series I think I

142
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,160
don't maybe a one series as well

143
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,660
a couple of potential items that could

144
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,880
cause that kind of an issue you

145
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,520
mentioned the post hole digger

146
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,139
which seems like you'd have to do a heck

147
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,940
of a lot of heck of a number to get that

148
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,800
to happen and then a stump grinder

149
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,840
that's a direct amount with all the

150
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,580
sideways force that that like the bomb

151
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,560
light 1p 24 is putting on there

152
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,820
potentially something like that not that

153
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,160
either one of those were directly

154
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,139
related but really just a couple of

155
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,699
potential attachments that could cause

156
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,080
this kind of damage folks I want to take

157
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,180
just a second to tell you about our

158
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,039
Channel sponsor rim guard they are a

159
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,960
liquid ballast solution they line up

160
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,460
with exactly what we do here on Good

161
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,259
Works which is talking about tractors

162
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,940
and tractor safety we see it as simple

163
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,620
as this if you own a tractor you need

164
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,360
rim guard in fact some attractors

165
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,580
include rim guard as standard out of the

166
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,800
factory liquid ballast is simply weight

167
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,479
all right and this weight hides inside

168
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,699
your tires it stays there all the time

169
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,400
it's a safety concern because tractors

170
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,259
are almost always too light and too

171
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,360
Tippy out of the factory the number one

172
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,860
attachment used by every tractor owner

173
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,300
is their front end loader so when you

174
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,100
pick up something heavy on the front end

175
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,840
your back end wants to pick up off the

176
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,280
ground rim guard liquid ballast helps

177
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,020
keep your back end planted to the ground

178
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,060
but beyond and safety is going to help

179
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,979
maintain traction because if those rear

180
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,780
tires those power driving tires are on

181
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,979
the ground you have traction to go where

182
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,840
you need to and you're going to operate

183
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,460
more efficiently because if those rear

184
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,720
tires aren't on the ground you're not

185
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,220
going to pick up as much as you need to

don't really know them off the cuff and

197
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,400
you guys can can leave comments down

198
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,600
below too so if you're if you're

199
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,060
shopping for a tractor haven't bought

200
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,060
one yet maybe this is a consideration to

201
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,940
take into account but there's certain

202
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,680
what do we want to call this a maybe a

203
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,900
top link

204
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,000
bracket or something but there's certain

205
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,800
models out there that have that bolted

206
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,960
on so if you did break it off you can

207
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,900
just simply buy a new small section and

208
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,220
bolt it back on unlike a lot of the

209
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,680
other models that you have to replace a

210
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,240
huge chunk of the housing and take a

211
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,740
whole bunch of stuff apart it's a really

212
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,539
big Endeavor a totally different story

213
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,699
so I'd be curious to know which of you

214
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:11,400
have maybe something that is bolted onto

215
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,740
the top versus a kind of a cast and a

216
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,539
whole one piece Contraption there

217
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,680
curious what models do and what models

218
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,419
