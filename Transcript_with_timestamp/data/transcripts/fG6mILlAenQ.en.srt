gardens were an ingenious agricultural

system developed by the Aztecs this

00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:11,120
method involved creating small

rectangular plots of fertile land on

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,039
vegetation which resulted in highly

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,080
productive soil The chinampas increased

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,680
crop yield significantly allowing the

00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,960
Aztecs to support a large population

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,840
crops like maze beans and squash thrived

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,840
in this environment benefiting from the

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,120
nutrient-rich sediment and water this

Advanced understanding of irrigation and

ecosystem management laying the

groundwork for modern agriculture
