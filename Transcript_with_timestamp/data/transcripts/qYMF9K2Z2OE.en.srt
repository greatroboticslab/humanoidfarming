1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,320
hey everybody welcome back to the

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,120
channel in today's video we're going to

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,840
be talking about purchasing land for

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,440
your homestead and I got three things

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:15,120
that you need to look out for if you're

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:21,560
a beginner just starting out trying to

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,560
find your dream property so let's get to

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,480
it all right first thing I hey well

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,120
first of all I'm back here in the back

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,239
40 as I call it um back here where I do

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,440
my hunting at got my redneck blind back

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,360
there um this was something that was

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,120
important to me but we'll get to that in

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,079
just a second first let's talk about

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:54,160
location all right location location

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:56,000
location for me location meant you know

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,519
I was in uh Washington State when I

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,640
finished my military career and um I

19
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:07,119
that's growing Zone 8 well was 88 at the

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,759
time and um I felt like I love that

21
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:14,400
growing zone so I wanted to have my

22
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:17,560
forever property in growing zone 8 as

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,200
well so that was something that I looked

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,439
for I like growing zone 8 because I can

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,759
grow all year round and it's it's

26
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,280
probably

27
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:32,720
the the zone that I think is most most

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,119
universal for being able to grow all

29
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,079
year round um the Summers get hot but

30
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,680
they don't get as hot as N9 and 10 and

31
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:45,000
11 you know um but the winters are mild

32
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:49,439
so they don't get as cold as seven you

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,640
know six and five and four um so I have

34
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,680
a really long growing season I can

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,960
definitely grow 365 days a year um and

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,119
that's something that was important to

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,159
me so that's why location location

38
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,159
location is so important so for

39
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,759
me uh as far as location is concerned

40
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,360
that was really that was really it that

41
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:15,120
was all that I was really concerned

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,760
about um but you know some people may

43
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,640
want to be close to family some people

44
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,000
may not want to be close to family you

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:26,120
know what I mean so you know I wanted to

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,599
be I guess you could say uh close enough

47
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,000
that if I had to get home on an

48
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,519
emergency I can do it

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,760
but I'm far enough away where I ain't

50
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,200
got to worry about somebody coming

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,920
knocking on the door if you know what I

52
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:43,319
mean so so location is super super super

53
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,680
important all right so something that I

54
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:51,080
um also had in mind was your local

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,879
resources or your community um I feel

56
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:57,120
that for a homesteader especially first

57
00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:01,360
starting off you really need

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,840
to um look at what's in your area that

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,400
you can use so um stuff

60
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,879
like like resources like feed for your

61
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,319
animals so important right um I know

62
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,120
most every place you know you got ATT

63
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,159
track the supply or you got this or you

64
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,920
got you know feed store or whatever but

65
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,760
um you know look at those places and

66
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,360
make sure that you have the type of

67
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,000
place that

68
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,080
you are going to make a long-term

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,519
commitment to as far as uh where you're

70
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,280
going to be purchasing from because a

71
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,280
lot of places just don't have the things

72
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,959
that you may have had in your last

73
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,599
location so

74
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:44,560
definitely um what you know look at what

75
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,280
is in your community as far as resources

76
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,239
you know can you get compost bulk you

77
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,159
know or do you have to buy bag compost

78
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,040
um you know bag compost gets expensive

79
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:59,280
you know uh but some people you know

80
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,959
that's all they need and so you know way

81
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,799
your weigh your your needs and your

82
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:09,159
wants and determine whether or not

83
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,840
you're going to need stuff like you know

84
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,720
bulk things that can be delivered to you

85
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,479
because some places hey I'm going tell

86
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,400
you it's nice to live off grid it's not

87
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,919
it's nice to to not um have neighbors or

88
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,160
whatever sometimes you know but

89
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,680
sometimes it's nice to have a neighbor

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,120
or two you know sometimes it's nice to

91
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,800
be able to head out to the feed store

92
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,080
and only have to drive you know 15 20

93
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,160
minutes versus 2 hours to get feed for

94
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,479
your animals you know what I mean so

95
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,479
that's something that's very very very

96
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:44,479
important and often overlooked is what

97
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,520
you

98
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:51,320
can what you can locally just reach out

99
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,280
and get in a in a in a pinch um some

100
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,759
things yeah you can plan it out and

101
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,960
where you can get it delivered to you or

102
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:00,120
whatever but that's extra cost as well

103
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,600
so definitely your local resources is

104
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,440
something that I highly recommend that

105
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,080
you look into especially if you're

106
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,199
buying a property that you want a

107
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,680
homestead on also when you're looking at

108
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,080
uh your local resources you know you you

109
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,120
want to make sure that you have access

110
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:23,759
to agricultural resources as far as like

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:28,039
nrcs or um your your a extensions and

112
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,280
stuff like that um make sure that you

113
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,800
know cuz like let's take for instance me

114
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,199
right and um I'm not bad mouthing

115
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,600
anybody or whatever this is something

116
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:40,280
that they told me you know so my

117
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,039
County's um a extension is not doesn't

118
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,479
have a lot of

119
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:48,800
uh of resources I would say and they

120
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:51,919
have even pointed me to you know a

121
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,880
sister County that has better resources

122
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:58,759
because they have uh a ug extension over

123
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,600
there so University of Georgia extension

124
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:04,560
so um it's a little further drive you

125
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,479
know but it's not too too bad but that's

126
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,880
something that I didn't know prior to

127
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:13,639
buying this property versus you know my

128
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:16,680
extension office is you know six 6 to 10

129
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:19,960
minutes away you know so um

130
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,280
definitely um you know having to go and

131
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,120
drive 30 minutes to the other extension

132
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,960
office is not ideal um it's probably not

133
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,919
something that I would have uh like not

134
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,240
bought the property over but you know

135
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,639
you have to look into those kinds of

136
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:38,880
things as well and last but not least um

137
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,800
the property condition and so what I

138
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,720
mean by that there's a lot that goes

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,880
into that um like me I knew I was going

140
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,720
to be having Gardens and whatnot and I

141
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,400
wanted to grow on this property so I

142
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,840
asked the the seller if I could do a

143
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,560
soil test they had no issue with me

144
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,639
doing a soil test cuz they knew that

145
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,120
they had you know premium soil here I

146
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:04,840
mean this soil they had horses here at

147
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:08,280
one point and this soil is just it's

148
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:11,560
Immaculate I did a soil test and

149
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,080
um it told me that I don't need to add

150
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,919
anything to the soil just grow in it you

151
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,280
know so um you don't run into that too

152
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,360
often not that I would have uh said hey

153
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,080
I'm not going to buy the property

154
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,800
because of the soil test um but I would

155
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,319
like to know what I'm getting into you

156
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,440
know from the soil test the other thing

157
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:33,199
that was really important to me was you

158
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,800
know I want to be on well water I don't

159
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,080
want to be on City water so um I made

160
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,360
sure and I I saw that before I even came

161
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,560
to the property that it was on well

162
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,039
water so well water was important to me

163
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,520
um it may not be important to you so but

164
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,280
that is something cuz you know I don't

165
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,159
have a water bill and I use a lot of

166
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,879
water here on my property so um that's

167
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,840
something to definitely take into

168
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,000
consideration when you're uh starting

169
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,479
off homesteading everything needs water

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,919
your animal your plants everything you

171
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:06,440
everything needs water so definitely

172
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,560
don't overlook that and if you can shave

173
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,080
off a little bit of your monthly bill by

174
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,599
having a well or if you have the ability

175
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,879
to dig a well uh because they dug a well

176
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:19,960
here on the backside of the property and

177
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,039
I have a well for the houses as well so

178
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,000
um you know that kind of thing is super

179
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,759
super important when you're talking

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,039
about infrastructure for your animals

181
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,640
you know if if you want you know know a

182
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,240
readymade place that already has Barns

183
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,120
and and uh fencing and all that kind of

184
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,200
stuff that's something you need to be

185
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,640
looking for don't overlook it don't

186
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,680
think oh I could just build that later

187
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,040
because you'll be four five six years

188
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,279
later and you still don't have a fence

189
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,160
you know I may be talking about myself

190
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,080
but

191
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:56,360
hey but no for uh but something that I

192
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,839
did not look at though I would say this

193
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,480
is a mistake that I made Okay so when I

194
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,959
pulled up onto the property uh the house

195
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,640
is kind of higher than the road right so

196
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:11,600
you know and that's typical cuz you want

197
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,959
your grade to go away from the house um

198
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,360
and then when I came back here to the

199
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:20,440
back I noticed that everything slopes

200
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:23,839
down back here and there's a there's

201
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,959
a a river not a river but a creek a

202
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,920
stream that runs through back there um

203
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,040
so so I figured okay yeah everything

204
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,360
goes down downhill toward you know water

205
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,040
typically and so I looked at it and I

206
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,480
was like okay that's cool that's that's

207
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,760
what I wanted that's what I want but

208
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,240
something you know I looked at the soil

209
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,480
I looked at the slope I looked at

210
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,800
everything you know I I like the slope

211
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,519
too cuz I was like man so I don't have

212
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,200
to worry about having one of those mud

213
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,000
Farms you know what I'm saying cuz you

214
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,959
know everybody everybody talks about

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,079
those mud Farms man I didn't want one of

216
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:59,800
those so I was like you know being on a

217
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:01,360
slope like this the water going to run

218
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,279
off and I'm not going to have standing

219
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,720
water and I don't you know but I didn't

220
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,720
think about

221
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,680
why why the Topography of my land was or

222
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,640
is the way it is I didn't think about

223
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,240
that and

224
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,880
so you know you get to working and you

225
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,480
get to doing stuff and next thing you

226
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,640
know it's like dang everywhere I dig

227
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,120
there's rocks and I got my yard my front

228
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:31,040
yard done I got it leveled when I first

229
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,800
moved here and um you know I I I had a a

230
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,880
company come in and kind of grade it

231
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,680
because I couldn't cut it because there

232
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:40,079
were so many rocks that were like um you

233
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,240
know I had to mow around rocks and stuff

234
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,480
you know so I was like a man I like to

235
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,680
mow you know I like to mow my yard so I

236
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,720
was like hey I need y'all to come in

237
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,839
here and get these rocks out of here and

238
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,760
hey they got the rocks out so you know I

239
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,639
was like all right cool so y'all got the

240
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,839
rocks out but he couldn't get it as

241
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:00,519
level as I wanted it to be you know and

242
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,880
so uh he was like man man you got some

243
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,639
huge rocks in this ground and I was like

244
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,040
what he was like yeah man you got rocks

245
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,720
so big that like you probably need

246
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,720
Dynamite to like to like dislodge him

247
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,480
you know he said you probably your house

248
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,040
is probably sitting on a big rock you

249
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,880
know and I was like ah so right around

250
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,680
the street the um the uh the next little

251
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,360
town over or whatever it's not really a

252
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,320
town it's just it don't really have

253
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,639
nothing over there but um it's called

254
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,600
The Rock The Rock Georgia you know so so

255
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:33,920
it makes sense you know and as as you're

256
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,680
driving by and you see other people's

257
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,399
houses and stuff you see a lot of rocks

258
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,800
like big rocks in their yards you know

259
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,800
whatnot so that's something that I did

260
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,440
not take into consideration so when I'm

261
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,079
making my Gardens and whatnot I tend to

262
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,600
hit rocks and I don't mean just little

263
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,760
rocks I mean big boulders that I hit

264
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,600
that I have to either grow around try to

265
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,320
dig up some of them I've been able to

266
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,360
dig up but I mean I got rocks that are

267
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,200
like you know big big as people you know

268
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,639
what I mean so like you can't just dig

269
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,519
those things up especially with me I

270
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,839
don't have any um equipment like that I

271
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,880
just have my hands my shovel and whatnot

272
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,880
to to get that kind of stuff up so I'm

273
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,519
able to get some of them up but for the

274
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,440
most part they I have to work around

275
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:28,440
them you know so um that is definitely

276
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,560
something that I was like okay yeah I I

277
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,120
messed up when it came to that now if I

278
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,360
had known that would I have still

279
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,440
purchased the property yes yes I would I

280
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:42,160
I love this property I mean I absolutely

281
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,600
love it it has a a healing feeling to it

282
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,320
and I don't know if you understand what

283
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,720
I mean by that but it it's the type of

284
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,639
place that when you come to it you just

285
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,519
get uh amazing energy from it and man it

286
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,480
seems like everything that I do here

287
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,920
like succeeds you know so um yeah I

288
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,480
wouldn't I wouldn't trade this property

289
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:07,079
for anything what I am going to do um

290
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,360
eventually is

291
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:12,320
my my uh stand is going to be moved to a

292
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,399
different property um probably in the

293
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,440
next three or four years uh where I will

294
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:22,120
have a hunting property and then I can

295
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,680
change everything back here to Growing

296
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:29,399
I'm already growing my um Orchard back

297
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:31,360
there I can also grow you know corn or

298
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,920
you know wheat or something back there

299
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,399
as well so that's my three things that I

300
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,639
think that um you know every beginner

301
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,680
Homesteader that's looking to purchase

302
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,600
property really needs to be looking at

303
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,120
um the

304
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,160
location the amenities or the resources

305
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,000
around that location and the condition

306
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,480
of the property um you may even be

307
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,279
looking at those things and like me I

308
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,160
was looking at the soil you know I was

309
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:03,600
checking the soil out I was checking out

310
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,839
the conditions the the Topography of the

311
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,000
of the land but I didn't take into

312
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,160
consideration the big old rocks that

313
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,320
they have here and I mean when you're

314
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,959
doing anything you putting up posts you

315
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,800
doing anything anything you have to dig

316
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:21,079
into the ground um it's tough when you

317
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,560
got big boulders that you have to deal

318
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:25,959
with uh but the good thing about rocks

319
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,120
is if you get one that's deep enough

320
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:29,839
it's a good support you know so you can

321
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,240
you can put a post on on top of it you

322
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,199
know that post is never going to sink so

323
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,000
you you can use it for for good you know

324
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:42,240
um or uh find the good in it I guess you

325
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,839
could say but hey that's my three tips

326
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,160
that's the three things that I think

327
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:50,000
that you really need to focus on um hey

328
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,399
if I missed anything definitely get down

329
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,199
in the comments let me know uh you know

330
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,160
if you're a season Homestead or and you

331
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:59,040
maybe you've bought a couple Properties

332
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,440
or whatnot definitely let me know if

333
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,240
there were some things that you would

334
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,240
have added into this list um obviously

335
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,160
it's a short list just three items but

336
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,120
within those three items I think there's

337
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:16,240
a lot there's a lot to uh unpack in

338
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:20,399
those three uh categories that that I

339
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:23,720
um those three categories that I feel

340
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,639
are very very very important to the uh

341
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,720
beginning Homesteader all right well

342
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:31,680
