1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,760
all right fig lovers this is Ross the

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,879
Fig boss and today's video we're going

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,040
to talk about why your fig tree isn't

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,880
Fring and how to fix that in fact this

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,960
is actually probably the most common

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,719
question that I get people message me

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,720
all the time on my blog my YouTube

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,520
channel I get emails messages you name

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,160
it about why their fig tree isn't Fring

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,400
and usually people will include

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,000
photos uh show me the pictures of their

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,759
trees their leaves and I just always see

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,840
the same common bread but it's not

14
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,960
really what you think it's it's not

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,200
water or a lack of water it's not

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,079
usually a lack of Health it's not a lack

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,120
of sunlight or fertilizer or this or

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,000
that that a lot of you guys probably

19
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,280
would

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,520
immediately think about it's actually

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,320
something called hormones plant hormones

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,039
yes I'm I'm not kidding plants actually

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,960
have hormones as well I've talked a lot

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,079
about them here on this channel and

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,440
actually I've written up a detailed

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,000
article that's a companion guide to this

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,520
video I highly recommend you guys check

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,640
it out the link will be in the

29
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,920
description you can go right to my blog

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,400
and read into more detail in depth about

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,600
what we're talking about today but the

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,320
hormones are really critical in all

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Fring plants not just and flowering

34
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,280
plants too not just the Fig Tree in fact

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,400
when we think about how to encourage

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,680
other fruit trees to actually fruit and

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,920
flower the main thing that people

38
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,560
actually talk about is actually pruning

39
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,320
and that's why I have my pruning shears

40
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,000
with me today because one of the things

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,799
that people say is actually to do summer

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,840
pruning and that the not

43
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,439
necessarily how much pruning you do but

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,920
actually the timing in which you do your

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,719
prunning makes a big difference and that

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,119
if I come in here to these cherry trees

47
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:58,159
that you see and I do this summer

48
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:00,000
pruning technique where I remove about a

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,439
third

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,880
to even a half of the new growth these

51
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,920
trees are going to be more likely to

52
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,479
fruit The Following season and it's

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,239
pretty brain dead all we do is just go

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,120
around to all the branches of the trees

55
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,879
and remove about a third to a half of

56
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,680
that new growth believe it or not this

57
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,360
tricks the trees into having a different

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,879
balance of hormones that encourages them

59
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,280
not to grow a lot next year but to

60
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,640
actually flower and fruit the next year

61
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,200
now it may take a couple year or two do

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,920
with these cherry trees because of the

63
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,800
way that they fruit but the Fig is no

64
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,640
different and that if we can actually

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,800
come in here during the summer we would

66
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,480
encourage our fig trees to fruit and

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,959
flour but we don't summer prune fig

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,280
trees any everybody knows that if you

69
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,840
have a fig tree we don't summerun them

70
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,560
because the weird thing about fig trees

71
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,120
is that they actually produce fruit on

72
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,879
the new growth of the season so if I

73
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,440
came in here to this cherry tree and and

74
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,599
I removed all the new

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,200
growth well that would be like removing

76
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,640
all the cherries off the

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,040
tree so we can't do the same thing with

78
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,599
the Fig maybe you know after actually

79
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,840
the Fig Tree fruits and it's done

80
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,799
fruiting if you guys live in really long

81
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,400
season season climates like Southern

82
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,280
California really hot and dry places you

83
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,640
can come in actually after they fruit

84
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,319
and prune them really far back and that

85
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,959
can actually encourage them to put out a

86
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,959
second flush of growth will then produce

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,879
even more fig believe it or not but

88
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:38,080
typically again we're not summer pruning

89
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:41,040
fig trees and the only real pruning that

90
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,280
we do is actually during the winter time

91
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,720
but if we winter prune our fig trees the

92
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,080
balance of hormones instead of Shifting

93
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,519
towards flowering it shifts towards

94
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,760
growing and that's what causes our trees

95
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:58,920
to have this issue is that balance of

96
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,480
hormones the Fig because of this is

97
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,439
really

98
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,840
particular about its hormones now I've

99
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,760
seen fig trees that can fruit in six to

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,480
eight months from cutting you put a

101
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,040
cutting in the ground six to eight

102
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,680
months later you got a lot of figs on

103
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,760
your tree uh I've seen them many of them

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,959
fruit in the first year the second year

105
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,720
the third year uh it's pretty rare that

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,520
we have a fig tree that isn't fruiting

107
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,160
by the third fourth or fifth year and if

108
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,600
that's the case with your tree I get

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,520
this all the time Ross I have a big

110
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,880
beautiful just Lush gorgeous it's just

111
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,919
the best looking fig tree and but all it

112
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,280
does is grow it doesn't fruit and it's x

113
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,639
amount of years old this is probably why

114
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,600
and that we're doing the wrong kind of

115
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:49,280
pruning either the timing is off it's

116
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,479
the wrong kind of pruning which I'll

117
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,479
discuss in a minute or it's actually the

118
00:04:52,479 --> 00:05:00,240
fact that you have a lots of winter

119
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:03,639
damage yes the winter is the same thing

120
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,440
as pruning our trees so if our the

121
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,800
winter comes in brings these branches

122
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,680
back it's the same thing as winter

123
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,759
pruning the trees have no idea of the

124
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,199
difference all they know is that they

125
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,560
lost some of their limbs and they lost

126
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,199
them in a particular order in a

127
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,360
particular way and so what happens if we

128
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,039
have here's how you prune a fig tree in

129
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,759
the winter time to ensure that you're

130
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,280
going to have successful fruit set the

131
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,199
next year

132
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,800
so keeping the trees in Balance we have

133
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,479
two different ways we can prune them and

134
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,960
my fingers here are going to be the

135
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:41,080
example so we have heading Cuts that's

136
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,039
the first style of pruning that probably

137
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,880
most of you guys have done today and

138
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,880
that you take your pruning shears and

139
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,560
you just cut across a certain height and

140
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,400
you make the cut all the way across the

141
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,479
top just like I did with these cherry

142
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,319
trees I cut out a third of the growth I

143
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,360
cut out a half of the growth we took a

144
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,639
chainsaw and just leveled all the trees

145
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,240
out at a certain height how many of you

146
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,039
guys have done that um you cut them at

147
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,400
chest height or waist height or whatever

148
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,360
it is and you just bring them all the

149
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,919
way far

150
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,840
back that's going to be a recipe for

151
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,680
disaster for getting your fig tree to

152
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,199
fruit the next year now I'm going to say

153
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,319
this it doesn't necessarily mean that it

154
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,280
won't fruit next year because I've done

155
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,800
this to my trees plenty of times some of

156
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,720
you guys watching right now have done

157
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,160
this to your trees plenty of times but

158
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,319
it's a balance of hormones and so even

159
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,160
though we can still chop them really far

160
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,280
back doesn't always mean it's going to

161
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,199
result in zero fruits but it's going to

162
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,400
result in zero fruits more likely than

163
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,160
not it depends on the tree you have the

164
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,520
structure of your tree the age of your

165
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,039
tree the variety of your tree the

166
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,479
climate that you're living in there are

167
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:57,360
so many factors that go into that uh but

168
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,639
generally speaking doing that kind of

169
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,960
pruning is going to result result in

170
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:06,639
less fruit set next year and years in

171
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,639
the future now the other kind of fing is

172
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,479
actually thinning Cuts where we come in

173
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,440
here and we actually remove the one in

174
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,520
the middle and we bring this by the way

175
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,319
all the way as far back as we

176
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,520
can and you leave the other two alone

177
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:22,319
you do not top them you do not head them

178
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,919
back you leave them alone so if we

179
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,360
remove the one in the center and we

180
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,000
bring that all the way back that can be

181
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,160
a way we can control the height cuz a

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,759
lot of people struggle well we're CR if

183
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,800
I don't want to prune my fig

184
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,080
tree um or if I'm doing the wrong kind

185
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,479
of pruning what if I just leave it alone

186
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,639
well if you leave it alone actually

187
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,319
you're going to have a more higher

188
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,160
chance believe it or not that it's going

189
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,199
to fruit but if you have to do any

190
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,759
pruning and you have to bring back the

191
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,639
height of your tree you want to do

192
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,400
thinning cuts and that starts always

193
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,879
down here at the base of our trees or

194
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,840
the scaffolds of our trees you remove

195
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,319
one of those arms you remove one of

196
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,560
those trunks all the way down at the

197
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,360
soil line as far down as you can can and

198
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,960
that usually is going to be the longest

199
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,840
tallest one you take that out a new one

200
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,479
comes up in its place and you just

201
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,919
continue this recycling process but in

202
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,159
that way of pruning you're not

203
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,159
destroying the hormones that balance of

204
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,440
hormones that needs to be in place for

205
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:21,280
your trees to be productive I'll tell

206
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,280
you this if you cut your fig tree all

207
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,560
the way back to 6 to 12 in some amazing

208
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,159
things can

209
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,080
happen if you cut your fig tree back

210
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,399
really far just in General you can get

211
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,240
figs that grow insanely quickly so this

212
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,760
might be a good thing depending on what

213
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,719
you guys are trying to do but back over

214
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,360
here on this Southern plot that I have

215
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,839
I've been cutting my fig trees back to 6

216
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,600
to 12 in for years and you may not be

217
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,200
able to recognize it now but I have

218
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,720
branches in here that were 8 to 10 feet

219
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,000
tall at the beginning of this season

220
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:00,440
because we cut them back last spring all

221
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,480
the way to the base or the winter came

222
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,600
in here and did it for us and that's

223
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,680
usually what's happening here with the

224
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,480
people I see that don't have productive

225
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,200
fruit trees or fig trees they have the

226
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,079
wrong kind of pruning that they're doing

227
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,720
they're letting the winter come in here

228
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:22,440
damage and cut the trees for them and

229
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,079
the only way to get this problem fixed

230
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,360
is to protect your fig tree throughout

231
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:29,480
the winter time for one season just one

232
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,320
growing season get it through through

233
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,800
the winter time without any damage that

234
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,160
way it doesn't do this heading cut

235
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,560
process for you you protect it through

236
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,959
the winter time with zero damage the

237
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,320
next year it's much more likely to fruit

238
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:45,760
if it still doesn't fruit at that point

239
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,959
you probably just have to be a little

240
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,320
bit patient because your variety just

241
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:52,839
takes a little bit more time than other

242
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,040
varieties to actually fruit and I have a

243
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,440
couple in here just like the ones over

244
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,959
there even though we've protected those

245
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,279
trees in the southern plot that I

246
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,120
mentioned there is a about five or six

247
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:04,279
trees in there that will not fruit this

248
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,920
year even though we did exactly what we

249
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,720
needed to do and the lessons that I'm

250
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,399
giving you today we have to be patient

251
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,079
and the other way we get them to fruit

252
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,959
is again doing that right kind of

253
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,120
pruning not the heading Cuts but instead

254
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,800
thinning cuts and if you can get away

255
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,120
with it consider doing some summer

256
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,640
pruning all right guys thanks for
