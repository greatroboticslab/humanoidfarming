  "text": "plot the destructive biodiversity made of parasites diseases viral diseases fungal diseases bacterial diseases predators birds rats worms caterpillars all kinds of agricultural plagues and competitors such as other plants which decrease the yields of cultivated crops now the wide diversity of attackers which are illustrated here we have the uh fruit worm on maize nematodes on bananas diseases on sugarcane drosophila being attacked by ants on monk fruit mango fruit and also white worms attacking the roots of maize a disease on cocoa plants all these aggressors attackers are a problem for agriculture and farmers and they account for a huge potential loss or even observed loss this table shows you the various types of attackers of fungi bacteria viruses animals uh other plants and the losses potential losses are huge the total decrease of production due to these four categories of attackers may reach 67 percent two-thirds of the crop may be lost versus the situation a similar situation without the attackers now agriculture for a long time has focused on how to best control or even eliminate the attackers at the bottom on the bottom line we see the efficacy of a possible fight against attackers in percentage we never will be able to eradicate the attackers limiting the yield of crops but we have ways to reduce the attack in modern agriculture however the best way consists in using or the most efficient ways consisting using biocides pesticides targeting this or that attacker industrial agriculture and agriculture in the green revolution countries intensive intensive single species with a high use of fertilizers invest a lot in pesticides and use huge quantities of fungicides pesticides the chemical turnover represents 40 billion dollars in this field so it's a huge cost for agriculture to try and eliminate or mitigate the action of parasites there is a paradigm on which uh agricultural production is based it's all about eradication an attacker is an emitting factor it decreases the yield we use a buyer site to try and eliminate the attackers but by doing this we forget about the wealth of ecosystemic services present both in the cultivated plot and all around the cultivated plot i think it is high time we thought about other ways to fight against parasites and attackers because abundant use of pesticides obviously has a negative negative impact on both the producers and farmers health on the consumer's health we have reason to worry about the use of pesticides by farmers especially in developing countries where safety rules are not really complied with we have a huge public health problem and obviously pesticides leave residues on the produce whereby the consumers are also in danger and the whole ecosystem is in danger toxicology of the pesticides in the environment is really a source of worry physiology the man who invented ddt and got the nobel prize about 18 years ago and ever since we have come a long way to understand that it's now absolutely necessary to limit the use of pesticides which aims at dividing by two the use of pesticides within a few years time is being implemented it's in progress except it's very difficult to control the pests and attackers differently research produces all of the uh agricultural industry of looking for new ways to control pesticides and attackers and diseases there is a very good example of a new way to achieve this result the use of vegetal biodiversity present on the plant and around the plot on the left-hand side you see agrochemistry everything used by industrial agriculture to get rid of attackers mainly pesticides the efficacy is specific it limits the efficacy of bio attackers for one campaign maybe two campaigns or three until the bio attacker finds a way to resist the pesticide and develops resistance but it also has an impact on production and yield is high except that an excessive use of pesticides may lead to a very unfavorable situation in central america require 50 60 70. treatments a year almost once a week an airplane has to spread pesticides on the plantation you can imagine the problem with this entails on the right hand side we have ways to fight impact on human health and environmental health with different methods than spreading poisons in the environment this can be achieved through beneficial organisms which fight the attackers or parasitoids or parasites or pests which attack the original pests and this also will have a beneficial effect on soil fertility and biological activity in the soil and finally there are some spectacular effects on economy and yield with this new way to eliminate attackers i'll give you one example on how to use a vegetal diversity in order to get rid of a pest that attacks a maze in africa this system was developed by icp in africa it's called the push-pull system push as in pushing pull as in pulling attracting there is a type of muff and uh worm that attacks maize and may reduce by 60 80 crop yield now this muff fruit and destroys the maze the system is a push-pull system whereby all around the plot a plant will be planted simply to provide the service it attracts the female moss looking for a place to lay their eggs and this plant is toxic for the female moth the moth deposits its uh eggs on this type of grass and uh the eggs will not develop they'll be intoxicated that this is the pool system attracting the moss and in order to reinforce the system between the stocks of maize this medium is planted and this medium is a plant that pushes away the female moss and therefore the moth population looking for a place to lay their eggs are pushed away by this plant they don't like it this is a very simple relatively um cheap system to push away the parasite out of the plot attracting it outside of the plot to eliminate it with a toxic there are other advantages because the dysmodium planted between the uh stocks is a leguminous plant which is going to provide nitrogen and fertilize the soil have an allelopathic effect on striga seeds striker is a plant which is a parasite for maize and this medium will kill this trigger see when they germinate so it's a way to engineer biodiversity in order to control a parasite moth or fruit worm and this system is now being used by tens of thousands of producers and farmers in africa this family of systems this push-pull system has been adapted in other systems a system that allows to push away the parasites and attract them to a different place between a trap where they will be naturally eliminated was it developed by sierra and for adequate companies or farms and this way to fight parasites is accessible for small producers relatively cheap and it doesn't have a negative impact on the environment we are finally realizing that we don't need to think in terms of a prescriptive way to eliminate parasites with a pesticide same way that a pharmacist or a doctor would make a diagnosis and give you a uh prescription to go and buy the drug now we have to rethink the whole system and there are other such like examples the biological fights against the pests extraction of natural substances for some products in order to spread them on the cultivated plants and even uh plants that sanitize the environment i remember i told you about the banana well in order to fight against nematode and weevil in the station there is a plant that will limit nematodes and limit the weevil populations and that will go from 15 20 year treatments on the french west indies on banana plantations and divide the number of uh treatments by three this is better for the consumers better for the producers and obviously it's also a better way and a more economic way to fight attackers
