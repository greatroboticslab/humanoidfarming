00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,140
hi my name's Allen Pattillo I'm your

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,690
fisheries and aquaculture extension

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,610
specialist at Iowa State University I'm

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,880
here to talk to you today about citing

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,400
and building a quality pond as you can

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,000
see here we're in a watershed this is

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,109
the future site of a pond and some

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,519
things that you need to consider

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,080
whenever building your pond is the

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,119
amount of soil that you're gonna have to

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,820
move because that's the major expense

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,619
component of building upon as well as

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,719
the volume of water that you want to try

15
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,219
to hold in there now we recommend that

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,559
your ponds be at least eight feet deep

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,510
15 feets probably better this is to

18
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,000
prevent winter kills you're going to

19
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,829
want to make sure that your your dam is

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,020
gonna have a lot of good clay in there

21
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,300
very little sand so that it can packs

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,520
very well and holds water you're also

23
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,829
going to want to check out the watershed

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,239
and find natural pinch points so right

25
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,039
here we have three ridges coming

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,320
together and we're gonna take the

27
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,600
shortest distance across there to hold

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,969
the most water for the least amount of

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,589
soil moved other things that you want to

30
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,360
take into consideration is what's in

31
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,130
your watershed so as you can see here

32
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,900
we're in a prairie this is going to do a

33
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,939
really good job of stopping soil

34
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,070
sediments from coming in as well as

35
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,530
reducing nutrient loads so you don't

36
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,840
have the aquatic plant problems another

37
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,460
thing you want to consider is the

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,320
construction the shape of that dam so

39
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,479
you want to have a three to one slope in

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,680
other words for every one foot of rise

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,140
you want to have three foot of run

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,119
that's going to establish some aquatic

43
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,979
plants on the edge but by the time you

44
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,720
get about ten feet offshore you're gonna

45
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,250
be at a depth where you're low enough to

46
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,340
where you're not promoting aquatic

47
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,710
plants to grow other things you can see

48
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,899
here we have trees in the watershed and

49
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,820
we can cut those trees off and create

50
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,829
really good fish habitat and that's

51
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,799
gonna congregate those fish in that area

52
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,990
so other questions that you might have

53
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,790
you can contact me again my name is

54
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,649
Allen Pattillo I'm your fisheries and

55
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,460
aquaculture extension specialist thanks

56
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,460
and good luck out there
