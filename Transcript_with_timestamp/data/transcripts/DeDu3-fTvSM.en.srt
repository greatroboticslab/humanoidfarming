00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,480
Hey, hey. I'm Sheay Wner and you are

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,560
listening to the Casual Cattle

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,000
Conversations Podcast. Whether you are a

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,840
seasoned rancher or just curious about

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,120
the cattle world, this podcast dives

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,559
into the stories, science, and

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,559
strategies shaping the future of

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,279
ranching. Let's get started and keep

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,439
your herd ahead of the herd. Folks,

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,400
today we are visiting with Devlon Ford

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,640
from the Noble Research Institute and we

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,640
are going to be talking about grazing,

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,119
but more specifically we are going to be

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,399
talking about some mistakes that

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,440
producers make that are really impacting

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,800
their profitability. So, Devlon is very

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,559
experienced in helping producers create

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,239
grazing plans that work for their unique

19
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,039
operations and improve their bottom

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,000
line. So he has a lot of expertise and

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,480
knowledge to share. He's very practical.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,160
I learned a lot in this conversation. So

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,079
I hope you learned a lot too. Now with

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,640
that I do want to remind you that if you

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,879
are looking for a speaker for your next

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,320
event, whether that is a workshop, a

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,240
keynote, panelist, in person or virtual,

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,760
I am still taking on slots for 2025. So,

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,840

and that goes straight to my email. But

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,880
with that, let's talk about grazing.

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
Does tax season make you want to bang

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,960
your head against the wall? Is billing a

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,640
bad word in your household? Does meeting

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,960
with your egg lender make your blood

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,799
pressure rise? Stress a little less with

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,560
cattle management software, Performance

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,320
Beef. It tracks important feed,

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,320
financial, and health data all in one

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,079
system. The results? You can pull

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,720
inventories, detailed financials, and

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,040
invoices in minutes. Get ahead for next

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,360
year's tax season. Visit

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,960
learn more. All righty. Well, Devon, I

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,200
am excited to have you on the show today

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,479
and to talk about grazing because

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,880
grazing is a topic that I sense that you

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,960
are passionate about and I know your

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,479
co-workers are very passionate about as

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,719
well, but it's just something that

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,000
always goes over well on the show and is

54
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,319
important for ranchers to always be

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,200
continuing their education on and maybe

56
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,760
brushing up on a few things. So, the

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,440
first thing I always ask guests, and

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,200
it's maybe not an easy question, but

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,360
it's sure a fun one to hear responses,

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,959
is why do you believe in the beef

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,760
industry?

62
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,560
I enjoy working with livestock, cattle,

63
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,879
particularly uh got to work cattle with

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,480
my son and some friends this last

65
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,560
weekend for the first time in a long

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,160
time. And while it was a good day, I

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,840
mean, it was we was working cattle, but

68
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,599
it was a good day. Enjoyable. I just

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,440
like being around like-minded people

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,800
like me that want to take care of their

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,720
livestock and their land. Absolutely.

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,800
And tell us a little bit more about what

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,560
you're doing today because you're with

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,280
the Noble Research Institute, but

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,800
elaborate a little bit more on your

76
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,200
role.

77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,440
My role is I'm one of facilitators. I

78
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,879
get to travel around a lot of the US

79
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,720
teaching courses primarily our noble

80
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,519
grazing essentials course and our

81
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,200
business of grazing course get to visit

82
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,040
with a lot of producers you know

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,959
hopefully when they leave our courses

84
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,360
they've taken something home that you

85
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,200
know from my past experiences and

86
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,840
typically every time I leave of course

87
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,519
I've taken home something from them so I

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,360
always tell everybody I'm a lifelong

89
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,680
learner I was about 50 when I finally

90
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,000
went back and got my master's degree so

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,519
as we go to these courses and facilitate

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,360
these programs. We get the opportunity

93
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,480
from learn to learn from those producers

94
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,400
as well. Well, I always like to visit

95
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,159
with lifelong learners. That's part of

96
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,319
the reason I started the podcast so that

97
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,159
I can continue to be one of those and

98
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,080
for all the other lifelong learners who

99
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,200
are constantly wanting to learn

100
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,959
something new, hear different

101
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,000
perspectives.

102
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,599
So, when we visited on the phone and

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,640
we're talking about, you know, what are

104
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:02,040
we going to talk about on this podcast

105
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,799
interview, you mentioned that one thing

106
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,319
that you either hear producers getting

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,040
mixed up or that you really focus on in

108
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,840
your courses is that difference between

109
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,239
carrying capacity and stocking rate.

110
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,639
Correct. Correct. I've been several

111
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,880
places and quite often people use those

112
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,560
two terms interchangeably. They use them

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,840
for the same thing and they're two very

114
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,400
distinct terms, definitions and outcomes

115
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,840
on your ranch when used properly. Do you

116
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,360
want to take some time to elaborate on

117
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,040
the two terms individually? So carrying

118
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,639
capacity is based off a mathematical

119
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,720
formula. It takes into account grazable

120
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:49,280
acres. It takes into account forge

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,960
production on those acres and it also

122
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,440
takes into account what utilization, how

123
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,199
much you want consumed of that forge

124
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,000
that's out there. Typically, that's

125
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,759
expressed as a percentage. And then on

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,880
the denominator side, you know, we'll

127
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,199
take your livestock weight and multiply

128
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,600
it by some intake value. Typically in

129
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,440
our classes, just as averages, we'll use

130
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,400
like a

131
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,160
2.6% intake per day for that animal. And

132
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,919
then you know how many ever days we're

133
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,919
planning on grazing. We'll multiply it

134
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,400
by that and then divide the numerator by

135
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,240
the bottom or the denominator. And that

136
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,120
will give us the carrying capacity for

137
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,639
our ranch. How many head our ranch will

138
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,320
support underneath the terms we put in

139
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,400
there. Grazable acres. You know, I hear

140
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,360
a lot of people say, "Oh, granddaddy did

141
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,039
it this way and he ran 100 cows and I

142
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,479
got the same amount of land." Well, you

143
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,400
might have the same amount of land and

144
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,160
you may not. In one of our classes at

145
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,000
the grazing essentials course, we talk

146
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,759
about this. We pull up a map that's

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,800
about 85 acres and 19 years later it's

148
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,880
75 acres just because the oil pad came

149
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,720
in, the highway moved south, different

150
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,639
things happen. So, and the other thing

151
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,800
about is if you're doing the things your

152
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,360
granddaddy did, you're probably running

153
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,240
bigger cows than your granddaddy did cuz

154
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,400
not many people's got a lot of thousand

155
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,960
pound cows anymore like my grandfather

156
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,400
did. So the forge

157
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,400
availability, you know, that's kind of

158
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,680
based on your climate, where you're at.

159
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,919
If you're more aid, you're probably

160
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,880
going to run less forge than say we are

161
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,199
here in South Central Oklahoma with 38

162
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,160
average inches of rainfall. So, you

163
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,639
know, you're only going to be able to

164
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,960
grow so much grass, so much forge for

165
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,440
those animals. Utilization, how much we

166
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,400
take is one decision as a manager or as

167
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,639
an owner that you make in that

168
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,360
calculation. you decide what it is that

169
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,000
we typically will try to push people to

170
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,039
take less than they want to because I've

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,960
heard the term that's wasting grass if I

172
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,560
don't eat it. No grass is ever wasted.

173
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,720
It's always useful for something

174
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,639
somewhere. Even if it's not ran through

175
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,280
a cow, it's going to it'll improve the

176
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,599
soil health in future once it lays on

177
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,680
the ground and decays. Those nutrients

178
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,280
can go back in the soil. On the bottom

179
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,960
side of that equation, we talked about

180
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,319
cow weight. And we just tell people take

181
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,479
the average weight of your cow herd. And

182
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,520
typically most people's going to use

183
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,720
1,200 lb cows and then multiply that by

184
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,240
the 2.6% intake. I know back in the 80s

185
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,520
when I was still in school, undergrad,

186
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,520
we talked 3% back there. Kind of the

187
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,720
range is 1.9 to 3.5 for cattle. So

188
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,720
somewhere in there, you know, depending

189
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,120
upon their stage of life cycle they're

190
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,560
in, whether they're cving or trying to

191
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,840
breed back up, that type of thing,

192
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,120
they're going their nutrient

193
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,720
requirements is going to be a little bit

194
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,840
different on a daily basis. So we just

195
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,080
use 2.6 as average. And then you take

196
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,199
that number and multiply by the days you

197
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,000
plan on grazing. If you plan on grazing

198
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,319
forages 365 days a year, that's the

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,240
number you use, 365.

200
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,639
If you've got a stalker operation and

201
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,879
you're going to be running 120 days,

202
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,560
that's the number you use. Once you do

203
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,039
all the math, it'll give you a number

204
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,639
and that's the maximum amount of cows

205
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,199
that that place will carry underneath

206
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,759
those conditions. Stocking rate, on the

207
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,280
other hand, is solely a management

208
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:17,199
decision. That is the number of animals

209
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,759
that we as managers and owners choose to

210
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,639
put on our landscapes. That's how many

211
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,879
animals we buy or put on that ranch. So,

212
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:29,120
it's straight up management decision.

213
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,280
So, what are the major implications and

214
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,320
problems you see when producers are

215
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,599
using those two terms

216
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,039
interchangeably instead of understanding

217
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,440
them for their two separate for being

218
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,880
two separate things? Typically what I

219
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,399
see happening is when they when they use

220
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,560
them interchangeably, they're not really

221
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,399
thinking or paying attention to their

222
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,000
ranch. Our ranches will teach us a lot

223
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,320
of stuff if we just look at it and

224
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,080
monitor it and see what happens over

225
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,839
time. But if they're using them

226
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,680
interchangeably, typically they have not

227
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,839
done the calculation to see if their

228
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,760
carrying capacity is where it needs to

229
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,120
be. You know, they may be low or they

230
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,320
may be high on their stocking rate

231
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,480
because they haven't calculated their

232
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,560
carrying capacity. Support your cattle's

the show notes. So when producers are

244
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,440
looking to calculate that carrying

245
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,399
capacity, I know you just went through

246
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,800
what goes into that calculation. Are

247
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,800
there other resources in their area that

248
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,440
they should turn to to kind of get

249
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,360
started on that or is it pretty much a

250
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,519
straightforward calculation across the

251
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,560
board no matter where they're at? Well,

252
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,160
the calculation is the same, but the

253
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,760
numbers are going to be different

254
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,680
depending upon where you're at, your

255
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,120
situation, and your numbers will be

256
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,519
different than your ranches, your

257
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,800
neighbor ranch's numbers. The grazable

258
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,800
acres, you know, people say, "Well, I

259
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,480
own 1,000 acres." It's a good deal. I'm

260
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,079
glad you do. How much of that is

261
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,480
grazable? Well, 1,000 acres is there's

262
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,079
no roads on it. There's no barns on it,

263
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,880
no lots on it, no

264
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,720
houses, very little brush or woods. So

265
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,160
that's where people get can get confused

266
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,120
there. They figured on how many acres

267
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,000
they own, not how many acres an animal

268
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,680
can graze on it. Quite often, you know,

269
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,839
oil field pads, we have some of those

270
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,920
here in South Central or South Central

271
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,680
Oklahoma. They don't think about those.

272
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,600
They don't think about their lots. You

273
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,320
know, if you do have brush, which we do

274
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,079
have a lot here in the Cross Timbers

275
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,600
region, we do have some control over the

276
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,600
brush. we can go in and either

277
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,839
strategically clear it with dozer or

278
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,320
something like that or you know if we're

279
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,760
very progressive and have very a whole

280
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,279
lot of patience we could bring in some

281
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,240
goats or something else that might eat

282
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,760
some of that brush. So that's you know

283
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,839
the grazable acres that's where those

284
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,600
kind of numbers could come from. Your

285
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,839
forge production is one of the hardest

286
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,760
numbers for people to come up with. And

287
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,440
the way we teach it in class is, you

288
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,839
know, if you got history of the ranch,

289
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,200
you probably

290
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,640
know, you know, I tell everybody when I

291
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,160
was on the ranches every day, I might

292
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,519
not tell you how many pounds of forge

293
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,760
was out there, but I could tell you how

294
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,640
long those set of cavs could be in that

295
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,000
pasture. So, I was still equating it. I

296
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,920
just wasn't thinking about it that way.

297
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,839
So, you know, you can visually appraise

298
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,000
it and say, "I've got 4,000 lbs of dry

299
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,839
matter here." You can take a ruler out

300
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,560
there and do some measurements and we've

301
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,720
got some methods here at Noble. Uh we've

302
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,399
worked with Jim Garish on some our

303
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,000
classes and he's helped us out a bunch

304
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,160
and you know, we've used a lot of his

305
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,040
spreadsheets and tricks and things like

306
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,680
that or you know, methods and we can

307
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,200
take that measure and do some measuring

308
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,519
out in the pastures and we come up with

309
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,440
that number. Another good way that I

310
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,600
tell a lot of people to do it is they

311
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,560
can get on

312
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:11,120
the NRCS web soil survey. It's a free

313
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,720
website. Very good to use for some

314
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,720
instances and it's it's a good starting

315
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,160
place for a lot of things. They can get

316
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,160
in there and outline their ranch on that

317
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,680
map and it'll give them an average. You

318
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,440
know, you can look at a good year or a

319
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,160
bad year or an average year. And I

320
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,680
suggest either going at the high end of

321
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,880
average year and at the low end of bad

322
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,720
or the best end of bad year because if

323
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,000
you use a good year every year your

324
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,040
carrying capacity is going to be too

325
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,959
high because we have 38 in average

326
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,680
rainfall here in Oklahoma and we might

327
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,240
hit that three out of

328
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,320
10. So but that's a good place to get

329
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,240
that forge production number just as a

330
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,920
base to get started. And then after

331
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,240
you've gotten started, you're monitoring

332
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,240
your animals, you're monitoring your

333
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,000
pastures, you're taking notes, recording

334
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,720
down all this information, and that will

335
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,120
help you become better the next time you

336
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,200
do these calculations. Again, the

337
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,320
utilization right rate, a lot of people

338
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,560
think they need to take 80 to 100% of

339
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,720
their

340
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,440
forage, and I would disagree with that.

341
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,800
We typically talk around depending upon

342
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,360
the type of forge we're talking about

343
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,880
30% on you know some native ranges here

344
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,800
in Oklahoma. If we're talking the

345
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,800
Bermuda grass we'll be talking a little

346
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,720
bit higher than that. If we're talking

347
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,200
winter wheat which we have a lot of you

348
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,360
know we're talking 60% or so. A lot of

349
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,120
those you know those annual type grasses

350
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,519
you can sometimes take a little bit more

351
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,440
than you can your perennials. But your

352
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,880
native perennials they are made to take

353
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,880
a little bit and move on down the road

354
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,800
and let that plant grow and recover. the

355
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,320
livestock number. I I ask a lot of

356
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,839
people what their cows weigh and I get a

357
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,800
lot of numbers and then I ask how many

358
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,120
people's got scales and not a lot of

359
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,639
people have scales. So unless you're you

360
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,079
make a living buying cattle and know

361
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,639
what a cattle weighs, you might miss

362
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,800
your cattle weight a little bit. And

363
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,440
then daily intake there's you can set it

364
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,440
at 2.6 3% either one of those would be

365
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,639
fine if you want to be a little bit

366
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,800
safer. 3% would be good average number

367
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,079
to use. And then the number of days is,

368
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,519
you know, that's dependent upon how long

369
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,160
you want to graze. If you plan on

370
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,639
feeding hay and, you know, energy or

371
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,519
protein supplement 60 days, then that

372
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,920
number is 305 days. If you've got a

373
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,760
lease that runs out in 9 months, you're

374
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,519
looking at a 9 month or 270 days. You

375
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,120
know, whatever how many ever days you're

376
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,040
planning on grazing that landscape where

377
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,800
you put that number there. So, like I

378
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,440
said, the carrying capacity calculations

379
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,519
is some of

380
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:40,000
the hardest math we teach. Okay. So, I

381
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,079
really appreciate you walking me through

382
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,480
that and the listeners through that and

383
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,000
going into more detail there. So, we've

384
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,839
talked carrying capacity, stocking rate,

385
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,040
and before we started this, you also

386
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,760
talked about stocking density. So, do

387
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,920
you want to throw that in there, too,

388
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,560
and share how that's different than the

389
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,000
other two terms we just talked about?

390
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,320
Stock density is it's basically the

391
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,199
amount of pounds or the pounds of

392
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,720
animals that you put on a specific

393
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:15,519
spot. Typically, you know, most people

394
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,680
are going to be talking 20,000 lbs of

395
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:23,120
stock density. So, that'd be 21,000 lb

396
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,079
cows on an acre. That's 20,000 pounds of

397
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,399
stock density per acre. In our classes,

398
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,519
typically the last day on our grazing

399
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,240
essentials course, we will show our

400
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,160
producers what a million pounds of stock

401
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,560
density look like. So imagine if you

402
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,800
would about 30 cows in a 50 by 50 fence.

403
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,959
50 foot by 50 foot. 30 cows. We leave

404
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,399
them there for 1 hour is all we do. And

405
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,720
then we'll open the gate and move them.

406
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,880
Again, stock density allows us to do a

407
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,800
lot of different things. And I'm not

408
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,959
telling anybody to go out and do a

409
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,680
million pounds of stock density.

410
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,199
Anywhere north of 60,000 to 100,000 is

411
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,880
pretty good. The higher you get, the

412
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,120
more intensively man you have to manage

413
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,759
it. So, but stock density is one of the

414
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,480
best tools in a grazer's toolbox. One of

415
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,920
the things that as animals graze around,

416
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,360
you know, they're going after what we

417
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,680
call the ice cream plants. They're going

418
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,839
after what they really want. And if we

419
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,720
give them enough time and enough room,

420
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,959
that's what they're going to do. But if

421
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,399
we put them down into a smaller area,

422
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,920
we're going to convince them that they

423
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,279
need to eat something. So they probably

424
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,360
need to eat whatever they can get a hold

425
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,360
of real quick. So you'll get a little

426
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,680
you get a lot more uniform grazing

427
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,079
distribution that way. You know, you're

428
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,639
using more of your forages that they may

429
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,880
normally pass over until the second or

430
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:45,360
third time back through there. Is there

431
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,839
an impact on animal performance when

432
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,519
we're when you're seeing higher stocking

433
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,920
densities in those more intensive

434
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,839
systems? One thing we need to remember

435
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,600
when we're talking stock density, you

436
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,480
know, we're talking pounds of animals

437
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,800
and time. And time is a very critical

438
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,079
piece of that. With the high higher

439
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,160
stock densities, we're putting

440
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:08,799
more nutrient back into the soil, more

441
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,640
manure, more urine back into the soil in

442
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,600
a smaller area. In other words, they're

443
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,760
not able to go a half a mile and loaf at

444
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,439
the water and, you know, and spread

445
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,039
their manure and urine there around the

446
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,240
water or underneath the shade trees. You

447
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,640
know, they're putting it on the pasture

448
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,600
where it's going to give us the biggest

449
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,600
benefit for our

450
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,799
operation. The other thing about stock

451
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,559
density is it's a tool. You know, we can

452
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,240
make those animals eat things that they

453
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,039
may not necessarily want to eat. It's

454
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,480
not going to hurt them, but they will

455
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,799
eat that. I mean, they'll still gain

456
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,480
weight on those forges. The other thing

457
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,480
it'll do is if we have a lot of dry

458
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,960
standing forge that for whatever reason

459
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,400
we didn't graze get grazed off or maybe

460
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,760
it's a, you know, winter pasture that's,

461
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,799
you know, already terminated and went to

462
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,520
seed. And we can use stock density to

463
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,280
lay that forge that's 2 or 3 foot tall

464
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,880
that the cattle are, you know, the stems

465
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,720
all dignified. The cattle are not going

466
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,120
to eat it. They're going to graze around

467
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,000
it. We can use that stock density to

468
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,000
then put that taller forge on the ground

469
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,919
and get it in closer contact with the

470
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,880
soil. So now we're back to feeding the

471
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,200
soil and the soil feeds the grass and

472
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,679
the grass feeds your cows. So for years

473
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,200
when I was managing cattle for Noble on

474
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,280
different ranches, I always thought I

475
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,280
was a cattle manager or cowboy, whatever

476
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,080
you want to call me. Come to find out,

477
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,120
what I've since then learned is I'm more

478
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,400
of a grass manager and a soil manager

479
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,000
than I am the cattle manager. I'm

480
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,320
hearing more and more people share that

481
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,240
perspective or change in thought, if you

482
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,480
will, however you want to describe that.

483
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,600
So with all of that, when we're thinking

484
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:58,960
about the profitability of ranches and

485
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,280
how grazing systems fit into that, what

486
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:06,200
is that profitability impact if

487
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:10,960
producers are putting too many or too

488
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,559
few cattle in their pastures and not,

489
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,520
you know, understanding those terms

490
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,520
correctly and having that plan, the

491
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,600
problem with running more animals are

492
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,240
setting our stocking rate above our

493
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,480
carrying capacity is we are more than

494
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,720
likely going to increase our direct cost

495
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,440
to those animals because we're more than

496
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,320
likely going to have to feed more

497
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,039
substitutional feeding feed hay more

498
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,200
protein or more energy. Not to mention

499
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,720
what we could potentially do or what we

500
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,280
will be doing once we start overg

501
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,200
grazing our ranches. You know what when

502
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,200
we overg graze our ranches we're you

503
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,600
know we're declining the roots in the

504
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,320
soil. We're declining the quality of the

505
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,720
soil on our ranches because there's no

506
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,799
forge there to grow. One of the six soil

507
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,320
health principles is always keep living

508
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:00,320
roots. Well, anytime we take a plant and

509
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,799
bite it to the point where we remove too

510
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,880
many of the leaves off of it, think of

511
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,200
those leaves as a solar panel on your

512
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,960
charger, fence charger. And what would

513
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,799
happen if you covered up half of those

514
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,240
solar cells with tape? It wouldn't the

515
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,240
charger wouldn't function like it

516
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,640
should. Same way with plants. If we

517
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,320
remove too many

518
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,919
leaves, that plant cannot perform

519
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,160
because it doesn't have any solar. So

520
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,400
then it starts pulling carbohydrates up

521
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,480
out of the roots out of the soil up to

522
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,919
the plant for growth. So that's one of

523
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,000
the dangers of stocking your ranch above

524
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,440
carrying

525
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,039
capacity. On the other hand of that for

526
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,039
profitability when we start you know

527
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,280
stocking rate is the primary determinant

528
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,559
of pro

529
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,480
profitability. Stocking rate is the

530
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,880
primary determinant of profitability. If

531
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,280
we stock few too few of animals on that

532
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,120
ranch, then we're probably not going to

533
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,480
have enough revenue coming in that we

534
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,840
can cover our overhead cost as well. So,

535
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,840
you know, we have to think about that,

536
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,720
too. There's a pretty good curve. You

537
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,360
know, the higher the stocking rate, the

538
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,440
less production you get with an animal.

539
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,320
But there's also, you know, if I'm in a

540
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,159
stalker operation, I may choose to, you

541
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,320
know, only gain two pounds a day and run

542
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,320
more animals than I run fewer animals

543
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,080
and gain two and a half. So, you know,

544
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,000
stocking rates, that's pretty fine line.

545
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,880
And we, you know, I I typically would

546
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,320
recommend people to depend upon their

547
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,960
forages, the climate they're in, how aid

548
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,640
it is, how wet it is, you know,

549
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,720
typically set that stocking rate

550
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,400
somewhere between 70 maybe 85%. If

551
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,880
certain times, you know, if you're doing

552
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,799
some winter pasture graze out with some

553
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,400
yards, then, you know, you can run that

554
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,640
a little bit higher, but just need to be

555
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,840
aware that you may need to be selling

556
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,840
those animals a little bit quicker than

557
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,360
you thought you would. So, you know, a

558
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,120
lot of this just kind of goes back to a

559
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,200
context of that producer and their goals

560
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,720
for their ranch.

561
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,480
Do you have big ambitions for your

562
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,919
operation, but feel like you get so

563
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,919
caught up in the day-to-day fires that

564
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,159
you are just spinning in circles? You

565
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,320
aren't alone. I've been in your shoes

566
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,480
and know just how frustrating it can be.

567
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,360
That's why I created Move the Ranch

568
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,440
Forward. It's a guide for ranchers. This

569
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,280
guide is a PDF that contains the exact

570
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,640
process my husband and I use to stay

571
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,240
focused on our goals throughout the

572
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,360
year, even when life throws us

573
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,840
curveballs. You can access move the

574
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,240

conversations.com.

576
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,480
So, you've touched a little bit on, you

577
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,559
know, when you're talking about stocking

578
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,960
density and talked about, you know, some

579
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,440
of the cool things you can do with that

580
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,600
and there's a lot of buzz around some of

581
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,760
those more

582
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,640
intensive grazing strategies, but there

583
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,360
are still a lot of producers who moving

584
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,960
cattle every day isn't necessarily

585
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,159
feasible or doesn't feel feasible

586
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,760
depending on their business plan. So,

587
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,000
what tips do you have for producers like

588
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,240
that who want to make sure they're still

589
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,080
being good stewards of the land and

590
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,760
improving those pastures that they're

591
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,000
grazing?

592
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,440
I totally understand that cuz a couple

593
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,799
years ago, me and my wife lived about 45

594
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,400
minutes from where our cattle were. So,

595
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,400
basically, I'd checked them about every

596
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,559
3 days. So I would come up and I would

597
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,400
move my cattle about every three days.

598
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,559
What we typically tell people in wetter

599
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,200
climates like we have here in Oklahoma,

600
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:24,320
you know, once you go in there and start

601
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,960
grazing an area, within about 3 to 5

602
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,080
days after you first move in there,

603
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,320
there'll be new leaves coming up on that

604
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,799
plant. And as those new leaves come up,

605
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,559
those are the plants and those are the

606
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,480
leaves those animals are going to target

607
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,960
because it's fresh growth. We all know

608
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,280
that fresh young growth is very

609
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,720
palatable, very nutritious, and that's

610
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,760
what those animals want. So, if we can

611
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,840
move them every 3 to 5 days in, you

612
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,840
know, a wetter climate, 5 to seven in

613
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,000
more aid climate where the grass grows a

614
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,320
little bit slower, we're okay. you know,

615
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,919
later in the year when, you know, we

616
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,760
start moving in towards fall, you know,

617
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,880
we might be able to extend that a little

618
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,760
bit of time in there just

619
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,600
because, you know, the plants aren't

620
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,640
growing as fast as they are in the, you

621
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,120
know, late spring, early summer. So, you

622
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,440
know, we have to make this fit our

623
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,200
ranch, fit our lifestyle, and just

624
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,520
understand our what our goals are for

625
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,200
our ranch. And if our goals are to

626
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,440
improve soil health and we have the

627
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,360
ability to move every day, great, get

628
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,360
after it. If you only have the ability

629
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,520
to move once or twice a week, do the

630
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,000
best you can, but always remember there

631
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,559
are pros and cons to everything we do.

632
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,200
So, you

633
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:39,159
know, someone who moves every day, they

634
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,520
may improve their ranch

635
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:43,760
faster, but they've got a lot more time

636
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,919
invested in it, too. Someone who moves

637
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,600
three or five once or twice a week,

638
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,440
they'll achieve the same results. It may

639
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,360
just take them a little bit longer, but

640
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,080
still yet there's quality of life that's

641
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,640
involved in all this as well. Well, and

642
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,200
I think about myself personally, we have

643
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,600
a very we have a diversified operation.

644
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,120
So there with the farming and other

645
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,200
businesses too. That's something else

646
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,360
that we always take into consideration

647
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,080
when we think through our grazing plan

648
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,880
and breeding groups each summer. Yeah.

649
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,760
on our uh business of grazing course we

650
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,120
work a lot on a grazing plan and that's

651
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,799
one of the things we put in there you

652
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,880
know we draw a line on the grazing plan

653
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,799
and said you know this we're going to

654
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,120
start cving here and you know we're

655
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,880
going to start stop cving here and you

656
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,880
know I want to go on vacation with my

657
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,480
family and we put that in there and we

658
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,960
do all this just as you said that way

659
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,880
that helps us plan those rotations and

660
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,679
our grazing movements and unfortunately

661
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,080
uh you know ranching is a great life but

662
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,720
It's doesn't always go the way we

663
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,279
planned out on paper. So, but by having

664
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,000
that grazing plan that allows us to be

665
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,960
more adaptive in our management and we

666
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,679
can make movements earlier. We talk

667
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,679
planning a lot and being very adaptive

668
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,200
because it's regenerative ranching and

669
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:05,520
grazing is adaptive grazing. It's not a

670
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:08,679
set in stone dynamic plan. So when you

671
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,360
are teaching those courses and helping

672
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:13,679
ranchers create those grazing plans or

673
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,000
modify existing ones, what are some

674
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,600
other common mistakes that you help

675
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,120
people work through or see or maybe it's

676
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,720
not a mistake so much as a missed

677
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,640
opportunity?

678
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,840
You that varies from course to course

679
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,440
and participants and that's one of the

680
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,960
reasons I love doing what we do is

681
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,799
because I get an opportunity to talk to

682
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,480
these people, understand their

683
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,840
particular situations a little bit

684
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,360
better. I was talking to one gentleman

685
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,440
and he realized that he was probably

686
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,200
overstocked. He was a purebred breeder

687
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,120
and he thought, "Well, I'll plant this

688
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,720
crop then I can graze it." And I told

689
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,159
him, I said, "Well, that's good. At

690
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,400
least you're doing something for the

691
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,799
soil that way, but all you're really

692
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,000
doing is

693
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,440
replacing one feeding for a different

694
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,360
type of feeding that you're spending

695
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,960
money on. Don't get me wrong, I mean,

696
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,640
bell grazing, you know, feeding, there's

697
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,039
nothing wrong with feeding hay. I've got

698
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,200
plans to do it on our place this year.

699
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,559
I've got some areas where the soil is

700
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,000
not where I'd like to be and I'd like to

701
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,679
put a little cover on it. So, I'm going

702
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
to do what we call bail gra there and

703
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,080
roll some hay out and allow my animals

704
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,720
to get there, get around it and eat. I

705
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,400
do not plan on taking letting them eat

706
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,320
that hay to the ground. I'm going to

707
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,880
leave a lot of it behind just kind of

708
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,919
put some cover on that soil. So, those

709
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,080
are just different types of

710
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,919
opportunities we get. And I talked to

711
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,240
one lady had a very sizable ranch and

712
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,559
she was want to know how to put

713
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,279
infrastructure in that on that this one

714
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:36,480
pasture and it was rather large. And I

715
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,960
said same way I do it on my 140 acres. I

716
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,640
develop a plan and I implement that plan

717
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,240
when and as I can. Slow and

718
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:48,480
easy. Anytime we start making ranching

719
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,600
too hard, it becomes unfund quickly.

720
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,960
Slow and easy. So you recommend

721
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,200
producers kind of

722
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,279
ease into it a lot of times as they make

723
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,480
those changes or I mean that can be case

724
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,840
by case too I know but case by case is

725
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,840
but typically when we're talking to

726
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,240
producers

727
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,799
that are ranching and farming a little

728
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,720
bit more conventionally we ask them to

729
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,320
just

730
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:16,000
get a set of land whether it's you know

731
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,000
10 or 50 or 100 acres whatever and start

732
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,159
there on that concentrate on improving

733
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,720
that one we typically going to ask them

734
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,399
to start with their better plant to do

735
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,520
that

736
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:27,120
with. And if there's things they want to

737
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,640
try on some other spots, that's fine.

738
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,559
But put their concentration and their

739
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,960
focus on this one little spot. And then

740
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,640
as they get more adaptive and more

741
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,480
adjusted to looking at seeing what

742
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,039
they're seeing and understanding what

743
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,080
they're seeing, they start seeing these

744
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:42,640
improvements. Then that gives them the

745
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,559
energy to go to, you know, to expand on

746
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,159
out to the rest of their land. You know,

747
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,760
that's kind of what me and my wife did

748
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,679
at our place. When it comes to

749
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,640
infrastructure, I say a little at a time

750
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,600
because infrastructure is not

751
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:58,159
cheap. Anytime you build any fence or

752
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,679
lay a water line or dig a well, it's

753
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,200
there's some dollars involved in there

754
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,279
and you know, you need to calculate that

755
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,440
out. Make certain you can still cash

756
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,880
flow or you know where the money is

757
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,799
going to come from. Can you afford it?

758
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,240
What's it going to do for you? What's

759
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,360
the return on investment going to be?

760
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,320
How long is it going to take to pay off?

761
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,760
I mean, there's all kinds of

762
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,159
considerations especially when you start

763
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,960
spending money on your ranch. for

764
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,480
producers who

765
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,200
are

766
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:26,480
overstocked but maybe fighting that

767
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,159
concept of change and how to start and

768
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,120
where to start. What are some questions

769
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,080
you recommend they ask themselves? Are

770
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,039
they over carrying

771
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,799
capacity? If they're over carrying

772
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:41,039
capacity, can they reduce the size of

773
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,039
their herd?

774
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,640
And if if the answer is yes to that, I

775
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,080
mean you obviously anybody can reduce

776
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,240
their size of the herd, but they have to

777
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,080
be willing to do that. You know, I know

778
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,600
a lot of purebred breeders and they say

779
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,799
it's my genetics that make me

780
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,880
profitable. And I will argue with them.

781
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,600
It's the decisions they made choosing

782
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,360
those genetics that made those genetics

783
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,880
profitable. In their mind, it genetics

784
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,440
has nothing to do. It's the choices they

785
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,360
made in choosing those genetics. So, you

786
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,120
know, if we are overstocked, my first

787
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,279
recommendation is to start, you know,

788
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,720
getting rid of those unproductive, if

789
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,039
we're straight cow calf, getting rid of

790
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,640
those unproductive cows. If we have

791
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,720
multiple enterprises, maybe we're

792
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:23,279
running goats and or sheep or stalkers

793
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,080
or cow calf, whatever enterprises we

794
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,480
got, evaluate each one of those

795
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,320
enterprises to make certain they're all

796
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,000
profitable and then choose the mix of

797
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,120
enterprises that's going to make us the

798
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,200
most money and that we want to mess with

799
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,880
and use those enterprises moving

800
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,240
forward.

801
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,679
setting the carrying capac getting the

802
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,320
carrying capacity right and setting

803
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,039
stock density appropriately cuz quite

804
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,799
often what happens down here is you know

805
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,240
everybody's dependent upon that spring

806
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,880
rain and then when we don't get that

807
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,200
spring rain and we go dry you know we're

808
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,279
not going to grow as much forge and now

809
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,360
all of a

810
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:01,200
sudden we've got to sell cows and if you

811
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,039
want to talk about an emotional decision

812
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,760
that's when you decide you have to sell

813
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,039
cows in a drought which cows are you

814
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,120
going to sell that becomes very

815
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,559
emotional to a lot of people. So, you

816
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,880
know, if you set your carrying capacity

817
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,919
below or I mean set your stocking rate

818
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,120
below carrying capacity, then you

819
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,720
automatically got a little bit of a

820
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,760
buffer in those years that's dry, you

821
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,640
may not have to destock at all. You may

822
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,279
be able to not destock as much, take out

823
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,200
fewer animals. Those years where it we

824
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,640
get adequate rain or a lot of rain and

825
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,679
we've got a whole lot of forage and

826
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,840
you're sitting there thinking, I've got

827
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,080
all this forge. What can I do with it? I

828
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,679
don't have enough cows. Well, there's

829
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,760
opportunities there. you know, we can

830
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,919
bring in a a set of yardings and graze

831
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,919
in there. We may u be able to bring in

832
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,000
some cows that we contract graze on our

833
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,559
place. Maybe there's some areas we

834
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,240
wanted to do some land improvements and

835
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,600
maybe we're going to set aside some land

836
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,039
that we've always wanted to burn but

837
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,840
just didn't have the forge. So, you

838
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:59,279
know, those gives you opportunities that

839
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,919
way. All right. Well, as people go ahead

840
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,559
and think about our conversation today,

841
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,480
if they want to dive deeper into this or

842
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:11,440
get more information, what resources

843
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,240
should they go to or do you recommend?

844
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,320
They can always go to our website. It's

845
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,840
noble.org. There's some articles. Uh

846
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,360
there's a list of our classes that they

847
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,039
could attend if they want to do that. I

848
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,919
know we've got several coming up in

849
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,919
several different states pretty quickly.

850
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,159
There's all kinds of other groups that

851
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,080
are out there, podcasts such as

852
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,840
yourself, YouTube channels, different

853
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,919
things like that. The regenerative

854
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,559
ranching movement is

855
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,640
becoming more mainstained, I mainstay, I

856
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,000
believe. So, there's opportunities

857
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:47,120
everywhere to look for information.

858
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,679
All right. Well, I really appreciate our

859
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,880
conversation today and your willingness

860
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,360
to share your knowledge and expertise.

861
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,240
For those of you who are listening, you

862
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,000
can find the link to the Noble website

863
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,000
in the show notes. It's under that

864
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,440
description there. It'll be easy for you

865
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,559
to find there. And with that, happy

866
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,559
ranching, folks.
