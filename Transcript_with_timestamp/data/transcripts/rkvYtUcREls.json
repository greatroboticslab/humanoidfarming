  "text": "hi folks ron agronomist with pioneer in central texas you can see i'm in a field of corn that's taking some pretty severe heat skull due to drought conditions you can look at these plants and see that the top material is completely scalded very little green left plants are starting to shut down question i would have this about this is what kind of yield can i expect out of these particular plants and will there even be any here's an air on down the road let's go on down here and see what it looks as we get across here notice as you go through here a lot of these leaves are scorched very little photosynthesis happening these are still alive but severely rolled up and of course the husks are starting to turn turn by so as we look right here it starts to improve as we get on down there so we've got an ear that i pulled back there let's investigate this a little bit and see what it looks like well number one you can tell right off the bat a little bit of incomplete pollination probably due to drought and that piece of soil is very very shallow back there a lot of rock this is an air i pulled on down the way it's a little better shape but one of the things you'll notice is some missing kernels my expectation here is probably that was a late roundup application we had such severe dry weather early in the season we didn't have weeds to spray at the correct time you know v8 or 30 inches whichever comes first when you have a drought a lot of times you shorten the internodes you'll have plants at a farther growth stage than you ever imagined so you could see looking here these uh these ears are not going to yield that well but if you look down here at this board where we've gathered two hybrids two different ones new 1122 the new 095 at differing populations they look pretty decent well that's a different part of the field a little bit better soil and notice our populations 25 22 18. so 25 on this piece of land is probably a little bit rich 22 is probably about right and 18's on the low side so a question i would get is okay ron what's gonna happen to these ears if these plants die well we're at the dent stage for the most part or early dent you're not going to abort kernels on the tip any longer because you're at that advanced growth stage what you will see though is you will see these kernels shrivel they will be very small like that be very hard to get in the combine and they will have very limited test weight so can you still lose yield absolutely kernel depth and test weight are going to be the two culprits in this situation again little better soils a lot better results a lot of fields will be that way this year i hope this helps you all have a great harvest season that concludes this pioneer agronomy video podcast visit our page on pioneer.com and follow us on twitter and facebook for more agronomy insights",
