1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,040
now our crop is finally starting to

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,039
exert itself it's within a week of

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,600
Maximum tillering so it's it's growing

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,560
quite strongly now and a lot of those

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,119
gaps that we've had to live with for

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,119
several weeks are finally starting to

7
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:26,359
fill in so we're feeling

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,039
better uh this week we're going to take

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,119
the opportunity to talk about uh what I

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,079
would call the biotic influences on the

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:38,480
crop and making an assessment of it so

12
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:40,840
that's how uh animals plants funguses

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,000
and viruses how how they're interacting

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,760
with the crop both beneficial and not

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,399
beneficial and I have with me here Nancy

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,079
Castillo who uh who is a specialist in

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,559
assessing uh rice crops for for the

18
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,879
biotic influences and the level of

19
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,600
injury that's coming from it and Nancy

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,719
and I will will step through the process

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,879
of

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:09,119
assessing the rice crop for insects for

23
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:13,400
um for weeds for and for diseases both

24
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,360
from viruses and funguses so uh in we go

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,400
so next week what we intend to do is

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,360
that we will be collecting data on

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,320
injuries caused by animal pest animal

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,360
pest uh uh refer to insect pest snails

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,960
and rats and then we will be also

30
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,799
assessing injuries caused by diseases um

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,520
viral disease bacterial diseases and um

32
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,200
um fungal diseases and then we will be

33
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,719
also uh assessing uh injuries caused by

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,680
weeds this this is direct seated rice so

35
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:50,079
we have here a quadrat what we call as a

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,520
We call we we consider some kind of a

37
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:57,119
magic weapon so this is equivalent to

38
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,439
one heel and transplanted rice so

39
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,320
we we would actually be sampling

40
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:08,360
um for for diseases and insect and uh

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,319
and uh insect injuries we will be using

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,680
um 10 quadrants we be sampling from 10

43
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:18,120
quadrants and then we would be also uh

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,400
taking uh um we will be sampling weeds

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,319
from three areas each area would be

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,920
about 1 M by 1 M so we would be

47
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,360
assessing weeds relative to the height

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,360
of the canopy and we will be recording

49
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,519
the type of weeds that we will find uh

50
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,720
next week so we have a sweep net yes

51
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,319
this is a sweep net we use this for uh

52
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,319
counting the flying insects in this case

53
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:44,159
mainly Green Leaf

54
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:47,280
Hoppers uh Green Leaf Hopper is the

55
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,840
vector of tongro for the topping method

56
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,920
we have this small a pan here with water

57
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,440
it has a little detergent and we use it

58
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,599
for counting sacking insects like uh

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,400
plant Hoppers white back plant Hoppers

60
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,920
Brown plant Hoppers and in other in in

61
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,640
the surveys we do in other parts of the

62
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:12,640
Philippines we also catch rice bugs okay

63
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,879
okay um black bugs rather black so so

64
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,159
with these these magic

65
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,519
weapons week when the crop reaches the

66
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:23,040
stage of Maximum tillering you'll make

67
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,840
an assessment uh according to our our

68
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,560
data sheet and then again uh in the

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,159
reproductive stage in in the grain

70
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,599
filling and mature mature stage uh we'll

71
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,959
make another assessment that should give

72
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,760
us a good idea of what biological things

73
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,120
have done uh both for and against our

74
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,599
our rice

75
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,519
crop as the crop gets into maximum

76
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,920
tillering it's it's really doing its

77
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,200
thing the the photosynthetic synthetic

78
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,200
engine is really starting to power the

79
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,519
rice crop along

80
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,920
unfortunately Akim I and the local

81
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,439
rodents are deepening our relationship

82
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,360
and they've emerged and uh are damaging

83
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,319
the drop and use so whilst most of the

84
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,280
field is is filling in nicely we're

85
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,720
still getting getting gaps in the crop

86
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,920
and those gaps do seem to be

87
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,920
multiplying uh we're doing our best to

88
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,919
control the rats around the field at the

89
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,000
moment as per our regular program here

90
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,680
at irie but uh these holes are

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,400
irritating to say the least so we'll go

92
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,840
out and have a look at one of them it's

93
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,840
it's complete

94
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
damage

95
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,080
eating the rice off at the ground

96
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,039
completely killed the rice plant and

97
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,199
rendered an area somewhere between half

98
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,919
a square meter and a full square meter

99
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,039
completely bare or pretty well

100
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,520
bare they're quite selective they didn't

101
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:51,759
even eat the weeds which was a bit a bit

102
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,680
annoying um I can now appreciate how

103
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,400
rodents can completely decimate a crop

104
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,919
um Grant described to me the typical

105
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,479
pattern where they'll completely destroy

106
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,840
the inside of a field and leave the

107
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,960
borders intact which is a good deceptive

108
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,000
way to do your

109
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,400
work um I'm hoping we can stop the

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,560
emergence of these new new bear areas

111
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,560
from rats we'll just have to work our

112
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,560
hardest and uh do our

113
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,319
best
