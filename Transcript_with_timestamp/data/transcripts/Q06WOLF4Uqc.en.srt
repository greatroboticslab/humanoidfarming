00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,040
hi I'm Mark Hall with the Alabama

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,879
Cooperative Extension system with me

6
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:43,559
today is Brad Durham Brad is our uh

7
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:45,600
natural resources advisor for the uh for

8
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,199
Al University and he's located here at

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,760
to Tennesse Valley research and

10
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,360
Extension Center and we're going to be

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,480
talking about linear irrigation today

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,160
linear irrigation Brad that that don't

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:00,079
suit everybody but in some places it's

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,000
it's what folks need tell us about

15
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,840
linear linear is just it goes down and

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,520
bite down and bite don't Circle it looks

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,640
like uh it's the same above ground but

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,280
tell us about linear irrigation uh it's

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,720
a real good system for any rectangle or

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,720
square Fields you have whereas the

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,520
center pivots you know goes around in

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,840
circles and some of the edges don't get

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,520
irrigated don't get irrigation we got a

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,079
hose drag system here and you can get a

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,280
ditch fed or a hose drag system and

26
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,799
they're very very efficient uh on a

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,399
square field and you can cover you know

28
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,240
quite a bit of of acreage so you can set

29
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,520
it up so that you you're irrigating

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,320
every square foot every row of that

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,280
field is irrigated if it fits in a

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,000
linear that's correct where it can go

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,719
down and back which a lot of fields do

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,759
uh what are the uh uh

35
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:56,640
disadvantages uh of it compared to say

36
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,360
drip or Center pivot uh a center pivot

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,119
you know you can pretty much hit the

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,719
button and go a uh linear move system is

39
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:08,360
more labor intensive we've got to swap

40
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,640
hoses every 500 ft we have to swap hoses

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,440
which you know you have to have either a

42
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,200
tractor or a truck and drag a hose to

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,680
the next hydrant hook it up um you just

44
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,800
have to look after it more cuz you

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,360
really don't want to pull one of those

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,120
hydrants out of the ground yeah it's

47
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,080
they're in the ground about 4T and

48
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,720
they're very very hard to dig up and in

49
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,319
your place how long will those hoses

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,440
last to me it look like that would be a

51
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,840
weakness of the system getting Dr along

52
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,440
the ground well the hoses this is our

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,040
second set of hoses here and the the

54
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,640
irrigation system has been in for about

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,159
20 years I believe um so they last a

56
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,879
good 8 to 10 years I would say on

57
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,519
average for water usage would the water

58
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,680
usage for a linear system be the same

59
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,640
per acre as a a center pivot yes sir

60
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,440
same per acre same per acre but crop

61
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,040
wise talk about crops will just a minute

62
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,840
Brad would it make any difference

63
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,879
whether you're growing uh we've got corn

64
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,879
corn and soybeans and cotton under this

65
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:08,640
year but strawberries uh high value

66
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,720
vegetable crops would it work just the

67
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,640
same on any of them I would assume it

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,440
would uh I don't have very much of a

69
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,840
horiculture background I would think it

70
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,640
would work along the same lines you know

71
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,959
we got the drop nozzles you know that're

72
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,680
closer can you get closer to the ground

73
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,080
you know where you don't have a lot more

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,720
you know in the hotter parts of the

75
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,400
summer you got a lot of

76
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,319
evaporation um from overhead

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,799
irrigation so

78
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,280
anything else I I just drug him out of

79
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,840
the field and said come here and talk to

80
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,879
me about our linear irrigation system

81
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,680
and I appreciate you doing that Brad any

82
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,000
other thoughts on this cuz you're you

83
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,760
seem to be the go-to guy and I see out

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,720
there working on that thing all the time

85
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,599
when when it's going when it's hot

86
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,040
weather irrigation is a job that's

87
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,640
correct you know the only other labor

88
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,120
intensive part of the machine is uh the

89
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,920
furah you know we have to keep a fur dug

90
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,480
to guide the system you dig a furah you

91
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,480
know we got GPS Auto Steer tractors can

92
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,280
dig a precise furra and run that machine

93
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,560
the irrigation machine right in a very

94
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,439
precise location you know I I would

95
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,360
think if you didn't have rtk you know

96
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,199
systems that might be a little bit of a

97
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,720
burden you know it could get out of line

98
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,840
and it's got these little sensors on the

99
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,440
uh the furah got it fur Wheels you know

100
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,120
if it gets out of line it'll cut itself

101
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,360
off and cut the water off all that so

102
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,440
it's it's really good system say a

103
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,919
little bit more about that in line I

104
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,800
tell you the truth I hadn't even thought

105
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:38,680
about that that it's just it's just a

106
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,440
linear it's like a board it's like a 2x4

107
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,280
going over but it's got all these wheels

108
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,680
so if one of them gets off man it could

109
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,800
get twisted around that's correct um now

110
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,759
the newer systems are they have some GPS

111
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,199
driven systems now would that be on

112
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,440
every wheel or just one the those I

113
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:58,840
believe are just on one

114
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,440
station um you know our ours is in the

115
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,880
middle of the field our F in the middle

116
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,160
of the field most of them are on the

117
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,800
inside right next to the cart as you

118
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,560
know most people call the cart it's

119
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,280
where the motor where all the

120
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,000
operation uh operations are for the

121
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,199
machine thank you Brad I appreciate your

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,680
your sharing knowledge with us today

123
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,800
folks if you'd like to look at our other

124
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,479
irrigation videos here's a website that

125
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,800
they're all on there or any other a or

126
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,680
or 4 or homet kind of videos how to how

127
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,160
to skin a catfish all kind of

128
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,319
