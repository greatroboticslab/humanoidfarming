  "text": "hello again it's spring the sun is shining some of the time everything is growing lots of birds and bees and other creatures are flowing around doing their thing and it's time to get out in the garden and this is I've been a little bit stuck trying to finish my book because I keep looking out the window and thinking I should be out there doing things outside so I thought given time let's do this little video bell books I would do a video about a couple of books to do with gardening and they both come out in the last month or so the first one I'm going to share with you is called edible paradise it's by a woman called Vera I wish I could pronounce her surname I could not do it justice I'm sure we don't get very well trained in foreign languages in England but there there it is Vera I do apologize for not knowing how to pronounce your surname she's from the Netherlands and she's been gardening for over 30 years and this book is all about her experiences around learning how to grow plenty of food well what'd she say here herbs flowers and veggies in any space and it's very much focused on a permaculture approach it's it's very much organic it's no dig which is becoming people are becoming a bit more aware of how to do no date particularly Charles darlings books and and she quotes him one of the people that inspired her and his lovely work it's full of color it's always easy to skim these things from the back to the front both of the books I'm going to mention have a guide to the months of the year and what you can do at different months so if you're starting now which is May as I'm doing this video you can just go straight to May and see okay what kind of things are we doing what do we need to do in May and some of us are perhaps more experienced gardeners and think of these two books this book certainly pitched at perhaps somebody has a bit more experience but it doesn't assume that you know how to do things do everything so it's it's a lovely book regardless of whether you have a lot of experience of not because there's something in here for everybody and I was certainly enjoying reading this book she has quite a lot about polycultures so polycultures are how we put plants together in what we call in permaculture guilds so a guild is a collection of species but in this case we're talking plants primarily which are placed together deliberately in order to create mutual benefit and beneficial relationships so for a fruit tree we might place around that fruit tree in its proximity plants that may be providing nitrogen fixation or attracting pollinators or accumulating particular minerals of values that plants or attracting pest predators that might prey on the plant and so on and we put these deliberate collections of species plants primarily together because it could include birds a bird could be a pest predator that might be attracted to maybe eating the bugs in the fallen fruit which stop that cycle of those bugs impacting the fruit next year and she starts off by looking at what you can do in containers in the garden back to this how do I show this and put into the camera at the same time but you can see it's full of beautiful photographs both of these books full of lots of lovely photographs her favorite flowers to eat how you might put things together so she looks at polycultures from the perspective of different levels we might cause of structural diversity in this space so how she might do that with a container for instance and Hoegaarden her in her husband's garden with the children and what they do through the year and slobby features of those other gardens throughout the year the different things she does different varieties of plants that she recommends it's a really lovely book she has a blog well I say a blog yes there is a blog and the YouTube channel which is I'm a bit more familiar with which is in Dutch and there's an English one an english-language one as well which is really good and yes I just highly recommend this book it's really nice particularly the focus on how do you put plants together in order to create beneficial polycultures that's really nice lots of lovely photographs so she's been growing since she was 12 this chap Hugh Hugh Richards he's being he's had a YouTube channel since he was 12 and has been gardening with his parents in he was 3 so he's just turned 20 I believe and he's already written his first book it's amazing and it was very lucky to meet you he came when a permaculture design course with us last year and his book has come out subsequent to this and he's an amazing it's a young man most people eat young by my standards these days and not only has he written this book he's also got this YouTube channel now which has had over he's got over a hundred thousand subscribers it's called Hughes nursery well worth checking out and he's really focused on helping people to learn how to grow food for themselves and of course as permaculturist s-- one of the key things we can do in order to improve and reduce our impact on the world is to grow some of our own food and whose mission really is about making that really easy for people now he's but there's lots of books about gardening around so Hughes focus on the book the idea for the book is how do you grow lots of different vegetables in about 19 different vegetables in one place so it's kind of looking at a poly culture is it's kind of not quite crop rotation but he takes that into account we looks at how you could create a three meter by 1.2 meter or 10 foot by 4 foot bed and grow lots of different vegetables and once we get past the beginning part which just looks at how to make compost and make your raised bed pretty kind of simple stuff he gets into whoops yeah the the plans the year plans and so each of these raised beds is divided into ten rows along the bed and he takes you through what to plant at each row throughout the whole year and that's the basis of the book so how to grow the different plants or hints and tips that he has for that and each each month has its own section so we can may so each time you're looking at what's in the bed what should be in the bed he's telling you how to grow things and what to raise when and when you plant them out and someone who so forth and the whole book is the book is mostly focused around all of that and then towards the end once you got to the end of your first year you then gives you some ideas for future years so in particular situations so cool climate flaunting low rainfall planting a salad bed and so on and this one is all about if you don't have much time you want to make it really easy and then they talks a little bit about rotation and so on but I'd say of course what's in this book is not new but the way he's put it together for me I've not seen that before and I think it's a really nice way of supporting people and this is very much for people who are beginners and even those of us who are not quite so beginners who like to think about how we might teach other people to do things in such a small space because really what he's demonstrating is how much food you can grow in such a small space so two great books for the spring to people very much authors worth supporting check out their channels and enjoy your summer of gardening",
