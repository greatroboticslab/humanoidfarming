  "text": "good morning guys welcome back to the farm in today's video we're going to be up potting some of these beautiful cherry tomatoes well snacking Tomatoes I call them snacking Tomatoes anyway we're going to be up potting some of these cherry tomatoes and I'm going to give you three tips that's going to make your Tomatoes double in size in less than a week just stick around [Music] you welcome back guys the variety that we're working with today is called Mountain magic and I call them snacking Tomatoes simply because they are actually bigger than your average uh cherry tomato now we grow Sun Golds we grow uh super sweet 100s and we grow black cherry um cherry tomatoes here on our farm and we grow a mountain magic now this tomato here will get almost the size of a golf ball it's smaller than your regular slicing tomato but it's bigger than your average cherry tomato and this variety is very popular at the markets that we attend and we tried to grow this several um secession plants throughout the year to make sure we got it on hand throughout all of our markets and these Tomatoes just like every tomato that we grow we start them in smaller trays so we can start more of them number wise and then we up poot them to a bigger container um so they can actually get a better root base before we put them in the ground and they no really script on how we start our Tomatoes it just depends on what trades we've got on hand at the time this is a 50 Cale flat and this is basically a strawberry flat it's all it is and we started these guys in this because I had 100 seeds and that equal two trays now we do start a lot of our seeds in 512s and you can see this we have to be real careful with this tray here because it'll dry out really fast if you're not careful and the they will get root bound also if you're not careful so you have to pay real close attention to these guys and you know up poot them when you think that they are ready but yeah these guys here are about a week away from needing to be up potted some of them have their true leaves on them but a lot of them are still in the calan stage and you can see there a lot of tomatoes in there I think I got five or six of these trays that I've got to up poot here in the next week or two so I'm going to go through and I'm going to show you the process that I use to up poot all of our Tomatoes not just cherries determinates indeterminates heirlooms all of our tomatoes are up potted the same way and we generally up poot all of our tomatoes is now to get away from having the up pot you need to start it in a bigger container and we don't simply for the reason that we don't have the room to do that we don't have the room to store a lot of these um at one time like I said in any given time there's 3 or 4,000 tomato plants sitting around here all the time there's 3,000 in my germination chamber and there's another 2,000 down here at the back of this High tunnel sitting on the ground so we don't have a lot of room to do that so that's why we start them in smaller trays so that brings me to tip number one give yourself plenty of room to grow your transplants out if you can't get around to putting them in the ground at the time that you think you will then they need to be able to stay in whatever you're up potting them in now I like to use these glue cups because they're cheap one and two that I can reuse them every year simply just wash them out stack them up and put them on the shelf and next year I can do the same thing now this works for Peppers this works for a plant this works for just about everything that you want to upot there's no real I mean I get to use these or I've got a lot of these trays here these little 2-in cups sitting around and you know just something to hold soil more than what is sitting in now that's really all you're looking for so the whole purpose of this video is to show you how we up poot these small tomato plants and you can see I've got one that I pulled up these these small tomato plants that look like this that were grown in these trays and make them look like this that was grown in the same tray it just hadn't been up potted yet and you know we could leave these guys in here and they would get to this size here and we could transplant them straight out into the Gard but that's not you generally how we do things these guys here are going in this High tunnel and we will be transplanting these out here really soon probably here in the next two two or 3 days but these guys will have to actually sit out for a while before we can put them in the other high tunnel that we're working on now so tip number one give yourself enough room to have a cushion in order that you don't get in a bind and have to up poot them again give them enough room that they can grow in here and these plants they'll get that tall inside of this container here a foot or more and you know you'll still be in good shape because you got a lot more soil in here and you can actually fertilize these guys while they're in this cup all right so the second tip I'm going to give you is that we are going to use the same growing medium that we started Ed these tomatoes in this is the same soil it's sterile there's no amendments or anything whatsoever in this soil we're actually going to take two scoops of this and we're going to put in a 5 gallon bucket and there's no real accurate measurement to this but I take two of those Scoops and you can see and I take a 4 oz scoop of garden tone and you guys know I swear by Garden tone and if you don't know what Garden tone is I'll put a picture of it over here so you can see it you can get it track Supply you get at Lowe's you get at Walmart sometimes but I'm going to take a 4 o scoop a level scoop and I'm going to put in that bucket with those two scoops of soil and then I'm going to just take my hands I'm going to work that in and mix it up really good and what this is is our pre-plant fertilizer and if you followed our Channel enough you know that I preached that you need to put down pre-plant fertilizer when you can for plants that are heavy feeders like tomatoes like cabbage like cyers all these good vegetables they need a pre- plant fertilizer something that is not already available in your garden give these guys what they need to get a good start so now we have our mended our up poot mixture which is the same mixture it was started in it set for it didn't have any mims in it our seed starting uh media is sterile guys we don't use any kind of mimt any kind of fertilizer in our seed starting media and be careful what you're hearing out there different videos I'm hearing a lot of guys that's telling people to actually Mi fertilizer in their seed start media and you need to be careful with that you know there's a lot of good Farmers out there there's a lot of guys that have some good content on YouTube but be careful what you're watching out there because there's a lot of stuff out there that can get you in a bind if you're not careful my advice to you is use a sterile seed starting mix and I use Black Gold I get M attractor Supply it's omry listed I mean it's organic um most Pete Moss is organic but basically it is sterile and this is what it looks like made by Sun gold that's it that's what I use and you can see it's arm listed so it's organic we can use it here on our phone no amendments no fertilizers no nothing we put it in there each plant each seed has enough energy to get itself to its first set of true leaves period just naturally it can do that once it gets to this stage is when you need to give it something to feed on that's what we did in this bucket so the recap give your plant something big enough to get a good root base in and use a pre-plant fertilizer when you up poot them not at planting the seed when you up poot it and now we're going to talk about the last step which is to feed your plants once they're established now whenever you upot a tomato plant pepper plant whatever you're going to have some level of transplant shot that means that plant is just basically going to stall and it's going to establish itself get its roots going back in the you know into the soil trying to run out and find its place in there to basically get established before it starts growing again now um you know all plants do it some do it less than others it just depends on the conditions but once your plant is established and you can tell that it's out of that shock stage you can start feeding it with a either a balanced fertilizer or in our case in tomatoes we want to put on some folage and get the stocks of this plant a little thicker so once we plant it you don't see them just drooping over like this they come flimsy they look leggy we want plants that are rigid see I can wiggle this thing and see how rigid that plant is that's what I like I like tomato plants that have a backbone to them and to do that before you get blooms on your plant what you want to use is a higher nitrogen fertilizer and in our case since we do plant or fertilize organically we use a Chilean nitrate which is what is in this bag here it's a 152 it is omry listed it is organic you see right here but it is a natural form of nitrogen that your plant can utilize immediately it doesn't have to wait for the soil to break it down your plants can use this now and what we do is basically give our tomato plants a bath in this stuff we set it in those totes out there what I use is a a tablespoon and a half that scoop right there and five 5 gallons of water don't overdo it so once these plants are young like they are we take these things and we spoon feed them to get them to look like this so to start with we're going to take this plant and we're going to water it nothing in the water just water plain well water we're going to water this plant and let it get established once we can tell that this plant is actually trying it's trying to grow then that's when we're going to utilize the nitrogen the organic nitrogen that's when we're going to utilize this stuff here in our totes and bottom water these guys and these plants will explode they will literally double in size in a week I promise you all right guys so I got to get busy but check back in with us later this week we're going to be up potting these guys here all of the heirloom tomatoes that we started in trays a couple of weeks ago and if you missed that video I'll put a link to it up here and if you found anything useful anything entertaining or just plain old interested click this subscribe button over here in this right hand corner and as always guys we appreciate you stopping by thank you for your support and we'll see you in the next one",
