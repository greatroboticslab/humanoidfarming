  "text": "good afternoon colleagues good morning good evening to all of you wherever you are um I would like to welcome you to this webinar on resilient drylands innovating for sustainable agricultural landscape and livelihoods my name is y yasmi and I'm a special coordinator for the plan production and protection division at FAO it is really a great honor to see many of you joining this webinar and I'm pretty sure some will still join later on um so it's encouraging to see you know how uh the subject matters is relevant for for all of us colleagues I invite you also to introduce yourself in chat room maybe where you are from so that we know you know uh in term of where you know where you are and and so for so feel free to to write your name and you know your country where you are based so the drylands you know are very important topics for FAO and for all of us not only because of the significant contribution to agriculture but also for pecularities of the of the drylands and a lot in know pecularity of challenges that they are facing so today we are so pleased to have an opportunity to discuss this to share lesson learned to share best practices and also you know we look forward to get your feedback and views on how we can actually work on Dryland better in the future to address the issues of poverty food insecurity and malnutrition colleagues uh participants uh and and Este team uh panels without further Ado uh I would like to start this webinar by inviting uh Miss Beth Beall FAO deputy director General to give her welcoming remark Beth offer to you thanks very much Yi and to all of our distinguished guests uh to all of our colleagues Coles uh and um everyone who is with us here today uh obviously we are pulling from a very Global audience so I need to say good morning good afternoon and good evening uh to each of you depending upon your geographic location I do very much appreciate everyone's taking the time to join us today for I think this important discussion Yi has already indicated that uh drylands certainly have their own unique uh characteristics um and they are critical to achieving Global Food security and so drawing attention uh through today's webinar on how we innovate for sustainable agricultural Landscapes and liih hoods I think is an incredibly timely discussion I'm also really pleased to see some familiar and friendly faces here on the screen uh Jackie Hughes uh here uh with us again uh as our partner uh errat uh and FAO have worked on many things together over the years and with her role as director General we have very recently uh been able to take on a number of these important types of topics together but we are also joined by a number of other distinguished speakers uh from across many continents uh I'm looking forward to hearing from them uh hopefully meeting them in the future as well because I know they will enrich today's discussions uh each bringing their own perspectives and their unique knowledge I have I think many ways the easy job uh of setting the stage a little bit and then I get to listen uh it's not often that I get to sort of sit in the background and really soak in the information and the knowledge from so many of our partners but let me try uh to do just a little bit of of staging for today's uh webinar discussion we I think all appreciate that dry lands uh make up over 40% of the earth's land surface they are home to two billion people on the planet and also Supply about 60% of the world's food production making them a very unique type of ecosystem but one that is also characterized quite harshly by water scarcity and low precipitation but although these regions are dry they are not barren they are productive landscapes for plants and animals but they certain they certainly require our committed attention between climate variability unsustainable land use conflicts and demographic shifts we are seeing the continued degradation of these ecosystems and these are areas that are facing unprecedented challenges but at the same time hold enormous potential they are sources for abundant soil energy they do have a rich biodiversity within them and there are countless opportunities to enhance the productivity and the resilience of production systems focused on dry lands and I think this where today's discussion comes fully into play is where innovation has an opportunity to play a key role to tap into these opportunities and Innovation can be the accelerator for the needed change to scale up best practices um and ultimately to reach more of an impact but an impact at scale FAO has a long history of supporting sustainable Dryland agriculture around the world we have contributed to the great green wall initiative in Africa to restore the continent's degraded Landscapes we have supported farmer field schools in Asia to the drylands of meso America to restore degraded drylands working to increase crop productivity and ultimately enhance community and Landscape resilience across these continents and we also have initiatives such as the grazing with trees initiative it integrates forestry and agricultural practices to restore dry lands while increasing local resilience against disasters and climate hazards and alongside uh unep we are leading the UN decade of ecosystem restoration an important opportunity to draw all of our attention to protecting and Reviving ecosystems all around the world and I think it too being featured as a decade gives us an opportunity to build a stronger more broad-based Global movement in support of dry lands and other important ecosystems but we still have more to do and I think that's where a conversation and a discussion like the one we're having today is so important for our part uh here at FAO in just a few days in fact starting next Monday we will be meeting and convening in FAO headquarters the 29th session of the FAO committee on agriculture or for those of you well familiar with fao's nomenclature and acronyms we call it coag uh coag is one of four technical committees uh governing body process of FAO that provides guidance on agriculture related policies we view Global issues and Trends and we advise on emerging topics and I believe this will also be an opportunity to continue building on this discussion because in fact it was back in 2020 uh at the 27th session of coag where there was an endorsement by members of fao's global program on sustainable Dryland agriculture demonstrating that dry lands are indeed a priority so so I hope that with today's discussion and with the bringing together of many of our partners bringing together our members around these types of unique topics that we can find ways to best use innovation Technologies data and other sustainable practices to really Elevate and make the drylands ecosystems of the planet far more resilient than they are today so yuy with that I think I'll stop um I'll turn it back over to you and look forward very much to hearing from so many of our uh Partners who are here with us for the panel and for the discussion and um also hopefully some very rich feedback and engagement from those of us who are joining us online thanks again thank you very much Beth for your encouraging welcome remarks and also for outlining the importance of the you know of drylands some of our featured work on drylands and also you stress the importance of you know working together and bringing the subject back to the table because of the important roles uh for farmers and for the livelihood and also for food security so thank you so much Beth uh dear participants I see that we have hit uh 200 participants I still invite you to introduce yourself where you are from I can see that you know some say good evening from the Philippines from Indonesia India Yemen so many tury so please you know feel free to introduce yourself in the chat colleagues um we will set up the stage for this discussion uh by a message from a director of land and water division of FAO Mr Lee Fang Lee who is unfortunately du due to other commitment cannot be with us uh but he has recorded his messages for us so heo could you kindly play the message from director Lee thank you dear deputy director General um backto distinguished guests dear colleagues ladies and gentlemen I'm very pleased to share a few Point contributing contributing to the discussion on resilient dry land at this seminar you may recall that I report the status of land and water resources for food and agriculture 2021 concluded that pressures on land and water resources are pushing the ecosystems to their productive limit compromising agriculture production and intensifying poverty and Mal nutrition in all regions especially in the fragile Dryland areas over 95% of food is produced on land and begins with soils and water we need to work together to produce more with less and safe guard these resources for the future desertification land degradation and short have increasing impacts on food security and the livelihoods of mils negatively affect food production water and soil resources and increasing carbon emission and vulnerability to climate change estimates indicate that humid induced land degradation affect at least 1.6 billion hectares worldwide impacting directly on 3.2 billion people more than 60% of the human induced land degradation is indeed taking place on agriculture lands put the Agri Food Systems under unprecedented pressure D is one of the most destructive natural disasters severe Dr inance and becoming more frequent and affecting food security especially in the dry areas and in countries with reduced capacity to absorb the shocks by 2050 draws may affect an estimated 34 of the world population it is a global issue together we need to urgently shift the draw management Paradigm Paradigm from reactive to proactive approaches to increase dra risk preparedness strengthen adaptation capacity and move away from emergency actions the frequency and intensity of sand and dark systems especially in arid and semiarid regions have increased over recent decades due to the land use land cover changes and climate factors with many regions projected to experience increasing arid aridity and D frequency in due to climate change sand and dark storms have major transboundary impact on environment CL climate Health livelihood Agriculture and food security and the social economic well-being of the site healthy soils are essential for sustainable and resilient AGR Food Systems as they provide safe and nutritious food regulate both water and carbon cycles and support over and support about 60% of biodiversity on this planet long and short-term development and investment decisions addressing the restoration of degradated lands require integrated strategy that must consider soil organic carbon stocks soil Rec carbonization strategies can be a game changer towards towards achieving land degradation neutrality objectives land Tous security is necessary to encourage people to invest sustainably in their land to fight desertification land degradation and drought and it's crucial to achieve land degradation neutrality supporting countries in dry areas to increase their resilience of livelihood and to reduce the impacts on vulnerable communities is at the heart of fa's mandate sustainable land water use and management is key to maintain and sustain food production and has to be at the heart of any Agri food system transformation integrated land use planning responsible land governance and land Tous security and Dr resilience are of fundamental importance for achieving food security SEC especially on the dry in the dry areas the restoration of degradated agriculture land needs urgent urgent political leadership massive investment and concerted actions on the ground I feel will continue work with the countries and partners to combat desertification and drought to achieve food security and nutrition with that I thank you very much for your attention and I wish you a very prod Ive discussion thank you very much Le Fang for setting the stage and context of our discussion today I will move on uh to the next speaker uh Miss Jackie Hughes the director general of rrad Jackie will share research and development perspective with the title critical development and opportunity for Dryland agriculture jaie over to you thank you very much Yodi and good evening good afternoon and good morning ddg Beth and the many colleagues and friends who have joined us on this webinar I'm going to be talking about where the dry lands are the main issues the latest developments and opportunities for the future which is absolutely critical next the drylands yes thank you the drylands as Beth said cover 40% of the Earth's surface land surface but the frightening fact is that it's 66% of Africa 40% of Asia and 24% of Europe are covered with dry lands whether they are arid or semi arid next although it is extremely dry and it's very difficult to get sufficient water you will see the agricultural success happens we have rainfed we have Highlands lowlands irrigated but agricultural success is predicated around the successful management of water resources to achieve sustainable livestock crop livestock or crop crop system next they looking at all these issues um productivity we have heat and drought we have soil degradation we need inputs we need fod and feed there are pests and diseases we need pollinators and an exceptional drought can cause huge yield losses I mean a truly exceptional drought 100% loss but an exceptional drought will give you about 70% loss of soybean maze wheat rice and as we heard just now the dry lands are degraded and over a billion people in more than a 100 countries are at risk climate change and climatic events we're all seeing them and we've got increased warming we also have cooling the rainfall climatic events changes in atmospheric CO2 and climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from 2030 to 2050 we must either mitigate or adapt looking at markets Market linkages in some of our arried areas are poor we have asymmetrical access to information we need digital tools globalization transportation in Colombia SMS weather Information Services reduce crop losses by 11 to 14% every incremental increase in production and harvest is important we have Labor and civil unrest we've got aging farming communities agriculture isn't a preferred occupation anymore prohibitive labor cost gender related labor issues civil unrest and in my point of view the first real climate change conflict took place in the Sahel in 2003 when the war in darur exposed how the convergence of environmental and political factors can lead to conflict policies got to be adapted to local needs and when adopted they need to facilitate resilience and productivity must be fit for purpose and you've got to manage tradeoffs capacity development has to be properly determined correctly implemented and you have to address the needs of the different segments of communities the farmers the production systems because communities with lower levels of adaptive capacity experience higher climate imp climate impacts due to their reduced ability to cope with climate change next there have been developments it's not all a bad set of stories here but the landscape approach we need to be holistic looking at watersheds perhaps we've got to have drought heat tolerant varieties that will survive and yield we've had a greater Focus on the dry lands think thanks to the international year of millets and then the G20 in India but we have to continue that was just the beginning we need the crops to be nutritious biofortified crops exist sometimes there's enough food but it's not good nutrition we're harvesting water is the dry lands and More than 70% of the area of the Indian semary Tropics has high to medium potential for implementing rainwater harvesting but we don't always do it for our soil we've been putting in a lot of inputs but not in the dry lands and one siiz solution such as regenerative agriculture it doesn't fit all glass houses and hydroponics are a possibility for the high value crops which can be grown in dry lands um you see them growing in the deserts of Saudi Arabia so on protected cultivation but high value crops next We Now understand better physiology and productivity we know about root architecture for example and canopy structure we know that if we get increased light penetration to lower canopy we can increase yields by up to 177% in some crops we've got to minimize risk to Farmers by diversifying we need to use digital tag but the information has to be not only available it has to be transparent and when we use machine learning we have to make sure that what is produced by us is correct usable fit for purpose we need to facilitate breeding whether it's um through genomics or other molecular tools we know how to do it but the policies and the regulatory EnV environment is not always supportive speed breeding Works conventional breeding six Generations a year for some crops now so that helps and we know we need Partnerships but we need better Partnerships stronger sustainable Partnerships next because I put it to you even however hard we try are we going to be able to meet the goals that we have set ourselves and the figures that we're seeing it's not looking good particularly for the dry lands next there are opportunities though this is the great part um one of the things we need though is increased funding that is critical for research agriculture doesn't get enough funding to start with compared to example medicine but we need more for the dry lands I'll come on to the health and nutrition aspect but for soils we'll hear more about soils but Farmers always overestimate the sizes of their Farms they've been putting too much on their Farms when they could afford or even find the input let's make sure that we target the recommendations very carefully um the diagnostic tools that we have for targeted advisories we we can do things like traceability um using machine learning we can add valued products uh capacity development it needs to be done not nationally but globally Continental Regional because if you're limited by a country or a specific group of people the interactions aren't there and you don't get the full benefit of the capacity development if we look at digital egg there are so many opportunities whether you're using satellites drones or any other type of Technology but it's got to be available to everyone and the information has to be true next I was talking about the holistic approach to health nutrient-rich food we're looking at soil microbi biomes we're looking at plant microbiomes gut microbiomes the interactions and synergies using big data we can use Ai and we need to understand the relationships between them that lead to Good Health when we have bio fortified crops which I was talking about earlier make sure that the nutrients are bioavailable they are not always we need to know how to prepare the food um make sure that even when we breed the plants it will be a bio available nutrient we need dietary diversity it's a very simple thing have diversity on your plate we've been talking about it for years it's not happening how do we do it and however much we do for one Health we need also to minimize chronic infections that prevent uptake of nutrients we don't do it all together we do it bit by bit we need to pull it all together if we could go on to the next slide please I'm talking about Gene editing on this this slide it's becoming more popular in some countries for example India there's a simple regulatory environment for Gene edited crops not transgenic crops and for intractable problems Gene editing can solve rancidity in PE millet flour might solve a toxins and if countries still cannot accept Gene edited plants because somebody might think it's scary at least then we will know exactly what we're looking for in gene banks in the diversity of our crops to use conventional breeding so don't write off Gene editing if you think the regulatory environment won't permit it it's an amazing tool and we need to use it quickly next other opportunities include crop management big advances in productivity are needed and we need to get our options right we need to have the management options absolutely spot on I'll talk about adaptation PES and diseases are really um taking off with climate change we can use remote sensing apps to identify and TR track and control but it needs to be done on a holistic level just controlling one field is not good enough you've got to control a landscape to stop the spread of pests and diseases we can help uh increase availability of nitrogen in the soil using biological nitrification inhibition again technology driven but it would help we can and um Advocate the use of new technologies Gene editing for example but scientists are not the ones to do that advocacy very well we don't do it well we need others to help support us and some of these crops used for the dry lands have industrial uses yes we want food we want nutrition but money is also important so let's not forget that and I believe we should foster entrepreneurship opportun unities that's a way of getting the youth back in um and we can scale and deliver impact which is what we're all about next I mentioned crop adaptation and selection I put it to you all that we can no longer breed crops for today we have to breed crops for maybe 10 to 15 years ahead why are we forcing crops which love a semi- temperate climate why are we trying to breed them forcefully to the drylands the drylands are expanding as the we reach the edges why not put in crops that are adapted why give ourselves such a huge headache trying to adapt crops that don't like those environments our crops need to be tolerant of climatic events abiotic stresses and broad-based resistance to PES and diseases but we have to get it all together one plant not a separate trait next and please can we work at a landscape approach we need Watershed level approaches we need to manage water water is owned it's used for irrigation Fisheries for drinking and it's a cause of conflict we need to have the cereals the legumes the horiculture the trees diversify the cropping system we have the tools we need data is plentiful it's available and there are many opportunities we need effective policies to though to be able to implement them I've given you a whole mish mash of all the things that are wrong and all the ways that we could work together but we have to work at scale individual Farms won't fix the problem it has to be on across scale so I hope it's given you a taste and I'm looking forward to hearing if anybody has the solutions that we can take further thank you very much everyone jaie thank you very much for this succinct but comprehensive presentation from you a very well received and I think very critical many of what you said are very relevant if not all uh and thanks you know Jackie for really bring this important issues new developments opportunities yes we have challenges but as you said we need to work at scale and at landscape level thank you Jackie uh colleagues for those of who you who have just joined you can start now asking question in the Q&A chat um we will continue to the next presenters our own uh makiko taguchi will be sharing uh our work on Dryland from fa perspective makiko off to [Music] you thank you very much Yi hello everyone my name is makiko taguchi I'm an agricultural officer with the plant production and protection Division I hope you're seeing my slide okay perfectly yes great so I have the honor to to share briefly about what our division plant production protection division is doing in the drylands alongside other partners okay so the first um program that I want to mention is the Dryland sustainable Landscapes uh initiative uh IMPACT Program which uh I think flows nicely after what Jackie just mentioned that we really need to work at the landscape level so this IMPACT program is funded by the Global Environmental facility and led by FAO and has started in 2021 and until 2026 let's see so the program is working uh in various forms supporting 11 countries in Africa and Central Asia one of the ways is through this sustainable landscape production framework which addresses common management challenges and drylands through an integrated multi sectoral approach and then breaking silos for greater impact by shifting from fragmented interventions to a cohesive model through farmer field schools and a improving access to seeds through community seed banks and um business incubation through forest and farm facility the other element is the integrated landscape assessment methodology as Jackie just mentioned data is available so through this uh methodology we bring together data from geospatial information systems such as Google Earth and down to household level data so that uh tailored uh evidence-based interventions can be made and these are are shared and Lessons Learned are are shared through a regional um exchange mechanisms and also uh through these community of practices that are set up who are dealing with the data but also with the production framework and this is all supported not only by our division but of course with the Land and Water Division that Mr Lee shared and also uh the forestry division going a little bit deeper into the community seed bank element that our seeds and genetic resources team is supporting this element is supporting six countries from the sadak region in focusing on the miombo and the mopan Woodlands area in subsaharan Africa so this uh community seed banks are set up to help mitigate the negative effects of land degradation and to help a regional approach through the regional uh exchange mechanism like I mentioned and then creating a s a sustainable and scalable action through the coordination with the sadak plant genetic resources Center and it is also supported by uh International platforms such as the inter in international Treaty of plant genetic resources which is also hosted by FAO and this work is really focusing on diversification that Jackie had just mentioned it's all it's about availability of quality seed through the Community Banks uh seed banks making uh available the well adapted crops and varieties that some of them might be traditional but because of of lack of of Investments they may have kind of disappeared from the cultures helping uh Farmers to diversify cropping systems and overall to improve productivity and to have a diverse and balanced diet and help helping Farmers participate in new value chains so in in that Community Seedbank initiative also supported the International year of millets that we celebrated last year that Jackie also mentioned uh millets is a one of the or group of crops that are are suited for Dryland environments so throughout the year we have celebrated not only just these 15 types of millets uh but um various millets even Beyond these to really focus on the the the traditions and the cultures and the Cuisines that have supported communities all around the world and I am happy to inform you that the final report has just been published today so you can visit the final report of the international year of millets in the link that is provided in the chat and in the slide that you see I would also like to bring attention to an FAO Carta International technical cooporation Network on Cactus that I've been working on for the last decade this community is working on on really bringing together research and development in Cactus it's a crop Duna species is the main species but not only that this group focuses on originates in Mexico but now it's grown in in all over the world in the Dryland areas we currently have n over 900 members in 79 countries and the the really uh interesting thing about this crop is that it's or groups of crops is that they're very resilient of course they're Cactus they they Thrive well in Dryland areas and they are versatile they are good for human consumption as the fruits or the pads of salads or vegetables and as for fod it's it's an increasing crop that is um recognized as a good source of fod and it is also a good source of bioenergy is G gaining a lot of interest around around the world and next year we'll be working with our partners zarta and others to support the international Congress on cacti as food fod and other uses in uh Spain so please uh let me know if you are interested in this work as well and on top of this I would also like to mention that we have been working in support of the US state department and the African Union on the vision for adaptive crops and soils are or know known as V for some of you and this is an an initiative that brings attention to indigenous and traditional crops that we some of them we have just mentioned Jackie and I that are more adapted uh to the local environmental conditions and nutritious that can be more nutritious than other major staple crops that are grown in in the countries and they have they are tend to be more climate uh resilient and also um better adapt to land degradation so as Jackie just mentioned it is important that these uh um neglected and underutilized species um get the attention they need for research and development as well as policy and investment attention thank you very much for your attention thank you very much makiko uh I can see the a lot of convergence between what you presented and that of Jackies it's good you know to see how you know um uh we are working you know at Country level at landscape level to promote uh to promote the dry lands um so for sure you know uh as jaie said and also B said you know we need to be working together on this you know I already see you know from these two presentation how important it it is for us to compare notes and to move together uh to support Dryland agriculture uh thank you again makiko now I would like to move on to our next presenters who will present managing soil health and plan nutrition in Dryland ecosystem in subsaharan Africa it is my honor to invite uh Sami zingore the director of research at African PL nutrition Institute Sami over to you Samy are you with us yes thank you very much uh can you see my presentation yes we can see it but maybe you need to put it in presentation mode now it's good it's okay now go ahead oh excellent uh thank you very much um for the introduction and um greetings to colleagues and partners joining us uh from um different parts of uh the world it's a great pleasure for me to be be part of this uh very important and um timely discussion on sustainable management of U uh livelihoods and landscapes in the drylands and I'm going to focus uh my presentation today on issues related to the intricate connection between soil health and pl nutrition with the primary focus in uh subsaharan Africa uh I wanted to start by illustrating the core um intricate uh relationship between nutrient management and some of the environmental and um social and economic uh sustainability challenges that uh we encounter in the region at the Apex of uh the challenges for agricultural sustainability in uh Subs Africa is the law and inappropriate nutrient application um southern Africa currently has the lowest use of both organic and um mineral fertilizers resulting in um a soil Health crisis that is associated with nutrient mining with currently more than 30 cages of nutrients being lost from agricultural lands on the continent and there's also the um parallel um challenges associated with overgrazing that also deplete uh the overall and nutrients in the system over the long term this Cascades into um land degradation uh which at this point 65% of the crop land in the African vland is actually uh considered to be degraded uh resulting in major um you know challenges and high risk for non-responsive source that don't respond to management and um this then is associated with a whole host of other environmental uh challenges including um High emissions of carbon from and and biodiversity losses mostly through area expansion uh especially into vulnerable drylands uh that then trigger a lot of uh climate um you know change and exacerbate the effect of climate change as well and this then is uh expressed in the major food uh and nutritional and livelihood challenges that we find on the continent so what I'm going to to address today is to highlight the importance then of building soil health and systems resilience with a key focus on addressing the core issue of plant nutrition and um focusing on integrated so fertility crop and water management and then ensuring that this is done to address climate change and then also address uh the cor specific Technologies due to the diversity of the um system that we are working in in um the um different parts of the continent but we also need to pay attention to the economic viability of uh the solutions because in large Parts uh a lot of technologies that work uh um you know from a technical perspective are not always providing the right solutions that uh meet the socioeconomic uh requirements of small holder Farmers I wanted to um provide an illustration here of um studies that we've carried out in the drylands in eastn southern Africa looking at the impact of low input systems on so carbon and so carbon is used as a good indicator of so Health due to its multiple functions uh for um biological physical and uh chemical so properties in a large part of the systems under small holder low input system so organic met decline finds very rapidly in the initial years of cultivation reaching um in about 10 years to less than 50% of the initial sologic carbon uh stored in uh Native um Woodlands or grasslands and what is very striking is that uh a large part of the carbon losses which is also associated with land degradation occur in the initial years of cultivation and resulting in very low crop productivity with yields only in the range of 1 to 2 tons per hect and land degradation results in cells that respond very poorly to management and this is a key challenge was in large parts of the world soil health issues are related to intensification and overuse of uh um pesticides and and and fertilizers it's a compressing situation large parts of the sou Africa where large part of the land degradation is driven by low use of nutrient inputs but what we also found interesting is uh by investing in um n Plant Nutrition uh by uh investing in Balance fertilization with uh managing prop procedures to improve sologic carbon um in commercial farming systems uh we observe that we could actually double the Sol organic carbon in the long term term and maintain much higher yields highlighting the core value of Plant Nutrition in improving so health and also contributing to sustainable Crop Production as well then I just wanted to then illustrate um some of the um processes of land degradation and how they relate to crop response and plant nutrition um the degradation rest and restoration trajectories associated with crop productivity happen in a sequential process uh in large parts of the systems uh early part of the degradation is associated with nutrient losses and under such conditions in the a Zone we can actually improve crop productivity by focusing on PL nutrition as a key component of increasing cor productivity and by investing in Plant Nutrition we also produce the biomass that is needed to maintain I organic matter and soil Health but as de addition advances and you you have a chemical and biological degradation taking place then the um responsiveness of the cells are diminished and the rate of restoration is also diminished and in those systems a greater focus on Integrated Solutions becomes pertinent but under Advanced uh degradation conditions a way I want to highlight in the zone C uh this is where degradation is very severe and nutrition itself does not Sol solve the challenge because SS become low responsive to nutrient applications and under those conditions Soul Health Restoration becomes in the key entry point and this is where a large part of the efforts in regenerative agriculture and some of the nature based solutions that are needed first to rebuild soil Health before the source can respond to nutrient applications becomes the key entry point for reversing productivity then I just wanted to uh End by highlighting that we have been working in these conceptual Frameworks uh addressing the critical need of Plant Nutrition both in terms of mineral fertilizers and Organics to support the Continental Agricultural Development agenda and we are proud as a pni to have contributed in a leading role in the development of Africa Union um fertiliz and soul Health action plan which was endorsed by the African government at The Summit in Nairobi this year this creates uh the priorities and set the priorities of the continent for sustainable soil Health uh and uh plan nutrition and crop productivity for the next decade it's a 10-year action plan and the action plan focuses on harnessing multi-stake order Partnerships and Investments for sustainable fertilizer and soul Health Management and four key intervention areas are covered in that action plan which um will direct uh Innovation and Investments uh through multiple Partnerships in addressing the challenges of so Health in the continent a large part of what I talked about today is in outcome three greater efficiency resilience and sustainable use of mineral and organic fertilizer inputs but this is done in the uh enabling environment of impr improved policies Investments finances and markets to ensure that access to the right Technologies is enabled and then also improved access and affordability of the organic and mineral fertilizers which overcomes one big barrier of access and affordability and then also we need to also pay attention to the institutional and human capacity uh development uh needs to be able to drive the Innovation and promote the scaling and um the um ad adoption of the uh blood nutrition strategies that are site specific crop specific but also fitting the social economic context of small orderer farmers I wanted to end this uh highlight of the Continental agenda and um we'll be pleased to further discuss uh some of the key specific Technologies um as we will have time for discussion later thank you very much thank you very much Shi for your very interesting presentations and I congratulate you for putting this together in view of time you know I will move on to the next presenter Mr tomoko harigaya Chief scientist Precision development uh who will talk about digital agricultural Innovations to Foster climate resilient small H system over to you tomoko thank you it's great to be here um and you know I very much appreciate the opportunity to share our learnings with all of you today um so as you know the spread of mobile phones and you know new technology and data present huge opportunity to disseminate and deliver customized information to small holder farmers in real time in a way that's really unprecedented um and today you know I like to bring in implementers perspective to the discussion and and share you know how we have approached to take advantage of these Technologies uh visal you know digital tools um and share some of our experience um in India next slide please um so I'll start with a quick introduction of precision development op pxd for those of you who aren't familiar with our work we are a nonprofit working with government and other partners to expand access to Innovations and informations that millions of farmers can use to improve their livelihoods and digital agricultur advisory has been a core part of our work um so we work flexibly with different partners depending on the needs in each context so sometimes we take on the implemental role um designing and delivering customized information directly to smolder Farmers but we also work with Partners to make data driven improvements to already existing digal services or in some other settings we take on the advisory role for the government you know trying to integrate digital Technologies into agriculture extension next slide please and over the years you know we've really focused on building customized Information Services for small water Farmers that are sustainable at a very large scale um and our general approach is to combine farmer specific information and available agricultural data in a given context um and then we create localized and dynamic information that enables Farmers to optimize their agricultural decisions um for instance you know you might have a farmal location profile um and and so forth from Farmers that you're working with and then you might have agriculture data you know in a specific context some some sometimes you know so so Health Data there might be meta forecasts market prices and so forth um you know usually you don't have all of this data in place at the start and this is something that you build out as you interact more with farmers and learn about the context available data uh next slide please and then one important element of of our work is really to kind of create this feedback loop that allows the service to iterate and improve over time and there are a few key elements to this uh first one is that we use behavior science and the human Center design approach to ensure that farmers we targeting find The Advisory messages relevant and actionable um especially with agricultural device or even things like weather forecasts messages can get quite Technical and hard to understand especially in short messages so this is something we pay a lot of attention to second we use experiments and other methods of data analysis to continuously tested design tweaks to increase engagement adoption and then third we set up every service with scaling partners of governments so that we can rapidly reach you know hundreds of thousands of farmers and keep the service free free to them and there's a sustainable path um and the scale of course you know also means that you gain kind of more data access and that allows you to learn faster and increase impact faster as well all right next slide please so now like how does all of this look like in action I'll take one example today uh from India work again so pxd is Flagship program which is called a microchip so this is a two two-way voice platform where Farmers receive customized agricultural device on their mobile phones as recorded messages and then they can also call in and record a question to get an answer from a government agronomist within you know 48 hours or you know two to three days um and in addition to agronomic advice you Farmers also receive realtime alerts uh on extreme weather event or you know local past conditions where the information was available the service was co-designed with the government of oresa and co-funded by the government and the Gates Foundation but the vision for sustainable model was very clear from the start among all stakeholders that pxd would you know first build and improve the service um and then you know that's again about Gathering farmer feedback tweaking messages or creating a dashboard and other tools to help the government monor usage over time right and then uh we transition the to the government fully after 5 years uh but this was all planned so when we handed over the service with nearly three million Farmers on the platform in 2022 we also handed over an operational team that was already familiar with the the flow and managing the service for a while and really I think the remarkable thing was you know the government was because about that planning and and kind of steps in place they were ready to take it and B with it after you know the transition they continue to expand the service and now it's reaching over six million Farmers covering think over 20 value chains now next slide please and then in the process of this scaling of the service we also Incorporated a randomized evaluation to measure the impact of the service among rice Farmers today I'm just touching on a few preliminary findings and insights um so first looking at the usage we saw a fairly high and consistent engagement over two years and then second we see a significant increase in total RTE production in particular a large impact appears to be concentrated among farmers in areas hit by certain types of weather shocks so for example in the first year of the evaluation there was this concentrated heavy rainfall that submerged plants in the middle of the season the analysis seems to suggest that access to amak crushi substantially increased total production among those farmers and then very excitingly we also see a large reduction in the reported likelihood of CIA crop loss due to weather related events and this figure you know comes from actually the second year where the the the big shock was actually the scarcity of rainfall so you know this this part of the the geography they get both too much rain and too little rain and we seem to to see that the you know generally the evaluation s suggest that ad visory was helpful in Pharm coping with these different types of weather shocks um three Insight that you know I just want to quickly highlight first is that these results seem to suggest that there's there is a very large amount need for climate information for for small farmers to to cope with these weather related events second we know that different farmers face different shocks and constraints across seasons and who benefit from the service and by how much will likely change from season to season so we might see a large impact in only a small subset of farmers in a particular year but that doesn't mean that the sh advisory won't be helpful for other farmers in a different year so so I think that kind of changes the way we think about maybe impact measurement and and and so forth and then lastly I think to enable Farmers to improve their climate resilience we see a big opportunity again with all this new tech Technologies and data to improve our capabilities to identify the most relevant localized climate risks um in real time next slide please now I'll wrap wrap up with just a few thoughts on the replicability of these types of digital agricultural advisory services so first um you know one challenge we faced is the difficulty of aligning donors and the government interest at the same time so for instance you know the government might Express enthusiasm um but it takes time to kind of identify finding opportunity um and and so forth so by then there may be changes in the government or the government may be busy with something else to kind of collaborate on a a proposal in a month um and and that you know I I think that we really find ourselves to to kind of find this big opportunities lost because of these challenges of aligning you know all the the stakeholders at the same time second once you do have an opportunity to set up a digital agricultural advisory service with the government it's really important to integrate the service into the existing government infrastructure um you know this can enhance collaboration Buy in and knowledge transfer which is absolutely necessary to make the service sustainable and then third systems Data Systems data processes that can create a feedback Lo a critical to maintaining the impact at scale as we scale and expand our Target farmer base we have to ensure that the content continues to be relevant for more diverse farmer needs and environments and this requires constant you know Farm feedback and interations and I think one way that we think about it is you know when we are setting up these feedback mechanisms we are reducing communication FRS between farmers and governments and scientists and in all the stat stakeholders and I think that's a really important piece um and then finally I think part of this creating an effective feedback system is about establishing a culture of experimentation and learning um I think the return to institutionalizing this type of feedback mechanisms and a culture of experimentation can generate very large sustainable impact of course we haven't really figured out how to do all of this uh and we are constantly learning and I'd love to hear from other panelists and the audience about you know their experience in scaling Innovations and services this smalla farmers thank you thank you very much uh makiko for your interesting presentation on you know how digital Innovation you know can play its role in in in our discussion very interesting and uh I I I congratulate you for this presentation and for keeping it within the time now I would like to move on to to our next presenter who will be talking about promoting enterpreneurship and Agri food Innovations in the Dryland is my honor to invite uh Mr tamy adoro managing partner shahel Consulting Agriculture and nutrition Tammy over to [Music] you thank you very much uh can you can you see my screen and hear me yes okay good uh good afternoon from Koo Nigeria um good evening good morning to you all um where you are um has introduced I head sah Consulting a consulting firm focused on transforming the food and agriculture landscape across Africa and I'll be speaking uh on promoting entrepreneurship and Agri food Innovations in drylands focusing on Africa uh just to quickly um you know mentioned that I mean it's a reminder that Africa is not really endowed for agult excellence and uh we know why um about 50 to 70% of the population is involved in agriculture uh 80% of the food produced been produced by by Farmers small scale producers and we have about 60% of the world arable land um but of course we know uh some of the issues we're facing with Dryland Agriculture and you know uh the significance of Dryland agriculture on how to make to ensure that uh we make drand agriculture uh more resilient more more sustainable um I want to speak today highlighting three uh ways to three critical ways uh to promote entrepreneurship and agre food Innovations uh in drylands the first would be focused on uh empowering smmes uh in agriculture to build resilience against shocks of climate uh the second will be scaling up private sector engagements with with more the farmers and they thought will be promoting Market Le initiatives um we uh we are currently uh implementing a program uh called the building resilience against climate climate and environmental shocks uh brace uh which basically is focused on uh intensive capacity development um to support AF African agult smmes uh to become aware of how the businesses are affected by climate change and you know enabling them to develop strategies to Mi mitigate them it's quite it's quite um um a very intensive program over 1,200 smmes across 30 countries in Africa have been trained and we're beginning to see increased uh business efficiency of these agre businesses at least about 30% of them are beginning to adopt clim smart agricultural practices um on the next slide I wanted to highlight um if some some of the um some of some some part of the data Diagnostics uh coming out of the training and really to say uh you can see how the knowledge of country level uh climate smart agriculture uh policies uh have increased to almost over 90% just uh from from the training activities as well as the knowledge of of climate smart ult approaches many of the participants actually didn't even know or were not aware of any uh climate smart agricultural practices pre predd trining and it's quite encouraging to see that and uh I can I can you know say that many of these train hagri smes are beginning to adopt uh various practices uh in their businesses uh in the drylands and just to before moving on on this slide to highlight that I think addressing climate shocks in drylands uh to start with increasing the knowledge of the key value chain actors very important uh businesses or or small scale producers um moving on the second I want to highlight here really is scaling private sector engagement with with small farmers and I think if we're going to promote entrepreneurship um you know promote Agri food Innovations in in drylands we need to encourage many of the private sector partners that are playing in that space um and there are quite a number of uh unique innovative business models that many private organizations have explored um explored you know ranging from uh informal engagement between entrepreneurs and smaller Farmers or intermediary uh where they sign foral you know contracts where we have former subcontracting of companies and and and aggregators farmer groups um you know to engage Farmers to to to to directly you know upake their produce all you know more centralized models or nucleus estate model where these companies are you know setting up farms and engaging Farmers there but the unique thing about these private sector engagement uh models is that uh many of the critical services that small scale producers require in Dryland uh come with these service provision models uh you know providing sustainable ecosystem for the farmers uh providing access to input Services training uh ensuring effective system providing mechanization support storage support and uh the the most important of all is know the fact that there is Market access and these models are are becoming more and more prominent on the continent especially in in drylands across sever Valley chains and I think one of the ways to encourage um you know Agri businesses um working in this in this space is to really support the scaling efforts uh in ensuring that many more value chains are reached and many more small scale producers are reached as well and of course more food is produced this U is something that I think is very important um the third uh initiative that I would highlight or way that I think we need that we we can explore to uh promote entrepreneurship and hry food Innovation is by promoting Market Le initiatives and there are several of them but I I want to highlight one called the advancing local Dair development in Nigeria program that is currently being led by sah Consulting uh robust uh comp comp complex program uh leveraging ecosystem uh model or methods to address the issues within the da U sector in Nigeria but not just addressing issues within the da sector ensuring that uh we are uh you know creating or building more entrepreneur capacity within rural communities um in both Dairy and nir communities uh so far the housing program has uh been able to form about form Farmers into about 2,600 67 s up groups uh you know formed into over 200 cooperatives now we have more than 11,000 women that are trained on different entrepreneur entrepreneurship uh you know business models ranging from know poetry go raring vegetable cultivation uh soap making petroleum jelly and you can see some of the numbers there how these women have been able to and through collaboration with uh private sector uh Dairy processors have been able to sell me qu over 2 million USD uh in the last uh three and a half years and uh within the program we've been able to also train more than 200 Community Based entrepreneurs uh who are providing various you degree of services um as artificial technicians V Community Based Animal hband Service Pro service providers these I think um you know has created a unique uh business part business pathway within communities and you know helping Farmers to to uh really you know increase income uh just to highlight uh what that is looking like in terms of income diversification for women we can see uh some two women groups here that I highlight um in both can and Adama Nigeria with income diversification training they beginning to really uh explore uh you know poltry businesses and we're beginning to see that these businesses are becoming sustainable because uh it's they've not just done it one off they continue to reinvest um you know their profit and plow plow back into uh actually doing more uh this for us believe a success story that um if we support these kind of initiatives uh we definitely can do more in dry lands the the other one is uh around uh nutrition uh education vegetable gardening and how uh training women uh and Men on the principles of diet diversity and supporting them to actually create Gardens have led to not just ensuring that they have food for their household but they also have uh vegetables to sell and they're making uh money at the community level it also just shows that uh if we scale several Market Le initiatives like this one uh we have uh likely going to be able to achieve a lot more uh in you know encouraging entrepreneurship in in drylands and and ensuring food uh availability um it's this is my last slide I I just want to end by uh specifically highlighting some very practical steps that I think we need to consider in addition to those three initiatives I think we need to support Agri food entrepreneurs to scale successful private sector Le initiatives I talk about some backward integration models uh between private sector and and and and Farmers uh service provision models as well um we need to leverage infrastructure to annest the Dryland some of the most important Dryland resources and I think I mean solar energy comes to mind uh uh I mean we can aness the power of solar energy in drylands to power Agriculture and power other sectors in Africa and I think that would definitely bring a lot more development to the into the drylands and I think we need to support the creation of um a Pan African policy platform for uh a coordinated voice on on how to develop drylands I think that's has become uh critical now more than ever before uh we need to empower entrepreneurs to build resilience against climate shocks um with the little we can achieve on brace I believe that with more uh education around climate and support I believe that many entrepreneurs would emerge from within the drylands and of course the the final the final one would be the creation of a knowledge sharing Hub I think data is extremely important and knowledge exchange information exchange is very critical for business decision making and uh you know evidence program design and implementation um I I will stop there and um I'll wait for the question and answer session thank you so much thank you very much uh tamy for sharing your uh experience on this and nice to see how this interpr entrepreneurship aspect entrepreneurship aspect in in in your work and in in in sub Sahara Africa in view of time uh I will move on to our final presenters um I would like to invite Marcela lus de ro uh who is uh from fa El Salvador she will be talking about climate building climate resilient landscape through local knowledge and innovation in Central America's dry Corridor Marcela over to you thank you very much JY and hello to all the audience that is joining us today h from all over the world my name is Marcel lemus and I am a specialist in resilient agriculture for the green climate fund project reima in F El Salvador and I'm very grateful H to share on behalf of the reima team our experience in building climate resilient Landscapes through sustainable agriculture measures so to start with our presentation I will talk a little bit about the dry Corridor in Central America which it covers 44% of Guatemala Honduras El Salvador in nicwa and as you can see we are located in El Salvador and the country is within the the region however the reima project is on 108 districts H which were selected through ER those territories having high and severe drought and communities within the dry Corridor are severely affected by climate change events ER mainly for long periods of drought followed by intense rains and also land degradation and we have talked also a another panelists have talked also about water scarcity in the region affecting crops animal production and human consumption unfortunately we still have un sustainable management practices in agricultural production which leads to an inadequate management of Natural Resources especially Soil and Water so under this context we have the upscaling climate resilient measures in the dry corridor agroecosystems of El Salvador better known as reima project which was formulated in 2018 and it is financed by the green climate fund and the Salvadoran the Salvadorian government and FES for a total of $27.6 million the project aims to H increase the resilience of the livelihoods of the population living in the dry Corridor to climate change and this is align with the objective of the Global program on sustainable Dryland agriculture which aims to empower small scale producers by building technical ER capacities to protect natural resources under a changing climate H the project has three main outputs the first one aims to improve the resilience of the livelihoods and production systems in Family Farms the second one h is more related with the restoration processes of critical areas such as water recharge zones riparian zones buffer zones of natural protected areas in order to increase the resilience of flows of environmental services at landscape levels and finally we have output number three which aims to improve the governance and information flow in support of sustainability and scaling up basically this output is is the foundation of the sustainability of outputs one and two but for today's presentation we will focus on output number one where we are applying an Innovative approach in terms of capacity building and Agricultural Extension methodology we are working with Farmers field schools but using a figure of a community promoter who is a leader farmer within their communities and they are selected under certain criteria we have technical staff facilitating these farmer field schools with these Community promoters after that H Community promoters replicate the knowledge with a group of farmers within their communities in average each Community promoters have um 35 farmers and that's why as you can see by 2024 we have achieved more than 40 6,000 Farmers already because I think that we all or mainly in in in the old countries we have a lack of Human Resources however we are creating capacities of these people H not just to building capacities but also to provide technical assistance within the farmers we have the participation of women Youth and Indigenous people and we have achieved already more than 41 ,000 hectares where farmers are applying at least two sustainable practices so which are the key implemented strategies that we are implementing to transform Dryland agriculture where first of all we have the traditional knowledge we have a validation of the sustainable practices with indigenous peoples and other key actors H and actually indigenous peoples were very happy that we were rescuing some of these practices as we will see they are not new and people stop doing them obviously for you the use of products or other technology that is not that are not environmentally friendly and but facilitates the work for them another important strategy is the governance and institutional strengthening and here we are working with uh local committees that are integrated by loal governments ngos a community based organization among another key actors and this is actually one of the things that have motivated producers to implement the practices as well because for example in some territories we have local governments supporting uh producers with additional inputs or technical assistance and at the same time local governments can comply with Environmental regulations within their territories for example with uh the not burning in the agricultural areas another important thing is technology and the use of digital tools Community promoters have compiled Baseline information of producers on the ground using Cobo collect tool and they also have been following up the implementation of the practices of their group of farmers use this H tool as I said the capacity building through the farmer field schools it's an Innovative approach within the project and we are leaving a human capital in the territories not only for this initiative but for some of the future initiatives um in the country and even when capacity building is very important we cannot forget about technical assistance and this has been also a key factor of success for the implementation of the practices because Farmers ER can have access to these service and they also are more motivated for the implementation of the sustainable measures so which are the sustainable agricultural practices as I may as I mentioned these are not new and we are working with no burning no tillage h stab management contourline planting live barriers infiltration ditches infiltration pits H death barriers the establishment of f bank with varieties tolerant to droughts and floods and the production of organic fertilizers the establishment of Agro forestry and Silo pasture systems the use of local varieties that are resistant resilient to the conditions of the dry Corridor and the implementation of drip irrigation systems in some areas where water is available and even when we are not working with the concept of keson wild systems all the activities we are promoting among the farmers ER include this important H element of a traditional knowledge H including also an integrated man management integr P management and the use of or of the biomass as a result of the pr of the trees ER to fertilize and and improve the soil and all these practices also we are using the exact tool H for the estimation of carbon sequestration and we already have a 590,000 tons of carbon dioxide equ equivalent capture H at this time at this stage of the project that H is the 70% of the goal we have and this is directly linked to the soil conservations soil futility and moisture retention that um impacts and improve the productivity and livelihoods of uh our people and I think that this is very key because ER some of our producers obviously they they are aware about the about taking care of the resources but they also are ER experiencing by themselves the benefits of implementing these practices in the cost reductions and the Improvement of yields so to sum up I just want to mention that it is very important as other panelists have mentioned as well to H focus on an integrated approach it is very important to rescue the local knowledge including Innovative Technologies processes capacity building h technical assistance in order to reach a a better and and sustainable dryland farming thank you very much thank you very much Marcela for sharing fao's experience let's let's say you know how f is in action in this dry Corridor uh I think it's very interesting and I also link it back to what makiko Beth and uh uh jaie said you know action at scale I think through green climate fund although you know there is a sizable amount of funding uh but to increase it skill it really you know require government commitment and and other stakeholder commitment to support the dry Corridor program in the region where you are working so thank you very much for that and Marcela colleagues now we have time a bit of time not much for answering questions that are not yet uh very you know answers that have been Q&A um in in in the chat and uh I can see that some of the uh uh panels me you know have have start answering these uh questions but not all of them but let me have a quick look on these um perhaps I can go to first to uh makiko um there is a question I think from uh Mr Alex Narco uh who is the FAO represent representative in Djibouti um he is asking about you know where to get the cuttings of cactus because jouti is also dry uh if you can attempt to that question quickly makiko over to you thank you very much Yi I I think I just as answered that question in the chat too but just quickly answering that um Cactus does exist already in the country so first and foremost way is to best make use of the the species that are available Thea species but uh the cactus net can also uh facilitate uh different uh uh genetic resources to be shared from uh G Banks and other um entities uh through appropriate means uh so please contact me for further information thank you thank you makiko and Alex this is an internal discussion that you will not you will need to follow up with makiko now we have this question from Sergio Torres what is the percentage of small holders that could have access to digital agriculture or given data that is understandable to all uh and not dependent on the international or government cooperation perhaps tomoko you can shed some light on this if you have uh you know any idea um I that's that's a you know very difficult question I think you know one is that like I think there are a lot of different you know stakeholders ERS and different digital an programs and you know they're working with it at different scales um you know in theory I think there are like I think there are different ways of reaching Farmers one is directly trying to reach Farmers through their mobile phones but I think there are a lot of programs that are also just leveraging you know availability of mobile mobile phones in the community so you can go through extension workers if you you know provide more real time information through extension workers you may be able to reach farmers who don't actually have a mobile phone access or or in remote areas um you know perhaps Agro dealers and there are other kind of leader farmers and other points of contact within communities that that you can Target in order to increase access to information indirectly as well um so I don't have a specific percent number that I can you know I can share but I think that the probably the the proportion is very very high at this point okay is there any uh uh panel members who want to add to that I think it also depends on the context you know and and condition in different countries right any any of you want to add to that I don't see any uh hand from the panels um I also uh see quite a few of other question um for example you know Derek makiko please how can we find you okay very interesting question so I leave it to you later makiko to explain to Derek uh where you are hiding in Rome okay um I see that okay uh Alejandro JZ the problem of Dryland is is that they are dry climate change will intensify this condition particularly in hot countries can you expand uh fo suggested strategy to overcome this huge challenge for instance in Middle East or meso America uh some comments on water energy Nexus in rural zones I think this is not only for FAO I think is also open to all panelists right so perhaps uh I use my power to perhap ask Jackie uh what is your perspective on this Jackie um how to you know to overcome this huge Challenge and especially taking into account water energy Nexus in the rural [Music] Zone thank you I was just thinking about water dry lands because there is water there is you can condense water in the desert in the mornings you can find groundw but what's happening is that when you get sudden rains like we're getting with climate change it runs off and we're not it's not going into the water table and so yes technically you're losing it and I think that again this is a huge Regional approach because you can't fix the dry lands by fixing one corner of it um Greening across the SEL with trees and other vegetation that's a good start because if we can get it green it will retain water so decent crops that are not wasting water are not a bad way to start as well can I pass it to someone else now Yodi yeah thank you jaie that is helpful um any other panel members want to contribute to that if not then uh I have a question also digital Agriculture and new business models have a lot of potential to promote more resilient Dryland systems um what are key bottlenecks to developing and scaling up successful model perhaps I I would like to ask tamy or tomoko to respond to that maybe start with tamy no thanks thanks very much Yodi I I would say maybe two things um the the first um bottleneck uh would be uh that you know many many of those business models are implemented by small and medium scale businesses um on the continent many of those businesses struggle a lot uh struggle for to access information struggle to you know understand the political Dynamics and how it affect the businesses you know struggle to access the right resources right so I I I think one of the things we need to do is to uh encourage um you know the the creation of you know communities that encourage these businesses to be able to come together work together and really support each other learn from each other and maybe that's just what they need to to be able to scale their you know um unique innovative business models and and I've seen that in practice with the work uh we're doing I'm also the executive chair at African food Change makers which is uh a you know uh a hub a community of entrepreneurs across the continent and I'm beginning to see um a lot of uh impacts on businesses that are within the Hub uh currently uh Hub house members are across more than 43 countries in Africa and you know it keeps growing every day and it shows that it's just one of those critical things that that is needed the other second uh point would be um every innovative business model no matter how Innovative it is also require Innovative financing and I think and I think we need to rethink you know the concept of financing for you know uh agricultural Innovations of business Innovations in Africa and ensure that uh those businesses have access to the right you know financing that is not expensive and that is you know competitive thank you tamy uh tomoko any addition from you briefly maybe just quickly kind of adding to Timmy's last point about financing model I think um one thing you know that that's difficult is you know when you're building a service for like a small scale p OT you know time bound pilot the things that you need to figure out to be successful there may not be the same as things questions that you need to figure out to create a you know long-term sustainable model at scale you know it's about technology needs the data security Quality Maintenance and of course importantly resourcing as well um so I think I think there a kind of bringing in how you know the vision of how the the service would really look like and what you need to figure out um from the beginning I think is something really important but but challenging because of the way lot of the funding is structured yeah thank you very much now uh last question and I hope the answer will be brief I would like to direct it to shami and Marcela uh for you to you know to answer what are some of the key Technologies and Innovation that you think have potential to truly impact Dryland ecosystems and Market systems in the coming years uh Marcela you may want to reflect you know from your you know GCF experience and and shami from your own experience in Africa maybe shami you can start first yes thank you very much um yeah I just want to speak from the context of addressing the key pertinent challenges from a technological perspective uh water carbon and nutrients and we need Integrated Solutions that help to conserve water and then ensure that we are adding sufficient and balanced nutrients and then as well as carbon so there's a whole uh range of technologies that need to be fit into specific context and um conservation agriculture is one technology that um has great potential because it addresses all the three um you know essential components but we have to pay more attention to water harvesting water conservation and then combine that with um nutrient inputs from uh organic resources and mineral fertilizers but more importantly also invest in the right um crops and uh plant species that are adapted to the poor swells and low rentfor situations as well and I want to highlight the role of legumes in the systems where they can add high quality biomass for improving nitrogen Supply that can actually add more nutrients through more sustainable processes thank you very much thank you shami Marcel yes I think that um it is very important to have technology in order to provide uh what for forecast for farmers in terms of uh decision making in know Salvador for example the big question every year is when should I plant yes but still we also need for example um technical recommendations about how to prepare during the dry season just to face any event that can come within the rainy season and sometimes farmer just and they harvest their crops and they forget about the plot H but in the meantime they can still H Implement a sustainable practices just to minimize the impacts and so I think that that's very important that's why I really ER was interested in in what tomoko share about the app they the already have we are still working on how to provide this information to FAS thank you thank you very much Marcela very useful um colleagues I know that there are many questions you know because drylands are so huge problems are so big opportunities are so big you know potential uh you know immens uh I don't think we can solve all the question at this webinar certainly from FAO part what I can say is that we will continue you know to use this platform uh you know to advance the discussion uh but because of time you know I really would like uh to end the webinar and it is my great honor to invite uh my colleagues uh uh Mr Abdul Hakim El the assistant director General and Regional representative for uh North uh Africa RNE who is here with us uh thank you very much hakeim for your time I know you are very busy and with that you know we give the closing uh to you over to you hakeim thank you Yi uh thank you very much and thank you to I see Beth beol here and all the colleagues uh um I'm really really grateful for for this opportunity what a great pleasure that we have here today it's indeed a very important webinar uh ladies and gentlemen distinguished guests uh as we come to the close of this uh enlightening seminar on resilient dry lands innovating for sustainable agriculture Landscapes and livelihoods I would like to express my deepest thanks gratitude to all our speakers for sharing their expertise and all to all participants for your active engagement throughout the day I think this is a very important subject and and I'm really grateful for everybody I represent the near East and North Africa region which is one of the driest region we'll hear more about it it has been a privilege to learn about the Innovative approaches that are being implemented in Dryland regions uh across the globe from Africa uh to Central America to everywhere else in the world each contributing to the creation of more resilient agriculture Landscapes and livelihoods indeed dry land does not mean westand does not mean Wasteland so the the urgency for ecosystem restoration is very evident with uh nearly three quarters of the regions rainfed cropland degraded and water scarcity projected to cause substantial uh economic loss by 2050 in the near e North Africa region alone one of the driest regions in the world we Face similar challenges including water scarcity drought desertification land use rather land misuse land use changes and degradation all of which are exagerated by the impact of climate change leading to significant economic losses amounting to about 9 billion dollar a year uh or up to about 7% of the national gdps of Our member countries these issues have serious ramifications on the food security livelihoods and overall well-being of the populations mainly living in dry lands yet these challenges are not insurable um the the inspiring solutions that we've discussed and heard today ranging from integrating traditional knowledge with Cutting Edge Technologies to enhancing soil health and promoting Agri food entrepreneurship prove that there are clear Pathways and hopes and opportunities to sustainable development in Dryland areas one key takeaways from this webinar is that resilience in dry lands must be multifaceted it cannot be single Direction it is not just about increasing productivity but also about preserving ecosystems fostering Innovation and building local capacities to adapt to shocks and stresses most importantly it is about empowering the farmers and communities who are at the heart of these very challenging landscapes sop pastoral strategies are particularly relevant to Dryland areas with forests woodlands and Mosaic of different land uses and tener ecosystems trees in Dryland forests and wooded areas provide essential ecosystems services including animal feed Timber fruits shap and regulation of soil and water cycles equally livestock production is considered a key activity for food security local knowledge enhanced by research and Innovation can create nature-based solutions that improve food security support livelihoods and restore Dryland ecosystems all while safeguarding ecosystem services and achieving land deg ration neutrality I would like to highlight here in particular the region from the near East the importance of the a Oasis regions most of the Oasis that we have are in the middle of the dry lands and the deserts and there are key initiatives of creating alliances on Oasis development that we'd like to focus on as we go in the future as one of the most fragile communities within dry lands as we conclude the seminar I urge each of you to take decisive actions these are there are several key action areas that I wish to highlight as a result of today's discussion notably as a development Community we must one invest in research and Innovation let us intensify our efforts to develop and scale up Technologies tailored to dry land conditions this includes not only agricultural Innovations but also digital solutions
