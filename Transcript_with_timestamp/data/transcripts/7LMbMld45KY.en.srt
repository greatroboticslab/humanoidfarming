00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,840
guys how we doing welcome to good works

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,160
tractors i'm asked all the time

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,879
why do i need a snow plow snow pusher or

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,000
anything else

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,599
i've already got a bucket on the front

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,240
of my tractor what's wrong with just

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,840
using that

8
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,360
and yeah it's going to remove snow it's

9
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,280
going to push it it's already there it's

10
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,880
convenient it's paid for

11
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,560
move that snow where you want to be done

12
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,160
with it simple as that

13
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,840
every attachment is built for certain

14
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,240
tasks set a pallet forks

15
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880
a grapple a tiller a brush hog and just

16
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,080
because

17
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,920
it's on the front of your tractor right

18
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,960
now doesn't mean that it's suited or

19
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,720
intended

20
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,640
to move snow there's a lot of reasons

21
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,399
why a bucket is not good for snow

22
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,680
removal let's get into that now

23
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,760
if you like what you see here would you

24
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040

the description below or go to good

32
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,600
works tractors you'll find all sorts of

33
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,440
cool products for tractor owners like us

34
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,280
now don't get me wrong i love tractor

35
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,840
seat time just as much as anybody else

36
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,440
however

37
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,359
it can be frustrating and annoying

38
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,960
especially if it's freezing cold out and

39
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,800
you're in an open station tractor

40
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,159
to not get the job done quickly so with

41
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,840
that being said you take a look at the

42
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,119
design the construction

43
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,880
of a bucket from the front of your

44
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,880
tractor could be a skid steer too

45
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,320
the point being it's designed with a

46
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,320
bottom back sides

47
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,880
to trap and hold material whether that's

48
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,960
dirt it could be mulch it could be rock

49
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,960
it could be snow but the point is is

50
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,840
that it's gonna keep it inside there and

51
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,080
not let it go

52
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,080
without an effort from the operator so

53
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,759
with a snow pusher or a snow plow

54
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,439
you're driving forward pushing that snow

55
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,640
wherever you want to and when you got it

56
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,040
to that point where you want to leave it

57
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,240
there

58
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,520
all you do is just start backing up

59
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,479
maybe raise the loader up a little bit

60
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,000
and away you go

61
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,759
the same can't be said with a bucket

62
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,479
with a bucket again that snow wants to

63
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,159
stay in here

64
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,520
or whatever material it is so you have

65
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,799
to lift that bucket up

66
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,320
you have to rock it forward you have to

67
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,680
shake it out there's still going to be a

68
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,040
lot of snow trapped in these corners

69
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,320
here that's overall going to make it a

70
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,000
very inefficient tool

71
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,360
just from that aspect so if you take a

72
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,799
look at the snow pusher right here and

73
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,439
it could be a plow as well it's the same

74
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,200
concept

75
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,880
you'll notice there's no bottom there's

76
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,920
no floor there's nothing to trap and

77
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,680
hold material in it

78
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,200
that's the big difference between a

79
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,040
bucket and a pusher so

80
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,280
when you're moving that pile of snow

81
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,159
forward you just simply back up and it's

82
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,479
going to stay there

83
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,599
one push is no big deal but push after

84
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,760
push after push

85
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,680
and then every time you go out and plow

86
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,879
and then season after season that's a

87
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,920
ton of additional time that you're

88
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,520
spending just on

89
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,200
shaking a bucket to empty the material

90
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,239
out one of the ways that i've seen i've

91
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,319
read online

92
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,760
to kind of help snow release and maybe

93
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,480
not get stuck in these corners is going

94
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,920
to be using

95
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,239
some sort of a spray you know a

96
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,400
lubricant silicone teflon

97
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,879
pam even but just sprayed all inside

98
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,400
here i've kind of seen mixed results

99
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,920
i'm pretty sure i even saw a thread on

100
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
one of the tractor forms where a guy did

101
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,760
a test with and without the teflon or

102
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,120
silicone spray inside of the snow blower

103
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,879
didn't really see much of a difference

104
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,400
in the result but overall i think

105
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,519
it didn't do any harm so maybe it'll

106
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,560
help you maybe it won't but it's

107
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,680
something to look at

108
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,519
if you're going to use your bucket

109
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,040
another consideration with the design of

110
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,560
a bucket here is going to be this bottom

111
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,239
edge that comes along here

112
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
not only is that going to trap and hold

113
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,640
material that's in here and not allow it

114
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,120
to release

115
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,840
but it also means it's intended to dig

116
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,560
dig down

117
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,000
dig into a pile whatever material it is

118
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,640
again gravel dirt

119
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,440
mulch it could be any of the above but

120
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,360
the point being

121
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,280
is that as this is riding along that

122
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,400
plowing surface it's going to want to

123
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,319
naturally just dig

124
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,239
into whatever that surface is if you

125
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,800
have gravel stone

126
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,040
even asphalt or a concrete surface you

127
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,599
catch any edges on there or loose stone

128
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,040
it's gonna maybe chip an edge collect

129
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,159
that stone put it into your yard

130
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,599
somewhere you don't want it

131
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,440
so you can see a bucket right here with

132
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,200
a long edge designed to dig

133
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,879
compare it against a plow right here

134
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,920
it's going to have skid shoes tucked

135
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,440
underneath the bottom or if you have a

136
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,200
snow pusher you'll have skid runners on

137
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,200
either end that are going to prevent

138
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,400
this main leading edge here from digging

139
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,000
down into the ground

140
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,519
the intent is to just kind of glide

141
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,080
along with those skid shoes or the skid

142
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,440
runners

143
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,959
not dig down but just follow that

144
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,239
surface there the contour of it take

145
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,799
care of the snow and move that where you

146
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,080
want to

147
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,200
so that's something very important to

148
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,879
consider because that could end up

149
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,480
costing you a lot of additional money

150
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,959
repairing that damaged surface down the

151
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
road

152
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,000
if you're concerned about costly repairs

153
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,159
to the surface you're plowing whether

154
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,280
it's a gravel drive concrete asphalt

155
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,280
the same thing can be said for your

156
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,760
bucket as well because this edge right

157
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,840
here

158
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,599
is going to wear significantly and

159
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,040
unevenly meaning you're not going to be

160
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,400
able to use it very well for other

161
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,360
digging purposes that it's really

162
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,519
intended for

163
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,360
this edge right here is going to end up

164
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,040
rounding off at the corners here

165
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,040
you'll see a lot of significant wear

166
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,519
chewing up the main portion of this wear

167
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,199
edge

168
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,960
and then it'll come back in and die off

169
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,240
into these side plates right here

170
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,320
and once you get to that point you're

171
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,759
really making it unusable however if you

172
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,440
really want to use your bucket or maybe

173
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,800
it's just a temporary solution until you

174
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,360
can figure out a better long-term

175
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
solution

176
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,280
there's some things you can do to

177
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,160
prevent that uneven and unnecessary wear

178
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,160
on your bucket edge

179
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,639
[Music]

180
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,320
you're going to see a couple of

181
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,880
different products right here one is

182
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,120
going to be

183
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,160
essentially a type of skid shoe that you

184
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,840
can put onto your bucket

185
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,800
just kind of fit it on there like that

186
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,880
and it's going to keep it from

187
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,040
allowing the main bucket edge here to

188
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,759
make contact with that plowing surface

189
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,039
both protecting your plowing surface and

190
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,400
the bucket itself

191
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,080
the trade-off is going to be the fact

192
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,080
that your bucket is then going to be

193
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,199
oh maybe three quarters or an inch above

194
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,039
the plowing surface

195
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,560
therefore leaving a significant amount

196
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,240
of snow behind

197
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,479
another option you can look into is

198
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,479
something like this poly or uhmw

199
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,840
is called a cutting edge that you can

200
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,320
put onto your bucket

201
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,080
kind of mount it down underneath here

202
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,120
and make this the sacrificial edge

203
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,120
instead

204
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,400
not only is poly a good option for that

205
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,560
but this is very protective

206
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,080
of paved surfaces as well anything like

207
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,160
your asphalt or your concrete

208
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,000
a good way to sum up uhmw is that it's

209
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,120
going to cut like steel but protect like

210
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,479
rubber

211
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,560
now some buckets are going to come

212
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,919
pre-drilled which this bucket here was

213
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,520
already pre-drilled you can see there's

214
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,160
actually an additional steel edge on the

215
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,240
bottom

216
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,479
a lot of smaller compact and sub-compact

217
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,160
tractors will not have a pre-drilled

218
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,680
bucket edge on here so you may have to

219
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,320
do a little bit of drilling on your own

220
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,759
in order to secure the uhmw now i will

221
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,880
have links below in the description of

222
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,160
the video if you want to get more

223
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,560
information on where to buy

224
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,479
skid shoes like this or the uhmw while

225
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,919
we're talking about edges on buckets

226
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,120
you know what i totally forgot i even

227
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,400
had this it's winter time you don't

228
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,240
think about it too much but this is a

229
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,759
really cool option for the summertime

230
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,000
it's going to be a way to enhance the

231
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
versatility and the digging capability

232
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,199
of your bucket instead of having this

233
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,360
smooth edge here you'll have these teeth

234
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,720
this whole bar here just tightens down

235
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,240
you have these allen

236
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,240
set screws here that just tighten down

237
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,759
it stays in place i honestly never take

238
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,800
mine off because it's that handy to have

239
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,240
when i need it but

240
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,000
something to take a look at this is a

241
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,600
heavy hitch tooth bar you go to their

242
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,880
website and order directly there

243
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,039
anything on their website you get five

244
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,039
percent off with code gwt so again i'm

245
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,039
not saying that a bucket is not going to

246
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,479
work for snow removal it certainly will

247
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,840
it's just that there are certain tools

248
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,360
that are meant to be used for snow

249
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,720
removal there are certain tools that are

250
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
used to be able to scoop and dig and

251
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,360
hold material

252
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,880
so they're two different things and

253
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,600
trying to use one for a different

254
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,120
purpose

255
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,120
it's gonna be kind of frustrating and

256
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,400
could end up being very costly for you

257
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,000
even if you're trying to save some money

258
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,520
up front it could cost you more down the

259
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,280
road so if you found this video helpful

260
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,479

where you can buy those products like

267
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,199
those skid shoes or the poly edge or

268
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,960
maybe a snow pusher or a replacement

269
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,160
bucket or a whole tractor we can put

270
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,039
