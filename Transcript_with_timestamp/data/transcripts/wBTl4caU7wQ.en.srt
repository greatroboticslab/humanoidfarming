1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,720
as a farmer we all look for a product

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:09,920
that all a crop that does not need much

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,360
of the capital and will give some good

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,839
returns within the shortest period of

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,080
time one of these crops is Los coco

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,920
beans the demand for beans consumption

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,119
has been on the rise as consumptions

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,080
increases most people are preferring

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,599
cereals and this has made it demand to

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,679
continue increase remember it's also

11
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,640
widely consumed by in

12
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:34,840
high schools and even some of the

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,760
primary schools so it's rare when you

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:42,879
farm this L cocoa beans for you not to

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:46,320
get good Market a bag of 90 kg of L coco

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,879
beans ages between 7,000 in high Supply

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,039
season to 15,000 or even 18,000 in a

18
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:55,879
shortage Seasons so this is a product

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,680
that you can manage to farm and get some

20
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,960
good results as long as you do it

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,120
collect remember having

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,439
cost does not guarantee profit you have

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,920
to do it right and also you have to

24
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:11,240
maximize maintaining your cost as low as

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,840
possible so that you

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,119
have good profit margin and also you

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,680
manage to get high

28
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,759

Farmers now we jump right into it now

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,880
lose coco

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,200
beans are first draw to tolerant and

40
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,320
then also they tend to grow fast within

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,520
90 days in AA you need an average of 16

42
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,439
to 20 kg that's a seed rate also for

43
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,960
beans and this is a general rule for all

44
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:03,200
beans you don't have to do it in fertile

45
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,840
soils actually we have observed a be

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,280
done in deep fertile soils those

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,000
extremely fertile soils they tend not to

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,560
do well and by doing well I mean you

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,560
find that that bean it looks very good

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,200
it's a very healthy has a lot of forage

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,080
like it has a lot of leaves but the

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,280
number of PS that it produces are

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,560
minimal and even the bean size is very

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,400
very minimal okay and that's why we even

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,920
commend when you're doing beans if your

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,920
soil is very very fertile don't add

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,319
manure also we also don't add a lot

58
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,840
of Dap You just use very very small

59
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,920
amount and if you can manage not to do

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,200
with it it's still fine it's a way of

61
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,080
reducing cost however if you farming in

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,920
an area that is completely infertile you

63
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,599
need to add manure at to sustain this

64
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:02,680
crop beans tend to do well in Sunday L

65
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:05,519
SS and the tend to grow well in well

66
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,239
drained soils okay so if your soils tend

67
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,319
to flat or if the soils are cray and

68
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,720
they don't support much this may tend to

69
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,680
frustrate you so if you have a well

70
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,480
drained s soils that's okay for you you

71
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,239
can do L cocoa beans how to plant it

72
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,519
it's very simple and it's very very easy

73
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,560
you just need to do you can do holes or

74
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,680
you can do follows or the Met system

75
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,480
then

76
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,200
as Bing of let's say from one line to

77
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,319
the other you can do 30 to 40 cm then

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,560
from one being to the other you can do

79
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:47,519
roughly 20 to 25 cm personally I prefer

80
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,360
planting with both holes so that I can

81
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,879
manage to if the soil is infertile to AO

82
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,680
manure and then also I can manage to do

83
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,560
some good spacing and also it's not that

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,480
much involving it's easier to dig holes

85
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,799
than the follow

86
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,840
I put two seeds per hole so that in case

87
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,920
one does not germinate the other one

88
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:14,519
will germinate uh nowadays it's easier

89
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:19,000
they all certified seeds like the L Coco

90
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:23,360
glp to from Kenya seed and also

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,919
from East Africa seed and if you cannot

92
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,759
manage to buy these certified seeds also

93
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:33,479
you can buy from the normal seral store

94
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,039
St okay so the normal Rose Coco that you

95
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:38,800
buy for 18 you can still brand it as

96
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:41,280
long as as long as you select the one

97
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,800
that are not dented the one that don't

98
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,199
have holes and then the on that are very

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,199
very healthy once you plant them the

100
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,560
performance will still be super good

101
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
remember for the one that is certified

102
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,240
and this other one in CL store there's

103
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,160
no that much difference actually the

104
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,759
only difference that I observe is that

105
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,720
the certified seed is treated it's well

106
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,280
selected and these are that you buy from

107
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,680
it's not treated and remember you can

108
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,759
treat your own seeds with like Molano

109
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,680
super and still perform well okay but to

110
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,840
cut the cost I would go for the normal L

111
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,520
cocoa beans from the market they still

112
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,039
do very very well now after you've

113
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,440
planted don't plant extremely deep you

114
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:28,600
plant just shallowly if your sty is not

115
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,440
F you can also consider top dressing

116
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,840
with d

117
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,680
this is often 10 to 14 days after

118
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,720
germination for those who have watched

119
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,720
our previous videos you have observed

120
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,800
that we recommend you applying dap

121
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,280
fertilizers on 10 to 14th days after

122
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,080
sewing or even transplanting this

123
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,400
enhances faster absorption and prevent

124
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,000
reaching as the crop will have developed

125
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,080
substantial loot hairs that will help to

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,720
absorb the nitrogen and the phosphorus

127
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,160
in the fertilizers okay and also ensure

128
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,400
that while you're tring the C is wet and

129
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,720
also ensure that the fertilizer does not

130
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:10,919
come into contact with the leaves after

131
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,080
that you can continue doing your normal

132
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,720
weeding the farm should always remain

133
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,240
clean nowadays the good thing is that

134
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,440
you don't have to incur that much of

135
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,599
cost especially when you're doing manual

136
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,240
weeding there are a lot of selective

137
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:29,880
post and pre-emergence herbicides for

138
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,599
controlling weeds in beans Farms good

139
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:37,440
example is Bean screen and also Mr Bean

140
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:41,479
plus these are good selective post and

141
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,680
preim herbicides that work very very

142
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,919
efficiently the only condition with the

143
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,560
one is that you don't they don't work in

144
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,800
intercrop FS remember B you can

145
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,639
intercrop them with MS and when you

146
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,759
intercop the apping face selective

147
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,680
herdes will kill the m and leave the

148
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,919
beans alone so these herdes only works

149
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,080
where beans are planted alone okay it's

150
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:09,160
easier because it reduces the cost of

151
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,000
the cost of doing hiring workers to come

152
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,039
and plow to come and do the we and also

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,680
it does the efficiency because sometimes

154
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,759
you hire these workers they come and do

155
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,360
so I'm sure work of weeding but when you

156
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,879
apply this chemical it's cheap okay and

157
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,280
remember all these chemicals you can

158
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,199
manage to get them from our farm shop

159
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,599
and we do delivery Countrywide and even

160
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,599
outside the country so this is one of

161
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,400
the best method to control weight after

162
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,560
that there are things that you need to

163
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,440
control one are feet and the other one

164
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,759
is diseases such as the blight Lea flast

165
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,240
the common one is Lea FL and Lea Sport

166
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:50,039
and the likes of otheros now first for

167
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:55,360
AIDS what you can do is you apply ther

168
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:59,520
Inc side especially especially from from

169
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,720
20th day after sewing 20th to 28th day

170
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,080
you can apply Thunder and you can repeat

171
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,680
it after one week this will help you

172
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,360
manage all the outfits that may infest

173
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,759
your beans then from there for all these

174
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,360
fungal diseases you can use nativo it's

175
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:21,159
a good it's a good fun Fung side that

176
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,479
will help you control all these uh

177
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:26,360
fungicides especially the Lea FL you can

178
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,720
also use sometimes little meal for any

179
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,960
early or late bright and even sometimes

180
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,519
you can use

181
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,800
infinitor infin it's a very good it's a

182
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,039
very very

183
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,159
good fungicide that you can also use to

184
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,880
control all this remember I've not

185
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,800
mentioned the use of uh boosters or F

186
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,320
fertilizers because when you apply most

187
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,680
of these nitrogen Rich fertilizers on

188
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,000
cereal what they do they boost the

189
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,560
leaves development and the leaves growth

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,399
okay but your intention is not to

191
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,720
harvest the leaves your intention is to

192
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,959
harvest the pot and when you enhance

193
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,440
leaves growth and when you enhance Le uh

194
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,320
development what you do you minimize the

195
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,279
ability of the port and you minimize the

196
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,079
size of the beans form actually it

197
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:13,440
interferes with the leav you call it the

198
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,800
Le PS ratio okay so the higher the

199
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,040
number of leaves the lower the harest of

200
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:23,519
beans that you get but you can apply

201
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,600
some of this like the Bon that will help

202
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,399
in preventing flowers abortion the other

203
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,839
thing that I really want to warn farmers

204
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,120
you don't do weeding on beans Farm when

205
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,600
it's raining this to prevent the prevent

206
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,640
of fungal diseases that that tend to

207
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,240
destroy all your farm and that's why you

208
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,959
observe if you've done weeding when it's

209
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,399
training or there was some uh light

210
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,600
showers you will observe that they tend

211
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,279
to turn yellow after completing the

212
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,240
weding and most of the time they lose

213
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,680
the leaves and when they lose the leaves

214
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,000
also they reduce the ability of making

215
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,680
their own food and the beans as well

216
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,800
reducing and roaring the whole thing

217
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,279
okay the best thing is that at the end

218
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,760
of all once you manage all this you

219
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,279
control all the weeds bottom line is

220
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:15,560
that it is possible for you to harvest

221
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:18,880
at least 10 bags and above per of L coo

222
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:23,360
beans and remember you planted 16 to 20

223
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,360
kgs okay and the if you do the MS the

224
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,519
fertilizer the chemical you find the

225
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,320
cost are very very very minimal now

226
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:33,920
before I leave I I would really love to

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,360
