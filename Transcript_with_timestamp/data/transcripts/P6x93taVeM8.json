  "text": "hello welcome to unit one of intro to agroecology this unit's entitled current non-sustainable agriculture practices what we'll be covering in this unit is what currently is happening in farming and why we need to make some changes uh as we go into the future in able to in order to be able to um feed the population of uh the world uh here is just a picture of way back when of what the farming practices were like and basically the reason this picture is here to show you how um they used to plow the land and it was just all open all the time you can see right now nothing's growing um this would be in a dormant time probably in the late fall winter or early spring before we planted and it's just to show you that that's what they used to do and we'll talk as we go on in this uh unit and discuss some of the changes we need to make um some of the areas we're going to look at we're going to look at the current practices um that we currently do in agriculture we're going to look at how we work the land that's the tillage practices that we use currently and we'll talk a little bit about um from the beginning um when they started out with the Prairies and made them into Farmland um to today and and the differences in philosophies and why they did that um we're going to talk about synthetic fertilizers and why they have become an issue and why we need to change into organic fertilizers we're going to talk a little bit about um weed and Pest Control practices that are in use today um that we use and most of those are synthetic um not organic and we'll talk about why we need to change those too um we'll also talk about a change that used to be all small family farms and it's becoming more and more as time goes on um large corporations doing the farming and raising the animals and we'll talk about um why that's been good and bad and then we'll talk about some of the limitations we have with our current practices um as we go forward in the future and why we need to change in order to be able to feed everyone um the first area we'll talk about is the um tillage practices that are in use today um basically when they had the native prairies you had to um they called it busting the Prairie but you were actually taking a piece of equipment um and making sure that it could dig into the land and they used to do that every year and we found out that in the practices of doing that where we're losing some uh a lot of soil because of erosion the winds in the winter time because was open like that first picture we saw in this unit um we're going to look at some of the different pieces they've used um current or they're currently using um and we're going to talk a little bit about why did they changeed and and uh over the last 50 years into using new practices one of the reasons they changed was because of the Dust Bowl they had um that they found out that the reason they had the Dust Bowl was because we were plowing and we were leaving the fields open and uh prone to being able to have erosion the wind was blowing the soil everywhere uh except where wanted it to be um then we're going to look also at some of the conservation things that they've come about probably starting in the late 60s early 70s to today um and why did they why are they practicing it why is the farm bureaus that are out there helping people or helping the current Farmers learn that they need to change what they're doing uh and then up to the current where we're pretty much now most farmers are believing that no till is the way they should do versus breaking the Prairie or using the plow all the time um there's a lot of farmers that don't even have plows anymore but basically what the no till is is they've changed when they plant they've added um some equipment to it that makes them able to plant and you know open the ground a little bit but we're doing it a lot less than what we did and it's um actually uh saving uh the land that we have um some of the current uh tillage methods that we have there's cultivation um and what cultivation is is after the plants are planted they go in there and they try to control the weeds so they can do that up to a certain point um let's just it doesn't matter whether it's corn or soy beans the two most common crops that are out there for most Farmers um it's just a little they call a chisel plow it's a v-shaped piece of equipment and what happens is it just goes between the rows of the crops whether it's corn or soybeans and it actually um pulls the weeds out of the ground you can only do that till it gets about a foot high but then at that point the crop tends to crowd out um the ability for the sun to get to the ground which is how seeds germinate for weeds and you don't have that problem anymore or certainly not as much um plowing is the first time when you do it if you've never farmed land or if you had it let's say in pasture land or it was just bow which means you don't have have any crops on it at all that um you might have to work it with a plow uh in order to be able to plant again dising is a practice that's not used as much anymore but basically it used to be used all the time in the 60s and 70s that they go in right before they planted it's a round shaped saucer and there's a bunch of them hooked down we'll have a picture of it later uh to see it and basically it would it would uh turn the ground a few inch is in and provide for the ability to be able to plant easy um minimum till was when you would do it um not as often they got to a point where they they did not at the end of the year when they took the crops out the crop residue was there they used to always either come in and disc it or they turn it with a plow for the winter time and then they come in and disc in the spring and you'd be able to plant and they'd have a smooth surface to plant on now what they do is they leave that residue a lot of what they found out will go away in the winter time from the freeze Tha Cycles uh and then there's now no till when they started adding that uh extra it's just a little disc actually it'll just open the soil enough to put the seed in the ground and that's what they call no till so it's technically it is a little bit of tilling but it's not as much as it was when you used to do the discing um um on this slide this just goes to the I said about cultivation plowing and discing um it talks a little bit more detail for the cultivation removing those weeds and it um why does it create a better growing environment because if there's less um competition for the plants the plants are going to do better they're all competing for excuse me all the nutrients and water so the less plants that are there and the ones that you want that are there they're going to grow better for you um plowing it'll dig down in 10 to 12 Ines so you you can see um that digging down that far how you're opening up a a big area when it turns over and you'll see a picture of it in a little bit that that's what allows for that erosion when the wind comes to have it Blow around um pretty much now it's only used when you're preparing a new field um dising told you before it's a platter like device uh it only goes in 46 in and it really doesn't turn it like a plow it just kind of cut cuts it apart because of how the disc is and basically when there are some Farmers that still do it they'll do it at the end to harvest to to break apart the corn or soybean residue that's there um and basically corn fields are what they use it in the soybeans don't leave as much residue okay uh some Farmers still use it for when they plant a new crop because that's what they've always done we all get in habits the minimum till it's that um discing a fuel before you plant but you don't ever use plowing at all um um and I would say most farmers are either in minimum till or no till um I'd say vast majority probably 90 to 95% today across the US um no till is when they don't use the um the disc or plow and they go ahead and harvest plant and harvest without doing that but once again the planter that they use has a little disc on that opens it up enough that you can plant the seed in the ground um here's a picture of discing and you can see it's pretty it's not completely smooth but in the next picture you're going to see um the reason you do this is it opens it up but what it also does is it also allows for um seed seeds to come up for weeds which would allow more weeds to come up and that's part of the thing too when you do the no till you're not going to get as many uh weed seeds that are on top and weed and any seed needs the U sun to be able to germinate so you want to make sure you you control that and that's one of the things they found out they have a lot less weeds um not having as many weeds you'll also find out when we talk about fertilizers that that's better too because you're not putting as much synthetic things on the land which we found out isn't that good here you can see when they turn it um that they have a this area right in here uh that I circled with my pointer that um it's a little bit higher and that's the ridge it leaves there's one across the second one here how those are created is up here is where the disc are it's just a a curved piece of metal that's about u a foot and a half wide and that's what actually goes into the ground they have a hydraulic on it and they are able to go into the ground that far uh the farmer can lift it by a control he has on his tractor uh talking about synthetic fertilizers um the synthetic fertilizers came about around the time that they ended the second world war and it was um basically because we were farming we weren't they needed to they always want to increase production and that was a way in which fertilizer of course um we all use it on you know house plants we have like um Miracle Grow and it helps the plant grow it provides nutrients that needs specifically nitrogen that'll help that plant do better most Farm crops nitrogen is um the fertilizer they want to put on there to make it grow better but one of the problems that they found out um that they didn't know right in the beginning was that those synthetic fertilizers don't make the soil Vitality any better in other words the nutrients in the soil that stay there they're they found out that it uses it right away and then there's nothing there so basically the soil is getting worse and worse every year the other thing is in a normal soil there are micronutrients and micronutrients aren't in as large a supply as the macronutrients that are out there and nitrogen happens to be one of the macronutrients um but basically they are things that help a plant get stronger they help a plant flower better um those types of things and there's things like Boron that um are some of the um micronutrients but there's total of all nutrients there's 17 different ones and in a uh unit that's going to follow will get into um all of the macro and micronutrients so that'll make a lot more sense then um also what happens is that by putting in the fertilizers and it's not a total result of that but because you aren't building the soil and the Vitality isn't as good it's going to be become more compressed over time because it's taking out some of those nutrients um and it's going to not be real good for the soil um one of the other things they're found out is all the nitrogens we put on the um on the land when we're doing this there's times that a lot of that fertilizer will leech out that means it leaves it without doing the desired effect that you want with the fertilizer and basically what happens is it goes from um the arm field into ditches then to streams then to rivers and it eventually gets down to the Gulf of Mexico and basically what happens on that is that's where all of the U basically it's killing the coral reefs and stuff um and all the uh all the plants and animals that are at the end of the Gulf of Mexico um and this happens all over the world it's just not in the Gulf of Mexico um but basically what we're finding out is that we're really putting too much on because if it doesn't need it it just runs off the other thing is if you put it on at the wrong time uh if it rains sometimes rain will make it wash away um if the water is you know running off the field real quickly um here's an example of a farmer applying fertilizer and in this case he's applying nitrogen and specifically it's called anhydrous ammonia um it's a it's a gaseous um liquid gas that BAS basically if you breathe it um you would probably not be here anymore uh it's very dangerous um but basically what you see and and it's a good example here if you look at between the this is an example of corn uh if you look between it there's a residue from the corn of last year um one of the things and we'll we'll get into this in more detail as we go through the course but that's one of the problems they have that some of the um crops we put in will put some nutrients back into the soil Corn's not one of those it actually just takes nutrients especially nitrogen and that's what's making the Vitality of the soils uh less and less all the time and we'll talk in ways we can make that better too here's an example of um the the prior uh slide showed you were just applying nitrogen you apply it everywhere okay it's really only needed where the plant is but there's not an effective way we can really do that without putting it on the whole field here is an example of it wouldn't so much be a farmer is not going to be out there doing this but it just shows that you can use a selective weed killer even if you spray it on the whole field but what's good about this is it's only going to kill the uh intended plant you want so if you're out in a just say a grass yard um you can spray a weed killer a selective weed killer and it's not going to kill the grass it's just going to Kill U the weed that you want it's the same in a a farm field they can put in selective herbicides they call it it doesn't kill the plant it only kills the weeds that are there um for synthetic fertilizers um in in some ways that it's it's become something especially with corn that if you don't use it you're not going to get the crop yield that you want and and one of the ways that they've made it they they've used genetics to be able to produce corn that that will give you uh a yield that you like back in the 40s and 50s they used to get about 40 to 45 um bushels of corn for an acre of land right now they're exceeding 300 bushels of corn per acre so you can see that they've really really increased the amount of uh yield you can get which means you get more yield which means you get more money and everyone loves it part of the problem is is you needed a lot of nitrogen to do that and because you're putting more nitrogen there's more runoff so you have a big issue with that so that's some of the stuff that we're going to start talking about what can we do to become more sustainable which you'll see is a huge word as we go through this class um irrigation would also aggravate the problem we talked earlier when you get too much rain um you can have an issue with it but but with that is is that it'll make it run off a little bit more you just have to be careful with that irrigation isn't in most Farms it's usually only in Vegetable Farms um so if you're raising stuff like potatoes or pumpkins or you know peas or you know things you buy in the store like that as opposed to corn and um soybeans which are byproducts use they create many different products but they you don't eat that corn directly um also irrigation aggravation a problem that it adds salt to the soil and too much salt is not good for soil either and it doesn't necessarily go away salt tends to stay it doesn't tend to um leave the area and that could be a problem and certainly is a problem in some of the areas that do irrigation um fertilizers are becoming tremendously expensive um they didn't Ed to be very expensive but even the fertilizer you buy for your yard you know 10 years ago used to be half the cost of what it is today so that's really made a big difference um and then I talked earlier the the second to the last point there is corn would not produce what it does if you didn't fertilize it you'd probably get about a third the amount that you get currently so you get about a 100 bushels an acre as opposed to 300 and like we said when we do that it doesn't address that long-term Vitality of the soil because what happens is it um just uses everything that's there and no nutrients are added and that's become a huge problem okay um also besides doing the nitrogens there's also chemicals that we use for Pest and weed control um what they try to control when they use these chemicals are diseases that you might get on crops um insect infestations um and there's also the weeds you can get um what we do is one of the reasons we put the herbicides pesticides or fungicides on and herbicides are for the crops pesticides are things for like grasshoppers bow weevils that type of stuff the insects and fungicides are for the diseases um that you might get and it varies by crop and we'll talk a little bit about that as we get into suceeding chapters of uh this course um so some of the issues we have with the pest and weed control is that it is a synthetic item so it's not something that's natural and what we're finding is is not having Natural Things it isn't as good as we thought it was but what happens is over time we have found that the effectiveness of that chemical decreases in other words it isn't doing the same as it did because the insects and diseases are learning from their going to get killed with let's say something like um DDT was a perfect example it killed everything but what we also found with that is over time that it affected the environment too so for the what one of the things of DDT um affected tremendously were Birds of Prey so the big thing everyone will remember basically it's Hawks and Eagles are birds of prey two of the big uh species that are out there and we almost lost all of the Eagles because what happened is the shell of the egg got thinner and thinner and thinner because of DDT and basically when the mother or father Eagle sat on the eggs they broke because they weighed too much um so now that we got rid of DD in I believe it was the 70s um the Eagles are making a comeback as everyone knows um but one of the issues with it is is that DDT was was one of those chemicals that we thought you put it on and did its job and killed everything and then it went away uh guess what that's not true the DDT is still around and we haven't had it on in what 40 years they haven't applied any and it's still in soil so we're finding out that some of the stuff we're doing isn't so good and one of the things we'll learn in this class is we really really need to consider getting away from synthetic as much as we can if not totally um here's just an example of irrigation and excuse me here's a crop of it looks like corn or potatoes it's hard to tell it's so small um but basically they just have those long units and they have sprayers hanging off the the big uh silver part that you see up here is how the water goes across and that goes all the way down there um the wheels on it are so that they can have a motor we don't see it in this picture but it actually swings around on a pendulum and it can go across that whole fields and what you see here is those lines that are there is where the tires going and it actually uh ruins some of the crops but it still um does a good job watering and because you're watering it's in areas they probably don't have enough rain but things like corn and soybeans don't need to have rain generally the rain that you have in an area is enough but when you get crops like the veggies you really really need to have irrigation because they need more a lot more water okay now we're going to start looking at um how changes have started happening over time um in terms of plants and animals is how we're going to look at this changes we've had in that they've had new hybrids and varieties of crops every year they come out with one of the ways we're getting higher and higher yields or the amount of crops we're pulling out of a field each year is they come out with new hybrids that will grow better in either a specific area a specific environment um or for a specific purpose um we've all heard the the term GMO um how they've accomplished this is they've done the genetically modified organism is what GMO stands for and that's how they've come up with the new varieties basically when back in the olden days I guess I'll say they used to have what they called open pollinated crops and that was crops that basically if you took like say an ear of corn and save the corn the next spring you could plant that corn and you get the same crop again well they did that you know 40 45 bushel an acre and that wasn't enough it wouldn't get anymore no matter what they did so they started uh geneticists started coming up with ways that they could produce more uh corn uh so you had larger uh cobs of corn ears of corn um but when they did that what they're finding out now is that that GMO type stuff is starting to show up in the animals that are um eating it it's showing up in the people that are eating the meat from the animals that are eating the GMO corn so we're not sure yet um what that means totally if it's good or bad but we're beginning to believe that perhaps the GMO might not have been the right thing and we might have to look at coming up with new hybrids um that maybe aren't as genetic Ally altered or certainly do studies to find out whether or not it's affecting us in a good or a bad way or animals too um in terms of some of the stuff there are new cross breeds of animals and everyone's heard about the Clone sheep and the Clone cattle you know the the Betty the you know Barney whatever the names of these animals are England tends to be a place that has a lot of they've come up with a lot of cloned animals um basically what trying to do when they do either a cloned animal or a crossbreed is to pass on the desirable traits from one let's say a cow to the next one so in other words if there's qualities about that cow it has too much fat it's it it doesn't walk very well um it has leaner um meat uh all those types of things that they're going to pass just those one traits that they like onto it another thing is if if you had dairy cattle that they would produce more milk is the largest thing or you produce a chicken that'll produce U more meat or it'll lay more eggs that type of thing um in order to do this though um the what they do is they try to do these things and then they'll use drugs and medicines in order to help in that development um they aren't real sure at this point and it's becoming more and more more of a debate on whether or not these this Evolution has been a great thing or it's been a bad thing and it's it's I suppose like anything you uh you're going to have people that are on both sides of the fence but time will tell on that uh here's an example of one of the things that in the in the what used to always happen is here was an example where you have cattle feed Lots okay you're in a pasture on individual farms and here's an example where um there's not too many cattle here but in the cattle feed Lots there are thousands and thousands of cows and it's that um corporate farming and then it's it's in their opinion much cheaper to do that but we've had some issues with um when we've done that when you look at the cattle feed Lots you see how close they are together when the animals don't have as much room to roam one of the issues that they have is there's more pollution because they're generally not out on farms they're usually on the edge of towns and they have nowhere to uh take the animal waste and generally they just keep piling it up and piling it up whereas when it was on the Old Farm the individual Family Farm they used to take the um animal waste and spread it on the fields and use that as fertilizer that nitrogen um the other thing is when you have animals in a small area they're more prone to disease so therefore you had to start using antibiotics that they didn't use they have to use as much when they're out on the individual Farms to try to control the different um diseases that they might get um in terms of looking at these changes that we're seeing that single family farms are going away at an alarming rate and a lot of it used to be that the oldest son would always take over um the family farm when Dad decided to retire and Dad and Grandpa help out on the farm but the son eventually had it the oldest one and that's generally what happened today it's pretty much all of the children are leaving the farm and when Dad retires they're selling the farm and it's becoming larger and larger and larger and more corporately owned um and how stuff is done is totally based on the kind of money you make not necessarily what's good for the environment um it's become also that because the um Cor corporate has kind of taken over and made the large uh lots for raising cattle that it isn't cost effective to raise cows or pigs as much as it used to be they aren't making as much uh in terms of Dairy Farmers they have to pick up the milk every day um and when you had the 30 40 cows those type of farms are pretty much going away and they're you know setting Farms up with two three four 5,000 dairy cows that they're uh milking on a 24-hour operation so it's become tremendously different um in in in what's happening um the last point there is most crops are dependent on many factors and you need ideal settings in order for them to survive in other words that they're becoming more and more specialized in what they're able to do and how they produce but what happens is if you get out of that um environment that was ideal you might not get the kind of uh yield that you want to get so we've had they're starting to have some issues with that that they're trying to address uh and then just a little bit a few slides to talk about some of the limitations that we have currently which we've basically been talking about the whole way through um what we're finding out is that our model is not very sustainable which means that over time it isn't going to let you keep going on and on and on we're going to have to keep making changes add more fertilizer you know add more pesticides or herbicides or come up with new ones because what we have isn't regenerating what we need to have good example is the uh nutrients in the soil that because we don't have that it's not going to let us continue on the way we're going eventually we're going to have to change that um another thing is populations are growing cities are getting bigger so every year the amount of land that we Farm is decreasing um and if you decrease the land the only way that you're going to produce enough food for everybody is to increase the yield of what you're growing um population growth of the world is out of control they're saying uh predictions are out there that by the year 2050 that if population continues to grow like it is right now they won't have enough food to feed the world we'll have massive starvation um in the oceans um the ecosystems there are declining over time one of the problems is all the fertilizers and pesticides and herbicides are getting to the oceans and it's starting to filter in and affect the different uh flora and fauna that are out there um and it's it's affecting you know what we're going to have the other thing they're having is in some areas especially like on the East Coast where they do a lot of uh uh fishing where boats go out and get all the different fish that are out there and then in the Gulf of Mexico they get all the um all the crabs and the crabs aren't aren't down there they're out east but um the shrimp and those types of uh uh animals that they're over fishing now uh another problem we are is we're coral reefs are dying due to that fertilizer population um they aren't excuse me they aren't sure but they believe that the GMO genetics um are starting to cause pollution also and that's just in the infancy of looking at that so we'll learn more as time goes on of that um another issue we have is the amount of water we have the fresh water um you can't use salt water from the oceans which there's a ton of you have to use fresh water so that's either comes from a well the aquifers in the ground or from lakes and ponds and what we're using is increasing and increasing at an alarming rate certainly faster than it's being replenished in those aquifers lakes and ponds um also animal feed lots are increasing in size so the pollution we have the amount of uh uh medicines that we have to give the animals and that is increasing so that's all going to affect our health as humans and things we want to try to to uh reduce that um what we're also learning is that there's residues from the fertilizers pesticides herbicides and insecticides which um we use and what we need to do is because it leeches out into the uh water tables into the streams fonds and rivers we need to reduce that um also the uh the level of acid in the ocean is increasing at a higher rate in other words it's taking the oxygen out that it has and it's destroying the coral floral re from in many areas which um they don't totally understand all of those things but they do know that everything around it is affected by those coral reefs de decreasing in size and coral reefs are live uh organisms and they're dying at an alarming rate all over the world okay um some of the limitations we have for soil degradation and we using the fertilizer what we're finding out it's just taking the nutrients out um what it also is doing is they call it their nutrients are bound up in other words the makeup of the soil is changing so that the nutrients that that are there are in a state that they aren't allowed to be used in other words the soil's keeping them and not letting the crops use them so what's happening with that that means that you're going to get less of a crop yield um one of the things they really believe to become sustainable is that you have to get rid of the monocropping what monocropping is is that you're putting the same type of plant in year after year after year after year um it used to be over time that um every third or fourth year they used to rust the land and how you used to rest the land is put in something like wheat or oats or just don't put anything in and put in some type of cover crop with another possibility and that put nitrogen back in the soils those type of plants would put nitrogen back back in and it used to be that they one year they put soybeans the next year they put corn the next year they uh put in wheat and then they go through that same cycle again and that would add the nitrogen back into the soil which was good because we don't do that anymore and we're just putting on the synthetic um fertilizer nitrogen um it's not it's making the soil worse and worse and worse as we go over time um other problem is in the vegetable Fields we're overwatering and that's promoting that pollution by salinization which is too much salt in the soil and then um we're also over grazing the pastures and basically what that is you're putting too many animals in a small area for the ones that are grazing and they eat up all of the uh crop or the grasses that are there and therefore it's more expensive to feed them um there's more disease it'll come because it's all dirt uh the wind will get the erosion issues so there's all kinds of things that come into play um when you're doing that this is a list of all the attributions um all the pictures we had in here and where they're at so I'll leave this up for a little bit so you can see that",
