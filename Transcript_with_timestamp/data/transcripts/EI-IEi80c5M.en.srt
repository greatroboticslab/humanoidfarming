1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,400
talk this morning is about nutrient

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,839
management practices on on small

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,880
livestock Farms I'm not going to get a

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,080
lot of detail about how to actually do a

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,679
nutrient management plan on a small farm

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,559
I guess that's going to probably vary

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,600
from from source to source to Source but

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,720
I want to talk about some practices

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,359
we've found or I've found that I think

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,240
are are good guidelines that small farms

11
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,720
ought to ought to be following and good

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,800
recommendations we can make I guess the

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,439
biggest question is uh what do you think

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,399
is a small farm I mean it's kind of Soup

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,120
To Nuts in a way here's uh you know 25

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,960
goats here's a couple hundred dairy cows

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,640
that are

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,680
grazing there's a few chickens on a farm

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,360
that happened to be pretty much a

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,199
managerie for

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:50,680
foul um 500 milking use this pretty cool

22
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:52,800
farm been there lots of times uh they

23
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,520
produce artisan cheese for a very

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,920
high-end Market if you want to spend $35

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,600
a pound for cheese you should come to

26
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,960
that that

27
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:06,080
farm um a 35 St

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,040
Farm some beef cows 65 or 70 head a

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,360
breeding Farm of horses so a small farm

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,560
um kind of across the board a little bit

31
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,119
so I'm I'm not going to throw out a

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,040
question for you here but I'd like you

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,720
to think just what makes a small farm

34
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:24,000
small um could be acreage um sometimes

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,320
Farms on small farms are very very

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,200
limited acreage they're small

37
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,759
um you know 20 goats on five Farms I

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,119
guess that would qualify as a small farm

39
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,280
animal numbers sometimes low but again

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,119
that can vary um 150 Cow Dairy Farm

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,320
would be considered small in much of the

42
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:44,079
country um and in some parts of the

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,040
country it would be considered quite

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,680
large uh small farms may have a special

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,360
kind of a market they're they're

46
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,600
producing for some kind of a niche

47
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,759
market um small farm uh um meat being

48
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,360
produced for a for a specialty trade of

49
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,360
some kind height well I'm just joking

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,000
there 5 fo2 I guess would be height well

51
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,360
this is the USDA answer uh for a small

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,160
farm a small farmer is defined as one

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,200
that grows and sells between $1,000 and

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,400
$250,000 per year in agricultural

55
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,000
products again that's a nice big range

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,040
uh to look at uh$

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,959
250,000 what's that 75 dairy cows you

58
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,840
know is that about right I think that's

59
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,560
probably in the realm of uh uh what it

60
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,959
might be maybe 100 dairy cows a

61
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,040
th000 $1,000 I guess below that we'd we

62
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,800
we'd be looking more at uh maybe kind of

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,440
a hobby farm and this is going to vary

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,920
by States a lot of states are going to

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,959
have um uh Farmland tax assessments that

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,480
are going to require a certain amount of

67
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,640
income to qualify for that Farmland tax

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,680
assessment in our state we only required

69
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,760
$500 of income to actually qualify for

70
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,239
Farmland tax Assessments in some other

71
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,720
states it might be quite a bit more than

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,840
that so again that's the USDA definition

73
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,080
um this comes off of usda's we side they

74
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,519
kind of divide between more of a let's

75
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,280
just call Residential or I don't I don't

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,840
want to use the term Hobby Farms but

77
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,400
retirement Farms lifestyle Farms um

78
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,120
there's a major there's an occupation

79
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,560
there other than just

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,040
farming um and then more what we'd call

81
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,319
an intermediate uh Family Farms probably

82
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,560
still less than that $250,000 gross um

83
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,439
they report farming as their major occup

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,720
uh occupation low sales Farms might have

85
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,959
less than $100,000 uh in sales High

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,120
sales farms between1 and

87
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,480
$250,000 in in sales so it's a pretty

88
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,760
pretty broad look we're we're looking at

89
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,280
um this kind of interesting uh from the

90
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,680
the 2007 census of

91
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,959
farms if you look at that um

92
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,360
$250,000 from less than $10,000 to up to

93
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,799
$250,000

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:05,200
60% um of of all those Farms of of all

95
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,000
Farms not just the $250,000 Farms 60% of

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,000
all Farms are less than $10,000 of

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,319
sales okay six and 10 Farms have less

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,600
than $10,000 in sales land in farms well

99
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,639
that's lower

100
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:24,080
18% um cattle inventory 9% horse

101
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,759
inventory 65% of our horse farms are on

102
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,759
those less than $10,000 of of income and

103
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,520
often times I wonder where horse income

104
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,759
comes from I'm not not sure so much in

105
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,280
my state where how they're actually

106
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,320
making money unless they're part of

107
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,160
other other kind of uh you know

108
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,160
Endeavors on the same

109
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,960
Farm okay we may not use the we may use

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,039
another governmental um um

111
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,639
recommendation and this would be the

112
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:53,680
EPA um uh approach you know we can um

113
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,400
we're all familiar with Kos small Kos

114
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,080
medium Kos um a small farm would be um a

115
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,880
small C would be less than 300 head of

116
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:07,000
of beef ve or dairy less than 200 dairy

117
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,560
cattle less than 750 swine uh that are

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,639
greater than 55 lbs 3,000 swine less

119
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,800
than 55 lb 16,500 turkeys 37,000

120
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,000
chickens 3,000 sheep 150 horses so by

121
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,520
the the EPA standard that would be what

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,520
we're um where we're

123
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,560
uh what what would what they would

124
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,160
considered to be a small

125
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,440
farm I like to maybe talk about what

126
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,759
I'll call small farm distinctives for

127
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,560
just a little bit generally smaller

128
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,400
Farms are going to have less animals

129
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,560
fewer animals and because of that

130
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,000
they're going to have less waste to

131
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,440
handle okay um they might have some

132
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,560
other problems related to having that

133
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,600
waste but they're going to have less

134
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,039
waste to handle they're not going to

135
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,360
have the volume that or the amount that

136
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,360
other Farms

137
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,400
have quite often they don't have a

138
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,479
suitable storage structure I know that

139
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,960
most small farms that I go on in my

140
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:00,360
state they probably they may have a

141
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,120
designated area for manure

142
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,600
it all goes here it all goes in the

143
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,160
woods um but quite often they don't have

144
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,000
any kind of a designated structure

145
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,479
unless they've gotten generally in some

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,639
sort of government program that helps

147
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,479
them get a

148
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,479
structure um they probably have less

149
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,880
land available for

150
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,800
grazing um they probably have less land

151
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,000
available for

152
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,280
spreading in in fact when it comes to

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,599
most horse farms uh they don't want to

154
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,280
spread it anyway they want to get rid of

155
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,919
it if they can they just assume haul it

156
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,840
offside um and generally operators have

157
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:36,759
less experience in Waste

158
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,240
Management closer to neighbors

159
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:42,160
probably they're they're often located

160
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,560
in some small uh um small regions or a

161
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,360
local that where they may be totally

162
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,800
surrounded by an urban area so they

163
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,160
might have more neighbor concerns than

164
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,880
someone else is going to

165
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,120
have they probably have a limited budget

166
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,039
budget for manure handling and

167
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,560
storage however in some areas you know

168
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,759
some Farmers tend to be more affl and

169
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,879
would have would have income or dollars

170
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,759
for that

171
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,479
that they might have the option of

172
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,400
disposing the offside now this is

173
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:10,280
something that larger Farms probably

174
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,080
don't have such an option for they might

175
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,919
but a lot of small farms would if they

176
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,800
can they'd like to haul it off site

177
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,440
unfortunately sometimes offsite means in

178
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,319
a

179
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,840
dumpster uh that gets hauled to the

180
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,759
landfill sometimes it might mean just

181
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:28,680
stored off in the woods somewhere

182
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:30,199
um composting might be an option in fact

183
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,039
a lot of small farm you'll ask you'll

184
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,520
ask they compost and they say oh yeah I

185
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,080
compost but I think generally there's

186
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,240
not a lot of understanding what compost

187
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,520
means it might to some people it might

188
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,199
mean that I keep it in a pile for a year

189
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,759
and after it rots I try to get somebody

190
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,800
to come and pick it up so that wouldn't

191
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,800
really be

192
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,199
composting uh less aware of manure

193
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,840
management bmps probably so um I put a

194
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,759
um a question mark there because I think

195
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:01,479
often times uh newer or beginning

196
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,199
farmers are more open open to uh Waste

197
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,639
Management ideas than maybe some more

198
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,440
established farmers are they're new they

199
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,759
want to learn and and they might be more

200
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,080
um you know more interested in and more

201
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,919
willing to make some

202
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,319
changes well let's go back to this that

203
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,919
uh that uh I'm sure we've all seen this

204
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,000
diagram many times um or or similar

205
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,520
diagrams that we've got uh nutrients

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,120
coming onto a farm we've got nutrients

207
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,560
that are exiting the farm we we've got

208
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:32,159
um nutrients that are causing balances

209
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,120
or imbalances in the in the soil now I

210
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,919
think

211
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,440
it's I think actually getting Farmers to

212
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,880
address if they're a small farm with not

213
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,599
a lot of acreage getting them to uh

214
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,480
accept the idea of actually spreading

215
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,880
and managing and nutrient management

216
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,640
plans on farms it's probably going to be

217
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,360
kind of difficult um but I think we can

218
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,360
focus on things like imbalances ways

219
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,360
they can uh they can get around that

220
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,000
that

221
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,399
concern and of course manur storages are

222
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,240
one of the ways we can do that

223
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,959
now the these are some guidelines we use

224
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,160
on small farms in our state in fact we

225
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,440
use these guidelines for all farms in

226
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,800
New Jersey but most of our Farms are on

227
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,240
the smaller side anyway

228
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,839
um so and this is the basic of our

229
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,120
nutrient management requirements within

230
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,920
the state but I think they're a good set

231
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,040
of guidelines uh our first point is we

232
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,120
we always encourage our producers to

233
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,680
store their manure in a dry level

234
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,560
impermeable

235
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,959
location or as impermeable as possible

236
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,519
free from Storm water runoff location

237
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,880
should be at least 100 ft from Waters or

238
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,040
Wetlands that comes right off of our

239
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,959
state regulations so I I think that's a

240
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,519
good thing we can we can look at on

241
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,959
small farms if they don't have good

242
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,800
storages now we can encourage them to um

243
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,680
at least consider how they're storing

244
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,519
their

245
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,600
manure secondly each Farm should have a

246
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,640
plan for managing manure spreading and

247
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,279
Disposal now

248
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,399
disposal if disposal is an option then

249
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,720
uh then then I think Farmers small farms

250
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:06,040
should be uh should be encouraged to do

251
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,240
that we have a number of uh centralized

252
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,920
uh small centralized composting areas in

253
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,440
our state which pick up mostly horse

254
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,360
horse manur but they they get manure

255
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,480
from other sources as well but it's all

256
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,480
small farm manur they compost it and

257
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,480
then they Market it as

258
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,839
mulch managing storm water so so your

259
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:31,600
the water stays out of uh uh out of your

260
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,560
manur pad out of your manur storage um

261
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,000
might require the use of some buffers or

262
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,519
some vegetative filters and I'll show

263
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,160
you some slides in a couple moments of

264
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:42,040
that um controlling animal access to

265
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,560
streams and waterways again that's right

266
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,120
uh right out of our state regulations um

267
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,040
and again does sometimes animals have to

268
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,959
have access to waterways if they if they

269
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,200
or or or streams if that's their only

270
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:57,200
source of water uh consumption so um but

271
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,920
that include fencing maybe some uh

272
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,600
stream Crossings control farmer oan and

273
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,760
finally being aware of those neighbor

274
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,880
concerns

275
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,639
um we asked a survey of horse Farmers

276
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,920
how many of you how many of them dispose

277
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:16,720
of manura off Farm over 40% of them diso

278
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,720
uh uh dispose of manura off the

279
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,639
farm I mentioned you a centralized

280
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,959
composter this is a guy that does that

281
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,560
he comes he's in the northern part of

282
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,120
the state he comes and he does a variety

283
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,160
of things he'll do a he'll do a if you

284
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,920
got manur stacked up for 10 years he'll

285
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,000
come and he'll he'll haul it off and

286
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,480
he'll compost it and he has regular

287
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,720
contracts with certain Farmers where

288
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,160
he'll leave a dumpster at the farm a

289
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,320
roll off and he'll pick it up on a

290
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,680
regular

291
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,360
basis Min

292
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,079
storage now again sometimes smaller

293
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,399
Farms don't have a lot of dollars they

294
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:54,680
may not be able to put up a a a storage

295
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:58,120
that has a roof on it or proper proper

296
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,000
storage for solid manure so um what this

297
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,360
Farmer's done is he's got he's put down

298
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,560
a mostly a gravel pad which is a three

299
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,399
sides on

300
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,600
it it's a relatively impermeable base or

301
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,680
we hope that it

302
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,680
is it's um 100t from Waters or

303
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,880
wetlands and it's um got a vegetative

304
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,600
filter on the back side of it so I think

305
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,320
that's a good recommendation for a small

306
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,519
farm they don't have to put up an

307
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,639
elaborate uh concrete pad um they can

308
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,279
put up a relatively simple structure

309
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,040
like this that allows them to store

310
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,079
their manure

311
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,399
want them to keep water out of uh uh

312
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,040
their animals out of water there's a

313
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,399
there's a dry lot just to the right

314
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,600
there which was a you know a muddy mess

315
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,760
so they shouldn't have been storing

316
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,240
their manure um the way they were um

317
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:49,720
right by that stream which is in a

318
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:53,600
sensitive Watershed anyway um this is a

319
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,959
a farm that had several hundred horses

320
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,480
um he thought he had a good system there

321
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,959
you know had Woods on the one side Woods

322
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,120
on the other a graveyard on the other

323
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,160
side

324
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,600
and uh and that's what his storage

325
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,720
looked like it was a mess now he's

326
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,040
changed that subsequently made some

327
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,279
changes but had water way on the side

328
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,360
there so I guess if you're talking The

329
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,639
Good the Bad and the Ugly this is

330
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,639
probably the

331
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,720
ugly um this is a a farm we assisted a

332
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:21,399
few years ago they had previously stored

333
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,600
all their all their

334
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:27,680
manure um on on one on one field right

335
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,199
along a ditch which ended ended up going

336
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,519
into a string so we came in we helped

337
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:34,600
them put up this this small composting

338
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,639
uh uh pad that you see which uh

339
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,399
certainly took away some of their

340
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,720
concerns this is actually on our campus

341
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,480
uh for our horse farm you know we've I

342
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,199
like want to point out that nice Vegeta

343
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,560
buffer on the on the downward side of

344
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,600
the of the storage so again the storage

345
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,560
doesn't needs to be adequate in size to

346
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,000
meet your needs we've got a 35 well foot

347
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,160
well vegetated buffer uh to uptake

348
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,120
nutrients that come out of that storage

349
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,680
so I'm not for small farms I'm not a big

350
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,399
proponent of of roofs on stor small

351
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,160
storages maybe in certain environments

352
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,079
rainfall Etc you you you have to

353
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,040
consider that but I think there's other

354
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,959
things that can be uh considered that

355
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,120
are more cost- effective Okay order to

356
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:19,040
store and spread again you have to make

357
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:22,600
um proper investigations of your area um

358
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,279
streams Lakes aquifers slopes for

359
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,399
spreading

360
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:28,040
neighbors now here's something that that

361
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,160
that I will generally tell people that

362
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
on a small farm if you're spreading man

363
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,320
on a small farm I don't think it really

364
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,759
does you any good to take a lot of

365
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,199
manure samples for your spreading

366
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,639
particular if you're spreading every day

367
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:40,920
um you might you might spread over the

368
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:43,040
you might take samples over the course

369
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,639
of a year and come up with a baseline

370
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,560
but in general I think using book values

371
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,360
is probably about as good as you're

372
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:54,720
going to get uh for an accurate uh

373
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:59,839
estimate um on a smaller

374
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,079
Farm okay here's a a spreader

375
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,320
that's a spreader for you milk Creek

376
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:08,759
spreader being pulled by a uh um by a an

377
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,759
ATV

378
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,320
vehicle and there are plenty of these

379
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,079
mil Creek spreaders available at least

380
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,000
in our area farmers who who use

381
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:21,279
these I think we should always be

382
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,399
encouraging Farmers kind of regardless

383
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,639
of their size to develop a farm map

384
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,000
think they ought have an idea what's

385
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,920
what and what's where on their Farm they

386
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,720
need to know where the water's at um

387
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,519
they need to know where the slopes are

388
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,040
and based on that they need to they need

389
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,160
to be able to make some uh adjustments

390
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,160
and some um plans about where they're

391
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,440
going to spread and where they're not

392
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,720
going to spread now if they don't have a

393
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,120
a map such as this which they can

394
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,959
probably get for the local Soil

395
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,160
Conservation District or nrcs or you

396
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,560
know Google Maps for that matter um

397
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,560
there's number of sources they can get

398
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,600
decent maps from they can draw their own

399
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,920
um that's but but they need to some idea

400
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,560
where their manur is um going and how

401
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,079
they're managing their

402
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:09,240
Farm sacrifice areas now I mentioned I'm

403
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,279
a pretty big proponent of storages I'm

404
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,759
also a big supporter of sacrifice areas

405
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,160
if you can now what's sacrifice are is

406
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,639
that where I'm going to kill my sheep no

407
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,040
that's not um some people might call it

408
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,519
an exercise lot or a rest lot or a dry

409
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,199
lot um it's an area where our animals

410
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,759
can kind of congregate we can feed them

411
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:27,759
in that spot we can water them in that

412
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,399
spot they could have some shelter in

413
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,639
that area they it could be a

414
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,920
semi-confined area which would probably

415
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:36,399
let them have some some access to

416
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,959
pastures and and grazing areas that are

417
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,000
outside of that

418
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:42,639
lot um sometimes we would include what

419
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,160
we call a heavy use pad around the

420
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,880
waterers especially um which is we've

421
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,120
excavated some of the dirt around it we

422
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,519
put in some kind of a geotextile pad and

423
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,360
then maybe a couple of different layers

424
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:59,880
of stone to uh eliminate the mud that

425
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,880
would be around the watering area um

426
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:07,439
to use a sacrifice area on your farm and

427
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,520
um about half of our producers uh uh

428
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,079
said that they did of some kind this is

429
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,679
horse producers

430
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:18,600
again and here's a not a real good uh

431
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:21,120
thing to to kind of uh not a good kind

432
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,679
of a sacrifice area to have just one

433
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,799
great big lot where they graze and they

434
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,120
feed and they water the same place

435
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,280
here's kind of the idea and I got this

436
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,760
out of a of a publication from I think

437
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,200
it was University of Kentucky kind of a

438
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,200
you know you got your dry dry lot area

439
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,400
and then um where your animals are and

440
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,520
then you have fences out to your

441
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,320
rotational pastures I think we we did a

442
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,280
survey recently looking at nutrient

443
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,480
management practices on horse farms

444
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,919
especially looking at feed management I

445
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,760
think the things we one of the things I

446
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,440
came out of it with is that sacrifice

447
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,360
areas and rotational grazing if you can

448
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,559
get Farmers horse producers to do those

449
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,320
things that's good I mean those are

450
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,159
those are good management practices that

451
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,400
uh hopefully they'll follow again of

452
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:04,840
course good uh well-managed pastures are

453
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,600
always going to take up more nutrients

454
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,600
than uh poorly poorly managed passengers

455
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,960
and of course you get that whole

456
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,760
recycling thing going um with your

457
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,320
horses or with animals in general poorly

458
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,360
vegetated passengers are not going to

459
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,280
take up as many

460
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,280
nutrients um erosion I

461
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,799
mentioned

462
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,320
so when when that's a possibility stream

463
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,880
Crossings are are are possible nrcs can

464
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,760
help design these and maybe help fund

465
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,120
them too okay again I went through those

466
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,320
those kind of six areas storage disposal

467
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:44,280
and spreading storm water management um

468
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,120
access to streams and waterways erosion

469
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,400
neighbors and finally just kind of

470
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,320
putting it all together small farms can

471
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,919
have some unique challenges because of

472
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,799
um their size both acreage and animal

473
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,080
numbers there's not enough land for

474
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,480
spreading there's probably a lack of

475
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,640
understanding of nutrient management

476
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:08,919
requirements lack of familiarity with

477
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,799
bmps it may be located uh in in or near

478
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:13,080
populated areas those those neighbors

479
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,960
those urbanized neighbors that might

480
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,200
surround us they probably don't many of

481
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,320
them don't have a good understanding of

482
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,440
what we do and why we do it um they may

483
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,919
be able to dispose of waste offsite

484
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,440
which is which is positive provid it's

485
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,760
not going to

486
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,799
landfill um and beginning on New farmers

487
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,600
May willingly make changes again I think

488
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,240
that that's a

489
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,000
possibility um small farmers small

490
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,200
farmers don't always fit existing models

491
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,720
that might work for a larger farm for

492
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,799
manure management so patience is

493
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,240
required and if you want to see a nice

494
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,679
fact sheet on on nutrient management go

495
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,520
to the E extension website and you'll

496
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,720
find a fact sheet there by a guy named

497
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,280
Randall Randall James I think it is he's

498
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:00,400
done a nice little program for how you

499
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:02,520
manage a manur on a small Farm Ando and

500
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,640
opposed to looking at it as just so many

501
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,799
pounds

502
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:10,720
produced per given time period he does

503
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:13,440
it by by time okay my cows produce so

504
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,320
many so many so much manure for for two

505
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,120
months so two months storage goes here

506
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,799
two month storage goes here so it's a

507
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:23,039
take a look at it it's

508
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,039
helpful any questions
