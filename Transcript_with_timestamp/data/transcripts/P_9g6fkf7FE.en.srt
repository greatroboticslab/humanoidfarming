1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,240
how do we feed 7 billion

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,600
people what about 9

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,800
billion how about

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,639
14 is there any way that we could do

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,000
this

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,700
sustainably what would truly sustainable

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,680
agriculture look

00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,160
[Music]

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,640
like imagine that this Urban Greenhouse

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,720
is your local supermarket when you look

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,320
inside rather than seeing rows of a

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,240
single crop you find a food producing

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,519
ecosystem with fish swimming through

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,719
channels and mush rooms growing

15
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,280
underneath fruit

16
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,840
trees this is polydome our vision for

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,640
how agriculture could be made more

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,680
productive socially Equitable and truly

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,520
sustainable at accept integrated

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,000
sustainability it is our company Mission

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,480
to create the foundations for a

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,079
sustainable future agriculture is one of

23
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,760
our key priority areas today's

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,280
agroindustrial food production is

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,879
focused on single product systems these

26
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,000
monocultures generate far-reaching

27
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,079
problems their structural need for

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,879
complex logistical chain siphons money

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,040
away from food producers and alienates

30
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:05,720
consumers from the source of their food

31
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,600
monocultures also concentrate and

32
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,080
separate material flows that would

33
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,560
normally cycle between multiple

34
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,759
ecosystem elements a team of us at

35
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,360
accept came together to develop a smart

36
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:17,479
polyculture based solution that would

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,280
address all of these problems with

38
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:22,079
support from Dutch partner organizations

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,439
Innovation Network and SN we set off on

40
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,240
a year-long research trajectory we

41
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,280
visited Farms interviewed experts and

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,200
developed databases on over 400

43
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,880
agricultural products with this

44
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,920
knowledge we created a process for

45
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,079
Designing highly productive Greenhouse

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,479
ecosystems we co-located crops and

47
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,600
animals based on their resource

48
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,600
preferences we layered hydroponic

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,560
production with soil-based crops we

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
envisioned internal Logistics systems to

51
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,479
simplify Harvest and processing and we

52
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,640
beneficially coupled material flows

53
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,680
between products polydome can produce

54
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,280
high value Niche products for local sale

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,759
rather than growing a single product for

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,159
low margin export this can improve the

57
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,399
livelihoods of workers farmers and local

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,039
consumers polydom inre Ines food

59
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,680
security and access while improving the

60
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,640
business case for urban

61
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
agriculture we published the results of

62
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,879
our work in a free open-source research

63
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,200
document for anyone to use we want

64
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,720
polydome to become a reality and are now

65
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,239
developing Partnerships to build the

66
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,200
first pilot do you share our vision of a

67
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,560
diverse distributed agricultural system

68
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:25,720
that reconnects people with nature come
