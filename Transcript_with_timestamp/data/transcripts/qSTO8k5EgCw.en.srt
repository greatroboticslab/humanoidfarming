1
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,540
you

2
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,600
your crawler tractor is an important

3
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,950
piece of equipment used in heavy

4
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,490
construction and road maintenance

5
00:00:52,950 --> 00:01:00,300
activities you as the operator can

6
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:02,790
minimize downtime and repairs each

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,460
agency has its own specific maintenance

8
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,260
checks it is your responsibility to

9
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,070
ensure that they are followed on your

10
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,020
machine this videotape will show you the

11
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,000
general methods and procedures for

12
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,150
operator daily maintenance on crawler

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,300
tractors but more important it tells you

14
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,130
why these procedures are necessary each

15
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,320
agency has their own specific

16
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,180
maintenance activities and each

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,970
equipment manufacturer as its

18
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,100
recommended procedures it is your

19
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,780
responsibility that none of the special

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,050
requirements for your machine are

21
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,330
overlooked follow along as our operator

22
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:42,690
goes through the complete set of daily

23
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,520
maintenance activities by using a

24
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,590
checkoff list you can divide your

25
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,450
inspections into four groups of

26
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:54,200
activities the pre-start check the

27
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,200
warm-up check

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:02,770
but daily operating check

29
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:04,689
and the shutdown check if during these

30
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,969
activities problems are discovered

31
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:10,390
follow your local guidelines to

32
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:12,580
determine corrective procedures now we

33
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,340
can look at these activities in detail

34
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:18,129
the first activity is the pre-start

35
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,440
check the pre-start check is a

36
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:23,260
walk-around inspection for damaged or

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,450
worn parts and fluid leaks it also

38
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,879
includes checking the tractors fluid

39
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,569
levels and the engine's air filter

40
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:35,470
system daily attention needs to be given

41
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:38,290
to the tracks gradually through use the

42
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,709
tracks will become worn check the

43
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,549
sprocket teeth as they are worn down the

44
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:47,620
seat between them will become oblong

45
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:50,440
next inspect the pins and bushings at

46
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,870
various points along the chain where

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:57,400
hear causes the bushing to become flat

48
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:59,230
on one side finally check the rollers by

49
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,019
passing your hand across their wear

50
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,350
surface this surface should feel flat

51
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:08,049
and smooth all these points are

52
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,260
important ask your supervisor for your

53
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:12,850
tractors wear specifications timely

54
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,370
maintenance of these components will

55
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:20,590
extend their service life and postpone

56
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:22,540
costly repairs now that the tracks have

57
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,540
been inspected you can move to the

58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:30,459
crawler tractor attachments inspect the

59
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:34,630
dozer blade the push frame the pins the

60
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:36,910
cutting edges and the end bits if the

61
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,160
cutting edge and end bits are worn to

62
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:42,130
the dozer blade report it to your

63
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,680
supervisor make sure there are no loose

64
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,049
nuts or bolts and as part of this

65
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,319
inspection you should also look for weld

66
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:54,790
defects here again timely maintenance

67
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,829
can save costly repairs if your koala

68
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,829
tracker is equipped with a ripper it

69
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:00,099
should be inspected in the same way

70
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:02,169
again

71
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,630
pay close attention to wear of the

72
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:08,160
ripper teeth if a replacement is needed

73
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,160
follow your local guidelines

74
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,010
you can continue the free start check by

75
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,870
looking for any fluid leaks fluid leaks

76
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,050
will affect the safe and efficient

77
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,970
operation of your tractor first look on

78
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:24,870
the ground under the engine compartment

79
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:28,710
for spots or stains any spots here alert

80
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,680
you to engine fluid leaks now inspect

81
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,230
for hydraulic oil leaks the hoses should

82
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,930
be checked for cracks make sure they are

83
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,060
not pinched leaks from the blade angle

84
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,200
and lift cylinders are most likely found

85
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,200
at the cylinder seals

86
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,200
finally as you move toward the engine

87
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,270
compartment you can finish this

88
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,960
inspection by checking the lift cylinder

89
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:02,090
hose connections in the engine

90
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,360
compartment leaks may occur at the

91
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:08,540
filter bowl seals inspect all filters

92
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,700
for leakage fill the bottom of the oil

93
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,560
and fuel filter bowls to see if there is

94
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:18,740
any fluid running down the side of the

95
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:21,200
bowls although they are not subject to

96
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,780
leaks the fan belts are part of the

97
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,870
cooling system and can at this time be

98
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,940
checked for wear and tautness the proper

99
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:32,710
operation of the fan will help control

100
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,710
the temperature of the engine coolant

101
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,630
now that we have inspected the crawler

102
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,220
tractor for leaks we must see if the

103
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,010
fluids are out the correct operating

104
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,680
levels begin with the engine coolant

105
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,780
level make sure that the fluid in the

106
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,240
radiator is at the level required for

107
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,540
your particular machine as specified by

108
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,660
your supervisor add more coolant if

109
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,340
needed it is a good practice not to

110
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,680
perform this check if the engine has

111
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,990
recently been operated since the coolant

112
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,270
might still be under pressure this

113
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:10,700
pressure if released by removing the cap

114
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:12,950
could cause serious injury to you in the

115
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,470
engine compartment check the engine oil

116
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:18,230
level the oil must be at the proper

117
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,600
level on the dipstick if the oil is

118
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,490
below the indicator mark do not run the

119
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:27,320
engine until the proper type and amount

120
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:28,870
of oil is added this completes the fluid

121
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,430
level checks in the engine compartment

122
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:35,240
now check the fluid level in the

123
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:37,820
hydraulic oil tank a dipstick for sight

124
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,790
gauge is provided for this purpose in

125
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,890
our case it is a sight gauge the

126
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,290
hydraulic system runs the dozer and

127
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:48,080
Ripper attachments as well as your

128
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,210
steering clutches if needed and the

129
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,960
proper type of hydraulic fluid to the

130
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,960
full mark

131
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:59,749
next you will need to drain condensation

132
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:01,789
and sediment from the fuel tank to do

133
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:04,929
this a drain is provided at the

134
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,929
bottom of the fuel tank

135
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,790
open the drain until all condensation

136
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,160
and sediment have been removed never

137
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:19,720
perform this operation while smoking or

138
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,720
with an open flame in the area

139
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,940
after the fluence system has been

140
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:32,050
inspected move on to the engine's air

141
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,599
filter system begin with an inspection

142
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,690
of the pre cleaner this tractor is

143
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:39,970
equipped with a free cleaner screen if

144
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:44,740
dust or other material have accumulated

145
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:47,620
on the screen clean it to clean the pre

146
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,479
cleaner first take it off with a stiff

147
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,139
brush remove any build-up from the

148
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,330
screen

149
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:55,680
don't hit the pre cleaner against a hard

150
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:58,090
surface this could cause serious damage

151
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,009
daily cleaning of the pre cleaner will

152
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:04,900
greatly reduce the clogging of the air

153
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:07,240
cleaner elements your equipment may have

154
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,090
a device that indicates when to clean or

155
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,550
replace the air cleaner element when the

156
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:15,370
indicator shows red the operator should

157
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,680
replace the air cleaner element if no

158
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,830
new elements are available notify your

159
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,659
supervisor in the interim the operator

160
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:27,639
should clean the old element in the

161
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:32,589
following manner to clean a dirty

162
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:34,779
element remove it if compressed air is

163
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:37,390
available clean the element by blowing

164
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:40,510
from the center outward while directing

165
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:42,190
the air up and down the pleats the

166
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,100
element can be checked to see if it is

167
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,380
clean by placing a light bulb inside and

168
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:51,600
viewing the penetration of light through

169
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:54,279
the pleated paper of the element if

170
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,140
compressed air is not available then

171
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:57,399
clean the element by tapping it with the

172
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,070
palm of your hand

173
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:04,899
do not pound it on a hard surface it

174
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:07,930
could damage the filter when the element

175
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:10,540
is clean reinstall it making sure that

176
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,310
the housing is correctly sealed this

177
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:16,779
will ensure proper air filtration

178
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:18,760
through the system never operate the

179
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:23,399
engine without the element in place as

180
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,399
this can cause extensive engine damage

181
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:33,559
now will be a good time to inspect the

182
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:35,829
battery make sure the battery is

183
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:38,239
securely fastened down

184
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:40,759
you should also inspect the battery

185
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:48,259
cables clamps and connections for

186
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:50,209
tightness and corrosion remove the

187
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:53,899
battery filler caps and check the fluid

188
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:55,879
levels if needed fill each cell to just

189
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:59,019
above the top of the battery plates and

190
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:02,149
separators with clean distilled water

191
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:04,129
never fill the cell to the top or allow

192
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:08,689
the fluid to drop below the top of the

193
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:10,549
battery plate and separators follow your

194
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:13,519
local guidelines when working with

195
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:16,669
batteries a word of caution all

196
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,529
batteries give off explosive gas there

197
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:23,600
should be no open flame or smoking

198
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:26,299
permitted around the battery now for

199
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,919
your last pre start check your crawler

200
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:30,019
tractor should have a meter that

201
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:33,559
registers the number of hours of engine

202
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:35,359
operation record the hours registered to

203
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,879
determine when you need to notify your

204
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:41,059
supervisor that periodic maintenance on

205
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:43,519
your crawler tractor is needed before we

206
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:45,949
go on to the next set of checks this is

207
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,169
a good time to stop the video and review

208
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:50,169
the inspection steps up to this point

209
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,770
in the last segment we finished the

210
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,510
pre-start check now you can move on to

211
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:10,270
the second activity which is the

212
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,460
equipment warm-up check the equipment

213
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,320
warm-up check helps you determine if the

214
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:18,040
crawler tractor is operating properly

215
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,590
before you leave the parking area before

216
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,340
starting the engine be sure all persons

217
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:27,330
are clear of the tractor all control

218
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:31,330
levers are in the neutral position and

219
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:37,270
that all attachments are grounded now

220
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:39,340
start the engine let the engine warm up

221
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:42,070
for five to ten minutes even in hot

222
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:44,230
weather this allows the oil pressure to

223
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:47,020
build up and lubricate all the moving

224
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,850
parts of the engine it also allows the

225
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:54,310
cooling system to reach operating

226
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:56,350
temperatures listen to your engine if

227
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,760
you hear anything unusual shut the

228
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:02,530
equipment down and call your supervisor

229
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,050
the panel gauges give information about

230
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:06,880
the engine performance we can look at

231
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,500
these gauges individually to make sure

232
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,740
they are operating in their normal

233
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:16,810
ranges does the app meter read on the

234
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:21,760
positive side are the oil and hydraulic

235
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:23,440
pressures in the safe zone if equipped

236
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:29,380
with a fuel gauge is the gauge

237
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:31,090
functioning is the fuel tank full is the

238
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,590
engine temperature gauge reading in the

239
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:37,330
safe zone is the transmission pressure

240
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,840
or temperature gauge in the safe zone

241
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,840
also

242
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,410
before we can continue you must first

243
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,110
lift the attachments from the rest

244
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:52,620
position while we do this we can also

245
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:55,560
observe their operation raise the dozer

246
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,470
blade up from its rest position tilt it

247
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:03,240
forward and by does it extend and

248
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:05,519
retract fully and smoothly if your

249
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:10,259
tractor has a ripper attachment raise

250
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:12,360
and lower it also for the final warm-up

251
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:17,149
check you need to put the tractor in

252
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,149
motion first release the parking brake

253
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,310
now apply the brakes the brake bands

254
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:29,000
should provide good stopping ability in

255
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,000
both directions

256
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,430
as part of the steering system you

257
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,470
should test the steering clutches do

258
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,810
they engage and release smoothly in

259
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:44,380
response to your controls as you move

260
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:46,090
the tractor from side to side all these

261
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,880
checks are critical for safe and

262
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:50,620
efficient equipment operation do not

263
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,080
begin working until the list has been

264
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:56,920
completed and all the checks have proven

265
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,350
satisfactory the third operator

266
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,690
maintenance activity the daily operating

267
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:05,110
check is carried out while the tractor

268
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,460
is working during daily operations you

269
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,030
should monitor your equipments

270
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:14,830
performance specifically listen for

271
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:16,960
unusual noises and read your gauges be

272
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:21,160
aware of any changes in the performance

273
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:24,790
of your equipment we can look at these

274
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,970
individually listen for unusual engine

275
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:32,650
and equipment noises noises can be an

276
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:35,140
indication if component failure read

277
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:37,870
your gauges watch pressures and

278
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,390
temperatures closely if any gauge reads

279
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,450
in the danger zone shut down the tractor

280
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:46,840
inspect the system and notify your

281
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:49,300
supervisor as part of the daily

282
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,220
operations you should monitor equipment

283
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,220
performance in particular track

284
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,920
adjustment improperly adjusted tracks

285
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,860
cost money in downtime and accelerated

286
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,800
track wear tracks that are too loose

287
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,290
whip at high speeds causing needless

288
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,530
we're on track roller flanges track

289
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,930
chain links and sprocket teeth tracks

290
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:13,660
that are too tight with extra stress on

291
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,950
undercarriage drivetrain components and

292
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,950
wastes horsepower

293
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:24,250
the fourth and last daily maintenance

294
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:26,380
activity is your shutdown check this

295
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,470
activity helps prepare your tractor for

296
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:32,950
the following workday find a level area

297
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:36,340
to park your crawler tractor rest all

298
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:37,730
attachments on the ground and set the

299
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,670
parking brake

300
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,440
this secures your equipment and prevents

301
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:46,730
injury to anyone tampering with the

302
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:48,649
machine while it is parked now let the

303
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,889
engine idle for approximately five

304
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:53,930
minutes before shutting down this

305
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:56,899
reduces the pressures in your hydraulic

306
00:15:53,930 --> 00:16:01,339
system that can cause leaks or damages

307
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:04,010
to the seals or hoses before you leave

308
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:05,810
the tractor cab record the our meter

309
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,420
reading against the time recorded at

310
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,220
startup this is a check to see if the

311
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,110
meter is working and will help in

312
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:17,209
scheduling the equipment's periodic

313
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:20,060
maintenance now is a good time to fill

314
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:22,730
your fuel tank filling your fuel tank is

315
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:26,120
a good maintenance practice it minimizes

316
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:28,730
water condensation when refuelling be

317
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,649
sure all equipment is clean this

318
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,680
prevents any contaminants from entering

319
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:35,959
the fuel tank since these are flammable

320
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,639
liquids do not smoke or have an open

321
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:43,600
flame in the area part of your

322
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,980
responsibility also includes lubrication

323
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,170
lubrication extends the operating life

324
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,269
of your crawler tractor follow the

325
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:54,470
manufacturer's guidelines for the proper

326
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:56,420
lubrication of your tractor one way to

327
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,910
make it easier for you to identify the

328
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:05,870
daily lubrication points is to have the

329
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:08,059
marked finally using a hand tool clean

330
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:15,380
away dirt or material that has built up

331
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:18,230
on tracks whish frame dozer blade and

332
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,970
the rest of the equipment that completes

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,799
the detailed description of the four

334
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:25,220
major daily operator maintenance

335
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:30,290
activities now we will review each group

336
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:33,230
of activities once more the first

337
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,510
activity is the pre-start check this is

338
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:39,100
a walk-around inspection for damaged or

339
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:41,330
worn parts leaks fluid level checks and

340
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,750
inspection of the engines air filter

341
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:49,159
system look for damaged or worn parts

342
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:51,260
such as the attachments and tracks it

343
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:53,929
also includes checking for fluid leaks

344
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:59,390
of the hydraulic cooling and engine

345
00:17:53,929 --> 00:18:05,390
systems inspect all the fluid levels

346
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:09,580
such as oil coolant and hydraulics drain

347
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,580

engine is warming up listen for unusual

353
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:37,100
engine noises be sure to read the gauges

354
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:41,630
check the dozer and Ripper attachments

355
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:47,179
and test the steering and brakes before

356
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:50,000
beginning work the third activity is the

357
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:52,850
operating check the operating checks

358
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,850
during the workday include frequently

359
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:58,880
listening for unusual noises reading

360
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:02,480
