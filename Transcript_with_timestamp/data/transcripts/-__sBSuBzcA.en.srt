1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,839
right here ready to plant and we've got

2
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:17,800
a beautiful machine here that we're

3
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:21,080
hopefully going to figure out how to use

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,359
now uh first thing I guess is the

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,720
question why are we going to use machine

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,400
transplanting we could also do manual

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,800
planting so why are we doing this Lee

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,680
well trying to act in as a contemporary

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,600
way as possible and I think uh labor

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,840
supplies in Asia are declining uh

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,840
everywhere as as the whole continent

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:49,559
develops and systems to use less

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,320
Labor uh evolving as we speak and one

14
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,160
way of using less labor is still to

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,239
transplant because there's benefits in

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,000
transplanting but to do it mechanically

17
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,840
now this this sort of machine was

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,680
invented in in Japan how long ago 40

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,560
years ago probably 20 30 years ago at

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,320
least yeah it's been these kind of

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,560
things have been in use in Japan Korea

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,560
maybe China but what we're seeing in

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,920
recent years is that it's now moving on

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,240
to into other countries in India

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,960
southeast Asia and it's mainly because

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,280
of Labor shortage and it's actually a

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,159
business opportunity not just for the

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,960
company selling the machines but also

29
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:32,880
for small farmers who then become uh

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,360
small entrepreneurs to providing this as

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,920
a service as a planting service to other

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,720
farmers and even for seedling Growers

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,680
you because you need to have uh

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,600
seedlings grown in a in a precise manner

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,960
you can see this here if you can zoom in

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,920
I don't know if you guys can do this

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,119
yeah so you need these nice uh ceiling

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,680
mats here though you can see how uniform

39
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:57,240
the ceilings are and it's of course it

40
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,600
requires a special way of growing them

41
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,560
so that you can pull them off in this

42
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,039
muds and cut them into nice stps which

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,479
you can then feed into this machine yeah

44
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,439
and this is actually a new business yeah

45
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,280
even for women we see this in some

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,720
places in in Southern India I've seen it

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,599
so women becoming seedling Growers

48
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,640
selling the seedlings then to a machine

49
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:20,160
operator or service provider so what

50
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,360
we're basically trying to do this year

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,800
here is a labor saving cost efficient

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,519
precise crop establishment technology

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,760
that is as close as it gets and maybe

54
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,480
even better than manual transplanting

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,080
right but but wait a minute last year we

56
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,400
were talking about exactly the same

57
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,599
things and off we went up to just over

58
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,800
our knees in mud broadcasting so what's

59
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,400
changed why why why this sudden change

60
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,680
of heart well because I think uh we we

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,360
will get u a more precise crop

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,280
establishment with this as a safer

63
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,440
technology to start was under our

64
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,920
conditions here with that kind of heavy

65
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,040
and soft so and we may still try

66
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,400
something else the next Dr is more dry

67
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,400
direct

68
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,110
[Applause]

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,080
to see if you're a hand seating would

70
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,599
want G some f right that's right that's

71
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,080
right should have been using a carabell

72
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,720
drawn mechanical transplanter just give

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,720
us some more give us some more grain to

74
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:56,719
[Applause]

75
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
eat

76
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,280
yeah we're nearly finished and um by and

77
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,560
large I would say it works but it is

78
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,799
actually quite hard work uh to walk even

79
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,639
behind this machine because anytime you

80
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,560
hit a a deep uh muddy spot you have to

81
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,360
make sure that the wheels don't spin off

82
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,919
and we've had a number of uh patches

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,960
there with standing water where

84
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,479
basically it's so mdy that the ceedings

85
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,919
because they're so small disappear you

86
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:40,160
so but uh here is a place where uh looks

87
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,840
quite okay so you can

88
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:49,240
see pretty good spacing and ceilings uh

89
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:52,320
that hopefully uh will recover and go

90
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,479
quickly uh but uh it has taken us a

91
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,880
while and the Machine is uh the engine

92
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,039
died a couple of times on the way the

93
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,919
planting mechanism got stuck once in a

94
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:04,240
while so

95
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,960
it requires some skill I would say of

96
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,400
course um a trained operator a

97
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,759
professional would have done this much

98
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,560
faster and probably better than we did

99
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,560
but uh well we got it planted now let's

100
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,560
see how it goes

101
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,639
so
