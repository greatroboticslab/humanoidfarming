  "text": "[Music] so do you think your garden might need a little boost this spring one of the best ways to tell is to do a soil test a soil test will tell you what nutrients you may need in the garden and how much the spring is the best time to do a soil test before you add any fertilizer the tools you'll need will be a Trel a screwdriver or a similar tool a clean bucket and some and a bag to put the sample in a Ziploc bag would be fine or a paper bag sometimes the soil labs will provide you a container to use to collect a sample you'll take the trowel and put it into the ground to loosen the soil you'll then use the trowel to collect a thin slice of soil the goal is to have a narrow strip of soil down the center of the trowel so the screwdriver is a useful tool to help clean up the edges ideally you will sample to a depth of about 6 in and you'll put that in your bucket then you'll repeat that step about 10 times for your garden to get a good composite sample once you've collected your 10 samples from across the garden you will mix them thoroughly in the bucket and then you will collect about two cups of this soil into your sample bag the lab will provide you with a form to fill out which includes the type of soil analysis that you would like to have done and that what you'll be growing in your garden your local County Extension Office can help you choose a soil analysis lab and they can also help you interpret the results with University of Wyoming extension I'm Caitlyn youngquist and you're watching touching from the ground up [Music]",
