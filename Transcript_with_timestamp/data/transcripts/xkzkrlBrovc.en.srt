00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,770
hey we're at the home of one of our

2
00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:05,060
sprinkler warehouse customers today

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,100
we're making this instructional video

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,290
for you on how to install a sprinkler

5
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,150
system where every valve every sprinkler

6
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,950
head and the controller are supplied by

7
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,840
our good friends at Rain Bird sprinkler

8
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,580
warehouse doesn't do installs we just

9
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,110
sell apart i'm adrian sanchez your

10
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,500
sprinkler warehouse pro let's get

11
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,710
started

12
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,710
[Music]

13
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,880
the first task is to flag the location

14
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:31,100
of each sprinkler valve according to the

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,630
sprinkler system design using different

16
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:38,540
colored flags for each zone will help

17
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:40,220
simplify the installation marking spray

18
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,739
will show the exact location of where to

19
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,809
dig the trenches after turning off the

20
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:46,129
water supply dig up the main water line

21
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:48,019
near the water meter

22
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,699
the reason we're next to the water meter

23
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:52,129
is we want the most amount of volume and

24
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:54,470
water pressure to feed our sprinkler

25
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:56,379
system so here we are at where we've

26
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,699
split off our main line into our

27
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:01,070
irrigation line it is a one-inch pipe

28
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:02,570
with a ball valve now the ball valve is

29
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,010
there so we can turn off water to our

30
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,049
irrigation system while maintaining

31
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:08,270
water flow to the rest of the home we

32
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:09,950
also got this valve box that goes over

33
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,630
our ball valve and once we fill it in

34
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,990
with dirt and we need to work on it

35
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,580
later

36
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,750
we'll be able to loop the lid right here

37
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,040
and get in and turn off our water

38
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,200
without having to mess around with

39
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,760
digging it all out trenching is the most

40
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,950
time-consuming and physically demanding

41
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,090
part of this job do-it-yourselfers

42
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:31,640
you're gonna want to get several friends

43
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:33,500
to help you dig so there's a backflow

44
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,800
prevention device this is a pressure

45
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,600
vacuum breaker or a PV B now most cities

46
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,130
or water districts require some kind of

47
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,470
effective prevention device when you're

48
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,270
installing sprinkler systems because it

49
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,430
keeps contaminated water from flowing

50
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,950
back into your drinking water source so

51
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,030
whether use an anti siphon or pressure

52
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,040
vacuum breaker

53
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,050
we recommend some kind of backhoe

54
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,880
prevention all right so now that we've

55
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,740
installed our ball valve and our

56
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,240
mainline we can turn the water onto the

57
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,530
rest of the home as you can see the

58
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,720
roots on this property posed pretty

59
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,790
significant challenge so what we did is

60
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,090
removed one

61
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:09,460
the way of our valve wire make sure to

62
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,320
use schedule 40 PVC pipes between the

63
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:15,580
pointed connection and the inlet set of

64
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,590
valves alright this is a premium

65
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,140
manifold kit from sprinkler warehouse

66
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,630
attached to our valves here we're using

67
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,630
that in our in our irrigation system for

68
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:28,600
this home now for this as opposed to

69
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,820
hard piping it in this is much faster

70
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,130
and easier to replace and to install

71
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,590
take it in now you do move in the

72
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,180
premium kit right there but if you need

73
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,230
to replace the valves it's as easy as

74
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,070
this you dig it up

75
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:46,990
you unscrew it you pop out one valve

76
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:48,730
bring in another valve that is a lot

77
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,980
quicker than having to glue and to cut

78
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,660
this entire thing apart in back together

79
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,850
if you're trying to replace your valves

80
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,950
or even just installing them just screw

81
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,480
it on and you're good to go after the

82
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,459
valves because there's a lot less water

83
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,140
pressure it's safe to use class 200 pipe

84
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,900
to feed the sprinkler heads and that can

85
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,000
save you a little bit of money to run

86
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,550
the pipe under the driveway we recommend

87
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,230
using a water-powered boring kit that we

88
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,850
have a sprinkler warehouse what you do

89
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,519
is you put a high-pressure nozzle in the

90
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,500
end of your class 200 pipe and you

91
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,940
slowly push it in there and the water

92
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,590
pressure pushes the dirt all the way

93
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,150
creating a tunnel for the pipe to go

94
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,340
through and then just connect that to

95
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,959
the rest of your system so if you were

96
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,090
to have your sprinkler head attached to

97
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,430
an old-school nipple riser like this and

98
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,590
never get run over by a vehicle or a

99
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,470
really heavy riding lawnmower you would

100
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,660
probably break your nipple riser

101
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:41,530
possibly break your sprinkler head and

102
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:43,570
even worse break your PVC pipe this

103
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,670
swing joint right here completely

104
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,040
prevents that as it's flexible and it

105
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,420
can move at the joints and it also makes

106
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,980
it easier for adjusting the height of

107
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,060
your sprinkler head just in case the

108
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,580
grass clippings were to change the

109
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,870
height of the ground right there you

110
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,910
just dig it up put a little dirt

111
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:02,040
underneath it and swing it up a little

112
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,040
bit and adjust at the joints

113
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,209
here we are with our our wire this is

114
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,040
direct burial wire which means we do not

115
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,940
have to run a conduit in order to bury

116
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,150
this underground

117
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,010
we got three red wires right here for

118
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,690
our three valves right over there we

119
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,280
have some obstacles in addition to

120
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,700
everything else here in this yard and

121
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,530
I'm standing on this sidewalk right here

122
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,350
is actually a big obstacle for our wires

123
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,930
and our piping we've gone underneath it

124
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,720
right here with a conduit and some water

125
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,910
pipe as well and we're gonna run our red

126
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,760
wires and one common wire through this

127
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,889
one piece of PVC pipe to our valves and

128
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,750
all the way around to the backyard and

129
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:45,080
to our controller that's inside the

130
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,790
garage so this right here there's a

131
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,130
little coil now what this does is as it

132
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:54,770
adds a little bit of a extra protection

133
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:58,070
against power surges boom coil and you

134
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,750
do that to all of them in order to avoid

135
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,400
electrical shorts when connecting the

136
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,110
direct burial are to the valve wires

137
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,139
make sure to use waterproof silicone

138
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,639
filled wire connectors so you want to

139
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,770
overfill your trenches when you're

140
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,050
filling them back in otherwise when the

141
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,030
soil gets wet and begins to settle it'll

142
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,860
sink down a little bit you want to tamp

143
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,570
it down to get a nice and compact that

144
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,970
way you don't leave any signs of

145
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,919
trenches in your yard so facing the bed

146
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,900
a crush rock under your valves can help

147
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,690
with drainage and provide a nice solid

148
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,610
foundation in case anything heavy ever

149
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,840
rolls over on top of it so here I am at

150
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,389
the eave the house installing this rain

151
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,740
sensor we want this to be above where

152
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:35,210
the sprinklers are going to be spraying

153
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,289
because we obviously don't want water to

154
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,100
get into here otherwise it's going to

155
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:39,100
turn off her controller

156
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,900
now in order to protect your wires from

157
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,090
damage you don't want to run it through

158
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,620
some PVC conduit from where it comes out

159
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,259
of the ground all the way to your smart

160
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,939
control next we'll flush the cyst and

161
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:54,919
open the test on the backflow

162
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:56,750
device leave the air and make sure to

163
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,150
turn the water on very slowly at the

164
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,979
backflow preventer to avoid any pipeline

165
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,560
damage alright now we got all the wires

166
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:05,780
running to our controller we have our

167
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,250
rain sensor wire right here we're gonna

168
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,080
hook that up we got our common wire

169
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,060
we're gonna hook that up as well we're

170
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,379
gonna turn the power onto this thing and

171
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,590
then what we're gonna do is we're gonna

172
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:17,180
strip the red wires one by one and we're

173
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,460
gonna touch them to a powered terminal

174
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,650
what that's gonna do is gonna start to

175
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,810
isolate which wire goes to which zone

176
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,520
because we don't know which wire goes to

177
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,319
which zone at this point so if we turn

178
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,240
on terminal number one and start

179
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,190
touching a wire to it what was gonna

180
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,289
happen is it's gonna turn on one of the

181
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,060
zones in our yard so let's just say it

182
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:37,340
turns on zone number five then we know

183
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,009
that that wire goes to zone 5 so we'll

184
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,930
count 1 2 3 4 5 and we'll connect it to

185
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:44,060
zone 5 over here and we'll strip another

186
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,389
wire touch it to the power terminal and

187
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,069
go on down the line until we know which

188
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:51,990
wire goes to which zone and then we

189
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:53,590
connected to that corresponding zone

190
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,610
[Music]

191
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,710
Rainbird is applied all the sprinklers

192
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,259
for this install today we're using Rain

193
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:03,169
Bird variable arc rotary or our vans and

194
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:05,779
a chi or high-efficiency van spray

195
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:08,060
nozzles now they all come in a variety

196
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:10,069
of throw distances so here we got the

197
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:14,060
Rain Bird our van adjustable rotary

198
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:17,569
nozzle these are the our van 14s 18 and

199
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:20,270
24 those numbers indicate how far these

200
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:21,560
actual nozzles can throw water so the 24

201
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,360
is gonna shoot 24 feet

202
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,580
the ATS gonna shoot up to 18 feet and

203
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,620
the 14 up to 14 feet and you can adjust

204
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,490
it down if you only need to throw it a

205
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,490
little bit less than that

206
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,610
all right I just installed the H evant n

207
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,180
now that's a spray novel that shoots up

208
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,340
to ten feet and can cover an entire 360

209
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,930
degree plane but it's adjustable down to

210
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,220
the angle that you need we're in the

211
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,310
center of a flower bed here so we're

212
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:52,130
gonna go full 360 and it's not quite ten

213
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:56,630
feet wide so we're gonna do maybe about

214
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:58,699
six or seven foot on this alright so

215
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,990
here I am in front of two nozzles that

216
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:01,520
are right next to each other now why

217
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,050
would we need two nozzles right next to

218
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,389
each other we're gonna want to water our

219
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,520
flower bed every day except for the days

220
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:09,110
when the yard goes off when the yard is

221
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,240
being watered that's gonna cover the

222
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,590
flower bed as well and we're not gonna

223
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,270
need to have this one running so we're

224
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,039
gonna use our controller to program it

225
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,840
to make sure we get exactly the kind of

226
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:20,330
water we need so let's take a look at

227
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,699
this achieve an eight right here now H E

228
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,910
stands for high efficiency this one is

229
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,919
12 inches high that way we can go over

230
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,949
our flowers and cover our entire flower

231
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,310
beds and then over here we're gonna put

232
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:36,770
the arvan eighteen in and that is gonna

233
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,900
shoot at 18 feet cover both the flower

234
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:41,120
bed and the rest of the yard all the

235
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,610
grass and everything - lets get that on

236
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,290
here just unscrew stick that in there

237
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,550
there we go get that on there

238
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,100
and that's how that goes that's why you

239
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,170
have two of them right here alright so

240
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,880
now we're gonna adjust these sprinkler

241
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,200
heads they might not be pointed in the

242
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,720
right direction and they might be so

243
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,400
over spraying have a wide angle we're

244
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,010
gonna try to make that angle be just

245
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,770
right for this flowerbed so first we're

246
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,810
gonna adjust it this way the Rain Bird

247
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,640
our van and a chi band nozzle spray

248
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,310
patterns and distances are easily

249
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,170
adjusted by hand without tools the

250
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,240

251
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,029

252
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,250
misting or foggy and water usage is
