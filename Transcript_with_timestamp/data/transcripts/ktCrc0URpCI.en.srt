because P fing is not profitable it's

farming all right uh

43
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,200
now there's one thing that uh we all

44
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,960
need to understand in in business

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,840
generally business is about buying and

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,240
selling of product and buying and

47
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,240
selling of certain items in this case

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,479
selling pigs so depending on whatever

49
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,680
model you are doing

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,360
one thing that makes you to be in

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,200
business is that you have a product the

52
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,520
pigs and you are selling them to a

53
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,360
customer to your final consumer or

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,400
whatever you have there so now you have

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,640
product that you want to sell

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:22,080
out if you are able to sell at the right

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,599
price to the right customers then you

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,680
are in business and if you can continue

59
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,560
that for a while because the pig farming

60
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,280
business is not just for a day or for

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,800
just one set you're not just doing this

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,879
for maybe you just buy 10 PS and you

63
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,920
sell them and that's all obviously you

64
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,959
are continuing a process uh you can be

65
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,760
in pig family for 10 years for 20 years

66
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:48,800
so obviously you need to have a

67
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,159
continuous um sales of your product and

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,319
that brings me to the very first key the

69
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:56,480
very first tip for you to make more

70
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:59,959
money in P farming and that's number one

71
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,720
have a very good reputation have a very

72
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,080
good reputation you see it's an

73
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,080
emotional business you know business is

74
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,040
generally emotional and I believe you

75
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,879
have probably heard this saying that

76
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,440
people don't buy product people buy

77
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:18,040
state so uh some someone will decide to

78
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,720
buy from you because they like you

79
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,640
because they trust you because they

80
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,120
believe in you and they will not buy the

81
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,439
same thing the same price from someone

82
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,760
else so people buy States and if you

83
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,640
understand this uh log this psychology

84
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,560
to business then you understand that you

85
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,920
want to ensure that your customers have

86
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,599
the right uh interest as as the right

87
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,080
relationship with you so you want to

88
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,319
build great relationship with your

89
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,560
customers you want to ensure that you

90
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,080
are very honest you're very credible you

91
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,000
want to ensure your credibility is on

92
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,840
the highest side that you have great

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,040
reputation when it comes to dealing that

94
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,519
means number one for instance let's say

95
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,599
you are selling um breeders to Farmers

96
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,599
you want to ensure that you have

97
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,840
all if you say this breed is a t breed

98
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,640
it's a it's a t breed if you are calling

99
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,319
this breed a Duro it's a Duro you want

100
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,799
to have great credibility if you want to

101
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:16,079
say this pig is pregnant then this pig

102
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,320
is pregnant you know I heard of someone

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,519
a farmer that bought um pigs from

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,440
another farm and uh he was told that if

105
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,919
the pigs were pregnant but on getting to

106
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,199
the farm after 2 months the pigs are not

107
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,919
pregnant the P the pig was not pregnant

108
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,199
and in calling that farm back the farmer

109
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,440
is not picking picking up the call do

110
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,880
you see exactly that that farmer do you

111
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,800
think that farmer is going to get to

112
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,720
that farm to get any other thing or is

113
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,360
going to make any referral to that farm

114
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,039
no and that's already a very bad thing

115
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,560
for his business because nobody if if he

116
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,600
knows anybody going to that farm he will

117
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,280
caution the person that that guy is not

118
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,840
credible so you want to ensure you have

119
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,080
the best credibility when it comes to

120
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,039
any business and which include the Pak

121
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,160
farming business anything you are going

122
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,880
to if you're going to talk about their

123
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,240
medication you are going to ensure you

124
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,759
giving them the proper medication the

125
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,080
the Waring and everything you're not

126
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,720
going to sell PS that are going to be uh

127
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm going to call turn to casualty when

128
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,120
it get to the other Farm because that

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,520
will kill your credibility and once your

130
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,199
credibility is dead the business is a

131
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,919
very small world the business world is a

132
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,880
small world everybody in town

133
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,639
understands that that person is not

134
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,520
credible they don't come to you anymore

135
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,960
and if you can't sustain your Market if

136
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,160
you can't keep selling your product

137
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,039
you're not in business so you won't have

138
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,160
the ability to expand when you don't

139
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,240
have the right customers coming to buy

140
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,720
your product so you want to earn honesty

141
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,199
is a very important currency in this

142
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,520
business so that's one key that you must

143
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:45,680
have to ensure that you keep making

144
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,080
money in pig farming you must be

145
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,759
extremely honest great reputation they

146
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,919
know this person is like this and they

147
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,400
know you you you would not lie about

148
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,759
what you're doing that's very very

149
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,639
important now I talked about the

150
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,960
external customer but let me quickly

151
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,560
Channel this discour to also the

152
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,000
internal customer customers a lot of

153
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,000
people forfeit the interest and

154
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,440
importance of their internal customers I

155
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,880
call the internal customers their

156
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,319
workers now if you don't have the right

157
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,280
credibility the right reputation with

158
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:16,039
your workers you should know you are a

159
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,360
you you a dead meat if I permit me to

160
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,440
say that because your internal customers

161
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,880
are the ones that sustains your business

162
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,800
so if your internal customers feel you

163
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,080
are fraudulent you don't pay them their

164
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,520
wages you don't pay them their salaries

165
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,000
or you are not faithful or you treat

166
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,840
them like like uh like uh they don't

167
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,880
exist like they are unimportant then you

168
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,000
are writing letter to failing in your

169
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,199
business because they are the ones that

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,599
keep your business going somebody said

171
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,039
you don't make it a duty to impress your

172
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:52,479
customer but make it a duty to amaze

173
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,759
your customers and I'm talking both your

174
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,680
external and your internal customers I

175
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,000
for a person now I can tell you one

176
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,479
thing that uh permit me to say this and

177
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,759
to talk about myself when it comes to

178
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,240
reputation it's really there I have

179
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,479
people that will vouch from here

180
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,479
anywhere and it's it's just that way

181
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,479
even without me being there a worker

182
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,759
will tell a worker that that person uhuh

183
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,560
is not like that he's a very faithful

184
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,759
person I would not uh deny my internal

185
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,560

surprised you will think I pay more than

195
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,919
what I pay you know but because of the

196
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,680

197
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,319

sure the farmers you are getting your

224
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,399
stocks from are very credible they have

225
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,640
the right reputation thems so that you

226
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:00,120
can easily Trace their genetics if they

227
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,279
tell you they're selling to you a large

228
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,680
white you know it's a large white you

229
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,760
are buying don't buy stocks from just

230
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,040
any Farm be very careful when you are

231
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,000
buying your stock uh ensure they have

232
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,680
the right medication being done on the

233
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,800
farm ensure they have the right genetics

234
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,079
ensure that they've taken their high on

235
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,360
injection when they supposed to have

236
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:22,720
taken it because I was one of my friend

237
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,360
um he told me he was telling me recently

238
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,040
that he suspected that the reason why U

239
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,000
some pigs he got some while ago while I

240
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,760
think all of them died or something was

241
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,120
because of probably uh the fact that

242
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,880
that those pigs probably did not take

243
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,880
their iron injection when they supposed

244
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,640
to they are farmers like that that don't

245
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,760
care about many of all these things they

246
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:45,040
don't they don't maintain good uh

247
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,560
medication on their Farm if you get un

248
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,800
Peaks from that farm they may be good

249
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,480
while you are looking at them right

250
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,120
there but once you shift them away from

251
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,800
that farm to your own Farm then they

252
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,880
start having problem so make sure you

253
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,600
get the right genetics and you ensure

254
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,760
that they have taken all their

255
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,519
medications and they the right breed you

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,800
