Howdy Folks this is Coleman Alderson for

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,340
Gardens all.com and today I'm here to

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,619
share with you our Harvest of our

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,340
Romanian red garlic and we'll put up

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:25,019
some information on that in an article

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,720
pertaining to harvesting garlic it's a

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,539
perfect time this is May 20th

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,340
thereabouts and um

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,020
we just pulled this one out of the

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,079
ground I wanted to show you a little bit

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,140
of its uh Anatomy of course you have the

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,800
garlic bulb here this is a Romanian red

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,040
variety by the way rather spicy well

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,680
known for its intense flavor and its its

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,920
heat it's uh it's good in a lot of

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,559
dishes and we'll be posting some recipes

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,719
on how to use it but we have the uh the

19
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,239
bulb we have the roots down here nice

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,340
healthy set of roots these were set out

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,500
in November

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,600
went through the winter just fine and

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,840
now we have this we have a hard neck

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,600
right here it's the hard neck garlic and

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,180
what's really interesting is these um

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,780
these leaves you have just regular flat

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,020
sort of leaves and then as the season

28
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,000
rolls on and gets warmer you get the

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,640
these things called

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,580
escapes and this is a kind of a

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,560
snake-like thing that comes up it's

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,280
different than the regular leaves it's

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,520
it's like part of the stem actually and

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,079
um this is an especially long one but

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,060
Scapes are great they're one of the

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,220
first things you can go ahead and cut

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,740
off your plant before you even pull it

38
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,420
out of the ground and take it in and use

39
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,619
it in all kinds of recipes that we'll

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,500
tell you about

41
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,600
but that's part of the the curing

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,740
process I'll be cutting the scape off

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,979
and then hanging this up to

44
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,840
cure for two weeks or so in the shade

45
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,799
it's real important you don't lay it out

46
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,140
in the sun but nice

47
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,599
airflow and nice shade so it isn't

48
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,239
exposed to the Sun and you don't have to

49
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,599
clean it off very much just let it

50
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,520
dangle there and we use a fence

51
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,340
basically

52
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,700
a plastic fence that we used to use to

53
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,099
keep the dogs out of the garden but uh

54
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,440
it works really well we put on a slight

55
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,260
frame so it will hold its position and

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,080
then we hang it up under the eaves of

57
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,660
some of our buildings here and it works

58
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,360
really good drives them out and in about

59
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,920
two weeks they'll be ready to trim up

60
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,260
take inside

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,300
so this is Coleman Alderson for

00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:16,080
garlic we'd love to hear from you

73

75
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,879
thank you

76
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,819
Howdy Folks I'm back with you here in

77
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,760
our Shady location under an eve of one

78
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,940
of our storage buildings and what I

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,819
constructed here was a very simple frame

80
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,980
using this kind of plastic fencing that

81
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,700
is stretched across a rectangular frame

82
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,440
and then hung from inside the eaves here

83
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,379
and this is an ideal location you got

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,040
good airflow we have nice shade sun is

85
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,580
barely ever even touching this area and

86
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,860
um

87
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,280
it'll take about two weeks

88
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,140
to to have this cure out right so I want

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,040
to show you what what we do here with

90
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,260
each

91
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,239
plant

92
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,739
first thing I'm going to do is cut out

93
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,120
this scape

94
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:10,799
which is a kind of a serpentine like

95
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,739
creature that grows

96
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,500
in the uh within the leaves usually

97
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,600
coming out near the top of the garlic

98
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,699
plant and you can cut these before you

99
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,979
even harvest the plants they're really

100
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,880
delicious you can think of them in terms

101
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:28,620
of stir fry and mixing them in with

102
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,720
flavoring anything that you might use a

103
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,560
green onion for it has a little bit

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,900
extra zap because it is a garlic flavor

105
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:40,560
so similar to The Garlic chives but

106
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,560
because this is a Romanian red it has a

107
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,000
a quality about it that is kind of spicy

108
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,520
so

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,180
that's the first thing we do

110
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,139
and then we want to weave

111
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:58,320
this top part of the plant into

112
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,540
the fabric of the fence picking out

113
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,880
one of the squares to push the leaves up

114
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,780
through and try to weave it up through

115
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,840
it

116
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,060
and to make it easier

117
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,520
what we can do is

118
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,500
start at the top and just do a little

119
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,259
fold here

120
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,259
and there's no science to this I'm just

121
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:21,780
picking in our arbitrary spot here

122
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:25,259
and then kind of meshing it up together

123
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:27,120
so it will go through the um

124
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,419
through the grid here

125
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,240
and then you just take it

126
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:35,520
and start at a place where you want your

127
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,060
bulb to hang somewhere

128
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,759
within the frame if you can

129
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,620
these are tough leaves but I'm weaving

130
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,900
them through the uh I'm going to go

131
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,300
every other Square

132
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,800
the better that way and then kind of

133
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,139
push it up through

134
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,660
see how this is working here

135
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,660
and we'll go up through here again

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,780
and after you get through about two of

137
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,520
these you really don't have to worry

138
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,740
about doing it

139
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,039
much more it'll it'll take care of

140
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,039
itself

141
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,600
okay all right

142
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,440
so

143
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:19,620
we have our garlic push up a little more

144
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,720
or a garlic bulb hanging here and the

145
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,620
leaves will feed a little bit more

146
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:29,240
nutrition to it and as it cures out

147
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,220
in two weeks it'll be ready to go

148
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,560
here's the old stem from

149
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,720
from the uh

150
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,520
Escape

151
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,800
kind of tough

152
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,120
okay

153
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,120
and then you can trim it up

154
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,080
but we'll be back here in two weeks

155
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,960
to check it out

156
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,460
and here we have a completed panel of

157
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,699
our garlic

158
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,680
curing now for 14 days

159
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:02,330
thanks very much for watching folks

160
