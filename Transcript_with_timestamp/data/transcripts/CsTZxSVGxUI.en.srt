00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,440
hi I'm Mark H with the Alabama

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,360
Cooperative Extension system and with me

6
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,239
today is Chad Norris director of the

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,320
Tennessee Valley research and Extension

8
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,800
Center here in Limestone County Alabama

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,520
Chad tell we have worked with uh

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,120
harvesting water for irrigation for

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,840
several years on the station uh what's

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,879
the concept of harvesting water for

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,399
irrigation here in the Tennessee Valley

14
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:03,039
Mark as you know most of the Iration

15
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,479
systems pull from streams it's extremely

16
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,280
difficult to obtain well water although

17
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,200
there are some wells but the majority of

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,759
them pull from streams so there's a

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,159
tremendous Demand on these small streams

20
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,439
during drought times when we really need

21
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,560
the irrigation water so the idea came

22
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,840
about here at the center 18 years ago

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,560
for us to have a water harvesting and

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,600
storage project so what we do we have

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,159
limestone Creek a leg of limestone Creek

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,240
that runs through the center so if

27
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,799
you're in high water water times which

28
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,720
is typically November through March

29
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,280
stream is in full pool there's a lot of

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,000
water and it's running down to the

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,759
Tennessee River at that time we'll pump

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,240
water from Limestone creb into a

33
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:49,240
reservoir that we have that contains 140

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,920
acre feet and we'll fill that Reservoir

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,759
and then strictly use that stored water

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,119
for our irrigation needs during the

37
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,680
growing season so it gives you water in

38
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,280
wet times to use in dry times what type

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,960
farming operation might this fit with

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,720
Chad it fits well with us of course we

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,480
uh B small LR compared to through larger

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,000
Growers uh I see some instances where

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,040
Mak some Growers of some specialty crops

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,519
which would be smaller Acres perhaps

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,760
could utilize this type of system and I

46
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,280
also understand there's some towns

47
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,280
municipalities that have considered

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,879
using this type of stor water system for

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,239
backup Water Supplies perhaps those typ

50
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,640
thank you chip appreciate your

51
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,879
information on harvesting water for all

52
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,800
of our irrigation videos and other AD

53
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,440
videos visit our website on YouTube

54
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,560
here's the address for that website

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:49,159
thank you for watching our video today

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,159
