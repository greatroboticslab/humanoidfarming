1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,040
in preparation for hurricane season it'd

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,170
be a good idea for livestock producers

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,730
to review their their health program

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,219
because there's always the potential

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,549
that animals may be relocated to a

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,680
shelter or another farm to get them out

7
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,140
of dangerous way and the other situation

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,189
that could arise is you know storms can

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,330
do a lot of damage not fences down and

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,760
potentially then in that situation

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,410
animals could go mingle with other herds

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,960
as well and just be exposed to other

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,669
infectious diseases so so having a herd

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,230
health program up to date having

15
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:39,210
vaccinations up to date would be a good

16
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,219
thing another situation that that could

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,860
arise is when animals are commingled

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,960
trying to get them back to their proper

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,910
owner so animal identification is very

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,800
important and it needs to be unique

21
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,379
animal identification something that is

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,399
specific to that animal into that farm

23
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:58,710
and so for example hot brands USDA II

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,140
mental ear tags electronic

25
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,449
identification tags those would all be

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,110
potentially unique animal identification

27
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,850
as opposed to say a dangle tag with just

28
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,159
a number on it you know there's a lot of

29
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,500
there's a lot of black cows in Alabama

30
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,000
that probably have an ear tag number 26

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,229
in their ear for example so it needs to

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,170
be something unique to that particular

33
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,970
animal so that that people can get the

34
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,130
animals back to their to their proper

35
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,369
farms of course making sure that you

36
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:29,880
have all the equipment on hand that you

37
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,520
need to to respond to to a potential

38
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,880
disaster making sure that you have feed

39
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,009
and water available and in storage for

40
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,619
one to two weeks potentially for stored

41
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,840
feed it needs to be stored in a dry safe

42
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,479
place and it needs to be someplace

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,560
that's that's fairly secure so that you

44
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,990
do have good healthy wholesome feed to

45
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,470
provide your your livestock after a

46
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,469
disaster if you're on a well water

47
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:02,369
source having hand pumps or generators

48
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:05,850
available in case electricity is

49
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,190
disrupted would be would be all the

50
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,810
important things to consider ahead of

51
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,000
time livestock producers should

52
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,530
prioritize their animals so that they

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,840
can be sure that those

54
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,850
animals if animals do have the

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,250
opportunity or the need to be evacuated

56
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,790
those animals with a high priority can

57
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,700
then be evacuated first or looked after

58
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,040
first if the producer knew which animals

59
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,800
were maybe getting ready to cab or a kid

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,440
or fall whatever the case may be put

61
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,580
them in a location where they can maybe

62
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,800
check on them

63
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,319
first to make sure that there haven't

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,390
been any complications or any issues

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,280
that arise during the during the storm

66
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,030
if you are in an area that is prone to

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,370
flooding

68
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,190
for example move move your animals to

69
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,810
higher ground and ideally keep them out

70
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,600
of barns they're usually going to be

71
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,910
better left in large open spaces as

72
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,980
opposed to confined to the barn the last

73
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,510
thing you want to do is put your animals

74
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,980
in there and then have the storm destroy

75
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,030
that building with all your animals in

76
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,170
it so they're usually going to be better

77
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,370
off on high ground in large open spaces

78
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,440
particularly if the horses are not used

79
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,600
to being out in the pasture in that

80
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,150
situation it may be safer and a better

81
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,310
idea to leave them in a stall in a

82
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,560
secure building because last thing you

83
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,750
want to have happen is a storm to come

84
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,709
in scare the horses frighten the horses

85
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,239
and and they you know don't know how to

86
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,150
handle that don't know what to do and

87
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,900
they may end up injuring themselves more

88
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,900
so than the storm

89
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,550
you
