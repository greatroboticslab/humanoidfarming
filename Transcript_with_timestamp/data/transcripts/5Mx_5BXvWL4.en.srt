1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,760
to export to it i need to pay somebody

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,520
who wants to pay somebody

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,520
for my product to come out and that's

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,440
great so you need to pay four people

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,599
first to get your product out of this

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,200
corruption it's just corruption but if

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,799
all these people have to get together

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,280
and help each i mean i see how this

9
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,960
white

10
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,119
people are doing here what these white

11
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,119
guys are not great so this is what they

12
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,480
do so i met what some guys they're five

13
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,760
of them they said okay they didn't have

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,320
the money so what they did was they went

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,599
to the bank

16
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,359
each person had to go and apply for

17
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,560
credit card they each got two hundred

18
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,279
thousand two hundred to one so they

19
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,720
ended up with

20
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,079
one million run they took the one

21
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,280
million run credit card and then they

22
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,960
started the one farmer

23
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,399
he started planting lettuce after six

24
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,920
weeks he started harvesting like he's

25
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,719
made two million run he takes the two

26
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,399
million run

27
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,640
pay then they invested into the next

28
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,160
person by the end of six months all five

29
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,320
of them had already they had

30
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,680
farms fully operational but zimbabwes

31
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,200
don't want to do that zimbabwe don't

32
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,800
wanna but but specifically black

33
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,280
zimbabweans

34
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,559
is a black specifically black zimbabwe

35
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,840
because the white guys that are farming

36
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,199
here are the same guys that we've been

37
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,440
farming in zim

38
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,199
now when mugabe started sorting out his

39
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,239
black people they started running to

40
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,840
south africa

41
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,240
now this is where they are so the

42
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240
problem is not that zimbabwe is bad

43
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,240
if zimbabwe is not passing but it's not

44
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,560
zimbabwe is rich it's great

45
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,240
we are to i mean when i say we i'm south

46
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,880
african black south africa but it's the

47
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,320
same

48
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,920
because we also don't help each other

49
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,960
trust me as blacks and africans we also

50
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,720
don't help each other

51
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,240
it's it's this you know there's this

52
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,119
pulliam down syndrome

53
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,000

54
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,600
