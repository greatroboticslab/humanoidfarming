00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,320
um hello guys uh

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,240
i'm back again uh dylan and uh

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,320
today uh i'm gonna be showing you my

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,400
refined forming system

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,640
uh this is much simpler it uses normal

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,400
pistons instead of sticky pistons the

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,240
layout is a lot simpler not as complex

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,480
i even made it underground

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,439
and the redstone isn't as complicated

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,640
so first i'm going to show you the

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,880
floodgates

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,920
the floodgates are normal pistons that

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,200
are activated to hold the water back

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,040
a single

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,120
source block of water

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,840
and they're hooked up

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,680
to a single red stone trail

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,440
by this lever

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,559
basically the lever hits off the first

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,840
repeater

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,680
and then splits off to the first piston

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,760
and then it comes up hits another

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,199
repeater and goes all the way to the

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,199
other piston around that corner

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,000
now to show you it

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,560
how it works also

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,400
i made it uh three wide rather than two

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,400
so you can get more wheat

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,920
uh you can get 90

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,159
uh fit 90 wheat on here

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,759
90 wheat 90 plants on here whatever you

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,200
want to call it

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,600
i don't know what you want to call it

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,439
but basically when you turn this off uh

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,080
floodgates open

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,759
and

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,799
you can walk along here to collect the

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,360
items

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,280
rather than walking in the water

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,040
and um

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,759
basically that's it uh you could also

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
use this for mushroom farms

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,479
uh

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,159
you know

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,479
whatever you want

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,520
so i hope that was helpful

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,520
and um goodbye
