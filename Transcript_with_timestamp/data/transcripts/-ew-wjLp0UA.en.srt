1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
if I could describe some of the best

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,240
management practices for the former to

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,210
adapt their with these different climate

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,670
conditions I would number one I would be

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,130
looking at which in so phase are we in

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,190
you know if we're looking at El Nino and

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,930
it's going to be wet and cool we may

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,760
have to delay planting wow that ground

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,740
to warm up until it dries out enough so

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,840
we can get in there and run if it's la

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,340
nina and going to be dry obviously we

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,710
need to go in there and plant early as

13
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,859
early as possible so that we can go

14
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,380
after our soil moisture as climate does

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,210
change we can expect more extreme

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,309
weather and we need to grow our crop

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,430
according to and anticipate what those

18
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,829
changes may be an example is this with

19
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,719
anticipated climate change we expect our

20
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,719
peanuts growing season to potentially be

21
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,300
warmer and drier and that sets us up for

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,719
problems like aflatoxin so what I'm

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,239
encouraging growers to do now is to both

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,180
repair their practices whether it's

25
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,280
increasing irrigation ability or to

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,439
invest in varieties that are going to be

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,130
both drought resistant and more tolerant

28
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,600
to or resistant to app epoxy under hot

29
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,790
and dry conditions we're going to make

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,740
sure that we recommend those growers

31
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,900
follow some type of water scheduling

32
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,180
program in order to make sure that we

33
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,430
have plenty of irrigation or moisture in

34
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,229
the soil for what the plant needs and so

35
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,100
if we got a non irrigated field and it's

36
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:28,049
hot and dry all we can do is maintain

37
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,520
what we can handle in other words take

38
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,070
care of any insects that are out there

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,920
that we have to take care of disease

40
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:38,250
that's out there now some of the ways

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,720
you can manage insects really well in

42
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,119
Phoenix and is crop rotation and

43
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,460
planting time so crop production is very

44
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,030
important look at your planting methods

45
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,799
and the varieties and do not go too much

46
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,229
peanut after peanuts because then you

47
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,799
have build-up of insect pests especially

48
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,799
soul cast
