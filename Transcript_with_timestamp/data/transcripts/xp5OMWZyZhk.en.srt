00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,720
it's as simple as that I read a blog

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,160
post a little while ago saying that you

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,259
can keep your chicken's water from

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,080
freezing by putting a salt water

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,300
solution in a 20 ounce bottle I'll link

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,680
to the article down below I don't know

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,480
if it's going to work but let's try it

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,580
today and see what happens I've been

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,599
waiting for it to get cold out again

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,279
um we're 15 degrees today

12
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,619
it's a pretty simple process it just

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,759
calls for a quarter of a cup

14
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,100
salt

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,200
I'm using rock salt and it says fill it

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,899
up the rest of the way with water I'm

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,780
just using a little warm water to help

18
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,460
melt the salt

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,420
pump load up

[Music]

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,500
all right it's as simple as that I hope

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,200
we've been using the salt water solution

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,659
for three days now today's the coldest

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,760
morning it's 9 degrees Fahrenheit out

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,920
let's go check and see if the chicken's

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,159
water froze overnight come on Pluto

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,700
let's go check on the chickens come on

30
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,740
noisy roaster sounds about right here at

31
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,240
London Acres that guy crows all day all

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,740
night long sometimes we'll hear them at

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,920
like two three in the clock in the

34
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,560
morning no ice build up there

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,020
a little bit here on the sides you can

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,540
feel it I'm gonna call that a success

37
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,340
it's not below zero out but it's nine

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,840
degrees out and the water didn't freeze

39
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,939
overnight

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,280
so I'm happy with that ends up freezing

41
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,600
when it gets below zero that's fine I

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,119
can deal with that every once in a while

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,640
we've had good success so far with this

44
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,799
I hope you do too leave it in the

46
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,399
the video it really helps we'll see you

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,340
right back here next time at London

48
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,360
Acres a guide to Modern homesteading

49
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,360
self-sufficiency and freedom
