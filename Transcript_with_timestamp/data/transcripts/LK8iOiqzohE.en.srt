1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
basically what we're doing I can show

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,640
you this week here because it'll be easy

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,140
to see easier to see than a small week

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,300
usually you don't claim me to weed that

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,080
is this big we're trying to get them

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,280
when they just emerge but if you look at

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,540
this thing we passed the flame over

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,070
pretty quickly and you can see it's

9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,840
already starting to wilt down it's not

10
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,930
like charred to charcoal or burn or

11
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,519
anything but when I pinch one of the

12
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,960
leaves I can see it leaves a really dark

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,699
spot where I can tell that the cells the

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,250
plant cells have ruptured because what

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,110
has happened is the flame has heated up

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,149
the water in the plant cells enough so

17
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,680
that the cell wall expands and bursts

18
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,790
and so this weed will wilt and die you

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,360
know if we come back in a couple hours

20
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,620
and look at it what you're trying to do

21
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,440
you can either use flame eating for a

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,660
stale bedding technique meaning that you

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,370
know letting the weeds in the top one or

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,170
two inches of the soil sort of express

25
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,699
themselves over the period of one or two

26
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,770
weeks and you can come through the flame

27
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,980
leader and sort of boiled them off the

28
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,809
bed top so that's creating a stale seed

29
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,189
bed and after a couple of passes like

30
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,320
that a lot of the weeds that are on the

31
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,189
top layer of the soil have already

32
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,380
germinated so you have it's stale

33
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:15,930
the main application that we would use

34
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,619
it for is will seed a crop into a bed

35
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,390
and before the crop emerges we'll pass

36
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,520
the flame leader leader over the surface

37
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,799
of the soil crop is under the soil so it

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,630
stays protected but the weeds that are

39
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,549
on the top of the bed are plain weeded

40
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,450
and then the crop emerges up into a

41
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,450
clean seed bed
