1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,160
in many parts of ghana especially in

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,080
rural areas having access to electricity

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,080
is a big challenge some rural

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,599
communities still live in the dark today

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,119
making it difficult for students to

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,960
study at night among others however it

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,880
gets exciting to know there are people

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,119
who are working hard behind scenes to

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,359
help bridge this gap

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,359
meet mustafa a young onion who is making

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,960
electrical streetlights with renewable

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,680
energy and recycled materials hi my name

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,320
is mustafa and i build speedlite using

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,640
renewable in it let me show you how

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,840
so for this build we have some solar

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,399
panels we have some pvc pipes

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,719
we have some led lights

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,000
and then of course some few electronics

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,079
and then lithium ion batteries

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,239
you also need some tools as well some of

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,480
the two that might come in handy are

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,520
a glue gun

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,879
you need this plier

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,000
and then you also need

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,080
a blade

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,960
for cutting

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,600
and

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,479
finally you need a pcb board to assemble

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,200
all your electronics components

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,439
so

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,880
let's get started you first of all have

32
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,840
to

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,640
fix all your led lights

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,080
on the pcb board this way

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,880
now this particular one is a 24 volt led

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,240
which is more brighter but you can make

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,520
a much

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,560
lower one

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,439
which can

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,680
run on very small power like 12 volts or

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,960
6 volt for instance

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,910
i have

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,920
a 12 volt led

44
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:47,280
[Music]

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,399
all right this

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,600
this one is a 12 volt led

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,830
it is powered by a 12 volt lithium ion

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,320
battery and we have

49
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,920
[Music]

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,479
this circuit

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,759
which automatically switches

52
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,840
the leds on and off during the day time

53
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,080
and nighttime respectively these lithium

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,080
ion batteries are actually recovering

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
these old laptop batteries which are

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,840
referred to as condemned by this in the

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,480
market a lot of people don't really know

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,440
that they are still usable even if even

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
after

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,200
not being able to power the laptop so

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,560
i'm going to break this off and then

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,120
remove them and test their voltages

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,239
one of this voltage

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,480
newly manufactured is around 3.7 volts

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,440
but after using it in a laptop for a

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,480
while there will be a voltage drop

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,760
usually

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,720
these voltage drops are not too high

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,950
that they cannot power anything so let's

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,380
go

71
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,380
[Music]

72
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,400
so now

73
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,560
we have finally removed

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,280
the lithium ion itself

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,959
so what we go on to test the voltages to

76
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,080
see whether they are still

77
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,200
working

78
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,800
with our volt meter or the multimeter we

79
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,480
set it up to the dc voltage over here

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:14,159
now we expect to get around 3.5

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,560
to below somewhere 2.8 2.5

82
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,040
this is around 3.6 volts

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
and earlier

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,799
so this one has very small voltage drop

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,120
so

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:33,080
we can use it let's start by assembling

87
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,080
the star for the units

88
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,840
and now that's it

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,040
you're almost done

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,040
with your split legs

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,360
now

92
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,519
with the help of the glue gun

93
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,440
you heat it up to the required

94
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,480
temperature to load it

95
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,080
apply

96
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,599
some here

97
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,640
after application

98
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,439
you stick it up

99
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,700
here this one

100
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,120
hold it in position secondly

101
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,159
[Music]

102
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,760
you pick

103
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,080
your

104
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,319
plastic bottles and you fix it in this

105
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,319
room

106
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,440
[Music]

107
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:28,479
[Music]

108
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,960
after you are done

109
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,120
you wire up

110
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,120
the circuit

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,759
of the bulb first

112
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,759
inside

113
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,280
the plastic bowl

114
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,680
or you can also

115
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,759
put this in position

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,479
apply some glue around it for you to

117
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,479
stick first before you put this

118
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,919
inside

119
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,919
now after you connect it up

120
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,880
you cut out these pieces of wire

121
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,120
we joined from these

122
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,199
two wires over here and then connected

123
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,440
to the led bulbs

124
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,160
i'm holding right now

125
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,160
so at the end

126
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,880
you connect the solar

127
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,240
panel

128
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,840
to

129
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,840
another model charging

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,360
i first of all design this model

131
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,360
on the breadboard first to test how

132
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,600
efficiently it will charge my

133
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,080
lithium-ion batteries for me i've

134
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,919
already developed the circuit and very

135
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,400
soon i'll bring the pcb out

136
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,280
now when you are done you remove it and

137
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,759
also solder them on top of a pcb board

138
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,759
this way

139
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,840
now the final part you now connect the

140
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,240
solar panel to the charging unit so the

141
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,000
solar panel provides power

142
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,280
through the charging units the charging

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,960
unit will charge

144
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,720
the lithium ion batteries now the

145
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,039
lithium ion battery also discharges

146
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,639
power through

147
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,400
the switch

148
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,680
then the switch also control the

149
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,759
switching on and off of the light and

150
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,680
you are done with the street light

151
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,360
mustafa has deployed some of his works

152
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,240
