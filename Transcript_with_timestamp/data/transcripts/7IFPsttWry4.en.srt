1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,879
now these quick hitches that we sell

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,919
here good works tractors the spikos

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,960
these red ones here

4
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,279
they're going to be good for everything

5
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,880
from a big 40 66r about as big of a

6
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,639
compact tractor as you can get

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,480
all the way down to a little subcompact

8
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,840
like this 1025r the great thing about

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,440
these speako quickhitches is that they

10
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,960
don't use bushings okay so

11
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,160
this little slot here is designed to be

12
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,480
a direct fit with your category 1 your 7

13
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,600
8 pin that goes right in here a lot of

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,960
the other quick hitches out there

15
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,199
require you to stack on

16
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,400
a category 3 bushing there's no real

17
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,800
point of that besides spending more

18
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,240
money

19
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,760
we can ship these all over the country

20
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,399
to you now let's get to that tip of the

21
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,000
week

22
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,360
this was a real scenario that happened

23
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,040
with a customer recently that just

24
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,040
purchased a quick hitch and went to hook

25
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,800
up to their frontier rototiller

26
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,920
it wasn't matching up so this isn't

27
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,040
going to take care of every problem

28
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,640
that's out there but this is going to be

29
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,239
a common thing found on things like

30
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,520
rototillers could be a sweep all

31
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,960
like what we have right here i want to

32
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,480
show you what it is so if you go ahead

33
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,160
and you're backing up your tractor with

34
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,680
the quick hitch to mate up

35
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,879
okay with the pins you got two lower

36
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,840
pins for your three point then you got

37
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,520
the top middle

38
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,680
so if your alignment with your bolt pins

39
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,359
right here are not equal to the quick

40
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,359
hitch spacing take a look and see if

41
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,920
this lower bracket is welded or bolted

42
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,199
on

43
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,799
in this case here you can see it's going

44
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,360
to be bolted on and what that allows you

45
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,520
to do

46
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,200
is loosen up the bolts slide this thing

47
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,119
in or out same thing with the other side

48
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,640
you still want to maintain an equal

49
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,960
amount of spacing on both sides of the

50
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,640
center pin back up accordingly get your

51
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,960
center line for your quick hitch here

52
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
and then just loosen it up see where you

53
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,840
got to be center it and then you can go

54
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,960
ahead and tighten these bolts back down

55
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,400
really quick while we're bolting this

56
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,240
lower link on let me tell you all about

57
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,079

well hopefully you found this helpful we

74
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,720
gotta finish setting up this sweetball

75
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,480
sweepster here

76
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,319
and get it ready to go but it's not

77
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,599
gonna solve every single compatibility

78
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,879
issue there with a quick hitch but it's

79
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,560
something to take a look at

80
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,080
again this customer called in they

81
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,360
weren't sure what was going on there the

82
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
frontier was supposed to be quick hitch

83
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,680
compatible

84
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,599
the quick hitch is built to a standard

85
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,760
specification there's no variation there

86
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,040
besides this a fraction of an inch which

87
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,800
isn't going to matter so

88
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,480
take a look see if you have adjustable

89
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,519
lower links on there that could solve

90
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,720

91
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,400

well right way to do it

110
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,560

sliding your pin in or out left to right

112
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,840
