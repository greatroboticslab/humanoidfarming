00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,879
foreign

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,160
hey welcome back to Lori Farm everybody

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,740
uh today we're going to be doing a

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,039
hydraulic fluid change on this old 1949

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,740
8N tractor so to start there's a there's

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,060
actually three main drain areas on the

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,580
tractor that you're going to want to

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,460
drain from directly below the

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,439
gear shift but on my tractor I don't

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,779
know what the previous owner did I have

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,000
no idea this thing almost looks like it

12
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,500
was either mangled up or welded on or

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,420
something I'm not going to be taking

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,860
that off today I'm a little bit worried

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,120
that once I get it off I'm going to have

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,040
a problem so we're going to start on

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,100
this bolt over here it's right next to

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,320
the exhaust and uh I think I've watched

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,920
a few videos and guys have said that

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,739
theirs is a 9 16. mine's a three-quarter

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,440
I don't know if

22
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,420
if it was changed out at one time which

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,860
is why it's a three-quarter but that's

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,680
where we're going to start

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:04,680
um the tractor should hold five gallons

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,680
of hydraulic fluid when

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,540
um when it's full so I have a

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,820
three gallon bucket here so we're gonna

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,280
have to stop at some point

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,260
I've actually never taken this bolt out

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,820
I've done changes on it before but I

32
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,580
always took the

33
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:25,020
the big one here in the back loose

34
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,700
exclusively but I thought today I'd try

35
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,280
this one all right well we let that

36
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,220
drain out of there a little bit this uh

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,740
this rear one I think is an inch and an

38
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,579
inch and a sixteenth which

39
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:42,119
on hand that socket so I'm going with a

40
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,860
an inch and an eighth that I have

41
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,479
put a rag in just to get this thing

42
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,400
loosened up

43
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,280
like I said there should be five gallons

44
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,560
in here so I got a little three gallon

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,759
bucket so we might stop a little ways

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,340
and

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,740
and uh

48
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,500
go pour out into a bigger bucket and

49
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,299
come back and get the rest

50
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,399
well while that's draining down on the

51
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,920
bottom of the tractor whatever

52
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,060
open the cap here up on the top for the

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,920
fill

54
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,920
it uh it looks like it's a

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,340
looks like it's a bolt but it's actually

56
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,739
not

57
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,739
kind of like a radiator cap almost

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,160
I'm actually surprised the old oil

59
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,420
doesn't look too bad

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,640
so that's a good sign I remember the

61
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,120
first time I changed it that uh

62
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,500
it was pretty white and scummy

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,120
well there's probably a million great

64
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,120
ways to fill but that's the way I'm

65
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,700
Gonna Fill things up the the dipstick is

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,260
over here underneath the underneath the

67
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,940
seat

68
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,040
and um

69
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,920
so we'll fill for a little bit and then

70
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,500
we'll we'll check our level and see how

71
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,120
we're we're doing

72
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,120
and we'll check our fluids here

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,300
pretty hard to see on there but it

74
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,040
should be right on the money well we got

75
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,400
the oil all put back and got the cover

76
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,660
back on so ready to go we'll fire her up

77
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,660
and see if she holds

78
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,159
well thanks for hanging out today and uh

79
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,420
hopefully we all learned something and

80
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,400
