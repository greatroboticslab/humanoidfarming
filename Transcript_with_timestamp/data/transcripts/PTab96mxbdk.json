  "text": "[Music] farmers and ranchers have many responsibilities two important responsibilities are producing food and protecting natural resources such as soil water air plants and animals these objectives are not mutually exclusive and in fact often complement each other even so producers do have to balance the ways in which they allocate time money and other resources this video explores how producers balance and achieve environmental goals while managing animals crops and business this video introduces some general conservation practices while outlining specific practices that are relevant to animal production manure management and air and water quality it also highlights the technical and financial assistance that may be available for producers to apply conservation practices such assistance is offered through the US Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service or NRCS local Soil and Water Conservation districts or s WCS and other federal state and local programs conservation on farms is based on maintaining or improving productive agricultural lands and natural resources farms and ranches of all types and sizes can benefit from NRCS conservation practices to improve or preserve soil health air and water quality and wildlife habitat on and around farms these components make up productive and functional ecosystems which in turn have economic environmental and community value that extends beyond the farm with these elements of sustainability in mind NRCS and others support producers as they make decisions about conservation practices for their farms although certain conservation practices are implemented to help meet regulatory requirements the majority are adopted voluntarily but even when required the specific combinations of measures are usually chosen by the producers themselves to meet individual needs and site-specific conditions many NRCS conservation practices apply to animal agriculture for example producers can store manure and plan application to achieve the right amount in form of nutrients at the right time in the right place for growing crops manage livestock grazing to promote healthy soil and vegetation and plant cover crops to retain topsoil and reduce nutrient losses such practices support productive livestock and cropping systems while also protecting water quality and promoting soil health conservation practices have the potential to significantly benefit Natural Resources although some practices can save money in the long term by reducing fuel or fertilizer use they can also require the producer to invest financial resources upfront farmers and ranchers can access technical and financial assistance through their local and rcs office to help offset the cost of implementing certain conservation practices the local NRCS office is a valuable resource where NRCS and conservation district staff technical service providers and other local partners work directly with producers to select design and implement conservation practices they ensure conservation practices not only follow the state's technical standards but are also carefully customized to account for the unique soils location management and needs of an individual farm there is rarely a one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to conservation practices tailoring conservation practices to the specific farm and local resource concerns maximizes the benefits to Natural Resources NRCS and the producer develop a contract that specifies exactly what will be done to the site and when the contract also specifies the amount of financial assistance provided to the producer the assistance can come from a variety of sources in addition to NRCS nrcs the conservation district or other partners continue to provide technical assistance throughout the process checking in on the progress and quality of the work more specific details on some practices used on animal agriculture operations are presented in the next video in this module conservation practices are one of several ways that farmers and ranchers work towards sustainability to ensure productive agriculture and healthy natural resources for generations to come [Music]",
