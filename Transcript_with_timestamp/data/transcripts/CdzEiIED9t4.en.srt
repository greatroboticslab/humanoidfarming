1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,640
you ever seen those big round bales okay

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,120
we got some hay so we're going to play

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,719
and wonder just how much hay is really

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,880
squished in there I mean compared to

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,800
like a square bail it's little but these

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,640
big round bales is it all loose is it

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,359
really tight is it super heavy well

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,519
we're going to rip one apart here and

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:30,480
see if it's enough to bury a person

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,480
in yeah bury a person you know kind of

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,840
like at the beach oh you bury person in

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,840
sand well we bought three round bales

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,600
here and let's go ahead and rip them

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,360
apart see how many it's going to take to

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,120
make a pile that we can get a person

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,480
buried in all right so let's see if we

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,719
can push it here first we thought we're

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,760
going to have to rip it apart where it's

19
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:00,879
at and haul it but nope here we go

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,559
rolling like a Snowman

21
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:07,280
cross the field pushing it to Nowhere

22
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,080
middle of nowhere pushing pushing

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,520
pushing we're heading out to middle of

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,960
the swamp

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,960
here still

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,119
going hey Bale it's really really heavy

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,240
I don't know how much this thing weighs

28
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,479
way too much to lift that's for

29
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,360
sure all right we're pretty much where

30
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:30,560
we're going to rip this thing apart here

31
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,840
so

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,360
let's get

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:40,720
these bail twine string things off of

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:44,479
here snapping them ripping them to the

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,399
side they're packed in there pretty

36
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,159
good and the fun begins here we go

37
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,079
ripping them

38
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:54,040
apart starting to make a pile going to

39
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,600
take a long time to get pile to Bear

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,039
someone in right

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,520
there lot of that roll left though

42
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:05,799
oh yeah it's getting there pile's

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,799

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,840
exhausting W that's nice

48
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,360
that was a pretty lean jump

49
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,560
there it's a lot of hay one round bail

50
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:46,280
that's a lot of fun in one round bail

51
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,360
uhhuh hey that's why we want

52
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:53,040
this looks like one bail is all it needs

53
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,360
one bail and we got a huge pile of hay

54
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,920
