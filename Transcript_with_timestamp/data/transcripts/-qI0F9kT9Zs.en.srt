00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,720
hi i'm louis and i'm an urban gardener

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,080
and food grower in toronto canada

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,240
i'm going to give you a tour of my

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,720
backyard space as well as my allotment

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,400
plot

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,000
show you exactly how i grow food for

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,920
myself and for my family

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
in this small space

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,489
[Music]

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,199
growing food in an urban setting can be

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,000
challenging because we don't have that

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,320
much space

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,239
to grow the food we want therefore i've

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,480
supplemented my raised beds

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,640
with containers and i use a range of

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,680
different materials plastic

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,200
grow bags wood and terracotta containers

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,719
and these right here as you can see i've

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,239
got some peppers as well as some

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,800
eggplants growing

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,719
right alongside my raised beds one of my

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,399
favorite ways to grow herbs is in these

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,760
small terracotta pots

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,199
and the reason for that is that they're

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,719
portable so i can bring them into the

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,320
kitchen whenever i'm cooking

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,239
snip off what i need and bring it right

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,920
back outside and this is also a great

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,640
way for someone to start growing their

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,400
own food

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,080
if they don't have a backyard you could

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,840
do this right on a balcony

33
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,159
another innovative way to take advantage

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,360
of your small space is to use

35
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,119
rain gutters as a way to grow food these

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,400
are galvanized steel rain gutters

37
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,080
that i will grow radish in the spring

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,159
bush beans in the summer and radish

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,479
again in the fall in addition to growing

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,080
vegetables in my backyard i also have a

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,080
few dwarf fruit trees

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,000
this one right here is a pear tree it's

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,079
a dwarf so it stays small

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,079
i also have peach as well as plum

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,840
i started growing food in this backyard

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,720
space about five years ago and it's

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,360
grown

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,040
considerably year after year i built

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,720
these cedar raised beds

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,640
that house my flowers my brassicas

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,560
as well as my zucchinis tomatoes and

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,159
melons another great way to take

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,479
advantage of your small space

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,719
is to build raised beds like this right

55
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,880
here this is a waste high salad bar

56
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,000
in which i grow lettuce in the spring

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,680
and in the fall

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,680
and during the summer i will grow some

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,680
bush beans in here what's great about

60
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,080
bringing this raised bar higher up

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,599
is that it reduces the pest pressure so

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,520
it's a lot easier to maintain

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,200
throughout the season so something new

64
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,040
i'm trying for the first time this year

65
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,000
is actually growing carrots

66
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,520
in these blue storage totes as you can

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,800
see these carrots are very healthy and

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,720
very happy

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,400
when space is at a premium grow

70
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,160
vertically and this is exactly what i'm

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,959
doing with my melons right here

72
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,000
i built this diy trellis system to hold

73
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,519
my melon vines

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,120
as you can see they're growing up

75
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,680
trellising on their own and what this

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,720
does is actually liberate the space down

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,319
here

78
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,400
in the raised bed and allows me to grow

79
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,239
other crops like herbs beets

80
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,480
and lettuce and other shallow rooted

81
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,319
crops so in addition to growing food in

82
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,200
the backyard i'm also growing it in the

83
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,120
front yard

84
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,400
this front porch right here has several

85
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,640
containers

86
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,000
of herbs as well as other vegetables

87
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,239
like this pepper right here

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
i'm growing oregano i'm growing parsley

89
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,120
i'm growing mint

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,159
sage and other crops as well flowers

91
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,480
obviously

92
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,480
very important in any vegetable garden

93
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,400
still in the front yard i'm growing a

94
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,319
plum tree as you can see right here

95
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,360
the plums are still green but they

96
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,519
should be ready in about four weeks time

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,519
many crops can be grown in containers

98
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,800
including potatoes i have several potato

99
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,480
bags right here

100
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,319
they'll be ready for harvest in about

101
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,200
four weeks time

102
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,720
so that's it for the front and backyard

103
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,600
and now let me show you what we have

104
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:40,720
going at the plot

105
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:42,799
[Music]

106
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,480
so another way for city dwellers to grow

107
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,120
their own food is to join a community

108
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,120
garden

109
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,040
or if your city offers it an allotment

110
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,480
plot i have an allotment plot in

111
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,920
addition to my backyard

112
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,159
so i'm going to give you a quick tour of

113
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,720
what i'm growing here at this allotment

114
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,120
garden

115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,040
since i garden 100 organically i have to

116
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,720
find ways to protect my plants

117
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,080
from different kinds of pests if you

118
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,599
look at this bed right here i've got

119
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,519
some chard and some beets

120
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,560
and in order to protect these crops from

121
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,159
leaf miners i use a tutu tool

122
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,159
that i actually bought from a fabric

123
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,000
store and this prevents the moths and

124
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,560
the flies from laying eggs in the first

125
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,359
place so one thing i'm growing at the

126
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,079
plot this year is about 75 heads of

127
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,919
garlic

128
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,680
i've already picked the scapes off this

129
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,400
bed and will be picking

130
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,360
and pulling the garlic in the next three

131
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,040
to four weeks

132
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,520
so we're also taking advantage of

133
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,759
vertical growing at the allotment plot

134
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,759
this trellis right here will house our

135
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,520
cucumbers and cooker melons

136
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,960
and as you can see the cooker melons are

137
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,040
already starting to climb

138
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,440
i'm also growing quite a few different

139
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,360
types of brassicas at the allotment plot

140
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,120
as you can see this cabbage right here

141
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,759
is pretty much ready to pick

142
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,160
another staple for every home gardener

143
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,840
is

144
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,600
chili peppers and sweet peppers so i've

145
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,000
got quite a few

146
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,520
in this bed right here including this

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,240
resin macedonian

148
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,800
which is almost ready to pick i'm also

149
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,160
growing about 28 different varieties of

150
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,080
tomatoes at the plot

151
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,840
and some of them have already set fruit

152
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,840
and others are actually ready to pick

153
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,680
well that's a wrap on our garden tour

154
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,800
today i hope that i've inspired you to

155
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,880
grow your own food

156
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:25,840
on your balconies in your backyards or

157
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,840
an alarming plot in your city

158
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,560
[Music]

159
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,560
you
