1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,520
move around a little bit it's just my

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,760
style my challenge today is to actually

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,519
build on what was just said to say I

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,480
don't actually think about the term Big

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,080
Data anymore because to me big data is

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,880
absolutely useless big data is only

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,439
useful as you transform it into big

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,960
decisions so the challenge for

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,199
Australian livestock species is to do

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,840
exactly as we said before is to merge

11
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,880
what I consider Big Data into big

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,519
decisions and actually equip the

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,599
livestock Industries to enhance the

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,920
productivity

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,640
in the area that I work with there's

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,040
some major changes are happening in the

17
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,559
livestock area suffice to say that we've

18
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,000
probably seen in the last 12 months

19
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,079
changes that we wouldn't have expeced in

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the last 10 years my challenge is that

21
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,680
producers are starting to operate more

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,399
sophisticated brand uh chains they're

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,079
starting to think about not only

24
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,320
supplying on weight and fact

25
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,520
demographics but also about how do they

26
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,359
fit into the brand architecture how do

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,559
they fit into the brand DNA how do they

28
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,359
fit into the brand ecology now all of

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,160
those three things are starting to

30
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,159
really differentiate producers in how

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,920
they interact with Supply chains

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,119
production driven by branded products

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,560
potenti block more in the brand so when

34
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:12,280
you actually become closer to the brand

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,880
one of the real challenges is you

36
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,640
actually start to move away from that

37
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,520
little bit of diversity that producers

38
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,680
actually like they like the opportunity

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,200
of diversity but with diversity comes

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,000
cost of production and with that

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,640
diversity also comes risk so being

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,520
aligned to Brand aets ups and downs

43
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,840
successful producers are really changing

44
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,360
they're starting to manage more

45
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,520
information they're starting equip

46
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,560
himself to handle this information

47
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,399
there's more and more sensors coming in

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,159
I'll show you some examples of that

49
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,240
there's this big challenge of managing

50
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,759
more and more animals with less labor so

51
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,200
corporate agriculture is moving into

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,479
this area the cultural Chang that's

53
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,640
happening in our uh particular space is

54
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:55,040
that we are changing 3 or 400 years of

55
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,560
agricultural production most farmers and

56
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,119
most family Farmers that You' spoken

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,000
about this morning have built themselves

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,399
on dealing with complexity around

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,600
visualization of that complexity they

60
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,119
walk out into the padic they observe

61
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,000
what their animals are doing they

62
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,640
observe what their Fe doing they observe

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,760
what's happening with the advance of all

64
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,280
of these senses you're changing that

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,120
Dynamic CU they no longer walk out into

66
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,200
the P to observe things they're getting

67
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,280
this tsunami of information presented to

68
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,080
them so I'll show you that in a couple

69
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,680
of these pictures that are coming up so

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,400
we are about to see the cultural change

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,400
of changing from visual agriculture to

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,280
what I say is its best uh driven as

73
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,000
information driven agriculture built

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,160
around these value chains so

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,239
transforming big data so big data

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,599
requires analysis and interpretation

77
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,120
into information and then interpretation

78
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,879
insights into decisions now the size of

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,080
those I tried to capture a little bit

80
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,360
there's a heap of data there's a little

81
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,239
bit of information and I had to put

82
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,440
decisions into that Circle and B

83
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,680
decisions in I really wanted to say the

84
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,400
size of decisions to be a pinpoint on

85
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,159
that particular side so we are investing

86
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,840
PS of money into agricultural data we're

87
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:08,080
not investing PS of money into

88
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,440
agricultural decisions and in our area

89
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,920
the biggest goal that we'll have

90
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,080
particularly in southern livestock

91
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,200
species is integration of what I call

92
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,799
the uh livestock Enterprises with the

93
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,720
cropping Enterprises with the pasture

94
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:22,799
Enterprises with soil Enterprises all of

95
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,280
those things which are the multiac areas

96
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,280
of mix farming businesses and there is

97
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,799
not one single entity that's actually

98
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,920
taken that role and responsibility on

99
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,640
MLA the company I work with they're very

100
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,120
happy working about livestock decisions

101
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,879
GDC happy working about cropping

102
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,080
decisions the interface between our two

103
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,480
areas will drive Southern Agriculture

104
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,239
and yet we still haven't had those

105
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,280
discussions so that is the role we need

106
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,760
to do so Emer Technologies objective

107
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,920
measurements changing the area and I

108
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,079
know Tom and Troy will talk about that

109
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,280
uh genetics and genomics a couple of

110
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,959
years ago when we first started the the

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,840
CRC we started characterizing animals

112
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,079
and we thought if one or two genes could

113
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,239
we could measured that would be

114
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,799
fantastic then we got something that was

115
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,519
measuring 100 jeans then we got

116
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,760
something that measured 1,000 jeans then

117
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:09,799
we got something that was measuring

118
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,280
50,000 je then we got something that's

119
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:15,079
measured 700,000 je now we're doing full

120
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,400
sequencing at 3.5 million gen and the

121
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,840
interesting thing full sequencing costs

122
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,040
now less than what it was to get one or

123
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,160
two jeans 5 years

124
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,960
ago so all of that information coming

125
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,400
and then when you say to the average a

126
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,520
sea stock producer I know there are

127
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,639
several in the room not only are we

128
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,120
going to give you this information

129
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,639
around F we're going to throw you back

130
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,160
full sequence information that full

131
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,880
sequence information is basically one

132
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,880
Gaby of information you've got 100 so we

133
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,400
want to transfer down 100 GB of

134
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,639
information down on the current download

135
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,919
speeds have a little heart

136
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,080
attack right so all of those things are

137
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,479
emerging that area now with this

138
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,479
information management how do you

139
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:59,919
actually get all this information so you

140
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,120
know we talk in talk in terms of of lead

141
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,440
Yi we're talking single figures around

142
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,360
percentages of L me yield what happens

143
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,240
if I actually gave you percentages of L

144
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,880
me yield in 39 muscles across the body I

145
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,440
also gave you the meat color of all

146
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,720
those muscles I gave you the pH of all

147
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,479
those muscles I gave you the marbling

148
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,280
store of all those muscles I gave you

149
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,160
the consumer quality scores of all those

150
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,240
muscles and then I said here's all this

151
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,240
information there's at least 39 muscles

152
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,720
I've given you 10 pieces of information

153
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,080
go ahead and breed the perfect

154
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,120
care producers can't even do one yet

155
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,120
they bit like marinas they they get to

156
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,199
one and they can't count past that so

157
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,120
we're throwing all this information

158
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,759
directly into their laps and we're

159
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,240
asking him to make much more informed

160
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,639
decisions and that he yet to really come

161
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,240
I'm a bit worried about that particular

162
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,400
area so we've got RI tags and they

163
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,440
coming things the F PS for livestock I

164
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,880
made a joke about 3 months ago on

165
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,280
another Forum I said there'll be F PS

166
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,080
for livestock and I noticed yesterday or

167
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,479
two days ago there was a major article

168
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,080
coming out but they've actually done

169
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,600
exactly that they've now got 50 P of the

170
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,680
livestock and they're actually thinking

171
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,520
they're going to get improvements in

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,639
breeding efficiency in Dairy C while

173
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,759
about 10% through knowledge of that

174
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,240
information so sometimes when you make a

175
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,759
joke you got to be careful about the

176
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,280
outcome GPS tracking we're doing all of

177
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,440
these things so we now know virtual

178
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,440
stocking rates we now are changing our

179
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,319
feing lines for changing our pattern of

180
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,599
resource utilization based on this

181
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,960
information we got drones and sensors

182
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,240
are going up in that area we got water

183
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,199
and and fence sensors are happening all

184
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,360
the time and the area that I'm most

185
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,360
excited about is this biolog IC tattoos

186
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,520
when you start to put in tattoos on

187
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,280
individual animals with biologically

188
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,319
active inks and they paress at different

189
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,639
frequencies and that paress tells you

190
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,960
about the well-being of animals now

191
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,479
wouldn't that be exciting you can walk

192
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,759
out in the padic and all the heers are

193
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,919
bright green so you know that they're

194
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,520
all

195
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,880
happy now or more importantly wouldn't

196
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,560
it be really good if you put the Drone

197
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,560
up and they saw all these bright green

198
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,680
heers and they actually reported back to

199
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,000
you in your office when you're sitting

200
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,199
inside the pool having the drink all

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,479
your he is a Happ

202
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,160
right now that's not too far off and

203
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,960
again that's going to change the face of

204
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,960
Agriculture and particularly

205
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,000
the again it's going to take the

206
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,599
visualization out it will change

207
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,759
management skills and as Phil said

208
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,800
earlier I'm starting to see that we're

209
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,240
going to change a way from Farm managers

210
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,720
to what I call a system as Engineers

211
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,319
systems Engineers actually take all of

212
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,800
this information and make effective

213
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,360
decisions they're not managing anymore

214
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,919
they're decision makers and again that's

215
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,560
a change in we havec the areas again

216
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,919
Chris people talk about it in her

217
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,840
session I encourage you to go and listen

218
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,639
to that later on is all these

219
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,879
hyperspectral cameras and new deay Dex

220
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,599
x-rays all this information that's going

221
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,120
on it's just going to throw this Sami of

222
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,240
of information back to livestock

223
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,360
producers more importantly how do they

224
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,000
make effective decisions about all this

225
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,840
of this information how do they balance

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,919
up the fact that we tell them that lean

227
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,919
me yield and E quality have a big

228
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,960
negative correlation if you want to fit

229
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,000
it into value based marketing to adjust

230
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,000
for that negative correlation the real

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,039
value is actually optimizing on those

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,360
two principles you throw a neural

233
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,520
network at it he's the optimal profile

234
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,680
for exactly the the numbers of animals

235
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,280
that you need in each of these sequences

236
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,520
and in Northern beep industry we're

237
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,479
doing exactly that we're starting to say

238
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,440
based on your genetic profile based on

239
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,319
the r growth you've had up to 200 days

240
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,520
you go on a boat and you go to a

241
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,720
processing

242
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,919
work that's the type of information

243
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,120
that's going to come

244
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,760
forward and again SPAC of technology

245
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,640
that little thing that's a NYX color

246
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,479
sensor that cost about $300 us it links

247
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,080
to your iPhone it does a really good job

248
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,240
of objective color in both beef and

249
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,800
sheep we think that we're able to put

250
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,040
all of these uh these little Nick

251
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,120
sensors into a range of supermarkets

252
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,880
basically get crowd sourcing information

253
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,600
back as each of the consumers picks up a

254
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,320
piece of meat tells whether they like

255
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,760
the meat color or not they come back

256
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,959
next time they use a little sense and

257
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,600
they tell us whether they like the

258
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,160
product or not so instead of having one

259
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,160
or 2,000 pieces of information some we

260
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,480
might have 100,000 pieces of information

261
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,600
consumer capability of eating Quality

262
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,640
Meat car on a daily

263
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,440
basis won't that transform how

264
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,320
agricultural production will go and

265
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,480
won't that transform how companies

266
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,680
integrate so it's becoming increasingly

267
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,240
complex so biolog the biology of of

268
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,320
Agriculture particularly Livestock

269
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,320
systems I think producers and

270
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,519
particularly livestock producers do a

271
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,360
fantastic job of doing dealing with

272
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,360
complexity in decision making what they

273
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,079
don't do well is actually handle the

274
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,079
complication of complexity and we are

275
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:41,920
throwing more and more complication to

276
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:44,959
that complexity we are making decisions

277
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,720
metric five a minute and that is going

278
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,959
to influence how we do those areas so it

279
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,440
doesn't matter where you sit in the

280
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,120
supply chain this increasingly complex

281
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,800
system of moving from complex to

282
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,440
complicated it's going to be a real

283
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,959
Challenge and to show here's the red me

284
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,399
language CH uh value chain this is all

285
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:03,880
the information that we've got that's

286
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,839
going across there does a whole hip of

287
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,920
information all of these traits are

288
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,600
coming in place the really interesting

289
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,399
thing is there is not one common set of

290
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,560
language or standards that goes across

291
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,640
that whole agricultural profile there's

292
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,240
Heats of information collected to that

293
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,839
and not one part of each of those

294
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,440
sectors talks to each other there's no

295
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,880
stand in the meure right way across that

296
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,760
Spectrum so goal of decision making

297
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,040
understanding these whole areas so

298
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,160
livestock Enterprises and my challenge

299
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,279
for the the livestock producers in order

300
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,959
to to Really grapple with big decisions

301
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,440
and Big Data understand resilience and

302
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,639
adaptability of your production system

303
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,880
understand where the key points are

304
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,279
going to be there's going to be huge

305
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,200
opportunity not to live productivity I

306
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,800
think people focus on productivity a lot

307
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,839
in the supply chain at least in the meat

308
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,680
supply chain I work in the cost of

309
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,760
non-compliance to livestock production

310
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,360
far out ways the cost of any

311
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,560
improvements we can make in productivity

312
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,040
so people producing things to a market

313
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,760
Endo after 6 or 700 days and getting

314
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,639
that wrong is far greater crost to the

315
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,079
industry than liting productivity by 2

316
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,000
or 3% and as an example with the cost of

317
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,000
non-compliance and a couple of Supply

318
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,320
chains I've worked in it's about $52 an

319
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,680
animal the dark cutting which is one

320
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,760
industry issue it's $192 a kilo it's a

321
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,040
$50 million issue that can be solved

322
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,880
just with the data that we've got

323
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,320
available today so there are big gains

324
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,959
getting rid of non so less wastage of

325
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,079
resources is probably the KE for

326
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:43,079
agriculture more than anything else what

327
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:44,800
are going to drive some of these things

328
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:47,959
as I said before compliance to Market

329
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,760
specification there's $30 to $85 ahead

330
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:51,320
value based marketing well I've gone

331
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,800
away from the term value based Marketing

332
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,440
in my STP value based pricing when you

333
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,160
actually have value based pricing then

334
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,760
you allow the value change do the market

335
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,360
producers shouldn't get involved in that

336
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,000
area business efficiency and

337
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,200
profitability they're all going to

338
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,639
leverage this information and data to

339
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,120
information to decisions identifying

340
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:11,240
where those key areas is going to be

341
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,519
quite important and from an RDC point of

342
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,720
view when you actually use that type of

343
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,880
area you will radically change

344
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,560
investment portfolios in R&D if you know

345
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,720
where the key points of transactional

346
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,760
efficiency are you will change where you

347
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,560
invest R&D dollars and at the moment we

348
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,880
apply a shotgun approach to that type of

349
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,560
area

350
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,800
so lots of databases uh mid or MLA we're

351
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,959
lucky to be the custodians of a range of

352
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,800
different databases so we've got n meet

353
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,880
stands Australia livestock data link the

354
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,680
national livestock recording system

355
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,399
where the custodians have breed plan

356
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,800
where the custodian uh sorry with AB

357
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,519
sheet genetics on Farm software Bree

358
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,720
societies are all involved that animal

359
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,440
health there's all of these databases

360
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,839
that com in on

361
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,839
board very few of them actually

362
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,720
integrate to together to form big

363
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,720
decision so in one area a little bit of

364
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,079
on Farm software now is linking the

365
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,880
national livestock recording service

366
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,959
with the Bureau of me meteorology to

367
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,079
sell a little bit of information about

368
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,160
when we sell and what to

369
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:17,959
Fe probably about 2% of livestock

370
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,160
production is starting to actively make

371
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:21,320
that

372
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,639
prop then we get a little bit more

373
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,440
complicated when we link those NIS with

374
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,079
me standard Australia with Loft data

375
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,600
link together with bre plan and Sheet

376
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,680
genetics and the research databases to

377
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,279
improve the information of eating qu and

378
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,519
to show you how complex our challenges

379
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,320
are in the area of meat standards

380
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,760
Australia last year we graded 3.2

381
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,800
million animals each of those had

382
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,120
measurements of intros measurements of

383
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,000
color measurements of verification all

384
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,600
those other challenges we have a

385
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,240
national genetics databasing breed plan

386
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,600
with the breed societies which is

387
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,240
basically the world's best at the moment

388
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,120
how many records out of that 3.2 million

389
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,399
do you think went back into the genetics

390
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,399
database to influence genetic decision

391
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,360
making that's greater than zero not by

392
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,360
much actually

393
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:16,680
611 so the other 2.9 million plus we

394
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,759
lost in terms of that contribution to

395
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,959
the genetics datab and and in our case

396
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,800
MLA manages both of them and we can't

397
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:26,240
even connect them yet so that's the

398
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,199
challenge we have and here's an example

399
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,680
of of where the real value actually lies

400
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,560
Tom will probably use this later on in

401
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,560
his talk value based marketing pilot if

402
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,440
we actually understood the complexity of

403
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,199
L that yield if we actually understood

404
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,959
the complexity of uh heating quality if

405
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:44,560
we can apply that the system provide

406
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:48,800
that information back to producers over

407
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,120
105,000 animals is $18.8 million

408
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,959
difference between paying on weight and

409
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,199
fat versus paying on real value

410
00:14:53,959 --> 00:15:00,600
based

411
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:03,240
course so there's about 20 to $130 per

412
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,959
Animal by getting that decision right

413
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,600
that's a huge opportunity for the

414
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,920
Australian agriculture Industries to

415
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,639
look at so we've got a whole heap of

416
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,399
things there benchmarking and I won't go

417
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,880
through those but benchmarking gracing

418
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,199
systems host compliance the area that I

419
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,240
want to see our our Industries get much

420
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,160
more invoked in the BCA is about

421
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,160
supporting investment strategies we saw

422
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,160
this morning about investment in

423
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,279
agriculture the problem about investment

424
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,319
in agriculture is we are not using big

425
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:32,800
decisions to make that investment

426
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:35,839
decision for us so we can do a lot more

427
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,839
of those areas Health and Welfare the uh

428
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,199
spoke about brand DNA earlier on there's

429
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,199
going to be this Quantum need for

430
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:44,360
Australian agriculture to start to

431
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:46,399
underpin brands with information that

432
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,839
supports the brand Integrity in both

433
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,319
domestically domestic and international

434
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,480
communities and all that requires

435
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:55,079
information coming from farm right up

436
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,160
through the value CH so to deal with

437
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,399
that complexity is going to be a

438
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,600
challenge then you get measurement of

439
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,759
R&D investment all those other things

440
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,440
and the bottom line is total Farm

441
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:08,000
productivity or or profitability it's

442
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,120
the key area of big decisions now at the

443
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,680
moment with big data we are making no in

444
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,560
rides into that area with big decisions

445
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,000
we can probably transform that with

446
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,279
about a 5 or 10% Improvement that's the

447
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,279
type of quantum we can see in

448
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,279
agriculture and value chain efficiency

449
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,560
is just a start to give you an idea

450
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,519
what's already out there this is the

451
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,120
Irish system so the Irish and you think

452
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,279
the Irish are a little bit backwards and

453
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,079
apologies for those people Irish in the

454
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,920
room but they have a lovely piece of

455
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,920
legislation that saids if you breed

456
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,480
cattle in Ireland you have to be part of

457
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,440
that system it's great wouldn't that be

458
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,240
great piece of legislation to putr but

459
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,920
it means every animal in irland is fully

460
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,519
genotyped every animal all the

461
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,600
transactions right the way through its

462
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,880
lifetime are made when it goes to the

463
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,240
avire every piece of information is

464
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,880
actually captured it in the avire all of

465
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,160
that information fed back into a

466
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,319
National Database and that's all made

467
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,240
will back up into decision making around

468
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:07,079
genetics and completely integrated right

469
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,079
the way through the system you have to

470
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,520
be part of that now the really good

471
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:12,679
thing is the Irish tapped into the

472
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,240
European Agriculture Commission and they

473
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:17,679
got something like $70 million to

474
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,439
install and we don't have the luxury

475
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,720
doing that type of area so that's our

476
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:27,280
job New Zealand again system with New

477
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:30,000
Zealand that's about $187 million

478
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,280
today now we're talking about in nla

479
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,559
about putting a system that's going to

480
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,679
cost us $2 to $3 million we're not even

481
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:37,799
in the right ballpark when it comes to

482
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,679
these type of decision making so the

483
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,520
lesson learned from others about talking

484
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,679
thing and we've got a review out at the

485
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,200
moment it's about getting everybody in

486
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,480
the same room and think about where the

487
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,160
wind situations actually are so looking

488
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,520
for people to make decisions and

489
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,480
outcomes and the real key about

490
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,440
integration across the live stock chain

491
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,960
is that you've got to create the win-win

492
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,400
based on aggregation and aggregation to

493
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,200
leads to decisions at the moment Mick

494
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,480
might talk about later on about Open

495
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,440
Access platforms around data well the

496
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,400
real people are asking livestock is open

497
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,360
access around the algorithms that

498
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,080
involve the decision making because at

499
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,640
the moment there is no confidence in a

500
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,200
lot of those algorithms that involved

501
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,240
the decision Mak so we've got to get to

502
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,520
that M no one really knows what big data

503
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,440
is everything everybody thinks is going

504
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,120
to be important uh everybody's applying

505
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,960
a consistent approach and principles to

506
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,559
address that there's Democratic data is

507
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,280
the delivery through public available

508
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,000
apis and everything like that you talk

509
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,720
to everybody everybody thinks yes I'm

510
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,880
involved in Big Data you talk to

511
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,640
everybody about how to using big data on

512
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,600
collecting it collecting big data is not

513
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,720
using big data everybody wants to be

514
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,520
part of it and everybody thinks that

515
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,520
because they've got data they've got

516
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,559
value in big data and people have yet to

517
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,799
work out the only value in data is when

518
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:58,799
you aggregate that data to make a

519
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:01,600
decision and we have got to face a real

520
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,360
cultural change in in agriculture about

521
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,600
moving away from IP protectionism to an

522
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,760
open- Source platform that allows big

523
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,320
decisions to be made across agriculture

524
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,240
at the moment we're moving the other way

525
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,039
down other way

526
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,880
around information about genuine value

527
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,280
creating genuine value in the supply

528
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,480
chain or the value chain is a real

529
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,919
critical thing you can make decisions

530
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,000
you can give advice on those type of

531
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,679
things but unless they lead to tangible

532
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,440
value there be no impact on agriculture

533
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:31,880
as I said before data by itself is not

534
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,919
valuable and people are putting all of

535
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,440
these restrictions around data because

536
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,559
they think they own the data the real

537
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,440
key is to only algorithms that aggregate

538
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:43,559
the data that's where the real

539
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,440
information is going to be collected and

540
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:48,760
actually making the public Source most

541
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,000
going and people think that providing

542
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,720
data entitles them more value so I've

543
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,120
listened and we worked with people

544
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,159
recently that said I'm giving you this

545
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,960
data and in in return for this data I

546
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:03,520
expect

547
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,919
this now in many cases you can't

548
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,320
actually predict what you're going to

549
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,200
give them so how can you actually give

550
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,120
uh take their data without actually

551
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,720
understanding what you're going to give

552
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,240
them back and that's going to be the

553
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,600
learning experience to work over in the

554
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,280
next couple years and then industry own

555
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,000
data I mean as an RDC about 3 months ago

556
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,039
we blindly went into the belief that we

557
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,760
should set up a single National Database

558
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,480
set up all these algorithms do all these

559
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,240
wonderful things control a lot right a

560
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,679
lot of consultations power

561
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,720
is firstly helping set the standards and

562
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,840
secondly helping set the framework about

563
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,200
how you create the algorithms to make

564
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,159
decisions it's not our role to pull the

565
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,159
data together our role is to coordinate

566
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,720
and facilitate the opportunity to do

567
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,600
that so my challenge for the industries

568
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,960
are data is increasingly more complex

569
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,559
it's complicated and volumetric and if

570
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,400
you think farmers are struggling with

571
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,840
day to-day decision making they are

572
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,360
they're struggling with draft decisions

573
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,120
they're struggling with all these things

574
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,000
and suddenly we're going to put this

575
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,440
huge pressure on them to cope with the

576
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,480
information that's coming back to them

577
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,400
and I have already started to see some

578
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,240
of the producers struggling and

579
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,720
particularly in the sea stock industry

580
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,559
struggle with that transition from

581
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,120
visual to information driven decisions

582
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:19,720
and that is creating culture Big Data

583
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,760
must generate capacity to drive big

584
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,080
decisions so I hope everybody walks out

585
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,240
the room we're thinking about big

586
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,039
decisions rather than big data and the

587
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,159
key barriers engaging everybody along

588
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,120
the value chain and listening what Phil

589
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,279
said earlier about changing the value

590
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,880
chain that horizontal platform of

591
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,240
information transfer is yet to be

592
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,960
discussed because we haven't yet had the

593
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,799
real conversation about agriculture

594
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,640
about integrating livestock with

595
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:45,360
pastures and cropping and soils

596
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,840
everybody's wor walking in their own

597
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,039
silos and that big decision about

598
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,039
integration has yet to come thanks very

599
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,039
much
