  "text": "that's been one of my biggest fears since we've had this house out here is like a cow's gonna chew through an electrical line and kill himself and then i gotta deal with that grow your guard and find your tribe let your hearts [Music] hello everybody and welcome back to the terraform homestead today we're coming to you with a new series all about our solar system this is not a how-to video this is not an in-depth detailed demonstration of exactly what we've done if you're looking for that there are a bunch more resources out there on the internet that are much more educated and detailed than i can be in this video but this is what we did to get our system set up in a series we set up our systems uh one for ourselves one for our camp and with that enjoy this episode today i have been uh procrasti working all day which basically means procrastinating on the project you're supposed to be working on by working on another project so you don't feel bad about not doing anything i was supposed to be cleaning the rv uh we've got a couple people showing up in about a week um i think i'm pretty sure work wires you never know um so i was supposed to do that today but i just did not feel like it worked way too hard the last couple days and wanted to do something more fun so i spent the morning planning and researching and designing and all that kind of stuff and spent about three hours at home depot today um and got all this wood got all this wood and got this new electrical system i'm really excited about this we got our second tesla battery delivered yesterday so that will put us at 500 amp hours which is really cool lithium ion batteries awesome stuff and now that we will be having not just the tiny house but the rv and then our pump house um so we'll have to be running electricity way way out there um to run that that well pump decided it was a good time to upgrade to what our electrical system will be finally like done done eventually this will hold this whole area will be a workshop um so we'll end up building the workshop around the electrical box [Music] [Music] got it into its spot and up on blocks we have termites out here so anything wooden has to be elevated off the ground so that's why with the cinder blocks and in addition to that i've got some of these uh pieces of rebar cut and kind of hooked that i will be driving into the ground here and then i have these long carriage bolts and then i just put a washer in here um to kind of help further anchor this bolt in then now i'm going to fill these four with concrete and this will be locked into place one of the things that don't really think about out here in the desert it's got these black hinges and they've been sitting in the sun so now they're literally too hot to touch um so i gotta get my gloves to get these guys on doors are in and look at that so now i'm gonna get the roof in the floor in and the backboard in to mount everything i'm very upset right now with this cloud this cloud was over there and it's been raining the entire time but it decided to go around behind the mountains and then over here so we got no rain whatsoever on the property nice windy hot day great for filming um i have got in our line and i'm about to start trenching so going from the tiny house to the electrical box um and that's going to make it so they don't don't have these janky extension cords going everywhere that's been one of my biggest fears since we've had this house out here is like the cow's gonna chew through an electrical line and kill himself and they're not gonna kill that so [Music] today is the hottest day we've had so far i think our high is 101 today so this little cloud is providing just the tiniest bit of relief so it's 101 out and then i'm just on top of this motor basically and it's just it's hot it's hot out here in the desert no one ever told me that getting my grounding rod driven in this is no joke in hard soil i feel like the soil is the bait of my existence with all the electrical and plumbing that we have to do out here okay we've got almost all of it done just got this last little bit here by 10-15 feet and then we'll be done and then get to what i'm good at laying pipe kind of how it's gonna be i need some more parts before i can finish this out um as always never get everything in the first run but this is going to run all the way down there there's that post running some big gauge wire um i think i got eight gauge wire i'm pretty sure that's gonna be way better than this janky ghetto fire hazard that we've been living off of the 30 amp plugs go in here i got this this wire big enough that or the conduit big enough that i can run six eight gauge wires through it and so i'm gonna have a tee off here and then not right now but once i get the ditch witch trench here to this little spot and then kind of 45 it out to the water tanks here's the makings of the electrical closet so this is our second tesla battery um the other one's currently being used uh with two of them there that will give us 500 amp hours at 24 volts which is plenty and should be hopefully enough for the big house and everything we want to do out here so eventually this whole area right here will become my workshop and then i'll mount the solar solar panels on top and kind of thought about right in here doing a like a covered garage kind of thing just so we can get a little extra rainwater but that's probably a little ways out so the solar panels right now they're terribly mounted not oriented right but eventually they'll be mounted on the roof here coming into the pv box that will go to the charge controller batteries inverter breaker box and then breaker box goes to everything [Music] i've got everything mounted and now it's starting to wire everything up be a quick tour so we'll have an inlet here and i still got a drill that will go to this which is a pv combiner box that basically takes all the panels and then combines them into one cord that goes into our charge controller here that splits off and goes down to our batteries which these are two 250 amp hour 24 volt tesla batteries these will be connected um so we'll have 500 amp hours worth of power that goes into our inverter 4000 watt pure sine wave inverter that goes to our breaker box here okay so i've got everything hooked up [Music] there we go and we'll flip this guy and i'm gonna run over to the tiny house and see if it's working it would help if i plugged in the tiny house and we have electricity to the tiny house that's not a ghetto uh extension cord super excited that this worked the first time we are set up we are pulling about 800 watts right now in uh so i've got over here a string of 600 panels or 600 watts worth of panels and up there there's another 600 watts worth of panels those guys come in and plug into these two slots here uh it gives me another four slots to put in um and i've got on order about 1200 more watts worth of panel to plug into this the power stations pretty well finished up i've got everything hooked up here everything's live everything's working added on a outlet up here so i think i'm going to build a bench right here as a work table for a little bit until i get something to get the workshop more built we have out here and see maybe our percentage and then this is a cutoff for the inverter so that way i can turn everything on turn everything off from the outside and not have to worry about getting into the locked cabinet if i need to shut something off quickly really excited really happy for this um this is a big upgrade from doing it the other way [Music] i hope this was inspiring to you solar is becoming so much more accessible and diy friendly for those of you interested in maybe getting involved with us and getting some off-grid experience some diy experience learning how to use some tools learning how to build a house um please check out our link below for eco residency program we're gonna be ramping up our summer program very very soon and are starting to take some applications spaces are very very limited so be sure to get that application in as soon as possible thank you guys for watching i hope this was inspiring go build something cool [Music]",
