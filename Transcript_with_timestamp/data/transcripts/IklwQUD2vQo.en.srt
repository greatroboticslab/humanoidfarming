00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,860

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,080

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,660

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,520

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,279

mama she's a very old

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,539
yes I know you want food

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,000
everybody is ready for dinner it is a

12
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,040
late dinner for these guys because we

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,559
weren't here and we left too early to

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,840
feed them before we left so

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,600
everybody's anxious for their

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,980
dinner but Tabitha is having a special

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,719
time

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,059
not sure how much of this I'll be able

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,960
to film as it's already pretty dark out

20
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,280
here

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,280
and I've got to figure out

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,760
[Music]

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,460
yes we've got to figure out some things

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,739
so I'm gonna get my puppy pads and

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,540
towels

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,360
oh

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,939
how sweet is that Mama taking care of

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,420
her baby

29
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,180
not sure if you can tell but there are

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,979
Hooves presenting I'm looking for a nose

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,280
shortly

32
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:27,720
so that it'll be a good easy birth

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,159
and Ruby is trying to help mama let her

34
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,880
do her thing

35
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,880
good girl

36
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,079
good girl because this is active labor

37
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,500
I'm not gonna try to move her to the

38
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,299
birthing stall until the babies come I'm

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,960
just gonna make sure they have a nice

40
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,240
clean spot to be delivered looks like

41
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,700
she's gonna find that on her own she

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,439
knows what to do her instincts are good

43
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,040
even with this being her first

44
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,040
freshening

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,640
and her sweet old lady mama

46
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,040
Ruby wants to help

47
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,200
Ruby is retired for quite some time now

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,819
she's a lot older than the rest of the

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,840
goats

50
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,840
here we go

51
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,420
looks like

52
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,420
a nose is trying to

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,260
I won't interfere unless I have to if

54
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,060
she seems like she's having

55
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,800
complications but she really just

56
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,360
started pushing so

57
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,239
looks like she's going to be able to do

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,060
this on her own no problems

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,140
I know it's not easy though is it those

60
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,140
are our front feet so

61
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,800
that's good that's what we like to see

62
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,300
just gotta get that little nose

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,640
that's pushing

64
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,640
trying to come through once that little

65
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,379
nose comes through it'll be a lot easier

66
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,640
oh baby

67
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,640
sweet Tabitha

68
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,900
another good contraction

69
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,860
oh

70
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,920
yes

71
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,500
oh

72
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,720
good girl

73
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:15,420
hardest one is the first one baby gets

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,360
easier after this I promise oh there you

75
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,860
go oh

76
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,440
perfect

77
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,519
good job Mama

78
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:29,780
good job that's a big baby

79
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,780
Ruby let her clean

80
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,879
I'm gonna wipe off the Airways

81
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,440
and put it up by her face so she can

82
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,680
push for the next one because I'm pretty

83
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,180
sure she has more than one

84
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,200
well she pushed that baby out before I

85
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,540
could even

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,099
get anything underneath her or go get

87
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,620
anything to put underneath her and the

88
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,560
other one is already coming out too so

89
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,879
we're just gonna grab them up and put

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,319
them on a puppy pad and let her clean

91
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,659
them off

92
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:01,319
as she births

93
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:04,560
good girl oh pretty

94
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:07,260
oh that's a pretty

95
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,840
good job Mama

96
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,459
good job

97
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,019
oh she doesn't like the way that feels

98
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,760
hanging from her

99
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:19,380
oh honey it's okay come back

100
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,180
come back and take care of the baby it's

101
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,800
feeding time and Ryan is bringing in

102
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,560
food so she's a little confused about

103
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,639
food or baby food or baby but I'll take

104
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:33,540
care of it and make sure that it gets

105
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:35,820
the proper care she'll be she'll be

106
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,919
paying attention in no time

107
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,240
[Music]

108
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,280
well we had a little bit of coaxing

109
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,259
yeah a little bit of coaxing but we

110
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,900
finally got Mama to

111
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,520
the baby's nurse she's just being a

112
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,979
nervous new mom

113
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,500
but she's very interested in them and

114
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:57,780
talking to them a lot so that's good

115
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,680
inside everything should work out just

116
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,180
fine

117
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,340
but it's really important that that

118
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,020
first feeding the first night

119
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,300
happens

120
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,400
and letting the baby

121
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,020
figure it out a little bit as part of

122
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,300
that so that we know that the baby's

123
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,740
gonna be okay when we walk away but

124
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:19,340
sometimes daddy puts his finger in there

125
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,340
and helps

126
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,539
to get that initial latch oh disaster

127
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,539
is

128
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,960
sad so the babies have good suck reflex

129
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,400
that's babies are strong

130
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,160
as long as they get a good nursing

131
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,620
tonight and first thing in the morning

132
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,400
we'll check back on everything and make

133
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,400
sure it's all good

134
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:51,240
Mama's definitely interested in them

135
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:53,780
she's sniffing and licking and talking

136
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,780
to them

137
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,820
she's just a little unsure about them

138
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,780
nursing she makes her very agitated

139
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:08,100
you don't like it huh

140
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:10,680
yeah so we put her on the milk stand put

141
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,759
her head in the headlock gave her a

142
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,259
bunch of grain got their bellies full

143
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,470
and that's that's all we can do for

144
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,199
right now

145
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,880
[Music]

146
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,039
oh you come out from underneath my leg

147
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,550
go see your mama

148
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,800
that's the girl and that's the boy

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,800
[Music]

150
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,080
we are making sure they get a good

151
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,259
morning nursing in everybody stayed okay

152
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,940
through the night this guy's got a long

153
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,000
tongue syndrome I don't know what that

154
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:48,740
is but he's constantly sticking his

155
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,800
tongue out since he was born and uh

156
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,000
yeah he was just nursing where'd he go

157
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,080
where'd you go don't nurse in your

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,220
sister's elbow

159
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,220
[Music]

160
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,259
sweet babies

161
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,060
[Music]

162
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:07,740
well I may be having to bribe her with

163
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,160
food every time

164
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,979
they eat but I don't know I don't know

165
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,800
if she's nursing when I'm not here

166
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:19,560
their bellies didn't seem as empty this

167
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,840
time but I'm coming out here at

168
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,520
intervals that I feel like a baby would

169
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,259
need to eat

170
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,060
first fresheners are something you have

171
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,620
to give a little bit of extra attention

172
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,319
to to make sure everything's going

173
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,960
smoothly but at least now she's not

174
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,880
kicking at them and they're nursing just

175
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,259
fine when I give her a little handful of

176
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,699
food

177
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,699
so this is great
