00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:04,319
hi my name is nat from living the dream

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,640
permaculture

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,720
and today i'm going to talk to you about

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,639
some of my favorite gardening books

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,040
i was recently asked if i could share

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,719
this so i thought i'd make a video

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,960
and hopefully help some other people who

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,960
want to expand their library

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,359
to learn how to grow their own food

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,400
preserve their own food

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,400
and learn about permaculture

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,400
so i'm going to start off with the first

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,240
book i ever bought i bought this about

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,320
13 years ago

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,000
i got it off ebay it was a couple of

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,680
bucks delivered

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,520
and i only bought it because it was so

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,000
cheap and it's turned out to be one of

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,680
the best investments that i've ever made

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,879
he can still get this book because i

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,920
have checked recently for someone else

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,680
and why i love this book so much it's

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,239
based in tasmania which has

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,840
which has a similar climate to um me

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,399
here in hipfland

26
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,079
victoria i'm in a cool temperate climate

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,600
so i would only recommend

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,600
this for people who garden in a cooler

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,479
area this is not something you'd use

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,439
in northern australia and what i love

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,080
about it is that it's all organic

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,000
and it teaches you how to grow each

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,920
individual thing so here we have lettuce

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,080
and i'll talk about how to grow it

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,040
and the conditions that it likes and all

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,159
that sort of stuff

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,600
i've read this so many times and i enjoy

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,640
it and learn something new from it each

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,080
time

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,159
this is something that i'll definitely

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,960
have in my library if you live in a cool

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,960
temperate area

43
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,680
the next book that i'm going to talk

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
about

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,000
is this one that i got from the library

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,280
it's called soil food

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,759
and if you really want to improve your

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,439
soil

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,280
something like this would be really

50
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,680
awesome for you

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,759
in the beginning she talks about all the

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,960
different nutrients

53
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,560
and elements and how they impact

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,399
plant growth and

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,000
[Music]

56
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,000
soil health and it's really really

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,280
interesting um

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,320
she also talks about sources um and how

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,800
to naturally

60
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,080
put that stuff into your soil and then

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,160
we talk about

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,800
1 372 ways to add fertility to your soil

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,160
so it's a really fantastic book full of

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,360
great ideas

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,040
and if you are passionate about soil

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,599
have a read of this the next couple of

67
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,560
books

68
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,400
are from pat colby there's another one

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,680
of her books that i really want to get

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,959
and it's called

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,360
um cattle care natural cutting natural

72
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,879
cattle care so we've got natural farming

73
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,000
and natural sheep care

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:47,120
and basically these go through

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,120
soil health regenerative farming trees

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,640
minerals and vitamins and remedies

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,160
so if you want to farm naturally um this

78
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,200
is a really good book it talks about

79
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,560
minerals

80
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,560
um and how to remineralize the land

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,640
she uses different technique techniques

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,760
to other people um but i find it really

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,920
interesting

84
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,120
and she funds really awesome because

85
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,480
she's got

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,200
diseases and illnesses and how to

87
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,840
remedy that with minerals all naturally

88
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,000
so

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,879
we've used this quite a lot and that's

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,959
why we want to get

91
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,879
cattle one because we would like to look

92
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,159
up cattle diseases if that was to ever

93
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,879
happen to us

94
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,360
and be able to fix it before it became

95
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,360
an issue

96
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,760
also a local book um i do love local

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,480
because when i'm reading about it i can

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,640
really

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,480
um put that knowledge to use on my land

100
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,040
and this lady lives about 30 minutes

101
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,920
away

102
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,319
over the mountain ranges and she talks

103
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,319
about

104
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,080
all the different weeds and how to use

105
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,200
them um

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,440
let's find something um let's have a

107
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,440
look

108
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,680
comfrey or rocket salad talks about how

109
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,040
to

110
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,159
preserve nasturtiums and vinegar

111
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,360
[Music]

112
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,959
how to use it for health controlling

113
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
weeds

114
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
and how to eat them and how to identify

115
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,560
them so

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,479
i found that really useful in my area

117
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,199
especially with your foraging

118
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,479
but also on farmland because you get a

119
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,759
whole lot of weeds out here and

120
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,280
sometimes you don't know what they are

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,560
you don't know if they're poisonous

122
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,360
and you don't know if you can eat them

123
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,120
or not so that's been

124
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,479
really interesting really eye opening

125
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,199
because there's a heap of weeds that we

126
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,960
have here

127
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,199
that i didn't realize you could eat or

128
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,600
use as a stock fodder

129
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,520
and that's really beneficial something

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,440
like chickweed for example really high

131
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,639
in protein in the seeds

132
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,759
similar to quinoa or related to quinoa

133
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,759
and um yeah it's called fat hem another

134
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,199
name for its fat hen so

135
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,639
it's called fat hen for reason because

136
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,160
it really puts on the weight

137
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,479
these books are all permaculture books

138
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,759
so we've got the first three

139
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,479
permaculture books that were ever

140
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,240
written

141
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,520
so the first one ever written was

142
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,160
permaculture one

143
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,199
which is when david was learning under

144
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,160
bill

145
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,680
bill was the tutor um at the university

146
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,759
that david was studying at

147
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,720
and this was the book that he wrote as

148
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,639
part of his

149
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,160
sustainable degree i can't remember

150
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,400
exactly what that degree was but there's

151
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,400
something in sustainable sustainability

152
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,479
and so permaculture evolved from that um

153
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,600
and then permaculture ii was written by

154
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,360
bill

155
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,039
um delving a little bit deeper and then

156
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,520
introduction to permaculture

157
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,400
so these are the first ones i would

158
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,960
recommend

159
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,639
for beginners that want to learn more

160
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,039
about permaculture

161
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:51,280
and then the next one i would suggest

162
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,880
especially if you're on farmland is the

163
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,759
earth user's guide

164
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,840
um to permaculture and this is by rosary

165
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,199
morrow who is up in the blue mountains

166
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,720
in new south wales

167
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,440
slightly different climate to me um

168
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,560
or not that much different but slightly

169
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,960
different

170
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,240
but she's got some different ideas in

171
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,840
here and it's presented

172
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,440
really nicely you can see there that the

173
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,240
illustrations are gorgeous and really

174
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,520
helpful if you're creating your own plan

175
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,759
or just

176
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,039
um trying to implement some ideas on

177
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,520
your own property

178
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,560
this isn't bad for urban but this is

179
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,000
probably better for rural

180
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,720
next one i would suggest if you are

181
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,160
wanting to do your pvc or get into

182
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,240
permaculture design

183
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,800
is the basics of permaculture design

184
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,199
this helped me heaps during my pdc

185
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,880
and basically talks you through all the

186
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,720
equipment you need

187
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,000
and where to get started in your design

188
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,800
so base maps

189
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,160
sector analysis and then all the other

190
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,560
elements that you're going to

191
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,840
implement um in your design so it just

192
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,680
talks you through that

193
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,479
and i found this really useful so this

194
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,840
would only um be useful for people who

195
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,520
are wanting to design

196
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,880
i wouldn't recommend this for someone

197
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,199
who's just a hobby

198
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,840
permi um that is someone who wants to

199
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:16,319
get into permaculture as a business

200
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,160
as with this book the designer's manual

201
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,840
this touches on just about everything

202
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,120
you'll ever need in your permaculture

203
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,960
design

204
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,960
this is called the black book um

205
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,800
i use this quite a bit in my pdc just to

206
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,720
kind of get ideas and then i would go

207
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,440
elsewhere to dive deeper into those

208
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,240
ideas for example he touches on key line

209
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,560
which a lot of permaculture books do

210
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,360
and then you can kind of go to piero and

211
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,400
stuff

212
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,000
and dive even deeper into

213
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,360
what key light is and how to implement

214
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,919
it on your property but this is full of

215
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,440
so much good stuff very expensive and

216
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,759
hard to get

217
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,960
but if you are wanting to use

218
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,520
permaculture

219
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,759
as a means of income source then having

220
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,479
a resource like this on your shelf

221
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,240
is really helpful so it goes through

222
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,479
concepts in them and design

223
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,080
methods of design patterns and

224
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,400
understanding them

225
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,599
climate trees and their energy

226
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,280
transactions water

227
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:20,240
soils earthworking and earth resources

228
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,280
the tropics dry lands humid cool to cool

229
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,680
climates

230
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,560
aquaculture and then strategies of an

231
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,840
alternative

232
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,919
global nation so it's over 500 pages and

233
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,039
it's pretty pretty good book to have if

234
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,360
you want to

235
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,039
um keep referring back to different

236
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,839
ideas

237
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,880
the next book that i'm going to show you

238
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,440
uh

239
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,680
more cooking style books this is the

240
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,000
second book that i bought um actually

241
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,640
paul bought me this for christmas

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,959
and it's from stephanie alexander who

243
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,560
does the kitchen garden foundation

244
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,000
and this one's called kitchen garden

245
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,120
companion

246
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,640
and in here she lifts

247
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,720
a whole lot of stuff all the gardening

248
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,680
equipment you need different methods of

249
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,800
gardening

250
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:11,680
kitchen equipment um and she

251
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,720
has a really useful chart on when to

252
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,640
grow

253
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,959
um certain things so what time of year

254
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,399
and the different climates

255
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,360
and then she goes alphabetically through

256
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,640
a heap of different veggies quite a lot

257
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,200
of veggies i don't think i've found

258
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,040
anything

259
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,680
that i've grown that she hasn't cooked

260
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,800
with so um i'd say it's really

261
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:37,839
comprehensive let me try and find

262
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,839
a starter one so

263
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,240
we have asian greens she talks about

264
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,640
um they're an annual perennial

265
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,320
soil types soil preparation climate

266
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,000
position winter plants

267
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,080
water requirements how to plant

268
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,880
successive planting when to fertilize

269
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,920
harvest period pests and organic control

270
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,640
companion planting

271
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,720
special information and quantities to

272
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,720
plant for families of four

273
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,720
and then you turn the page and it's got

274
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
more information about all that so

275
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,519
growing and harvesting container

276
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,279
planting preparing and sharing

277
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,240
um especially for kids so she does do a

278
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,959
lot of

279
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,079
like i said kitchen gardens at school so

280
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,519
um she's really passionate about

281
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,560
teaching kids how to grow

282
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,320
and cook their own food um and then she

283
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,360
goes into recipes

284
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,800
which is really useful for when you have

285
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,560
a heap of something in your garden and

286
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,640
you're stuck for ideas of what to cook

287
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,600
it's nice to open up the book and be

288
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,600
inspired

289
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,839
with all these ideas and then yeah so

290
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,839
alphabetical and all the veg and all the

291
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:48,240
fruit you could ever want

292
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,240
so i really enjoyed that as a resource

293
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,880
i got this one for an op shop for a

294
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
couple of bucks and it's the same sort

295
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,279
of principle

296
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,600
except not as detailed he um

297
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,120
orders his by seasons and then he has

298
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,959
like the cabbage family

299
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,640
carrots and beets climbing beans

300
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,880
courgettes onions

301
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,279
peas and broad beans pizza potatoes

302
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,760
strawberries summer salad and tomatoes

303
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,720
now he's obviously in england because

304
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,839
jamie oliver

305
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,880
is from england so for me

306
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,760
i have to rethink the seasons and the

307
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,720
time of year

308
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,680
that he suggests to plant stuff um also

309
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,920
i can't grow

310
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,880
broad beans in summer so for me that's

311
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,440
an autumn

312
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,720
sorry uh late winter and spring crop

313
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,040
another summer crop

314
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,079
um but he's got some awesome recipes in

315
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,000
here and that's

316
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,920
why i've got it not so much for the

317
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
gardening advice but for the recipes

318
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,440
because his recipes are really awesome

319
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,720
easy to follow and yummy

320
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,200
um for australia you've got the commons

321
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,160
um which is from matthew evans very

322
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,000
similar to

323
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,200
jamie at home but his recipes are a bit

324
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,079
more fancy

325
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,839
um what i also liked about it was that

326
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,519
he's got a little bit of a diary in here

327
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,200
so he'll talk about what's happening on

328
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,079
his farm at

329
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,720
that particular time point in time and

330
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,800
um

331
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,839
his recipes are really awesome but

332
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,440
fancier so

333
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,440
um not as easy as jamie's but still

334
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,160
delicious

335
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,920
his other book that gourmet farm which

336
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,320
comes from its tv show i guess

337
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,480
um is also written um nick haddos in

338
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,600
here and ross o'meara

339
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,399
this is not so much veggie um but it's

340
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,880
more meat

341
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,760
and dairy and how you would preserve

342
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,560
them

343
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,200
into delicious things like cheese and

344
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,800
salami

345
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,120
ham sausages um so that's why i've got

346
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,519
this one um

347
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,720
there are a few veggie dishes in here

348
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,000
but it's more

349
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,399
so chicory um but if you

350
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,920
are on a farm and you're slaughtering

351
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,519
your own animals and want to make

352
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,959
chicuteri

353
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,959
this is a really good beginner's book

354
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,920
for that the cheeses in here are soft

355
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,760
cheeses not so much hard cheeses

356
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,000
but there are other books for high

357
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,240
cheeses and if you do need to find

358
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,200
a good book for hard cheeses let me know

359
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,920
because i've got

360
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,600
one that was recommended i haven't used

361
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,639
the recipes or all the recipes in it

362
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,720
because

363
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,959
um i'm still learning how to make cheese

364
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,959
and

365
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,519
now for some more nitty gritty books

366
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,240
books

367
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,519
that give you um lots and lots of

368
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,959
technical information

369
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,959
about growing um i got these from op

370
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,160
shops so i'm not sure if you can find

371
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,160
them easily or not

372
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,760
but they've been really cool um

373
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,240
horticulture australia

374
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,760
basically it's a reference complete

375
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,880
reference for the horticultural industry

376
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,240
and basically

377
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:48,399
it goes through um growing

378
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,399
planting harvesting um i can't remember

379
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,519
if this one teaches you how to

380
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,920
propagate by cuttings as well but this

381
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,199
is a nice technical book when we need to

382
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,720
reference um you know either an issue

383
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,160
that we're having in the orchard or with

384
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,560
other trees

385
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,720
um or had a graft or how to propagate

386
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,839
trees that aren't as easy to propagate

387
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,959
as others

388
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,560
um the ultimate australian gardening

389
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,720
book

390
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,160
great for referencing plants that we

391
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,199
don't know much about

392
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:25,040
um in design and in

393
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,240
on on and on our property sorry um

394
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,240
so it tells you all the different

395
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,720
species here we've got cholesterols

396
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,720
and all the different types so that's

397
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,639
just a nice little handy book

398
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:40,480
um and then the royal horticultural

399
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,399
um studies concise inclu encyclopedia of

400
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,519
gardening techniques so this has got

401
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,519
the grafting um propagating and all that

402
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,839
sort of stuff

403
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,920
if you want to go into more details this

404
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,720
is not just sowing seeds this is

405
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,440
um serious plant propagation which we're

406
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,800
trying to

407
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:02,240
learn more about and the last two things

408
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,920
that i would recommend um are two

409
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,839
books on c savings so i've just ordered

410
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,240
these books one is called

411
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,440
the seed savers manual and the other

412
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,920
ones

413
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,360
the seed savers handbook i'll put the

414
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,920
proper um

415
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,839
names down below and i'll also add the

416
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,279
names of these books down below

417
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,880
but basically one's an australian

418
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,000
version and one's

419
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,120
not um but they tell you how to save

420
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,680
seeds they tell you

421
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,480
how far away to plant different species

422
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,120
um

423
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,880
to stop cross-pollination timing to stop

424
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,680
cross-pollination

425
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,360
and proper harvesting and storage

426
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,480
techniques for all your seeds

427
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,720
i read the manual before

428
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,160
and it's full of amazing information um

429
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,320
but it's something that i'd love to have

430
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,000
on my shelf to quickly reference

431
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,639
because it's something like this yellow

432
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,720
book that i'd use a lot of

433
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,000
um and just keep i don't know work with

434
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,320
it but i'd keep going

435
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,320
back to it and referencing um

436
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,160
hiding under there referencing um

437
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,480
techniques and stuff like that

438
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,880
because um there's a lot of information

439
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,880
in there and a lot of it's new for me

440
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,920
um and it's something i want to get

441
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,000
really good at so we can be

442
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,959
self-sufficient in our seed production

443
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,440
so yeah i think really useful to have

444
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,839
yourself so i think my top ones would be

445
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,480
if you were to only buy a couple of

446
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,839
books

447
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,320
definitely that book and i'd say that

448
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,399
one too if you were to get two books

449
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,920
and if you were to get one permaculture

450
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,279
book i'd get

451
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,279
the infuses guide so they'll be my top

452
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,120
top three this one's just really really

453
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,639
good full of so much information about

454
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,160
how to grow

455
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,160
all your own food this one's

456
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,639
just great for permaculture design and

457
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,839
different principles in there

458
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,639
and then this one will tell you

459
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,759
successive planting and um how much to

460
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,639
plant for your family

461
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,800
but also great ways to use up everything

462
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,720
that you harvest from your garden

463
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,959
so i hope this helps you and

464
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,720
that you've found some new books to add

465
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,480
to your stash

466
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,480
thanks for watching guys see ya
