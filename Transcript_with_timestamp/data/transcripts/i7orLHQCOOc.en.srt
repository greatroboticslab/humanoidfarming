[Music]

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,920
probably one of the oldest methods for

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,119
irrigating Fields is surface irrigation

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,400
also known as flood or Furrow irrigation

5
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,480
this can be seen beside me this can be

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,240
accomplished by digging a ditch at the

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,160
top of the field water running down the

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,280
ditch eventually hits a canvas Dam built

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,280
by a farmer this canvas Dam can be moved

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,399
to a desired location in that field once

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,360
the canvas dam is built small aluminum

12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,399
pipes are used to siphon water out of

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,520
the ditch to irrigate the crops other

14
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,960
methods in flood irrigation is made

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,600
possible through gated aluminum or hard

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,079
plastic pipe each morning or evening the

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,160
farmer attending to this water opens and

18
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,160
closes the gates to distribute water to

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,239
different parts of the field surface

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,080
ation is used throughout Wyoming today

21
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,439
especially in the farming areas of the

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,159
North Plat Big Horn ly Wind River and

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,799
pure River watersheds nationally

24
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,680
approximately 29.4 million Acres of

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,520
Farmland are irrigated by flood

26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,040
irrigation each year as compared to 28.3

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,320
million Acres irrigated by spray or

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,600
sprinkler irrigation flood irrigation

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,200
may not be the most efficient method but

30
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,840
is cheap and low

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,240
Tech whether using gated pipes or crude

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,880
dirt ditches makes little difference to

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,520
the crop needing water all the farmer

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,560
needs to know is that he or she is using

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,640
a method that's hundreds of years old in

36
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,719
the making from the University of

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,280
Wyoming Cooperative Extension Service

38
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,759
I'm Brian SE and this is exploring the

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,759
nature of Wyoming
