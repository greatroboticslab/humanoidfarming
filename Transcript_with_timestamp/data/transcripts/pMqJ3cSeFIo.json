  "text": "[Music] Water scarcity will be a global issue of critical importance in the 21st century and ensuring safe drinking water and water for farming will be an enormous challenge. [Music] Low and irregular rainfall patterns are not the only reasons for drought. Irresponsible and unplanned development, environmental damage are worsening the problem. [Music] Climate change is causing weather patterns to shift leading to unseasonal rains, hail storms, dust storms, excessive rainfall, rising temperatures and frequent droughts. Natural water resources are drying up or disappearing at an alarming rate even in regions that receive nearly 200 mm of rainfall. Take Maharashtra as an example. 11% of the cultivable land receives 50% of the available water. Out of 225 lakh hectares of arable land in the state, 40% is prone to drought and 7% is prone to floods. Experts estimate that a farmer needs at least 3,000 cubic meters of water per hectare to grow one karif crop and one irrigated crop. As a result, farmers rely on bore wells. However, excessive use of groundwater has significantly reduced the water availability underground. Groundwater levels have dropped so much that it is common to find water only 500 to 1,000 ft below the surface. This drastic decline has disrupted natural springs and negatively affected groundwater temperature. Although people are now more aware of these issues, very few act to prevent the looming crisis. But there are notable exceptions just like Romesh Karmmar, a retired army officer from Junar, Maharashtra. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] In 2021, Romesh decided to give back to nature on his birthday by digging water absorption pits. on the Dhan Kale Mountain near Junar [Music] city. Tirelessly working as a conservationist with the support of his dedicated wife Swati, this couple has dug 70 soaked pits to recharge groundwater. These pits spanning 412 m absorb an impressive 8 lakh l of water during a single rainfall. A practice that they have continued since 2021. [Music] Soak pits are a traditional cost effective method for sustainable water management. They help water seep into water table beneath the soil. These pits store rainwater which then replenishes the groundwater. Continuous cut trenches are dug out 1 to 2 m or even lesser 1 to 2 ft and the excavated soil is collected on the down slope of the trench. Continuous control trenches help in reduce runoff, help conserve the soil and reduce the speed of onland flow of water. If there are large quantities of water then the soil water actually percolates into the groundwater and therefore CCTS are also considered as structures that help in improving the groundwater of the area. The Karmmade couple didn't stop there. They created an oxygen park by planting over 500 trees on the same mountain with public support. These trees not only produce clean air but also protect the environment by preventing soil erosion. [Music] Romesh's environmental efforts go beyond soak pits and tree [Music] planting. He has also addressed the problem of wildfires which have become more frequent due to global warming. To combat the wildfires, he cuts the dry grass into small patches and creates barriers that reduces the spread of fires during hot seasons and droughts. [Music] This approach is an innovative and effective way to prevent wildfires from spreading across large areas. Romesh's work demonstrates how ideas, determination, and relentless effort can make a real difference. Their initiatives serve as an shining example of what can be achieved through dedication and vision. Romesh's dedication to water conservation has led him to restore neglected stepwells and tanks in the Junar [Music] Taluca. [Music] for these forgotten water resources called as Baravs are hidden in plain sight but are now being revived with the help of local youth who clear the vegetation, remove the silt and repair the structures. In today's fastpaced world where people rarely dedicate time to nature without expecting anything in return, individuals like Romesh and Swati are unique and truly a blessing. While most people focus on themselves, Romesh and Swati stand apart as someone who nurture nature which in turn gives [Music] generously. Southern foreignch. [Music] [Music] Several individuals have contributed not only to create vast areas of continuous control trenches in aforestated areas or in barren areas, but they have also joined hands with government officials and with forest department to create unique ecological niches in the upland of Maharashtra. Their efforts in water conservation, tree planting, environmental protection and social service have earned many awards including recognition from the government of Maharashtra and the forest department. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. It is the perseverance of selfless individuals like Romesh and Swati that makes the world a better place. We should all strive to conserve water just as they do for the sake of our future generations. Water is the greatest gift of nature to humanity and we must protect each drop. [Music]",
