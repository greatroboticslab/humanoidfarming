  "text": "what's up modern stuts we're here at the Mother Earth News fair and we're looking at some nice gardening tools that this gentleman makes in his backyard let's find out how he does it so what's your process of making your of all these nice fine tools well it obviously it varies a little bit from tool to Tool but first step is the forging uh we start forging all the shanks first uh the blades I cut these blades out in a plasma machine we buy this in 4x8 sheets uh and depending like I say depending on the tool and quite what we're doing we'll do all the forging get ready to weld and then there's a cleanup step to get this uh down to pristine metal for the weld weld them on there and then the TRS for example they go back they go for another round of forging where I cup them and put the bend in them after that they sit and cool off a little bit to where we can mess with them again and then they go back into the forge a third time for a heat treat cycle that's the uh you can see the heat treat line here where we've got a hard Edge out here that Fades back to softer more ductal material in the center y uh from the way the slag holds on to it there so what's the best way to condition this after you've been using them for a while uh well after you've used them for a while a little bit of any kind of a light oil uh I like the beeswax and linseed oil because the wax gives the oil a little bit of extra tack to to help hold on um the reality is like these are dipped in beeswax and linseed oil now but uh they're all carbon steel over time they're going to pick up rust and the best way to maintain your tools is just keep using them awesome if it rusts uh you're not using enough go yeah you're not using it enough and once you start using it again it's going to be shiny again in a couple hours now the handles way just f with beeswax or tongue oil or tongue oil linseed oil little beeswax just the natural oil off your hand if you're using it a lot that's where you really want to take your time to take care of it is the handle itself don't leave them out where they're getting wet dry wet dry um take good care of the handle and the rest of it will be fine you yeah a little bit of rust on this isn't going to hurt it within the first couple hours of using it again it'll be shined up and and look like a new one again these tools are awesome guys I'm going to leave a link down in the description below hope you guys enjoyed that video don't forget to go check out will over at the homestead iron the link will be down in the description below and tell them hi from lumni Acres we'll see you guys next time [Music]",
