  "text": "all right fig lovers this is Ross the Fig boss in today's video we're going to talk about growing fig trees in containers and I think you guys are in real special hands today because I have dedicated a large portion of the last 10 years so learning as much as I can about this very special fruit tree the Fig and I've also spent during this time a lot of that time growing figs in containers but also growing other species of fruiting plants in containers as well I've grown a number of different varieties hundreds of different trees in containers and I have a lot of good advice I want to share with you guys in today's video we're going to try to make this as simple as possible in regards to these fig trees so the first thing I think that's really important can you actually grow fig trees in containers I know that's pretty simple the answer is yes and I find that of most of the fruiting species that you can grow in containers they do fantastic the problem with the fig tree in a container is that you met you got to make sure that you put it in the right size if it's too small of a pot this is a two gallon size here it's about eight inches by eight inches you're not going to see great production you're not going to see great fruit set you're not going to see good fruit quality and it's just kind of going to be a waste of your time I find if you're going to grow fruit fig trees guys in containers you got to grow them in at least a three gallon I mean look at the difference in the size and the productivity between the two trees I just showed you they're actually similarly aged believe it or not and this tree here in front of me is probably going to produce close to 50 figs every year if you really know what you're doing versus the other size that may if I'm lucky produce 20 or 25. so that's a big jump from just a two gallon size pot actually to a to a three gallon size pot and I would also recommend by the way going in a larger size as you can handle so I have five gallons in here I have 10 gallons in there I also have 15 Gallons back on the other side of the patio and those I think are great because they obviously the trees produce more fruit in that size but those are more of my permanent fruit trees my permanent fig trees in containers because if I'm going to be growing figs long term in a container I want to make sure I have the a bigger pot size first off they're going to produce more fruit but also I'm not going to have to typically root burn them as often they're not going to become as root bound as quickly and in these smaller sizes here like this three gallon we'll probably have to root from this maybe every other year every three years just to maintain the health and the productivity of this tree also if I went from let's say a three gallon size or a five gallon size which is going to produce about 75 figs a year and then I went up to a 10 gallon I'm gonna probably double my production so I would go from 75 figs to 150. so the larger I can go the larger I can carry the better off I'm going to be the problem is with a lot of us in zone sevens sixes and fives we have to move our fig trees in the wintertime and really some zones Zone eights some of you guys in zone eights may have to move them as well if our fig trees get below 15 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter time we need to move them away from those cold temperatures that 15 degree low maybe even around 10 degrees Fahrenheit is going to damage the roots of our fig tree and potentially kill it especially on the low uh the lower Hardy varieties that you guys may have everybody has a different fig variety and so giving you just that General recommendation of 15 degrees Fahrenheit would be the safe number for all fig varieties you want to make sure they are kept out of that cold and so that's the beauty of growing them in containers why would you even grow them in a container personally you need to be in either a short season climate that you can benefit by getting your fig tree awake earlier getting it a head start and making use of having a warmer soil temperature or you need to be living in a very cold place where you just can't grow fig trees in the ground and so that's the main concern I have with the pot size is that yes I would like to go as large as possible to get as much fruit as possible to also have to root prune typically less but I'm gonna have to move it at some point so a 55 gallon drum or a half whiskey barrel might be too big might be too heavy might be too much to deal with especially if you have a lot of fig trees so for me the three gallon or the five gallon size actually is perfect and if I have a more permanent tree I like to go to the 10 but a 15 is almost a little too heavy even for me to move so that's a big lesson there now let's talk about caring for them because we can't just have a tree in a pot and expect it to do well one of the most important things actually is fertilizer this here is just a bag of slow release fertilizer it's called florican and you can also get this by so many other names there is osmocote they sell it at Home Depot there's classic coat they're basically those little beads that are different colors they're very small and these little beads here as an example sit on top of the soil or mixed in the top of the soil and they slowly provide fertilizer to our fig trees every time we water and so this just makes it super easy I mean you can't get any easier they've already designed essentially on the bag you'll read about the nutrients that are in here obviously you want something close to a 10 10 10 or as close as you can get to a 10 10 10 or a 20 10 20 is also really good but they also include in the bag all the different micronutrients that your trees might need and so you essentially you can just apply this and be done with it I mean this is the really the simplified version of it if you want to get really technical I would recommend going to the blog that I mentioned before figboss.com guys we have a whole different article written there that's so much information about fertilizing if you really wanted to get in the weeds of it but this is a one-time application that I do every single spring to every container fig tree you read the label on the bag exactly how much you should apply and that's it I don't worry about it uh every time I water for a certain number of months depending on the fertilizer you buy it provides fertilizer and I do it day one of the growing season as soon as they start waking up the next thing in terms of care that's really critical is water and so I have all my fig trees believe it or not hooked up to a automatic Irrigation Timer this is drip irrigation down there see the tubes and this timer just does it automatically for me it's rather simple even if I had a couple fig trees I would still probably hook them up to drip irrigation they go through this tube here it automatically turns on and then they're every single tree has an emitter in the soil they're called spot spitters and you can get those products at uh drip Depot is probably a good company uh drip works I think is another one that I recommend and they all have roughly the same Parts same prices and you can't go wrong uh what you want to do is give your fig tree water especially during the growing season about a half gallon of water roughly every day you can start off with a fourth of a gallon especially when the temperatures are warm guys they need more more and more water earlier in the season when it's cooler and there's not a ton of leaves on these trees just yet you don't have to go crazy but as the season goes on as it's 90 degrees out here today you got to give these trees roughly a half gallon of water per five gallons of soil now if you have a larger container with more leaves bigger tree you may have to expand that but start off with roughly a fourth of a gallon then go to a half gallon then maybe go to a gallon and just from there you'll have enough water to keep your tree happy and healthy and that's roughly it one of the most important things though I'll mention when it comes to Growing fig trees in containers is the soil because you could water your tree actually too much especially when they're young and that will lead to root rot figs are very prone to root rot and so what I like to do is actually get myself a nice compost mix you can get Pro mix by the way that's an easy one just go to the store and get pro-mix already mixed for you it's peat moss and perlite a little bit of mycorrhizae in there you're going to be set otherwise get yourself some kind of compost blend that's organic that's a potting soil or a soil conditioner typically you can add things like bark vermiculite perlite rice holes different materials like that because we want to have somewhat of a well-draining mix in containers we don't want to have something real heavy we don't want to go to our yards and just dig up our native soil and put it in a container that can sometimes be too heavy especially if we're growing in a lot of clay worm castings could be good compost that you make can be good all these things really help the drainage and the air in our soil if we have good air we have healthy soil and then healthy Roots so that's really the key that's the main things other than that just make sure they're getting as much sunlight as possible the more the better and I would also recommend especially early in the season give them more warmth put them somewhere like on your patio that has a lot of radiating heat maybe it near your house maybe near a structure maybe just some way near big boulders or something just some way to warm up that soil and keep it warm for as long as possible the last thing I'll mention I for I almost forgot about this is Mulch and so wood chips are a great idea to add to any Tree on top of the soil I have wood chips virtually on every tree and I do this religiously in the ground but also now in container fig trees as well and this will just keep regulate the soil moisture and also regulate the soil temperature especially in places like Arizona West Texas Southern California it can be very hot we're in the South like Florida Georgia it can be too warm believe it or not to grow fig trees in containers so we want to put that Mulch on top and that's going to help really regulate that soil and we're going to be Off to the Races your trees are going to do great if you guys have any questions contact me on the blog figoss.com or put a
