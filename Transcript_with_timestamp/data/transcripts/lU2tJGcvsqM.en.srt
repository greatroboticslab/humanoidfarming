1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
Chris and I had the opportunity to

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,000
finally get down to the National farm

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,160
machinery show it was our first time

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,559
ever actually going I wanted to go for

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,059
years but running my business and being

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,219
such a small business it's hard for me

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,599
to get away for that many days and not

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,520
be able to do all the other stuff I have

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,960
to do but this year I bit the bullet and

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,820
went down there and it was a lot of fun

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,199
we got to see all sorts of stuff

12
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,699
it's been a couple days there or parts

13
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,800
of a couple of days talking to a lot of

14
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,779
folks the second day we saw things that

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,340
we missed the first day either you walk

16
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,920
right by it or there's so many aisles

17
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,180
that well you just get confused on what

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,340
you saw and what you didn't and they

19
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,960
have stuff for tractors big and small I

20
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,940
mean a lot of the the equipment that was

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,920
there is not really relevant to to my

22
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,960
business and to what I I sell or what I

23
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,760
use either but it's still cool to see

24
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,680
some of that really big equipment in

25
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,260
person that's in pristine conditions

26
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,940
right brand new showroom quality but of

27
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,460
course there were plenty of different

28
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,960
tools and tractors and all sorts of

29
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,520
Brands you can sit out and try them out

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,719
and see how they felt so a really good

31
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,760
opportunity if you ever get the chance

32
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,620
to go I'd highly encourage you to do so

33
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,359
they say if there's one show you're

34
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,040
going to go to this is the one we bumped

35
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,479
into a whole pile of YouTubers out there

36
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,040
too so you'll probably see some familiar

37
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,600
faces in the video but I thought we'd

38
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,580
just kind of take you through Mosey on

39
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,020
through all the boots that we saw just

40
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,479
kind of like you're there yourself so

41
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,479
let us know what you think here we go

42
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,479
foreign

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,060
okay so we're

44
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,060
let's get out of the way here

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,140
this is like this is like their 1025r

46
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,140
model right here

47
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,540
yeah

48
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,140
20s

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,719
see it's got one of those flip around

50
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,979
seats down there

51
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,979
oh there's no third function

52
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:26,360
yeah they're good looking tractors

53
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,360
they're good looking tractors

54
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,540
a lot of hydraulics there

55
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,200
it's cool Baylor

56
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,620
coyote

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,860
so where do we go oh I gotta check that

58
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,160
out so it's tree Terminator that could

59
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,160
be cool

60
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,580
no I'm just kind of looking around thank

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,580
you

62
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,280
well these guys uh the three foot one

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,000
oh it is a three-point mount

64
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,420
it's like a little mini one

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,099
I wonder if this fits on uh

66
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,099
if a subcompact would lift it

67
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,599
[Music]

68
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,599
things

69
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,440
a 20 inch

70
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:03,480
nasty okay

71
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,000
the hydraulic flow is almost the same on

72
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,379
the JCB all I need is 10 gallons a

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,599

82
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,380

83
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,720

you want to do all three

149
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,560

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,360
of thing too so yeah big crowd out this

375
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,440
morning we're just talking about I think

376
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,900
it's bigger today than it was yesterday

377
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,059
yeah

378
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:59,640
it is it is but the line even to get in

379
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:02,400
was long just you know through parking

380
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,280
and all that but that's a good thing

381
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,980
approach

382
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,960
oh yeah hey you got anything that uh for

383
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,919
like compact tractors that maybe I

384
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,919
should take a look at

385
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:17,880
selling our root rate grapples like our

386
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,440
baby baby

387
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,220
um the light the light duty wrecks yeah

388
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,440
uh so I just looked at those the other

389
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,500
day

390
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:30,419
well so the big the huge concern with

391
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,860
small tractors is lift capacity right

392
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,860
and so like the work saver

393
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,659
I really prefer that I I think that does

394
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:43,080
a better job yeah this thing

395
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:44,760
you put a six inch branch in there it'll

396
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,700
just rattle ahead this bottom to pick

397
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,820
something up oh yeah it falls you know

398
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,000
Deuter right kind of clean up this you

399
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:57,860
end up standing it on Android yeah

400
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,860
weren't they yeah yeah they are a little

401
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:04,320
so no 72 then for like a four series

402
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,120
no

403
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,460
people would love to have a two inch

404
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,440
receiver in those Forks they would they

405
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,539
would

406
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,039
I'll just orders a whole pile and I and

407
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,780
I haven't bring a few skins you know

408
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:18,419
what do they come in six packs or 12

409
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,220
packs a game remember but um

410
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:21,360
so on right off the top of my head I

411
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,400
don't

412
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,320
I don't charge card okay and then the

413
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,700
pulverizing basket at the end that's

414
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,380
going to break down the rest of your

415
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,900
clumps and kind of give you a smooth

416
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,020
finish okay all right I think quite a

417
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,140
bit lower than one of these guys for

418
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,140

419
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,580
big old

420
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:50,480
well but still even though the business

421
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,480
end down here

422
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:08,539

440
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,559
compact tractor type stuff though

441
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,160
[Music]

447
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,120
what am I missing here

448
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:24,240
so there's some sights and sounds for

449
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:25,559
you just kind of well let's just say it

450
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,360
was a lot busier the second day than it

451
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,620
was the first I don't know what the last

452
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,240
couple days are like but we went the

453
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,400
first two days and and they got really

454
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,140
packed out

455
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,820
but man it was a good time I think we'll

456
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,960
probably make it down there again I just

457
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,279
kind of moseyed around and Chris

458
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,600
followed along with the camera I think

459
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:42,120
next time we do it though we'll probably

460
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,740
both be miked up a lot of good

461
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,000
well you're just noticing things right

462
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,140
so a lot of new equipment that you're

463
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,520
seeing you're trying to figure out what

464
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,080
some of it is or maybe what

465
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,000
differentiates it and so there was a lot

466
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,200
of good back and forth banter we talked

467
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,059
to quite a few reps too that was pretty

468
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,260
fun now of course we do sell tractor to

469
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:57,740

00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,059
