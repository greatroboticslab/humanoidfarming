  "text": "all right everybody this is ross i thought in today's video we would talk all about pruning fruit trees and not just you know these peaches behind me here but also a lot of the stone fruits a lot of the apples the pears we'll probably look at the persimmons and we may even look at the grapes as well but i want to just cover pruning and show you some of the pruning i've been doing over the last week or two i've already at this point come over the trees about two or three times and have made my cuts i've come back again later and then made more cuts and have reevaluated the trees and i thought it would just be you know rather than just showing you guys this whole process of every cut i made i think that's an entertaining video but i don't think it's a very educational video i wanted to really just show you guys the shape of the trees now this i think is worth more than just showing you where the cuts are let me show you and talk about why i made certain cuts on these trees um so that you get in it you can get an understanding you know you can get the blueprint you get the book the manual so that when you actually do this at home on your own trees this makes a lot more sense to you we're going to show you guys older trees younger trees trees of different sized root stocks and many different species of trees so these are the espalier peaches the only real way that peaches work and every tree is different is if you renew the wood every year right you have to have one year old wood to get the fruit buds so this is one year old wood you can tell by the color of the wood it's typically a redder color and the older it gets it becomes more gray or more brown so you need to have one-year-old wood but if if you have a tree as an example that's an espalier which is really not what you should do or even if you had a tree that was a vas shape you still have to renew that wood it doesn't necessarily matter what the form is you got to make sure that you can set up a system and that's kind of what i've done up here at this top tier right we have three tiers in this espalier system you have to set up this open vase open vog shape because you're going to be able to renew the wood a lot easier that way now as an example we've already cut out a number of these big scaffolds here big branches that were three or four years in age so you can see this one here this branch is probably three or four years old as well and there's a number of these these are probably two or three years old this one back there is probably four years old this one coming out in front of me that actually is quite a nice branch i like this one how it leans outwards getting that sunlight and opening up that center of this top tier this is probably four years old as well so you know some of these scaffolds on a typical tree and we're going to look at that typical shape in a minute of what a what a peach tree really should look like when you have something like that you know you want to be able to take out these scaffolds at a certain age to thin this out and then have the scaffolds renew and replace themselves over time so these younger ones here are coming in to take up this space but at some point having both of these two right next to each other or maybe even this one right next to this one is just not gonna work we're not getting enough light we're not getting enough airflow and especially in the summer i mean if you can imagine these trees i've done a great job this year of opening up that center you can throw something right through that but even in the growing season in the summer this is going to fill itself in real quick right in that center so you got to come in here if you want good fruit quality you want less disease pressure on your fruits and even on your trees you got to come in here and thin out the center and even keep up with that during the summer so that's what i've kind of focused on this this bottom layer here of uh espaliers typically what i like to do no matter what the species is have the tr have the branching come outwards and sort of downwards um and that way it can uh you know take up this lower space it's easy to harvest even if i were to cut off everything up here i still would get a great harvest from what's below and it would get good light you know in that sense but if you're gonna have this upper stuff again and this is exactly what i focused on is cutting this stuff out in the center and making big cuts you know we cut out a scaffold there we cut out another scaffold right there and there smaller cuts actually on on those trees or on those branches and i've kind of thinned this out a bit more what i probably should do is even consider this again is because right here we have one two three potential new scaffolds that are coming in of a similar age i don't need all that you know even this branch here kind of is shaded out by this taller thing this taller system excuse the camera right above it so again this one here is kind of shaded out by this right here and if you kind of picture this it's hard to imagine but this whole thing right in this area is kind of a mess so that's just the struggles you know and it's better i think to cut out more than less because you know like i said all this stuff down there at the bottom will give me so much fruit i mean how many peaches can you possibly eat in a season i mean it's crazy how many peaches i get we're talking this year probably it's going to be easily in the thousands so how can i eat that many also i don't want to preserve that many or really any at all so the best thing i can do is give them away but giving away you know hundreds of peaches peaches you know that can be uh a difficult task unless you got like a food bank or something so you know i don't know to me it's just not worth it to have all this disease pressure up here that then lowers the fruit quality on the entire tree you know it's all about getting that light not just you know having that open center because that gets you the light in the center it makes use of the most photosynthesis on these trees right you want to be able to have every single leaf getting photosynthesis that is going to give you the most amount of sugars and carbohydrates the tree can generate to then put that into the fruits and you're going to see that in the the measure of your bricks if you were to take the bricks squeeze out some juice put it on a refractometer you would see a higher brix just by having a more open center having more photosynthesis hit your tree that's absolutely critical the other big benefit is the air flow which then uh you have less disease pressure right so it's a no-brainer on the peaches you get something called rot and it happens all the time in these humid climates it's so hard to fight and you could fight it with sprays and other things that you might want to do but just having the right form can go such a long way i mean it's almost impossible to avoid it but like i said if you get the right form and if you if i cut out more up here then probably i really should come in here again i need to come in here again to these trees specifically they grow so quickly their standards i need to thin this out even better than i have i'm going to get the best fruit quality possible and this alberta that's what this tree here is is here on the right did not fruit and has never really fruited that well in terms of its fruit quality right it's put out plenty of fruits but the quality's never been up there and i wonder if oh well maybe it's a lot to do with the way i was pruning my trees you know i it's crazy you think you know about pruning so you really get a crop of peaches or a crop of plums and they're just a disaster you know here over here let's see this is a younger persimmon tree and this guy is getting its form this is proc i probably could cut this out but i'd rather you know get all the fruit i could but this is the main leader here and i've made a cut there to cut out that central leader open this up a bit more you can see the scaffolds one two three four and we have some uh scaffolds up here potentially if i want to cut out something lower down on the tree like this one probably will come out in the future as it might be a bit more shaded than the others just based on the angle of the sun this is kind of the standard thing right you want to get your tree grow it up and don't be afraid to cut it you know that single stem whip as an example don't be afraid to make that cut do i have any single stem whips at this point i mean this is kind of here's a young seijo persimmon here it's just the main whip at this point there's some branching here at the top i just really want this thing to grow it's been taking a while to get established but uh you know that's it's very similar thing is that you want it to grow up as a single stem whip cut it back at a certain height maybe around your knee maybe at your waist depending on how tall you want your tree same thing over here with this quince this guy actually got killed back um by some branching that fell on it from the the shade tree above you can see that big shade tree there it's the same thing you want to make your cuts bring it back to a lower height and it'll start sending out these branches so even though i have you know two nice branches here on the left and right what i want to do is actually take off the tips and what i probably want to do is even bring it back even further at a lower height and really get that branching to come in at a lower point the more space over here this is more traditional sense younger trees these are plums of what you might actually want to do with the with your aspaya is actually grow something that should be a spy a to plum it's very similar situation having the lower growth down here forming this open center at the top and even if i wanted to i could bring this these branches way back and have some lower uh branching here keep that in check in the summer rather than letting this grow all summer just keeping it in check and i would get nice plums i don't have to have crazy sized espaye trees right they don't have to get like that you know i think it's nice to have all that fruit but um you don't really have to do that you don't have to maintain the trees like that i could if i really wanted to like i said bring back that top layer in the summer i mean we're talking about winter pruning right now but to be honest with you summer pruning is really important and i i think it's um something i'm really really going to focus on this year on all the trees you know i think it's important to get them established and not really worry too much about summer pruning where i'm at maybe in a longer season climate that'd be something you would do but getting them established i think you could just do that in the winter by keep cutting them back to a lower height getting that branching that you want keep doing that over time you're going to see success the birds are uh they're out and about it's just so warm out right now and then if i bring you guys over here i want to show you these two plantings this is really critical i think you'll learn a lot from these two here's actually by the way two of our cherries the white gold and the black gold just cut out the center that's all i really did made sure i even cut out the center within the trees themselves to have even more of an open center i made a big cut right in there i think i need to actually get a saw and chop that out i forgot about that but uh opening up the center of the trees but also making sure there's nothing here in the middle you know even in the future probably cutting out some of this other stuff that's going towards each other you got to keep that center clear and this is a great really good example over here because these trees are my plums um plum cots and apricots so these are all very similar in how they fruit and you can see i've done a an interesting thing here that you know dave wilson nursery has promoted and other people have recommended where you plant a lot of trees in the same hole and you can see look how many of those white things down there at the bottom there is there's quite a bit there's one two three four five six seven eight there's eight trees in a very small area you know it's just not something i would recommend it's it's difficult to maintain you don't really need to do this you plant one tree in the center and then you graft all the varieties onto that one tree probably a standard is the way to go and i think that's a little bit more difficult for the average person but it's way more difficult i think to maintain this and especially if you don't plant the trees correctly so this one here you can kind of see this tree is uh i think my satsuma or this might be the um you see here santa rosa so this is the santa rosa plum and this guy was just planted too much in the center of this planting so it's kind of occupying weird space and i've had to force the branching outwards because you don't want anything in the center right you want to be able to throw that hat through the middle you want to be able to even stand in the center this is going to fill in probably quite a bit in the summer got to keep on top of that as i said with the peaches but this is kind of just positioned poorly i i think and then even this plum cot this one here behind me i don't even the tag is now gone might be somewhere down here but uh this guy was planted even even in an even worse position excuse me and i'll show you guys actually what i mean if you can see that so ignoring these two trees this is a bit weird because there was one here that died so this one was growing out this way but you see what i'm saying here is that this is supposed to be clear and this tree should be more over here that was the santa rosa we looked at and then this tree back here this plum cot is right in the center of the whole damn thing and that's just not good because this thing is now occupying all that space in the center and i've really had to focus on pruning all the growth that was growing out this way or growing out in in just the wrong direction and this tree is in a sense kind of paying for it last year and this is why i've really come to this realization you know just with the peaches we did a video on the peach trees not too long ago and the peach video that we did talked a lot about disease and a lot about that alberta and how it didn't put out good quality fruit and how it's really fighting with disease over here and this planting that we're going to look at in a minute this tree here put out hundreds of peaches and it did not i did not get to eat a single one because of disease i know bugs plunker curlio is definitely a big part of that as well but you know between the rot and the plumka curlio i didn't eat a single one and you know what they weren't even that good they were nowhere near as good as they should have been because i couldn't get them to ripen to perfection and also because the tree was heavily shaded it was not getting the photosynthesis it wasn't getting the bricks that these plums need so by opening this up and really pruning out a lot of this tree pruning out all the center we should have a lot more success this year with this one um again it's just in a bad spot you know this italian prune plum is just odd and how it's shaped and how it's doing but you know we're making do with what we got and i think this is just a really good example of what not to do and that's why i'm showing it to you guys you know having this tree here in the center if you're going to do this here's how you should do it okay this is going to make a lot more sense because i have another planting in the front these are peaches and nectarines and the peaches and nectarines in addition to the trees i already have by the way it's amazing actually that you can just walk right through the center of this look how well pruned that is i mean that just looks gorgeous doesn't it now this is the back side this is the north side of the planting the sun comes from over here on this side of the house and then finally sets over here west so the sun is really coming through here like this and what you want to do again is be able to walk right through this i can stand in here there's no issue whatsoever so this is kind of what you want to do with these trees is have one planted here one of these guys even if you're going to do it like this which i again i don't recommend it but if you're going to plant this many trees in one hole here's four and there's two of them behind me this is how you have to do it angle them away from each other pretend as if this is a scaffold this is a scaffold this is a scaffold and etc on one tree and you know what these are now a part of that whole system as well so instead of thinking of this as four different trees this is now one tree with all these different arms coming out again keeping the center clear and open that's the only way you're going to get good disease pressure good air flow you know good fruit quality with the sunlight coming in here getting as much photosynthesis as possible and that's it i made some big cuts right here in the center i'll show you guys and this is the key really has become the biggest um thing that i've done with the pruning this year and i think it's absolutely critical i would not be showing you guys this if it wasn't but look here's a big cut here in the center another cut right here in the center even these branches here in the center i've even topped them off and made sure that the growth is growing outwards again all that's growing outwards and then the same thing behind me look this is a big cut in the middle this was the biggest and most problematic branch of the entire system because this was a giant scaffold that was way in the center taking up all the space all this real estate same thing with this one and this one and that's really all i've done is i've come in here pruned out the middle this planting makes a lot more sense it's going to get a lot more light the fruit quality is going to be better but again i got to keep i got to stay on top of this because if i don't stay on top of it in the summer it doesn't matter it's going to continue to grow it's going to continue to do its thing and those branches are going to fill up the middle there's prime real estate for the sun in the middle of the trees so the tree is naturally going to think oh i got to fill up that middle space i got to take advantage of that but you don't want that you got to prune out that that middle stuff there and keep up with it throughout the summer that's how you're going to get the best air flow that's how you're going to get the best fruit quality so rather than showing you guys you know my actual cuts my actual pruning i thought this was a lot better to come in here and actually show you guys how i've actually pruned these trees the pears are a little bit different but you're trying to get that pyramid shape actually with those but even you know this is just good principles every tree is a little bit different but you're starting out young in a very similar fashion getting that lower branching getting an open center in most situations trying to think about light when it comes to actually pruning your trees and making those cuts thinking about airflow because everything we do is in an effort to promote fruit quality you could have you know 100 500 1 000 peaches a thousand fruits whatever it is if they're not of a good quality you're not going to enjoy them you're going to be actually pretty creeped out you're going to be pretty down on yourself because your tree is just diseased the fruits are diseased all this hard work and all this effort is just finally coming to a point where it's actually a problem you know as the trees get older you're going to realize this as the trees get bigger as the trees grow more quickly this especially in humid places you're going to realize that's what i have to do it's gonna probably hit you then now i hope it hope this got through to you now but we need to focus on this first and foremost in the beginning and it's so hard to realize that so don't be down on yourself but there's my advice guys thank you so much for watching take care hit that subscribe button you got this far and share this with your friends somebody uh you know that's just now getting into fruit trees i'm sure this is a good video for them to kind of understand what is it that i should at least be doing all right we'll see you guys later take care",
