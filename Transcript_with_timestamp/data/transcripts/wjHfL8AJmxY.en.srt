1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,199
guys what's going on today we are going

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,600
to talk about five

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,480
different tread patterns for tractor

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,760
tires this is a good variety here of

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,599
different patterns we're going to tell

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,080
you all about what you would use them

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,920
for

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,759
what the patterns are called price

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,760
points where to get them construction

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,359
all that kind of thing so stick around

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,880
oh yeah and if you haven't done so yet

make sure you read through the

15
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,359
description it's right down there as

16
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,840
well you're going to have links to where

17
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,000
you can buy

18
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,519
all these tires at get discount codes

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,320
all sorts of good stuff for you tractor

20
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,760
owners out there

21

and don't forget to check out the other

22
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,440
videos on my channel you might like them

23
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,960
let's go ahead and get the terminology

24
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,160
out of the way let you know what these

25
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,520
tires are called here because that'll

26
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,280
help you'll see these terms

27
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,280
used all over the internet if you're

28
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,960
tractor shopping or in forums or

29
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,399
different websites that kind of thing so

30
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,840
right here you have the

31
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,399
r1 ag style tire agricultural style tire

32
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,360
you can see it's a v-shaped bar pattern

33
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,840
here there's going to be different

34
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,280
variations of it but the general

35
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,520
tread pattern is going to be what you

36
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,760
see here kind of a v that goes back

37
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,320
very similar to what you see on all the

38
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,320
old style and current style but

39
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,840
farming machinery okay what's out there

40
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,439
in the fields doing the work that kind

41
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
of thing it's a very traditional style

42
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,560
of tread pattern and it's been around

43
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,080
virtually as long as tractors have been

44
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,320
around well at least with

45
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,280
rubber tires on them maybe maybe steel

46
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,159
tires too

47
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,759
this one here is an r4 industrial style

48
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,520
of tread pattern okay so it's going to

49
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,200
be a thicker bar it does share some

50
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,479
resemblance over here with the r1 but

51
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,880
it's going to be a thicker

52
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,400
flatter wider bar all right and so we'll

53
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,840
get into what the applications are in

54
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,960
the differences in a little bit but

55
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,799
that's going to be the difference that

56
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,640
you see here again there's multiple

57
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,600
variations of this depending on the tire

58
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,240
manufacturer and

59
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,240
maybe there's little hybrids or you know

60
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,439
specific applications that

61
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,799
would require something that's a little

62
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,000
bit of a different machine or even in

63
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,479
the construction world too but

64
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,119
r4 industrial this one here is called an

65
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,720
r3 tire all right so it's a turf tire

66
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,840
there's going to be a lot of variations

67
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,719
of these as well you're going to have

68
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,799
golf course tires flotation tires but

69
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,320
turf as you might expect is going to be

70
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,159
great for your lawns you'll see these on

71
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,520
a lot of garden tractors as well or lawn

72
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,399
mowers that kind of thing but

73
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,439
turf tire right here r3 next up this one

74
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,800
right here is going to be called the

75
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,000
hdap it doesn't really have an

76
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,160
r uh delineation that i know of but hdap

77
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,680
stands for heavy duty all-purpose tire

78
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,360
you can kind of see here it's a bit of a

79
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,680
hybrid if you look across here

80
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,280
a stab tire and the next one actually on

81
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,000
my tractor over here this is going to be

82
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,599
the carlisle

83
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,680
versaturf again it doesn't really have

84
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,680
an r delineation on there but

85
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,720
as a name might suggest turf you're

86
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,120
going to see it does share

87
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,480
some similarities with this style of

88
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,760
tire right here as well

89
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,840
so the big hitter is going to be the

90
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,200
application what these excel and what

91
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,480
they do bad and that kind of thing but

92
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,280
let's get to pricing first we can get

93
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,959
that out of the way

94
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,360
of course these are all the same size

95
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,640
tire here they're a 26 12 12 made for

96
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,400
the sub compacts

97
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,400
made for large garden tractors like the

98
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,560
john deere x700 series

99
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
your kubota bx the list kind of goes on

100
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,160
it's a very popular size here

101
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,920
for a lot of machines so if we're

102
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,599
talking the same size tire which this is

103
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,200
a really good example here

104
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,760
same price same price same price in

105
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,640
price more money okay so

106
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,920
you're going to have all your

107
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,440
traditional styles and you're going to

108
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,400
have a more advanced style the versa

109
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,920
turf over here

110
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,519
being the more money all right and we're

111
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,879
going to get into that as well however i

112
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,239
have links for all of these where you

113
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,640
can buy these tires whether it's on

114
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,959
amazon if you want tires and wheels

115
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,560
miller tire as well is a great company

116
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,239
links below to where you can get more

117
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,959
information on there get discounts as

118
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,319
well but

119
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,319
if you're looking for a tire in this

120
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,159
size links are down there

121
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,760
okay so now let's figure out why this

122
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,599
tire over here the versa turf is going

123
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,319
to cost more than all these other tires

124
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,599
right here

125
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,959
it's still a bunch of rubber right it

126
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,159
doesn't look like there's more material

127
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,040
there's really not anything super

128
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,239
special

129
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,920
about it if you're just looking at it

130
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,599
right the difference is going to be

131
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,280
underneath the construction of it

132
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,200
these are going to be bias right here

133
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,560
one two three four these are all bias

134
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,400
construction which is a

135
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,000
an old school way of doing it okay or a

136
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,120
cheaper way of doing it as well

137
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,120
and this is going to be a newer

138
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,000
technology it's going to be a radial

139
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
design which

140
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,519
michelin i think kind of came up with a

141
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,200
long time ago but this is going to be

142
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,720
fairly new to the tractor world

143
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,879
are the radial tires so you're going to

144
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,519
see those that terminology thrown around

145
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,840
a lot in

146
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,879
trailer tires and vehicle tires that

147
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,799
kind of thing but

148
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,159
in the tractor world it's fairly new so

149
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,680
if we take a look here at the general

150
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,920
construction of these tires you're going

151
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,040
to have a radial tire here the versaturf

152
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,280
versus a bias tire so a bias tire has

153
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,479
strands the elements that make this up

154
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,400
are going to go all the way from the

155
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,120
bead on one side all the way around to

156
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,520
the bead on the other side they may

157
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,199
come across at a diagonal 30 degree 45

158
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,720
degrees somewhere in that ballpark

159
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,639
but over here on the radial you're going

160
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,479
to have different strands different

161
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,639
elements that make this up and so your

162
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,400
contact surface that's up here is going

163
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,560
to have a completely

164
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,479
separate existence from what's over on

165
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,880
the side walls and what that means is

166
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,400
that

167
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,040
when you hit bumps and you go up and

168
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,800
down and the tire absorbs load and then

169
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,160
flexes and reshapes

170
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,720
you're going to have more contact

171
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,560
surface with the radial tire because

172
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,080
this is all one piece so as it kind of

173
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,960
ebbs and flows and it's almost like a

174
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,800
balloon

175
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,080
you're going to lose contact surface

176
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,440
it's going to increase you're going to

177
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,400
have a bumpier ride

178
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,759
you're going to lose traction at uh at

179
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,520
different moments as well

180
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,039
over here on the radial you're going to

181
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,639
have more of a little bit of a cushion

182
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,000
or a shock absorption so it's going to

183
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,840
be a more comfortable ride with

184
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,919
a radial tire but it's also going to

185
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,400
maintain better contact with the ground

186
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,919
which

187
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,440
is great for traction is great for

188
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,440
getting power to the ground

189
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,880
and it's going to just perform better in

190
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,479
those kinds of scenarios

191
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,759
so some of the benefits that come along

192
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,280
with that additional cost are going to

193
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,120
be a more comfortable ride because it

194
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,440
will absorb those shocks as you go over

195
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
it

196
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,880
you're going to have better traction

197
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,919
more power to the ground because of that

198
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,400
additional traction

199
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,680
and then longer tread life as well let's

200
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,440
go ahead and rank these bad boys on a

201
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,800
scale from one to five from best to

202
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,440
worst i'm going to put the information

203
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,759
below

204
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,960
let's cover lawns let's cover paved

205
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,880
surfaces let's cover

206
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,960
snow and ice and let's cover dirt and

207
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,800
mud all right first thing really quick i

208
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,720
want to touch on these versatiles here

209
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,320
if you have a larger tractor such as a 2

210
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,400
series 3 series 4 series

211
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,080
that kind of thing there or equivalent

212
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,840
kubota mahindra whatever it doesn't

213
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,800
matter just a larger tractor besides the

214
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,479
subcompact

215
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,240
right now you can't get the versaturf

216
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,039
however there are a couple others that

217
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,680
are out there

218
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,800
i just had them put on my 4066r it's

219
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,680
going to be the goodyear

220
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,280
r14 okay it's going to be a radial tire

221
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,160
again it's going to be very similar

222
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,120
you're going to see a lot of

223
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,120
similarities

224
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,039
to this tire pattern right here i just

225
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,000
put them on i just took my r4s off

226
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,400
the other one you're going to see out

227
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,319
there is going to be called a galaxy pro

228
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,000
r3 plus i believe it's called okay so

229
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,360
it's going to be an r3 which is this

230
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,280
tread pattern here but plus

231
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,280
so a little bit on steroids again and

232
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,960
it's galaxies take

233
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,319
basically on a radial like this as well

234
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,319
so radial construction

235
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,759
a bit of a hybrid there just another

236
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,120
option out there for you to consider so

237
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,479
you may have a hard time remembering all

238
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,080
this so i will put a reference down

239
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,400
below in the description of the video

240
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,680
too

241
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,440
let's go ahead and start out with lawn

242
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,039
now if you think of a lawn application

243
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,400
you want something to be gentle right

244
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,280
you don't want anything aggressive on

245
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,039
there so

246
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,960
it's not going to be too hard to imagine

247
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,720
that the turf tire here the r3 is gonna

248
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,759
be number one in my book

249
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,479
now a very close second or third you

250
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,000
know it's almost

251
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,160
a tie for second place but i'm gonna

252
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,800
give it to the to the radial here the uh

253
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,599
the versaturf radial here followed up by

254
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,680
the hdap

255
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,039
then we're gonna go r4 and then we're

256
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,440
gonna go r1

257
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,280
now a few notes here the r1 is going to

258
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,199
be bad on your lawn if you

259
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,800
enjoy a nice lawn if you have a nice

260
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,880
lawn if you don't want it to get ripped

261
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,520
up do not get an r1 tire and think that

262
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,960
you're going to be

263
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,639
just mowing your lawn and everything's

264
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,960
going to be hunky-dory this

265
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,400
here is designed for traction it is not

266
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,280
designed to be gentle on the lawn you're

267
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,639
going to have rust you're going to have

268
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,479
ripped up areas when you're turning

269
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
all that kind of stuff the r4 is

270
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,759
probably the most popular tire

271
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,599
out there right now for both subcompacts

272
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,199
and compacts it's going to be just fine

273
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,720
for mowing lawns

274
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,880
anything that you drive on your lawn if

275
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,880
it's going to be wet and soggy and damp

276
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,560
any of these tires here will cause

277
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,240
damage okay it doesn't really matter how

278
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,759
light or heavy your machine is

279
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,840
just don't drive on it when it's wet and

280
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,280
soggy so these two right here will both

281
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,479
give you a little bit of a problem if

282
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,400
you are doing circles

283
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,840
around trees in the same spot over and

284
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,199
over they're a little bit more

285
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,560
aggressive right just a little bit not

286
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,080
too much more than this but

287
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,840
that's why i'm giving this a nod and

288
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,240
these are second and third

289
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,639
okay next up let's talk about snow and

290
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,479
ice what is the best tread pattern here

291
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,639
for those conditions can you guess what

292
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,160
it is the best tread pattern far and

293
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,000
away the reason i ended up putting them

294
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,479
on my 4066r for this year

295
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,520
as well is gonna be this versaturf style

296
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,520
of tire right here

297
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,199
again on the larger four r series

298
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,160
tractors i end up going with a goodyear

299
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,639
r14

300
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
but basically the same very similar

301
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,120
tread pattern to that a radial

302
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,680
construction as well

303
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,560
i'm telling you these were amazing just

304
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
amazing in the

305
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,000
in the winter for the snow and the ice

306
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,919
around here last year you know

307
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,959
these tires right here not so much all

308
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,320
right so let's go ahead and rank these

309
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,440
really quick but we're going to go one

310
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,760
two three four and then five these are

311
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,399
the

312
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,839
absolute worst right here the r4 tires

313
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,600
they're just terrible i've gotten stuck

314
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,519
on the side of my driveway before

315
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,959
have been able to not make it up hills

316
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,519
but you're going to kind of see

317
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,480
a little bit of a similarity amongst

318
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
these three right

319
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,560
so quite similar in their tread design

320
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,000
turfs believe it or not are quite good

321
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,839
and i would take them any day

322
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,440
over the r4 tires in fact i would take

323
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,959
even the r1 eggs over here

324
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,440
these are going to be okay not super

325
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,920
great um but they're not going to be bad

326
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,160
the r1s so before the versaturfs were

327
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,720
around i ran hdap tires on my

328
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,160
john deere x7 series tractors absolutely

329
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,920
loved them i long wondered why they

330
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,760
didn't offer these from the factory

331
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,120
for the john deere 1 series the kubota

332
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,120
bx that kind of thing because i think

333
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,320
it's such a versatile tread pattern

334
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,399
so i'm really thrilled they came out

335
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,240
with this versatiff tire i give it the

336
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,320
edge over the hdac because it is that

337
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,680
radial construction as well one of the

338
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,959
biggest problems people have when

339
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,000
they're in snow whether they're pushing

340
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,360
it whether they're driving through it

341
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,680
whether they're plowing it

342
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,480
whatever they're doing is traction that

343
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,640
is your

344
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,399
engine your tractor your machine it's

345
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,600
got enough power to do the job all right

346
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,080
you might have the right tool

347
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,959
in front to do the job the weak link is

348
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,800
most often

349
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,800
that traction that point of contact to

350
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,839
the ground so tires and that kind of

351
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,760
application are

352
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,360
absolutely critical and while of course

353
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,519
traction is important in all

354
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,760
applications i feel like in snow and ice

355
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,680
it's really really put to the test

356
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,120
and it separates the really good ones

357
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,480
from the really bad ones

358
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,240
let's go ahead and talk about pavement

359
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,120
here really quick i want to include this

360
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,440
pavement being

361
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,640
you know whether it's asphalt you know

362
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,839
concrete you know

363
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,120
if you're in your shop if you're on your

364
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,880
driveway if you're in a big going down

365
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,640
the road if your main purpose is going

366
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,839
to be traveling on a road a lot or on a

367
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
hard surface that's where it's going to

368
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,560
kind of live

369
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,600
that's what this is really meant for so

370
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,440
this is going to be number five right

371
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,680
here your r1 ag tire this will be the

372
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,440
absolute worst for those paved surfaces

373
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,920
for the roads for concrete that kind of

374
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
thing

375
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,640
really beyond that i'm going to go ahead

376
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,360
and shuffle these three right here in

377
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,959
the middle

378
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,040
no particular order and then i'm going

379
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,600
to give the radial here the edge for the

380
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,600
absolute

381
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,000
best tire that you can get for paved

382
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,720
surfaces the reason the r1 here is

383
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,560
really bad

384
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,760
is not that it doesn't have traction

385
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,279
doesn't grip that kind of thing

386
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,880
but it is a little bit bumpy of a ride

387
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,920
just based on the construction of it and

388
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,680
it's also going to wear

389
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,120
very very quickly on those paved

390
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,880
surfaces it's just

391
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,480
it's a very aggressive tire and when

392
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,240
you're turning and twisting and turn

393
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,160
and just moving around on paved surfaces

394
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,200
a lot it's going to wear super quickly

395
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,320
and wear these out

396
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,560
and it's just not going to be very

397
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,279
practical you get into the r4s these are

398
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,480
going to be great

399
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,480
same thing with the turf same thing with

400
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,839
the hdap on your paved surfaces

401
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,760
going to maintain really good traction

402
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,959
they're going to wear very well

403
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,240
you're not going to wear through them

404
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,279
quickly they're going to last a very

405
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,880
long time

406
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,320
the reason i give the radial over here

407
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,000
the edge is because of the fact that

408
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,360
again it's a radial alright so you're

409
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,200
going to have a more comfortable ride

410
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,279
when you're on those hard surfaces there

411
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,279
where if you do come across bumps

412
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,959
you know dips in the road whatever the

413
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,240
case is that you run into

414
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,839
it's going to take some of that shock

415
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,640
out of there maintain better traction

416
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,959
across your whole

417
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,399
operating experience okay so dirt and

418
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,760
mud they kind of go hand in hand they

419
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,279
kind of don't you know whether it's dry

420
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,640
whether it's a wet soupy mess we're

421
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,519
going to go ahead and break this down

422
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,279
best to worst

423
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,279
the best tire that you can get for dirt

424
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,079
for mud are going to be the r1

425
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,839
ag style of tread pattern here they are

426
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,720
just an absolute beast that's just what

427
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
they were made

428
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,160
to thrive in you think about again go

429
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,120
back to farming you know you see the

430
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,320
tractor out in the field they're

431
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,600
planting all the corn harvesting the

432
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,040
corn whatever it might be

433
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,480
they're going to have this style right

434
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,600
on there because you never know what the

435
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,959
conditions are going to be

436
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,560
but you know it's going to be mud it's

437
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,519
going to be dirt let's go ahead and rank

438
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,279
these really quick you're going to have

439
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,320
the r1 being the best the versaturf

440
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,360
being the second best

441
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,279
the hdap being the third best r4 fourth

442
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,720
best and then unfortunately

443
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,480
your traditional turf tire is going to

444
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,760
follow up last now this is a little bit

445
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,040
different but i did have a skid steer

446
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,120
recently with these tires you got to

447
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
check out that video i got it buried in

448
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,360
mud

449
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,120
out of my hunting lease it was quite

450
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,079
humorous there but these tires right

451
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,320
here

452
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,440
they just they just have a lot of

453
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,519
limitations okay now

454
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,120
keep in mind a skid steer is a very very

455
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,880
heavy piece of equipment it'll sink like

456
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,320
a rock and that's exactly what it did

457
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,079
you know these versaturfs over here had

458
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,000
the self-cleaning cleats on here again

459
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,160
similar to the goodyear r14 or the

460
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,480
galaxy pro they're going to have just a

461
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,040
good

462
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,560
hybrid setup on there the h-steps again

463
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,000
have a lot of areas for grip they're not

464
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,959
going to clean out as well as

465
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,560
this versaturf is over here i just am

466
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,800
not a huge fan of the r4s

467
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,560
it's unfortunate they're on so many

468
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,120
tractors in the subcompact and compact

469
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,639
world

470
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,800
but of course you wouldn't expect a turf

471
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,600
tire like this to perform very well

472
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,800
in dirt or mud now on dry hard dirt if

473
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,399
you're just going into the woods down

474
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,720
the trail it's going to be just fine all

475
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,079
right

476
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,680
but if we're getting into those muddy

477
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,360
situations this is where it's really

478
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,560
going to fill up fast the cleats are

479
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,839
they're not going to clean out

480
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,680
and you're just going to be sitting

481
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,200
there spinning your wheels so a good

482
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,680
question that you might ask yourself is

483
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,440
why is the r4 tread pattern so extremely

484
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,040
popular okay and i think it's

485
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,120
a combination of reasons right because

486
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,880
tractors are used in a lot of different

487
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,240
applications you might use it

488
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,839
for mowing your lawn you might use it

489
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,480
for push and snow you might use it in

490
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,399
the woods

491
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,079
you know all the above on paved surfaces

492
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,320
so the r4

493
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,680
is really the all-purpose tire in my

494
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,120
opinion yes this is heavy duty

495
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,760
all-purpose hd ap

496
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,480
that's what it stands for but it's not

497
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,120
really viewed as a tractor or a heavy

498
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,000
equipment

499
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,839
tire so you get folks that see this tire

500
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,880
this is what they expect to be on a

501
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,959
tractor anymore

502
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,920
it's become so popular in the last 15

503
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,079
years or so that

504
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,560
probably 80 or more of the tractors out

505
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,000
there are rocking an r4 tread pattern

506
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
but they really don't excel at a whole

507
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
lot

508
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,920
except for not failing at most things

509
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,399
you know they're gonna give you really

510
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
good

511
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,839
uh where life you know you can go

512
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,360
hundreds if not thousands of hours

513
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,880
front tires are always gonna wear

514
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,079
quicker than back tires are

515
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,760
you know you're turning you're putting

516
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,040
more load with a loader that kind of

517
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,519
thing on there they're just gonna wear

518
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,440
out

519
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,959
they're smaller you know just everything

520
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
but the rear tires especially

521
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,560
you can go a thousand maybe even more

522
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,760
than that depending on the applications

523
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,199
that you're using it for

524
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,639
but i want you guys to see this from a

525
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,320
different perspective here that you

526
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,959
don't have to be stuck with the tires

527
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,399
that come

528
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,560
on your machine all right you have the

529
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,480
ability to change them out to keep a

530
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,880
second set of wheels and tires on hand

531
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,720
too

532
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,480
so if you have a spring and summer setup

533
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,920
and a fall and winter setup or

534
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,040
you have a month worth of projects that

535
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,880
you want to do in the woods so you want

536
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,560
to put a more aggressive tire on there

537
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,399
and then switch back to a different

538
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,480
tread pattern for the rest of the year

539
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,839
you can really mix that up just don't

540
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,680
stranglehold yourself and think

541
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,360
you have to stick with just the tires

542
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,959
that are on your machine right now

543
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,639
and now i know that does come as a cost

544
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,120
but it's something to kind of plan for

545
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,800
right

546
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,399
when you look at a machine you shouldn't

547
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,360
only be thinking well i get the tractor

548
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,760
and then that's it

549
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,440
tractors are just the the basic tool all

550
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,040
right you can outfit them in so many

551
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,320
different ways on the back end on the

552
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,320
front end and of course

553
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,360
even the wheels and tires well you got

554
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,639
to take a good look there

555
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,760
side by side by side by side by side i

556
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,199
think that's it

557
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,639
of all the different tread patterns that

558
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,360
are out there it certainly doesn't

559
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,040
encompass

560
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,040
everything that's on the market but it's

561
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,320
a pretty good variety and it kind of

562
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,560
gives you a little bit more insight

563
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,440
hopefully on where each

564
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,480
style of tread pattern will excel i'd be

565
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,079
very curious

566
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,680
very interested and i think the other

567
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,600
viewers would as well if you would leave

568
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,399
a comment below with your own experience

569
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,320
of these tires

570
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,000
i know we all have different experiences

571
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,079
this is just my two cents on the

572
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,639
situation i've used all these tires in

573
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,399
different

574
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,320
situations applications over the years

575
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,800
so it's kind of my own take on it

576
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,240
i get a lot of tractors in here hundreds

577
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,600
of tractors in here with different tread

578
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,279
patterns on them as well so

579
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,279
i can see kind of how they last over

580
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,480
time too just gives me a really unique

581
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,680
perspective to be able to share that

582
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,120

all of them that we're seeing in this

599
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,160

with all the hardware you need where

604
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,199
you'll just

bolt it right through long bolts right

606
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,600
through that one right to your other

607
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,680
tire here and get

608
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,839
a lot of additional stability there side

609
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,279
to side you can use a dual wheel adapter

610
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,800
just like this to get a lot more

611
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,680
stability on hills okay

612
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,360
side to side can be very dangerous can

613
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,120
be very concerning for a lot of folks

614
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,560
out there so whether it's wheel spacers

615
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,399
dual wheels you know there is a

616
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,079
potential there to shorten the lifespan

617
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,360
of the rear axle of your machine but

618
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,880
really that's a decision that you need

619
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,160
to make as the operator right

620
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,759
if you're going to choose safety if you

621
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,360
have really dangerous situations there

622
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,880
where you need to accomplish your work

623
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,799
you can either add spacers or you can

624
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,319
add dual wheels get that safety measure

625
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,160
there and just take the risk
