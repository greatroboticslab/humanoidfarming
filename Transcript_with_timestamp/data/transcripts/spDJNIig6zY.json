  "text": "hi my name is carl hoppy i'm the extension livestock specialist at the carrington research extension center and today i'm going to visit about feed rations for background in cattle and this is the fall 2020. this is brought to you by ndsu extension well new calf crops are here 2020 uh time to place them on feed and look at what type of calves we have you know these january-born calves are going to be big these april and june born calves are going to be smaller so we got a little bit of everything out there in the pen we have different colors we have different types sexes uh bulls steers heifer hopefully most of them are castrated if they're going to the commercial market and uh there's just a lot of differences out there but it's a new year and a new season a new group of calves that need to be placed on feet a couple comments here traditionally in background in calves we grow cattle and it takes feed in the northern plains where backgrounding state if we're in the southern plains we would still have grass or some type of feed resources out there which to graze so in the northern plains it ends up being a feeding state so that's kind of the difference between backgrounding and stalker cattle backgrounding means we're feeding them for a period of time after weaning now the feed prices follow the corn price that's traditionally what's been going on and it continues to go on that way so as corn prices are increased so does the overall prices of other feedstuffs increase as well let's go through some examples let's take a walk back in memory lane i like to i like to reflect on these just to have an idea of what prices were just a few years ago because you know we tend to even remember we only remember about a year back so not even that far at times what happened but in 2017 our corn price is 288 a bushel and our distiller's greens was a dollar i was 113 dollars a ton hays were anywhere from 65 to 85 a ton depending upon what it was and wheat mixes were at 95 and at that time we still had barley mulch sprouts in the region in which to feed in 2018 the price of corn went up to three bucks a bushel hay remained about the same price of distillage grains went up slightly as well as wheat meds and barley malt sprouts are not available in north made in north dakota at least now for 2019 just last year the price of corn did go up another 10 percent hayes remain about the same price wheat beds are a little bit lower and and distillers grains reflected the corn price and it increased as well now let's see what's happened for 2020 corn prices increase slightly hey in both alfalfa and grassy at least this is alfalfa hay for steers for beef cattle not necessarily for dairy cattle um have remained the same compared to previous years wheat meds has creeped up just a little bit distillers grains has increased quite a bit there's been a demand for distillers grains and the price is up canola meal prices are up as well and the price of corn size because the price of corn has increased the price of corn silage has increased as well must make note we have a lot of processing plants in north dakota some states don't have this opportunity that we have but if you're located in the right location and need some supplemental feeds the price of these feeds along with your freight might make it very competitive to bring that into your feed yard if you're in western north dakota you've got a lot of freight compared to being located in eastern north dakota distillers grains is quite prevalent throughout the lower part of north dakota and even into south dakota so uh the amount of co-product feeds better from distillers grains is quite readily available as well as wheat meds and we have uh oil crushes throughout north dakota that would make um soybean meal canola meal sunflower meal those types of things where the oil's been taken out we do have sugar processing plants in the state sugar beets that is and they produce beet pulp we used to have tailings but most of those might be going to the new ethanol plant that's producing up in grand forks north dakota here's just to run down the co-product feeds in north dakota rather than a map as i said we got five different distillery grain plants like five different ethanol plants that produce distillers greens uh in north dakota and actually several more throughout the region they produce both wet which would be like 60 moisture modified which is 50 moisture and dried which is basically dried 95 percent dry matter feed sometimes they produce what's called corn syrup but its real name is condensed distillery solubles most of these plants put this back onto the distillers grains that's why it's called distillers distillers grains with solubles although most time we just shorten it up and say ddgs which is dry distillers grains or just distillers grains we're talking about the water modified and for those people that do get distillers grains with solubles excuse me condensed cellular solubles they just call it corn syrup not to be confused with the corn syrup that comes out of a fructose refining plant a corn a wet corn milling plant like there is down in waffenton north dakota but that usually goes to the human food industry not to our livestock feeds so usually we're talking corn syrup and livestock it's always just great we do have wheat millings in north dakota the north dakota milan elevator is the largest mill in the world in one location and of course we the the taxpayers of north dakota own the state mill and elevator in grand forks and they're very competitively priced when it comes to events of course we have a mill up in minot carrington and fairmont and even some milling is done up in can do probably mild sprouts is only done in is it done out of state now in moorhead uh we don't have a milk sprouting plant well it's closed now has been for several years in north dakota we do have a corn gluten feed plant or a fructose plant wet corn milling plant and produces corn gluten feed as well as corn gluten meal meals about 60 protein usually goes into a lot of our dog food type diets pet diets not so much into our animal diets but corn gluten feeds widely utilized in the dairy industry and can be in the beef industry too uh the plant now produces only wet product that's how much the demand there is they don't even produce the dry we do have a couple of potato proposing plants in north dakota one in grand forks one in jamestown if you're on the list to get it year round you are probably their favorite customer it's really hard to get this product in the off season but it is available uh depending upon what the supply is b tailings again that used to be readily available but now with the ethanol plant located up in grand forks that utilizes uh potato waste as well as tailings um beet tailings that they might be more difficult to get a hold of beet pulp is still available when the dryers can't catch up or meet the demand of drying down beet pulp of course our meals kilometer linseed mill which is from flax sunflower milk and soybean meal are produced at several plants across north dakota one couple these plants are swing plants where they produce other it depends upon the time of the year that they're crushing what particular items right now we don't have a mill in north dakota that is crushing soybeans so consequently there would be no soy hulls available in north dakota but if you go across the border into south dakota there is plenty of million halls available in aberdeen of course there's always screenings that are produced everywhere but be sure to watch out for weed seeds that might be in screenings the favorite one now is palmer amaranth or or palmer pigweed and if those seeds are in some screenings that are brought in from out of state you have just created a a very weed herbicide resistant plant into your fields or your feedlot and just be careful about what you're buying when you're buying screening if they're locally from north dakota and sourced locally from north dakota that problem shouldn't be there with not swedes that can't be controlled with herbicides let's talk a little bit about cattle now there is a daily nutrient need for certain feed ingredients for cattle i'm going to try to lay out here that our most expensive costs for feeding cattle is in feeding what we call energy that'd be the starch and the fiber the animals digest and utilize to make their bodies grow a lot of times you talk about proteins but in reality it's the energy that costs the most and we do buy protein supplements to meet the needs but usually energy is the biggest expense so let's just use some assumptions we have a 700 pound steer he's eating three percent of body weight and that would calculate almost 18 pounds of dry matter feed and if we look in the energy world we can utilize two different terms to describe the amount of energy the animal needs it's either in mega cals of net energy for gain or simply placed as tdn which refers to as total digestible nutrients well for easy math we can use the 14.12 pounds of tdn needed by the animal and in order to get that the cost of energy when you look at the price of corn and just do the calculations for the cost per pound of tdn it comes up to be 5 cents per bushel so this example 14 times 5 gets 70 cents a day for the pro for the energy cost to feed an animal a 700 pounds tear now they need 13.1 percent good protein their diet if they're eating 18 pounds of feed that roughly means 2.33 pounds of crude protein is needed per day good protein if you look at the soybean meals or the other meals um it's 18 cents a pound in this example which means it costs almost 42 cents a day just in protein costs so just in that calculation alone we spend more money and energy than we do in protein but think of this when we buy corn uh we buy 80 almost 90 percent of the corn is energy but to eight percent of that corn or nine or maybe even 10 percent of that corn is going to be protein so if we need 13 protein in the ration and we bought corn and hay that's averages 10 protein we only need to add an extra um six tenths of a pound of crude protein a day so my math down there is 2.33 minus 1.74 pounds that's the amount of protein that is in the feed that we bought for the energy so we need to provide an additional six tenths of a pound of protein to the cattle at 18 cents a pound that means we spent a penny excuse me a dime so energy cost in this ration would be 70 cents the additional protein cost this ration is 10 cents and for those of you that wonder about the cost of water roll water would cost maybe two cents depending upon what your rates are in your location and the cost amount of water they drink but i like to point that out that water is actually a very cheap part of our ration but energy is most expensive and protein while we usually talk about protein a lot we do need protein to aid in digestion it's really only a small percentage the total amount of feed that we provide their animals on a daily basis let's calculate some numbers for feed value in other words cost per pound of nutrient the two big nutrients here are going to be crude protein and tdm let's take the first example canola meal uh it's ninety percent dry matter let's use the math on as fed basis and the crude protein in canola meal on an as fed basis is 38.7 percent the cost per ton as fed would be 255 dollars a ton the cost per pound then as adult is 12.7 cents you take the 0.127 divide that by 0.387 that's the 38.7 percent good protein and we end up with a 29 cent cost per pound of protein that's how we calculate cost per pound of protein coming out of feedstuff now we do the same thing in calculating cost per pound of tdn except we use that 1.27 and divide it by 0.621 that's the tdn energy of the of canola mil and that ends up with 0.84 we do the same math for wheat mints corn grain and distillers and as you look through there what's the cheapest cost of protein of a tdn we normally think corn grains the cheapest cost to tdn and that's exactly what our math turns out to be it's fairly cheap and it's it's a fairly low cost feed weed mints is right behind it uh fairly close and distillerish grains are somewhat competitive now if you look at canola mill that is definitely not an energy source that would use in our rations because the high cost for energy now let's look at the cost per pound of protein where's our cheapest cost per pound of protein it's actually in the distillers grains and then wheat mints and then canola meal actually are cheaper sauces distillation grains then canola meal then wheat mints and of course corn green would have a very high cost per pound of protein because it's not utilized for protein as a protein supplement it's utilized as an energy supplement so if we need energy we look towards corn if we need protein we usually look at protein supplements like canola meal however distillers grains can almost be considered one of those as both a protein supplement as well as an energy source and quite frankly wheat meds falls in that same category too so when you start looking at rations please keep these in mind as two co-product feed sources that can help balance a ration before i get into rations i'd like to talk about some feed issues in north dakota 2020. this year corn silage it wasn't as difficult for harvest as it was in previous years but we did like last year but we did end up with an early frost the first part of september we've been kind of used to having a frost that doesn't show up until the first part of october so he lost about a month worth of growth and of course when it freezes corn choppers are they want to have every everybody's asking for them to show up their place now because corn is ready at that particular time so the amount of delay you have from the time it froze to the time it actually gets chopped affects the moisture content of the feed and that in turn can affect the feed value so i always encourage you to feed test dryer silages like this picture of the corn was froze and you can see that kind of a light green color in the corn it dries out and there will be some poor fermentation due to x and metal lead to excess heating so i like this temperature gauge it's a three foot long gauge that you stick into the size pile and it tells you what the temperature is just a few weeks after chopping it was only at 82 degrees about a month and a half later it went up to 100 degrees which indicates there's more more air or fermentation going into the into the pile because of the lower moisture content one other issues that we've ran into this year is is dry edible beans it appears there's enough moldy and discolored beans that producers of dry beans can't sell them or market them consequently they've offered these to beef cattle producers say can you use those and in reality we can unfortunately we can't use a lot some of the research projects have shown that if you feed it a high degree you can actually like 20 30 percent even more of the diet the cattle will just stop eating so the recommendation comes down to limit to 10 of the rations you might be able to go up to 20 but watch cattle performance and if they don't decrease in performance continue on here's the things you'll see with cattle there'll be digestion issues probably some scours decreased feed intake and actually downright feed refusal remember one project using great northern bean northern great white northern great northern whites and the cattle actually i think 30 or 40 percent of the ration just stopped eating the ration and wouldn't eat actually had to discontinue eating that because you know animal health they'd die if they won't eat so cattle might eat it for a little bit be careful how much you can put in i suspect if you wanted to cook these you could probably eat more but cooking beans before feeding the cattle probably isn't a realistic thing for us in the northern great plains here's some rations for feeding cattle for the next four slides you're going to have different rations for 700 pound steers and different rates of gain and correspondingly different feed costs the first one is simply 13 pounds of grass hay and we need some protein and energy to add to it in order to get enough gain because grassy itself won't provide a two pound a day gain but thirteen pounds of grass hay and then seven pounds of wheat mints will give us a two pound a day gain the rations around the sixty four percent tdm the cost to feed per pound of gain is 42 cents if you look at a little bit better gain we have to change our rational realm we got to increase some alfalfa hay actually pick up some wheat mints why do we increase alfalfa hay because alfalfa hay has got calcium in it well wheat meds is really high in phosphorus and without the adequate two to one or one to one ratio of calcium to phosphorus you can end up with urinary calculating cattle you don't want kidney stones in cattle so you need to balance the rash for calcium phosphorus as well this is a real deal most time we don't have a problem with it but it certainly can if the rations are improperly balanced okay so this particular ratio will give you 2.6 pounds per day gain and 37 cost a gain please note that as our gain increases our cost of grain decreases now let's just use a ration that's got we go from 2.6 to 2.8 that's not much is it that's just uh just a few more pounds in this ration we used eight pounds of hay grass hey 12 pounds of wheat mids and we had to include limestone in an ounce per head per day just because of the extra calcium needed in this ration because wheat meals are high in phosphorus we need to add extra calcium so a 2.8 pound a day gain feed costs is 35 cents per pound a gain again as we pick up the rate of gain our cost to feed our cost per pound a gain tends to go less now here's another set of rations say we put up a lot of corn sides we had alpha alpha hay so alfalfa hey is the queen of forages corn slides is the king of forages in this example eight pounds alfalfa hey 29 pounds corn salad you might think that's a lot of feed but that's 29 pounds of wet feed which would be what's one third of 29 maybe 10 pounds of dry feed so they gained 1.8 pounds on this particular ration and the feed cost is 0.48 that's 35 ton corn silage and 90 dollar to an alfalfa hay now let's cheapen this up with some grass hay and corn grain and wheat mitts and in this particular example we've got 2.6 pounds per day gain feeding six pounds of hay four pounds of alfalfa hay two pounds of corn grain and eight pounds of wheat millings and our feed cost per pound to gain is 38 cents again as we increase the gain the cost of the gain goes down and if we tweak this ration a little bit more so we're giving them even more corn grain and uh less al they're only going to eat so much so we have to if we give them more corn grain we're going to have to back something out of the ration we give them less grass hay and a little less wheat mitts and now we got three pound a day gain and our feed cost per pound again is 3.6 so again the same true message rings true um that as we increase the gain the cost of the gain goes down uh please note that corn size you always get this comment wow i'm feeding a hell out of pounds out there can they eat that much the answer is yes because it is mostly water they're not going to be drinking as much water because they ate it in their feed okay now here's another ration a simple alfalfa hay and corn grain no wet feed here we can feed an all dry ration this particular one would be 2.3 pounds a day gain and our feed cost is 46 cents at 2.8 let's not go backwards to slide for a second uh but maybe i can't now we got another ration that's alfalfa had seven pounds corn grain 11.5 and then because we're not feeding enough alfalfa hay and quite a bit of corn grain we need to add a provide and a protein supplement and it's going to have extra calcium in it as well so it's going to be 1.5 pounds of that particular feed and then we're going to get a 3.1 pound a day gain it's gonna cost us 46 cents per pound to gain if we tweak this ration a little bit more and decrease the alfalfa hay and increase the corn grain a couple pounds i will get a little bit better gain at 3.4 and our feed costs are now down to 42 cents well now let's do another ration using grass hay and distillers greens 15 grass hay 5 pounds of distillers feed cost is going to be almost 550 cents per pound a gain if you look at grass hay corn grain and distillers we're at 38 cents and if we look at grass hay corn grain distillers and limestone because we're feeding quite a bit of distilleries and quite a bit of grain and and we're not getting calcium anywhere else but it's got to come from limestone all of a sudden we're at 35 cents we've got quite a spread going on here at cost of gains anywhere from 50 cents down to 35 cents and when you're doing your budgets uh this certainly comes into a consideration of what type of profit you'll make because if you're paying for feed and not getting gain you need to be careful of how you're doing things now we should talk about rates of gain in cattle low rates again are considered less than two pounds a day gain that works quite well for cattle that are going to be heading for grass cattle it also works quite well for replacement heifers we don't need to have a replacement heifer away 1300 pounds when she goes out on grass she's probably gonna go backwards lose weight if that's the case but if you have her 1.8 pounds a day gained throughout the whole winter and going up the breeding season she'll be in good condition away the appropriate rate um roughly heifers should weigh eighty percent of mature weight at their first calving and eighty percent of their first calving weight at breeding so um we're looking at an eight to nine weight steer excuse me heifer when it gets to be breeding time and a lot of times if you do the back math here 150 180 days on feed at a pound and a half a day will give us enough weight on these heifers to make them into breeding season without spending too much money on feed and getting them too fleshy because we are inventorying them until they're breedable and ready to go out to grass if you're looking to grow cattle without adding too much condition and conditions referred to as fat two to three pound average daily gain is where we look at three pounds a day for sixty days as compared to um two pounds a day for a hundred days uh different ways to grow cattle remember if you feed them really heavy um you might end up with fleshy cattle which leads us to the next light rate which should be greater than three pounds per day average daily gain that's almost what we call a finishing ration and it really would be we can feed it to young calves have just been weaned they're just going to get fat at an earlier age and if you're looking to get them harvested less than a year of age this might be the way to do it however feedlights feedlots like to buy cattle that have not been fed at these higher rates again because it might reduce subsequent feedlot performance however some cattle are genetically disposed to gain well even without any loss of performance and can grow and grade extremely well even if they're fed at higher rates of gain so if you know what type of animals you have you might be able to get this by get by with this and it works quite well especially if you're looking to get animals and you can feed them on your own farm until finish this is something that we do routinely on calves that are brought in weighing 5 600 pounds and trying to be sold at 11 to 12 months of age which can be done it just needs to be pushed you need to look at the historical performance of the cattle what type of cattle they are they'll give you insight of how you want to manage these of course the next piece of the puzzle is what is the market price going to be at the time that you're looking to sell these cattle and usually most of our spring-borne calves get fed to be dead come the summer of the next year and that's usually when the market low is so we try to background cattle or feed cattle to avoid marketing them into that particular time frame otherwise we end up getting a lower price so we can target calf gain with a balanced ration i always think of a balanced rational we have adequate amounts of energy and protein to give us our better gains and feed efficiency but when we're looking at a target weight i think about that as being the ideal issue of backgrounding so we wean calves we want to feed them for two months so we can get them sold after the first year we might have three pounds average day the gainers are go home that'd be 180 pounds in these calves or we might be looking at selling these calves six months from now into the grass cattle market that would be come april and people be looking for those calves there's usually quite a price for green type calves and green i mean under flesh calves that time of the year and uh 1.5 as your average daily gain for 120 days is going to be 180 pounds so in these two scenarios we feed for 180 pounds but we certainly changed the market window by quite a bit and of course different market windows can lead to different prices you can source core product feeds in different locations uh there is an info sheet on this website that shows where there is selected prices of co-products that are produced in north dakota with phone numbers and a spot market price available there let me just note that we can contract feed prices to cattle and they're usually low during the summer times and if you can put in if you can estimate what your need is for the fall time uh you can probably get into a contract at that lower price rather than waiting for the spot price and it usually gets higher after the first year whenever people start feeding big issue is when it comes to feeding co-products is how far the freight how far you are away from the plant or in other words how much freight there is some people haul a wet product hundreds of miles and i always have to do the math and wonder why they are doing that there must be other reasons other than cost to feed maybe they're looking for a wet product maybe they've got a trucker or somebody they're trying to keep in business the the real issue though is we can't afford to haul wet feed too far because the high price of of uh trucking after a while it gets to be cheaper to haul dry product if we're hauling it it's even cheaper if we raise it on our own farm and produce it that way usually for background in cattle we look for high fiber feeds and a lot of these coke products are high in protein as well a lot of our hays are usually a little bit lower in protein so by adding in a co-product it mixes well with our haste increase the protein sources ladies uh think about good feed bunk management good feeding management for your calves this is the opportunity for you to train them and how to develop their behavior of eating out of a feed punk when to eat develop their routine and that'll stay with them so far mother has been doing the mother cow has been doing that to the calf they graze the morning craze at night now it's your opportunity to train these cattle and how they are going to be fed we don't want to just keep the feed bunks full that means they can eat whenever they want to which we do want is to have the feed bunks filled to what the animal's intake will be for the day and then we put in new feed for what their intake will be the following day try to have the bunks cleaned up we usually practice what i call slick bunk philosophy that's where when you come out to feed in the morning their bunk should be all slicked up cattle have eaten everything they need and now they're ready to eat more and please practice that one of the big issues we run into is when you have variable intake eat a bunch today not so hungry tomorrow and then they eat a bunch on the second third day not so hungry they eat a bunch more on the fifth day in doing so creates kind of a yo-yo effect and the animal's steady-state condition and room and fermentation goes haywire and the cattle are not as efficient in digesting that food as compared to having a meal every day at the same time don't forget bedding we've done research at the carrington research extension center that shows where bedding can improve average daily gain in these calves and uh and it's not because they're eating the bedding it's because it's a nicer environment for them to lay on water should be kept clean so cattle will be readily willing to drink it try to reduce the amount of mold you feed the cattle if you do feed it you'll notice there will be digestive upsets especially in these young calves that are just developing onto a new ration you can keep cattle healthy whether it means antibiotics in the feed with a veterinary feed directive or working them through a shoot and giving antibiotics if they're snotty or just brief vaccinations there's a lot of things you can do to keep cattle healthy and when healthy cattle are healthy they consume lots of feed and grow very well adapt to ration slowly in other words we start with a step up ration one that's higher in forage and lower in energy content and as the cattle are filled up we after three or four days or a week or two weeks we bump them up to a higher energy ration a step up ration that would have a little bit more grain in it and then we might do that two or three times depending upon what our goal for rates of gains are we just don't dump a whole bunch of grain out there and hopefully they don't get acidosis and die on you that certainly is something that can happen so that's why balanced rations and step up rations are certainly utilized by nutritionists and it works quite well the old thumb rule way of feeding is you give them a couple pounds of grain along with all the hay they want to eat and then in two days we give them a couple pounds of grain and another half a pound of grain and do that plus a full feet of hay we do that for a few days and when they're adapted to that rash then we increase it again by another half a pound for two days and keep moving up the grain part of the ration until the cattle have matched your target goal ration that you're using for whatever gain it is we're looking for again balance ration there's lots of feed nutritionists whether it be your county extension agent or a feed company that provides this service there's lots of ways to put together rations for cattle and let's not forget there are the things that can prove feed efficiencies in cattle ionophores remits in their bulb attack can improve feed efficiency by five to seven percent implants the ear implants can increase average daily gain because there are steroid that'll in and they can increase it by five to seven percent and your feed per pound of gain can be improved by five to twelve percent these things can also control coccidiosis um if you ever run into coccidiosis outbreak in a group of cattle you'll wish that never happened and you will do anything in the future to prevent that from happening and use the onofores or declinate or co-rid our options to our feed things that we can add to the feed to prevent coccidiosis of course coccidiosis is usually an opportunistic type thing that always develops after a stress so if you have a blizzard that would be a stress cold weather can be a stress co-mingling cavity others new stress just being lean can be a stress so pack all these stresses on top of each other and coccidiosis might break out especially if you make a diet change or a ration changes iron energy that can lead to an additional stress so only one stress at a time don't stack them up and make them endure and then you end up with a health issue well in summary here let me just say that it looks like feed prices are higher this year as true this year is in other years higher average yearly gains usually have a lower cost per pound of gain we have lots of options out here in developing rations we tend to always use distillers grains and rations because of where it's priced and the availability and it is quite availability quite available but there are other feeds that are available out here too and we can use those if that's what you need co-products are usually higher in protein and fiber and actually work into a background ration very well in a finishing ration maybe not so much because they just don't have the overall energy density to be included at a high rate in the in the ration but certainly a smaller percentage could work and again your management in feeding goes a long way to good calf gains if they're used to being fed at eight o'clock in the morning keep them fed every morning at eight o'clock making different changes going a little bit earlier going a little bit later all leads to behavioral changes in cattle that can lead to poorer gains",
