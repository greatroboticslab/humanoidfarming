  "text": "hey guys it's Anne if you are new here and you are looking for an active homeworm farming Community you are in the right place today my goal is to show and explain my highest producing worm bin and there's just the two things that you need to know in order to have a very productive bin I call this the wedge system it's a little bit modified but we'll go through that in a little bit and if you're not new here you're going to see that blue has an empty spot which means that I've been doing a massive amount of harvesting this is about 10 to 15 gallons of worm castings that I've harvested in the last three weeks or four weeks since the last time you've seen the spin you don't need a five foot long Barrel in order to have this kind of productivity you just need a couple of good tips in order for you to be successful so what you're seeing right here is the overs from when I do my sifting so these are the ones that are not exactly you know finished so one of the things that I have started doing that is a little bit different than what I've done in the past is I have been taking these overs that are you know hard bits of stuff that the worms haven't finished and very likely some warm cocoons that have gone dormant and I've been putting these in with my prepared bedding instead of using the finished castings and one of the things that finished castings have that these don't have are usually some warm cocoons so my prepared bedding usually ages from three two to three weeks before I start using it and that is one of your first things that you need to realize is that you need to be prepared when you are doing your worm bin so thinking about the end in mind and basically getting ready to be successful and harvest as much as you can in the least amount of time with your worm bins so what you're seeing here are seeds and little bits of shells Etc and bedding that has not fully composted now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take some of these overs and I'm going to put those in my bin with my prepared bedding and I will link my recipe uh the video for my recipe up above here so what we're going to do is we're just going to take a couple handfuls of this in a 45 gallon tote with my shredded paper and coconut coir and this all of the you know nutrients all of the bacteria and fungi that live within the castings as well as the little worm cocoons in here these are going to explode into growth once they get into high moisture and they are going to start turning that bedding into castings before I even use it in my worm bin so I'm going to grab this and throw it over a couple handfuls the exact amount is not you know 100 percent necessary scale it to whatever size bin you're using to make your bedding if you indeed choose to make your bedding ahead of schedule for me that makes a layer about this deep all the way across the bottom and so now that we've got our handful of these overs let's start moving the wedge down getting prepared to be successful is my first tip so in the case of this bed this bin I'm doing a wedge system which means that all of the finished stuff is down at this end it's drier it has very little food left in it and the worms actually move out on their own so as I move this over you can tell this does have a decent amount of moisture and it also has some worms in it but this is the oldest edge of the bin so we're going to go through this and move everything down so that's what I mean by starting off with the end in mind my goal here is to get finished castings now these castings are probably about five months old maybe a little bit older and my goal here is to move them down here where I'm not going to mess with them I might put some air in them by you know fluffing them up every once in a while but I'm not going to feed this end and I'm not going to purposefully give it any moisture and in so doing I am going to set this bin up for success for a fast Harvest so what I'm doing here is fluffing this up moving it over the fluffing part gets all of the air in there so that it can start drying so little by little we're making sure to kind of go in order so first in first out anybody who's in manufacturing will know that as fifo probably also in retail so first in first out these are the oldest of the castings and I'm very slowly moving them over in the order in which they had been started now these castings will start to dry over the next month or so the worms are going to start moving down to the feeding end of the bin leaving us with castings that we can Harvest again in another month or so so what we're doing we're still we're moving we're getting into like the next area here this part's probably three months old picking out any of the big pieces here making my life easier when I go to sift so we'll still just keep moving things over I've had a lot of questions about the wedge lately and one of the things is that with the wedge and the little inset diagrams that I put I often put the 45 degree Mark for the wedge and I don't always or let's just be fair never um go in the 45 degree angle I just shove everything over the wedge method was originally made for Barnes to process like horse manure or cow manure and when they were doing that they're not doing it in a nice five foot Barrel here what they were doing is they're shoving it off to one far wall in the barn and that way every time they clean out a stall they add something and possibly at the far end of the wall they could take something out what they were trying to do by doing the 45 degree angle was to create air but in here we have me as the person or method for adding air to the system so I don't really need to do that 45 degree angle because we're not in a barn so I am just continuing to scoop here moving everything over and as I go around you can see I have a lot more worms here but that won't be true for long because we are going to get to the food end of the bin and they are going to want to move into that nice new food [Music] okay and I am trying to figure you know fill this up pretty high because as it dries it's going to compress so this bin gets completely fluffed probably once a month every other month Maybe so we're going to completely move it I haven't done a harvest this big in a very long time but needed a lot of castings for my beds because I've started some new raised beds recently and I needed the worm castings to get the biology going in a brand new bed and that's the best thing about worm castings it's not the NPK it is the biology in here that helps release all of the nutrients that's already in your soil I mean the soil already has a lot of nutrients in it for the most part at least mine does here in the Midwest it has a lot of nutrients but they're locked up and the biology in the soil isn't always sufficient enough in order to release all of those nutrients so what I'm doing is I am supercharging my own soil so that it can release the nutrients that I already have in my soil here getting the sticker out of here all right let's move the camera down and then we will get closer to the area that's already been fed but we're still doing the same thing we're moving everything over so this can dry so it can cure and so the worms can move all right hang on let's move over okay here we are down at the business end and uh last time I fed an enormous amount of rhubarb plants because I was tired of my rhubarb plants not producing basically I would get some some leaves and then it would immediately flower I don't know what its problem was but quite honestly I don't eat that much in the way of rhubarb I did offer the plants out to many people that I know and everybody already had their own rhubarb plant so I did try to give it a new home but that was not in the cards so the rhubarb is going to feed the worms and as you can see here I have a rhubarb plant that is still growing I don't know if we're gonna play Survival of the Fittest and let this go you can tell the worms are definitely working on that root it's getting all mushy but we'll move that down hitchhiker move that down with the rest of the food but you can tell they're already working on these big huge rhubarb stems let's split this open and see if we have anybody inside and there you go they love crawling in little nooks and crannies for whatever reason you can tell they've actually got their little castings in there with them hey so still moving still pulling out the stuff you can tell oh much much wetter much much more worms oh looks like they made short work of that mango seed take out my label here I had some radishes there we go and this is not super dry there's like a seasonal problem with the worm bins I go through a couple Seasons where it gets too wet when it gets humid here and then it gets too dry when the heat goes on but right now seems to be my sweet spot it's June it's 80 degrees in the basement with about 60 humidity so everything's pretty stable okay so let's see what we've got in the way of finished food just gonna kind of pick through here and see what I have and put that off to one Edge so like I said um first things first you know what is your goal are you trying to get a whole bunch of castings well if that is your goal you need to think about how quickly can you harvest and if you set up the worms to get out of your way because that is very time consuming waiting for worms to make up their mind to migrate so one of the ways that I can make things go faster is kind of make the area a little inhospitable so these worms are going to oh worm ball in the avocado I really I wish I knew it was what it was about the avocado shells that they just absolutely love all right we will put the party in the avocado back not to you know upset the little Fellers okay so we're still moving out the see if we get another worm ball down here we have an absolutely massive feeding for them today and we are also going to give an enormous amount of bedding because I did take out um three five gallon buckets of castings out of here so blue is getting a little skinny for anybody who's watching that's the uh [Music] uh chicken bones from a project last summer or last winter okay but somebody was asking in one of the Facebook forums do do worms eat uh different things and one of the things that they were asking about specifically was rhubarb and I told them uh you know don't tell but they most certainly do and if you go back and look at the last video you will see how much insane amount of rhubarb that I put in this bin okay so we are getting all the way to the end now this bin does slope a little bit this way so you the moisture also kind of gravitates to that way there are no drainage holes in here I manage moisture by you know adding wet or dry bedding or wet or dry food in order to mitigate any sort of problems that I'm having at any particular time with changing in moisture so there we go that is a big old route that they are getting into these were completely viable Roots less than a month ago and the worms have and they're friends you've got the little isopods in here and mites I don't see any spring Tails springing around but I'm willing to bet they're there I usually do have a very good crop of isopods in here there's about 15 to 20 pounds of worms in here so I get to feed a lot of food so if you're if your bin is much much smaller of course you need to get a get an idea of how much food you should feed in order to be successful oops and they have taken apart that avocado pit looks like I had another worm ball that I upended this one was actually in the avocado pit all right guys well we'll put you back the goal is to keep moving the more finished stuff to this end and the less finished stuff to the leading end so that I focus all of my worms and worm friends on the food that needs taken care of I don't like to to leave the food in multiple different places just because I want the worms to have one location to go to so that they get out of my castings and I can Harvest them ASAP foreign and then here is the last hopefully a little mostly finished part of the casting so this is a a pineapple I don't even know how old that is I'll have to put that in above I'll have to go back and look and see when we fed that so everything smells great not having any weird smells but they have totally annihilated all of that rhubarb that um I fed the last time so that's that's really good good job worms okay so you can see how now all of these worms are here and when they finally get finished with all of whatever nuggets of deliciousnesses in this part here they are going to move this way I think that's a potato a little tiny potato I did Harvest potatoes recently planted some super early in a grow bag in the basement and then put it outside really gave me a jump I was able to harvest some potatoes in June so that was that was nice okay now the second thing that you need to be successful is the hardest with worm farming and that is figuring out the moisture for the bin what is too wet what is not wet enough and honestly that is something that you have to basically watch what your bins do in your own environment and then write it down in my case I make videos but basically whatever Cycles you're seeing within your worm bins and in your environment you know keep a note of that so that you can be prepared for it the next time so like in the case of right now this is The Sweet Spot I don't have to attempt to make it wetter or drier it is completely managed all on its own but when we're in the middle of winter um or in the early spring when it's super wet then I do have to manage first things first I'm going to put a 10 gallon been of prepared bedding this is pretty dry and I want to put that on the bottom so that the food that I'm going to put on basically will absorb into this and make it all nice and tasty so they eat this has been in the prepared bedding bin for about a month this part was the top that dried out in the basement a little bit and then this part here was on the bottom and you can tell how well processed that is now that is because if you were able to look close enough you would see that there are springtails in there and I think I even saw a couple worms in there and they get started working on that bedding so that I get castings faster so if you keep the moisture correct in the bin where I keep all of the the bedding then we go faster and that's the goal more castings faster fast uh call on forbidden food okay we have an onion here and everything I'm putting in this bin works perfectly fine bananas nobody's worried about those bread you can tell that I soaked all of this bread in water first so that it would you know be kind of like paste if you put it in dry there's a chance that it will suck the moisture out of your castings and out of your bin and it'll kind of turn into a brick here's something that I haven't done before so this is kimchi I uh accidentally left it on the counter and it molded so unfortunately that kimchi over there is going to the worms but I have given things that are similarly pickled I've put pickles in the bin before so I'm reasonably sure that kimchi will be okay just like pickles were okay so we've got onions and then we're gonna give some more pineapple here lots of bananas here is a rotten potato that has been frozen and also thawed mostly so if there's any questions about this is zucchini and carrots and here's a tea bag um all of these things will be attacked and will be eaten appropriately here's an avocado that didn't make it and they will all just be exactly fine okay so in order to make sure that this stays nice and bug free I'm going to get them some more bedding wait but first let's add some grit and I'm adding this generous amount of grit for two reasons one I have a lot of it it is crushed eggshell I have somebody in my household that eats about a dozen a day so that means a lot of eggshells so even though the worms don't need this much grit the garden will use it later so it's going to be fine so in goes the next 10 gallon bin of bedding and again you can wait wait oh there's a worm okay so for me putting the overs from my screen into the bin with the prepared bedding I'm actually making kind of a miniature worm bin sort of and uh so this bedding it's also got some leaves in it it's got some coconut coir in it and all of that will make it nice and fluffy it'll help make the moisture even and also this will help keep any flies or anything away from the spin bucket number three foreign is a little bit drier but this is going to help so the moisture will stay down low and then the dryer part will stay on top which will keep all of the the bugs from doing things so I pretty much filled half of the bin all at once with food and paper all of the worms are down here for the most part and now that this part over here has food they're going to finish up over here because this is nice and wet here they're not going to want to leave this they're going to stay in here for another month or two but down there at the far end is going to become dry and they're going to move over here and then when this starts to dry they'll move down here and that way everything is very simple for me as far as moisture dryer medium wet and that is exactly what you need in order to cycle castings as fast as possible if you like the video go ahead and give it a muddy thumbs up if you're not a member of my worm family click that subscribe button and if you want to know what I'm doing when I'm doing it ring that Bell icon all right guys I have the playlist for this video right over here and if you've already seen that I recommend you watch this video over here alright guys thanks for hanging out with me and my worms and everybody have a good day",
