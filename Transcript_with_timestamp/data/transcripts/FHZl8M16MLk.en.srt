1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,560
the fight against coronavirus means that

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,920
everyone is talking about vaccines

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,519
but how do vaccines work and what have

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,719
ferrets got to do with it many human

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,160
diseases

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,840
like 19 are caused by tiny particles

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,880
called viruses

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:28,240
and by tiny we mean really really tiny

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,560
much smaller than a human cell

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,280
a lot of viruses have spikes on the

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,680
outside that are made of protein

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,120
the protein spikes help the virus to

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,160
attach to a cell

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,480
and eventually break into the cell where

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,160
it can do the real damage

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,719
this is what makes us ill luckily

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,680
when a virus manages to get into our

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,120
bodies

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,079
we are not left defenseless special

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
cells

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,000
circulate in the bloodstream and hunt

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,640
down viruses

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,640
and other things that can make us ill

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,239
these cells are part of the immune

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,720
system

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,920
two of the most important are called

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,040
phagocytes

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,240
and b cells phagocytes

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,720
destroy other cells the name actually

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,759
means

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,560
cell eta b cells

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,479
make the protective antibodies that kill

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,080
particular viruses

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:29,600
and other diseases when viruses get into

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,600
you the phagocytes seek them out and try

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,079
to engulf them

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,799
when the virus particle is completely

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,840
engulfed

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,920
by the phagocytes it is broken up and

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,960
destroyed but the phagocyte

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,360
doesn't throw away all the bits of the

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,479
virus straight away

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,000
it keeps the viral protein spikes the

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,280
thing the virus uses

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,200
to attach to your cells and

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,079
it shows them to the b cells

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,360
the b cells can now start to make

48
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,560
antibodies

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,840
which are a perfect fit for that

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,760
particular protein spike millions of

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,879
these antibodies are released

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,560
into the blood the antibodies stick to

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,840
the virus so it cannot

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,720
attach to your cells any longer

55
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,640
once b cells have made antibodies for a

56
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,760
particular virus

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,440
they will usually remember it for a long

58
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,920
time if the virus comes back

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,200
the b cells make more antibodies

60
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,720
straight away

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,560
before it can hurt you this is called

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,519
immunity vaccines work

63
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,480
by teaching your body to make antibodies

64
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,360
without having to meet the real virus

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,640
so scientists take the virus or one very

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,280
similar to it

67
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,920
and remove the parts that you damage

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,840
which is

69
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,280
usually the genetic material or dna

70
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,000
what is left is a depleted virus

71
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,040
something that cannot hurt you but which

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,040
still triggers

73
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,000
the b cells but how do you make sure

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,680
that the depleted virus really can't

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,720
hurt us

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,080
that's where ferrets come in vaccines

77
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,040
have to be tested

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,120
on something that has an immune system

79
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,159
to see if it is safe

80
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,159
and effective

81
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,959
ferrous are useful for studying flu-like

82
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,159
viruses

83
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,400
because they catch colds like humans and

84
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,760
have similar symptoms

85
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,360
but many other animals are essential

86
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,159
in the hunt for new vaccines especially

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,239
the laboratory mouse which is the most

88
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,280
commonly used animal

89
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,239
in science by far

90
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,760
even chickens help save lives the

91
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,040
viruses we study

92
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,400
are often grown in chicken eggs another

93
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,319
essential part

94
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,599
played by animals in vaccine research

95
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,239
in countries all over the world animal

96
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,040
studies

97
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,239
are an important part of the search for

98
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,000
new vaccines

99
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:25,199
for coronavirus and other conditions

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,199
this benefits people and animals

101
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
everywhere

102
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,120
