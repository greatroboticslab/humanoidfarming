Um, numbers might sound good, but when you're working with a team concept, be it you start in the service department, move up through parts, everything else. If your parts and service is doing a good job on it, your sales come as salesmen, we we get credit for it. But as SA the other areas bring it up. So we don't look at anything individually because uh we have to look at it from the standpoint of profitability for the whole dealership and and giving the customer a fair price for a fair product. And that's what we look at. And when we was nominated for this, it we that wasn't even I didn't even know what it was per employee. And so we got into the fact that we don't look at it that way because we're doing a lot of double tasking around here. Um we have one one mechanic. He does our uh warranty work and things like that. We full-time service rider. We we kind of duplex on that a little bit. I run the shop and yeah, I do the sailing. So, we're trying to uh take the revenue and uh make the dealership a very solid foundation and then we can expand after [Music] that.
