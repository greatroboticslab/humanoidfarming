performing as efficiently as they should

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,760
more than 3 billion people around the

and higher levels of obesity

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,320
the clovid 19 pandemic has caused

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,960
significant disruptions to food systems

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,520
already affected by other stressors such

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,520
transformation of agri-food systems can

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,480
help transition them to better deliver

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,960
safe affordable and healthy diets to the

time

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,920
improvements must contribute to

[Music]

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,320
innovation is a central driving force

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,520
for transforming

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,720
agri-food systems digital technologies

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,720
are one example of innovation digital

agri food systems innovation

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,720
includes online platforms precision

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,920
agriculture

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,960
based on sensors geo data and artificial

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,119
extension e-commerce and digital

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,280
technologies for rural finance

42
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,960
additional examples are blockchain and

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,759
food sensing technologies

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,799
delivering transparency traceability

food safety

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,560
and quality along the food value chains

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,159
most of these solutions are generated by

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,240
the private sector

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,880
currently adoption of these innovative

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,439
approaches by small and poor producers

51
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,840
is still significantly hampered by the

52
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,799
digital divide

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,960
public investments in rural connectivity

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,679

and adequate policy and incentive

57
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,800
frameworks

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,640
are needed to bridge the divide and

59
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,440
allow for more widespread global

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,640
adoption

61
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,280
of digital agriculture transformation

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,520
but it is not only about technology

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,160
innovation is all about solving complex

64
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,920
problems

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,800
and adding value in new ways farmers

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,879
herders foresters and fisher folks are

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,360
at the center of innovation

68
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,080
as custodians of natural resources they

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,560
have always

70
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,440
innovated to find new solutions to

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,280
complex issues

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,560
inclusive business models such as

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,280
contract farming

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,640
allow producers better access to markets

75
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,360
and a more stable income

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,640
adoption of geographic indicators labels

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
for food products

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,879
generate improved market position and

79
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,040
incomes

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,760
and recent online agriculture worker

81
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,120
platforms help meet supply and demands

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,560
during covid19 but all these innovations

83
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,400
must ensure access to

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,080
rural communities in developing

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,159
countries especially women and youth

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,080
women are key players throughout all

87
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,879
stages of agri-food systems

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,440
likewise youth are poised to make a

90
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,480
major contribution to this

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,239
transformation

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,000

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,959
solutions within their communities

98
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,200
public-private partnerships will be

99
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,400
crucial to help bridge investment gaps

100
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,120
