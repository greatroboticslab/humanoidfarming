  "text": "dear innovators how are you do you ever think that by a professional holding a diploma in agriculture or just to be a sega culture card Agricultural Extension officer but not a professional holding village is an incredible extension what is an extension what is an extension service what is extension education what is a negative Israel extension extension research what are these why it is needed to study extension from where it came to our context why we need to study all these yes all such questions will be clarified within 10 minutes in this video I am dr. Sarah Chandra welcome to the channel agree innovators every agricultural University in India must perform three important roles education research and extension education is to develop and produce agricultural professionals to develop agricultural sector research is to encounter various challenges occurs while agriculture sector development extension is to cue knowledge of Agriculture and its technologies to the people who actually practices agriculture like farmers let us take the extension dimension of the university and discuss in detail extensions in the broader sense it is called extension service this service is an educational intervention Extension Service Providers educates the farmers about new methods of practices new approaches for the profit and various useful agricultural information along with the educating the farmers here the extension service providers can also supply them with various agricultural inputs credits etc look at to the pictures provided here here some of the scientists they are supplying farmers with the new technology of poultry housing and they are supplying to the farmers here one of the scientists is explaining the farmers various diagnostic methods and identifying the particular pests in a particular crop and here another picture where Agricultural Extension officers they are trying to demonstrate various agriculture technology for the paddy to the farmers but who will do this Extension Service Agriculture officers aggregate all extension officers rural developmental officers private sector development officers scientists at kvk dart centers sometimes estin professors scientists when they visit adopted villages or any field visits like that and occasionally the students in the reveille program sometimes NSS programs may visit the fields and they can perform this extension service till now we have covered one of the dimensions of extension that is Extension Service still two more dimensions of extension are there they are extension research and extension education let us see extension research in detail what is an extension research and who will do this extension research we are going to see observe the list of focus areas of research of extension with the help of extension research we can identify the best methods of transfer of Technology and we can study the adoption behavior of the farmers and we can identify the farmers interests so these suggestions and their requirements and we can identify the suitability of a particular technology to the farming community feasibility any of any particular technology and we can identify the different case studies and we can report success and failure stories the most important thing is that we can forecast the technology and we can forecast the research requirements from the farmer side as well as from the state for different stakeholders of the agriculture sectors and we can give that particular information to the and who will do this extension research they are extension specialized scientists at receiving me and kandra's and dart centers regional agricultural research stations agriculture of colleges and PG and PhD students of Agricultural Extension let us consider another dimension of an extension that is extension education here again two things are there one one thing is there the extension expert is equipping the agricultural professionals to perform as extension service providers in the future again those extension service providers are involving farmers for the transfer of Technology these two things are comes under Agricultural Extension education so teaching of extension science to the agricultural professionals as well as agricultural science to the farmers both things comes under extension education now tell me which subject is more important economy it is targeting the plants how to grow the crops entomology is targeting on the pests pathology is targeting on the pathogens and breeding see technology these are targeting about the seeds plants like that but extension is targeting the farmers and their prosperity I'm not saying extension is the only subject is meant for the farmers with the along with all the subjects extension is also playing a very crucial role to the development of agricultural sector actually we should not compare subjects like these one should have its own role for the development of agricultural sector we have to consider each and every subject is very much important for the farming community so how can we define extension education it has n number of nation's because it has a very wide range of dimensions out of all definitions I have picked up a common simple definition for extension education look at that extension education is a professional method of non-formal education to bring desirable changes in knowledge skills attitudes and understanding of the rural people to improve their social economical and psychological status we need to understand it is a non-formal education and it is an educational intervention and here we are focusing on the socio economic and psychological standards of the people the term extension we have given meaning for the term extension in India is transfer of Technology but here we can observe different meanings of an extension in Dutch it is called go reaching in Malaysia it is called short arch UK it is an advisory work Germany enlightenment USA education Austria furthering Korea rural guidance France vulgarize ation spain capacities ation so we have we can give different meanings for the term extension but in india we have given a meaning for the extension is transfer of technology so that we are mostly concentrating on the transfer of agricultural technologies to the farmers through extension let us speak about some of the facts about extension it has started not from the agriculture universities like this it has started in as a university extension during 1867 actually availability of the knowledge and generation of new knowledge with the help of research is only consumed within the university vicinity but during 87 it has felt that what is the fate of outside university people so they should also get benefitted with the university knowledge so their first time steps towards extending the university knowledge to the rural community has started from there the concept extension has came into the picture nowadays we are adopting this extension subject for the agriculture horticulture veterinary fisheries forestry daily home sales etc in India so first time in Britain the term extension has been used as university extension the person behind that / University Extension is James Stewart we can call him as father of university extension or the father of extension during 19th century like in UK in USA also extension term has been used in the form of extension education the person behind this extension education is JP Liggins he is also treated as the father of extension education and the father of agricultural extension so far we got to know the origin of an extension where it actually came into the picture and how we have been adopted that particular extension to various disciplines and we have understand different roles of an expert's related to the agriculture as well as extension and we have to perceive extension is a educational interface to empower people further we are going to learn extension education process Kris principles objectives and scope of extension what we can expect from this course the basics of extension education basics of communication because communication is the essence of Education basics of teaching methods knowledge on adoption of an innovation basics on capacity building agricultural journalism recent approaches of Agricultural Extension like there thank you",
