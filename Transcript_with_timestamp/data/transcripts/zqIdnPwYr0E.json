Today we discussing rodents in or rodent control in agriculture simply means rats affecting our crops simply as it is. But to my right is Mr. Christopher Luben who is the owner and managing director of FDL um pest control solutions. And of course next to him is Mr. Alexander was the crop protection officer attached to the Ministry of Agriculture. Gentlemen, welcome to the program. Thank you. Thank you. Chris Bayer, of course, you know, you're not new to this this this um area here. Um but let us St. Lucian Lu who is Chris Lubin? Give us a little background. Okay. I am Christopher Lubin, an aronomist by profession. I started working in the agricultural sector at Windban in 1985 where I worked with the plant pathologist and subsequently with both the plant pathologist and nematologist. My work involve working in with pesticides, neatocides, fungicides in controlling cigar disease and also nematodes um and other pests in bananas. And I was lucky to whilst working at Windland for 10 years go off to do my first degree at the University of the West Indies where I studied aronomy of course and because of my performance I got an opportunity to start an MIL/PhD with a European funded um project. However, I lost all my research to tropical storm Debbie right and the funds went run out. So I basically moved on where I worked with ran pollen which is now beer crop science where I worked as a an individual who developed pesticides between Latin America and the Caribbean farm with that company and subsequently Renick Incorporated which is a company that was based in Puerto Rico where I worked as a product development and marketing manager and after that I came like back to St. Mucha and I formed FDL pest control solutions because I worked with companies across the Caribbean, Latin America in pest management. Working out of Puerto Rico, I worked both with agriculture, public health, urban pest management and had done a fair amount of work. So I went off to study pest management both US and Europe and I I've kept up in in touch with that and I've done a fair amount of work with dicide companies and other pest management of um manufacturers of pesticides based on my research background to develop them in the region. Okay. Well, a wealth of knowledge. Of course, Clus, I mean, everybody knows Clus has been with us in the ministry for a while. Of course, right now, I think it's Dr. Alexander now. PhD. Um, rodents have been around for many, many, many moons. Um, we know the effect it has on, um, crops as far as farmers are concerned. uh it from an economic standpoint it has set them back a lot. um we have tried rod dentisticides over the years and um with the rest are still around you know so tell us what's what's happening now I'm I'm hearing new things are happening in your collaboration with with Chris so give us a little background as you said rodents they they have been in for a while but in in terms of agricultural production they cause between estimated that between 2 to 10% of some crops is lost due to rodents. Again, they are major vectors for some zunotic diseases. Mhm. Rudent, they can affect the crop before harvesting and they can affect the crop after harvesting. They can at planting they can go and they can eat the seeds that that you you you planted and they can cause a lot of problems in terms of the the post-h harvest. Um it has been an issue in terms of the the agriculture production in India. Basically the farmers have depended a lot on neaticides but yes you have had some level of control but you need some thing that is more sustainable on a yearly basis thousands of dollars of neatides are imported into the country and based on that are you seeing that if you have to um do some research in terms of the amount that is imported and control of the pest. Is it warrant further investment in the maticide? Is there a dire need for transition to something that is more environmentally friendly? Because again, you will use the rodenticide and it can basically contaminate the crop as well. Mhm. Also, you you'll kill the some of the rats out in the field and they can again that can be an issue for for in terms of the safety of the of the crop. So hence the reason for us now doing some trial in terms of something that is more environmentally friendly something some fertility control for rodents basically something like a contraceptive in human being where you try and control the the the fertility of the of the of the male and the female so that you can have an impact in terms of the of the population but there are limitations in terms of the um the the use of the fertility products. It has to be sustained because once you stop it means the the the get back fertile again. So multiply faster. Mr. Lubin and I we collaborated on some research in the Roso area. So I think he is quite vers in the area and he's going to expound more on what we did that day during this trial. Mhm. Well going back to Rosa was nostalgic. That's why I started off as you're home. You're home. Yes. Um but I worked with uh with two um rodenticide producing companies. One with the fertility product and one with an anticoagulant. But I want to start by saying we should try to change from speaking about rodent control to rodent pest management. Yes. Management because if we think like that it we need to understand the biology of the rat and its food preferences and also the way the pesticide or the rodenticide works. So we looked at the the birth control product. We looked at an acute poison and we also looked at two what we call anticoagulant um rodenticide. And if I can just go into that a little bit. Yes, definitely. Rodents scent taste is very important to rats. Rats are omnivores like us. All right. And there's um silanthropic which means that they benefit like cockroaches, ants and other insects. they benefit from man in the sense that what we eat they eat and what we do they know they they take advantage of it. So the two most important factors would be in the case of a farmer I'd say the most important factor is sanitation because when you go on farms there's some indiscriminate use of food. That's one but also that what they're growing is food. Yes. And if a rat is raised in that area eating a particular kind of food from its mother's womb it's very conscious of what to eat. And rats now smell each other's mouth. Okay. Um um carbon dulfide is a is a smell that comes out of rats out of rat's mouth or rodent's mouth and that's very important to the young. Yes. Okay. They smell. Yes. They smell and they they're very good at using that to eat because although they're omnivores they're risk outside there. So rats if they eat the wrong thing they'll die. So they've learned to use cues. And um there are three things that we can look at. One I mentioned it's that they look at the others. Another one is picker. They if they're if they eat food and um they're not too sure. Pika is practiced by some mammals. They eat dirt and the clean it would help it stick and get get out. But then because rats cannot vomit, okay? They can't vomit. They have a very strong the the valve between the stomach and the esophagus is is strong. So unlike us who use our diaphragm individually, the two muscles and we can force this open, rats can't do that. So because of that, they would have to find a way to survive and making sure they understand food based on taste, smell is very important and also urine. Rats pee a lot on different things. So in the case of female, estrogen, progesterone is important. The female rat which is who's about to go into heat would pee everywhere for the the stronger male to come, right? So they do it. Some in some cases the younger rats that not even there yet would pee on the stronger meal. So therefore they remember who to go by who to go by you know so it's it's signs that have already been said it right. So when we looked at the area, farmers were complaining about sweet potatoes, corn, melons, pumpkin as well and pumpkin. So the intention was to look at palletability. How would the rats react to this? So if I go back based on our age in this room here, if we go back, farmers before use a product called phospho in cocoa. And what they were doing was creating what's called bait shininess. the rat ate it, some would die, some wouldn't die, but those that didn't die would remember what they ate and would not eat it for at least 3 months. So that that concept was very interesting to me in terms of trying to look at the crop because the farmers are saying, \"Okay, I'm buying how much rodenticide like it too and I'm still seeing the thing.\" So what I found out was a lot of them use pellets and pellets are designed for indoor use, not outdoor use. As experts, we know how to use it in the field, but the farmer doesn't. So he was basically throwing money away. Mhm. And then we looked at the liquid which is not for general use. So what we did was first put out the pest the rodenticides where we we tainted food with liquid rodenticide. We used the normal rodenticide but the two of them one had more wax than the other. And when we got two things we got uptake with the rodenticide and we got bit shyness with the food. We then put the the palatable then we put the um the sausage base which is the um the birth control and we got very good uptake on it. Now it's a long-term trial. The key here was to see palletability. The farmers were very pleased because they saw the uptake and we were able to prove that we can prevent a rat from eating watermelon. Okay. Like the old people would say they would think that you know watermelon you know and they wouldn't eat it. We were able to prevent them from eating pumpkin um pumpkin and eat what we wanted them to eat and the was great. How based on that? I mean um in in layman's term, how can that happen? That's a good point. In layman's terms, a farmer should not just think of I'm growing a crop so I can sell and make money. He has to think of it and I said pest management. Okay. So we have two kinds of rats in St. Lucia. the roof rat seems to be the one that's affecting them the most because they would say to me we saw them pass on the branches of the you know the trees or on the fronts of the coconut trees and we can see them moving. So let's go backwards before people use that metal strip on coconut trees. That's one that's one factor that's very important, right? Even the trees if they have to. Two is know which rat and we can tell it by looking at the the droppings of the rat and also if we see them because the roof rat has a much longer tail, bigger airs. It's a slender. It's a nicer looking rat compared to the Norway rat which we see all around the place. Right? So it's important to know which rat is affecting. So the rats in cast is these are the Norway rats. In 2004, we did some work there. Some work. It was very interesting. They're all over. But these are the nori rats which are bulkier, stockier, heavier, and they they tend both rats don't always agree, but we've seen places where they coexist. Okay. Okay. Um so the important thing here is to the farmer needs to understand if I'm going to grow potatoes, I can impact the rat before I start my crop. Okay? Not when the crop is growing because the rats are there. And like when farmers when they remember I spoke about sanitation when they leave whatever in the field there's stuff there you need to clean that out but also they can use it to prevent rats from eating their crop. Okay. And to Clintus's point the the birth control can come in after because it's a long-term strategy. So you can keep that population of rodents down and you now need to look at the other thing that was interesting is we use rodent bait stations and it's a monitoring device. So I can always come and say okay yes they took it because farmers generally buy the rodenticide and throw them out and the the rodenticide disappears but does not mean they're out. So with the unit we have we can actually see that they n on it and we keep on replacing. So rodent pest management if I put bait and I come back and there's no bait left. I did not put enough. Okay. I must always come back and see some bait left because if if that means the rats came in they hit everything and they went away. Now a farmer is always on his field so he can be trained okay to do that right but I'm happy with what I saw and a lot more work has to be done but we can from what I'm seeing and with some of the people that have interacted with us um farmers can be trained to understand their field and understand what to do to reduce damage. So what happens to a farmer next door who does not um carry up that control? Um will it affect come back and affect the the the the stations where you bitted in that particular farmer? Say farmer number one you're working but farmer number two doesn't do anything. what happens remember again what he is saying is very important with the the the the control whereby if there's an urgent situation in humans the use of the toxic pesticide is important because you'll knock down the population but with the the fertility um control now what you'll have is that um yes they'll be sterile but they're going to leave as well you depending on natural mortality to bring down the population so with with the neatide it will much quicker than And and what you have you may have is that um even if you control the population on some of the farms that you conducting the recession you'll have immigrants those neighboring areas you'll have the farm since there's a void now they will come into the area where trip and then they will get the population will hence the reason why you need um continuous baiting with the the fertility so that they can because not only the the parents that you looking at fertility for looking at all the offsprings as well. So fertility will be continuous. And remember I indicated that they have a food preference, right? So if you put the two things together, you're basically saying I'm trying to get them to not want to eat food in this farm, but it doesn't mean that others would not eat from the other farm. So there is need for that structure in terms of the how it should be done. And it comes back to research. We we in the windband days a lot of research was done in bananas, but a lot of work is done now, but there's no set research in these areas. And I think um farmers can be trained because the farmers we work with were initially a bit skeptical but when they saw the results they were yes it's gone and we will actually be able to prevent rash from eating corn prevent them from eating and go for the watermelon yeah and go for the the birth control and it's a it looks like sausage so I guess it's something that's palatable enough for them and rats initially don't if there's something new they don't eat it up front remember I said they so they would taste And if they now realize, oh shucks, this thing got me sick, they will leave messages for others not to eat it. And so it's important in that case they at all. They ate all of it. So it's palatable. So there is some interesting. So how many farmers you worked with in that? We worked with four farmers. One corn, watermelons, pumpkin. We three farmers. Three farmers. Three farmers. Okay. But I know there is a lot of um rats um when it comes to cocoa production. So are you all hoping to Well, if there are opportunities there, yes, because it can rodents can be controlled. Okay, we just need to take time to understand it. So rodents, rats don't see too well. People need to first understand that don't see too well. Rats feel. So they have special hairs on their bodies called vibr, the the whiskers. So a rat runs the whiskers come for you never see a rat run into a wall because it's aware of it it surroundings and they will mark like I said they will mark with their urine. So if something was moved they would mark it to know that was it wasn't there. So they they work with that. So if it's a roof rat we first have to establish whether it's a roof rat or whether it's now a rats affecting them. Okay. And if it's now a rats they borrowing the wrong roof rats are in the trees and they leave because they don't see too well and they rub they leave those rub marks. So the sebaceious glands what we'd call ring around the collar they produce that and they mark the areas they they go through heavily. So we would see that and we can train people to understand what's fresh and what's stale. So it's important to know the habits of the rat. Again I come back to pest management not pest control because if not you're doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result and it's not going to happen. Okay. There's there's of course we know about the rat urine and leptospiryosis. Yes. Okay. Um how can that be controlled in terms of um would you think there'll be less leptospirrosis using that method down the road with less rats around? I would say in the farming areas you'd have less rodents and less chance of that happening. Okay. Okay. So the key thing is monitoring systems and a rodent bit station makes a difference. Not throwing the bit around because in a farm it's out it's in the open. The rodenticide is not going to last forever. Right. So it's important to put it in an area. If we find the runway of the rat, you don't put stuff in the runway because they know that wasn't there. So you have to now trick them into finding it. Okay? So you have to look at home and food and remember they have a preference already. So what you put in, you just add into the menu, right? So it's important to understand how So you have to understand the the the mo of the rat. Yes. Exactly. You have to think that. But we seem to be um focusing a lot on rats but mice as well. Oh yes. So it's rat and and and the mice. The mice. Yeah. So for us it is very important creating what is called the bit shyness because if you have a watermelon crop you should not wait when this the the the rats start eating your watermelon. That's for control the baiting. But what you can do is if you know your watermelon will be ready for probably in a couple of weeks. What you can do is try and you can purchase a watermelon put the watermelon in the bit station apply the the the the liquid neaticide and the bit sh and and tell the others that I ate this thing in the farm and then I I you send the population I'm going to die and so on. So definitely that is very important creating the bit shyness whereby the the the if you have pumpkin as well with the pumpkin farmer in the base station we put the pumpkin under liquid neatide rodent keep saying not neatide sorry the rodenticide so um it's it was very interesting to um again the farmers they were very receptive to um the the research and we're looking to um probably scale up if you can get other regions where um we can transfer the technologies to the other regions where um crops have been cultivated that how how long this thing has you all did this I did it for 3 weeks we did it for 3 weeks just to understand the palatability but also in do in that time we inspected we were on the farms at least twice a week okay sometimes every other day we just wanted to make sure that like I I mentioned earlier if we put rodent um um rodenticide in the bait station it should not run out so we had to go as frequently as we possibly could Um farmers also have to be trained. You have your farm, your shed, the way you eat and what you do inside is important. Okay. So that's the sanitation part again you know. So there's a it's not just one thing. Mhm. Okay. We can put rodenticide till we get blue in the face. If we don't understand the why we fail. So the food is what we want to protect. Mhm. You create big shininess, you use the product, you you know you reduce the population. And um it's not only in rodents you now have this this happening. And it happens with birds, you know, there are there are things that can be used. So it's it's a a range of activities that should be done on a farm and the farmer has to pay attention to it because if not, he will always have issues, right? And he can be trained to see the runways of the rat to look at where they come from and they know it, they see it. It's just to understand how to use what they have to to control. So Okay. So you all worked in Roso? Yes. Okay. So where else will that be replicated? Um we're looking at um region five that's in the V4 area. Also we we did it on um the watermelons, the pumpkins and the corn farmer. Very important to us will be um the having a trial with a a sweet potato farmer. Yes. because we know um there's a serious issue in terms of the rat infestation in in sweet potatoes. So once you can get a sweet potato farmer who is interested, we can transfer the technology to whatever region that um we feel that um we can have the the trial on. What was interesting to me is the potato farmer said to you there is you know there there's still potatoes in the field after harvest. M so it might be small potatoes or pieces they left in the field and that's a source of food some of them might might start to grow because they then till the land because we actually went back when that process started so we didn't just come and we went back to look at it so the lands were being prepared so that's when you now would disturb the potatoes right but in some cases if you look at it from a practical perspective some of them might already be growing and now you're digging it up and remember rodents you smell So if they sense that they can be coming back from that early and then you plant your crop and they now know hey I have a source of food. So it's important that habits change some of the practices have to be adjusted and we can have good success. Okay. So at what point will um that road denticide be available to the public for at for purchasers? I'm I'm sure. Yeah. But I I this is something that the ministry would have to to decide. We can't, we wouldn't because it's something that requires proper training to use. Okay. Um it's dangerous stuff. You know, no pesticide is safe and you want to make sure it's used the right way. And I say that simply because over the years what we've learned is farmers or people use different products as rodenticides. Furodan, for example, was one of the main ones that was used for years. and farmers mix stuff even down to using the cans where they they cook it and then you know they they they tint the food. So I think it's important for people to understand the why the how what you do and it's important to to document it. That way people are aware and the training is is taken seriously. If not we will start something and then if it's not done properly people will see that as a failure. Okay. And we need to make sure people understand what's being done why it's being done. Okay. So, so there there have to be that collaborative uh situation with the ministry of agriculture to ensure that it works. So, yeah. You mentioned you said when would the the neatide sorry be available on the market? Firstly, it has to be evaluated by the pesticide and the chemical control board because if a new product is coming into the country, we'll need to do the necessary risk assessments to mitigate some of the impacts of the of the product. So once this is done um the product can be taken to the board for registration. Okay. So so in so right now it's it's just a trial tested trials around the island and like I said again so um you do have any a specific time frame before it gets gets the to the board for approval. Um it's difficult to put a time frame because um if an a registrant um submit a dossier it means well after reviewing this particular dossier you may ask for further information. Mhm. Where was it tested? Where was it tested while going for the dosi may see um something where you see some impact some hazard on on on the um dossi. will the registrant will need to prove to you that some of the persons or where where it was some of the risks that he's is presented where it was mitigated some of the research papers that was done on this particular product. So all these the important pieces of information they're very important in terms of the registration of the product to mitigate the risks associated with the product. M so so you still so there's no time frame you cannot but but still there is opportunity to train farmers until that time to understand what they should and shouldn't do great because it's it's it's not going to happen overnight but um my observations because in our industry we are observational biologists my observations are people want a quick fix but you're dealing with a pest that has been around for a very long Mhm. And being silent anthropic, it's adjusted its lifestyle to us. So we need to readjust and it will not happen with just a pesticide. It has to happen with an attitude change towards understanding I have my crop. I want to make sure I save I have maximum yield and less damage. What do I need to do? And years ago we've been training with farmers where for example using fogging um misting sorry for secret to control things like that you have to train people need to understand wind direction in that case how to move through the crop it's no different in this case it's it's to understand how I should use a rodenticide and if I understand that and I see the results I believe if I don't see the results then of course to continue I don't yes again what's very important for us is um the farmers they've been really reliant on pesticide use and the use of pesticide is not the only means of controlling rodents. M so um there are other technologies available for controlling like the what we trying presently the fertility control the use of carbon monoxide and probably the um blocking of the borrows and so there are lots of other measures available but specifically we feel that um the use of the fertility product is going to again the product is an organic product. No, that's another thing right in terms of environmental protection and food safety. It will help in that regard. Finally, sir, me I hope it it catches on. I love research. That's what I always um as professionally that's where I was I my profession started. And I think um urban pest management, pest management in agriculture, it's very important to understand the why and the how. Um we should not just be applying stuff for applying it sake. And I think it's important for all involved to to take it seriously before an end result. I think for me it's um that's the food security. Great. The Ministry of Agriculture, we've been talking about food security for a very long time. And if you are able to control um the the the rodents in watermelons, in the cantaloupes, in the pumpkins, in in sweet potato, there can be at least a 10% increase in those crops. Definitely which can benefit more money more. Gentlemen, thank you for being here. I wish you all success and um I'm sure that um once you all are on track with what you do, we will get there. Thank you again. Thank you. You've been watching Agriculture on the Move. We want to thank you for viewing the program. We always want to tell you remember agriculture is our business and we need to eat fresh St. Lucia's best cuz once you can control the rodents obviously we'll have an increase in production. Thank you again for viewing. I'm Philip City saying goodbye. I'll see you again. Agriculture on the move. Agriculture movement. Agriculture on the move. Agriculture on the move. Agriculture on the move. Agriculture move. Agriculture on the move. I recall on my mom. [Music]",
