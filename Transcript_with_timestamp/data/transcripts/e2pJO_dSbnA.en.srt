46
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,959
broccoli all right and so over here we

47
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,080
have more

48
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:22,680
cabbages um we have some radishes that

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,879
I'm going to harvest today because they

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,480
have been in here too long I think I've

51
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:31,560
let them I've let them get too big so uh

52
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,519
but the spinach is doing well look at

53
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,599
that spinach the spinach is doing very

54
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:40,879
well we have some more cabbage over

55
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,920
here um we have some

56
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,120
lettuce and we have some carrots so

57
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,159
everything has been growing pretty good

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,319
now over here we have a we have some

59
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:56,440
beets that are growing um we have

60
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:58,400
our turnup greens so I am going to

61
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,560
harvest some turnips today if you look

62
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,000
down in there we have quite a few of

63
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,120
these turnup greens that are they're

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,959
ready they can be harvested if you look

65
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:14,000
there this is like a a

66
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,879
trio so I'm going to harvest some and

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,799
then plant some more seeds the only

68
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,959
thing I don't like is the turnips are

69
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,799
pretty good but big but the leaves we

70
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,319
didn't really get a lot of leav growth

71
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,599
but had to get out here and treat it

72
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,120
because these bugs are really eating

73
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:33,680
them up and so here go the collge

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,000
they're growing and then we have some

75
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,280
Swiss short over there so if

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,040
anybody I have idea what I can put

77
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,159
down

78
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,959
for these

79
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,799
greens um what can stop these you know

80
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,799
the bugs that are eating them up please

81
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,760
let me know all right so I'm going to

82
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,280
plant the potatoes over here in these

83
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,799
two boxes and then I put some uh

84
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,920
compost um dirt that I already had I put

85
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,239
it in here and then I'm just going to

86
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,200
mix it with some miracle Grill and some

87
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:13,599
other top saw dirt that I have all right

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,599
going to put the dirt in here

89
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,320
this is just some pot and so it's not

90
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,960
that

91
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,960
expensive I feel this

92
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,400
well since these are

93
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,400
full I am just going to

94
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,800
put so let see we

95
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,840
hold all

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,280
right so this looks like a red

97
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:35,160
one so I'm going to

98
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,160
put that down there and cover it

99
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,120
up another

100
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,120
one right

101
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,840
there put this one over

102
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,280
here I'm not putting them too far down

103
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,360
but just down

104
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,759
enough I don't no I'm not supposed to

105
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,280
put which way I supposed to

106
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,280
putant there a

107
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:21,440
hole I'm going put the

108
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,919
roots that one right

109
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,199
there we have another

110
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:31,560
one right

111
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,560
here this

112
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:39,400
here

113
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:42,880
and them up so I have one

114
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,160
more so I'm thinking about the this one

115
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,560
I'm just going to put this one in

116
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,560
another

117
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,560
box

118
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,440
and go from

119
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,520
there all right so I have another box

120
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,680
this is the biggest one I can find it's

121
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,160
a little smaller than the H or to but

122
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,800
it's going to

123
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,800
work go ahead and

124
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,199
put this side in

125
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:24,360
here so this almost fills this box up so

126
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,360
I'm going to add some of the

127
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:34,120
[Applause]

128
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,120
put the too there

129
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:09,039
all right so here's the tuer I'm going

130
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,919
put this one right here in the middle

131
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,560
cover it

132
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:17,360
up and then I'm going to water so what

133
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,280
I'm also going to do I'll probably get

134
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,520
another bag up there just to feel these

135
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,520
all the way up to the

136
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,720
top I'm go ahead and

137
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,600
under M estim the

138
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,360
water coming all the way over here

139
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:51,560
so once they store gr I just use

140
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,560
the get the water in from

141
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,080
now do this hopefully it doesn't miss

142
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,600
the box so I wonder should I put a

143
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:05,000
plastic EG in here anyway

144
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,000

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,480
TR the Box start

146
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:24,880
breaking think that should

147
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,000
little but oh

148
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,360
