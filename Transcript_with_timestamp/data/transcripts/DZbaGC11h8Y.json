  "text": "[Music] good afternoon everyone welcome to an afternoon session on the second day of the conference as part of the o grain track the organic grain track of the growing stronger collaborative conference i'm erin silva i'm an associate professor at the university of wisconsin-madison and the state extension specialist in organic agricultural systems and it's my pleasure to welcome you today to our workshop organic row crop management the biology of soil health we have three outstanding speakers to share information with you today both on a broader scale with respect to understanding the biology of soil health as well as giving some specific information on a research project that's been underway at the university of wisconsin-madison for the past three years so we have joining us today dr matt rourke who is a professor in the department of soil science and the state extension specialist in soil fertility we have dr teal potter who was a postdoctoral researcher at the university of wisconsin-madison and is now at washington state university and miranda sakura who is an associate research specialist in the department of soil science here at the university of wisconsin-madison so i am going to hand it right off to them they have a lot to share and we are hoping to get a lot of questions from the audience um if you have questions please type them in the chat function in the sivant app we will uh take questions throughout um we may wait till pauses between the speaker or address them at the end but certainly as we go along um ask your questions in the chat we also have some interactive questions so be looking out for that i will let you know when those questions are in the chat because we'd like to get your opinion and your thoughts on on some issues as well so with that i will turn it over to dr ruark thank you dr silva so first off um yes i highly encourage everyone uh ask questions so i found that uh you know these virtual formats are a little different right and it'll be a lot more fun with more questions that we get so uh overall uh the the title of our presentation or organic row crop management and the biology of soil health and today we're gonna cover we're gonna have three different sections i'm gonna talk a little bit to start on just an overview of soil health and just the perspective on soil health that we know where we're coming from on it uh miranda is going to talk about managing for soil health and organic production systems so a little bit more specifics on management and based on some on-farm survey work we've done and then teal is going to get into a deeper understanding of soul microorganisms and what they do so the overview of of soil health and so i would imagine as everyone thinks about soil health you know everyone might have a little different take on it and so i always like to use this slide uh put together by my my friend steve coleman you know what does the soil a healthy soil consist of right and i'm sure everyone on this on this uh zoo meeting here can think about you know several things of how they would describe a healthy soil right and so some of these might be might be have sufficient nutrients good tilth good workability sufficient rooting depth good drainage few pathogens but um plenty of beneficial soil biota low weed pressure no harmful toxins to the crop and brazil uh and resilience to degradation now you know uh what's interesting about this is none of this none of these are connected to one specific measurement per se right so it's about healthy soil is about what we want and how that what the charac these bigger characteristics are of the soil so we all i put this together to kind of get out what we've done in soil health from a soil science perspective is we have devolved it a little bit into soil testing and so you're just starting with this idea up to the left this fluffy definition conception of soil health we know soil health is good um but really is it about what are the specific things we want from the soil we had that list before but i you know in theory there would be a hundred or more things we might want from the soul right and maybe a better way to capture that is the idea of ecosystem services what's that service that soil is providing but what we really need to do and we're going to work over here on this side of the world the specific soil measurements what do we need to measure about the soil that does connect in some way to the things we want from the soil and then also in a perfect world that these specific soil measurements may connect to agronomic decision making meaning if you could quantify if you could get a certain measurement of your soil would can you know that you're able to achieve higher yields would you be able to reduce your nutrient inputs would you be able to reduce your your need for other inputs to manage pests and disease then you have this side of the world with crop management and all these crop management effects that are that are affecting these specific crop measurements or crop management effects that might be affecting the ecosystem services so you can see there it can get a little fuzzy in here um so i want to just make sure everyone when we're thinking about it we do have these things we want from the soil but we also need to identify if soil if the science of soil health is going to advance we need to be able to identify what we should be measuring and what would be things that we can measure in a relatively easy way so you know we talk about ecosystem services here's another kind of big example of all these other things that you know we could list too the idea of carbon sequestration uh flood regulation um foundation for human infrastructure you know all of these different things so it's there's so many things but it's hard to capture like the idea of is it a habitat for microorganisms well what would you measure to to know that and you might want to measure several things and that's the thing so soil health is multivariate by nature and so there's many properties uh that can or should be measured and we probably can't sum it up with a single number so this is our this is our great challenge so many of you have probably seen these this figure we use it all the time there's three circles and in the middle you know with the physical aspects of soil the chemical properties the soil and the biological properties of soil and in the middle where they all intersect that soil health okay so we have all these things and you know we can kind of break it down well chemical properties of soil these are well studied they're easy to measure any soil test lab can tell you you know about you know extractable nutrients they're the aspect of soils that we've been studying probably the longest um people have been studying soil chemistry for well over 100 years and we know what to do with those values if you get a you know a ph measurement or soil nutrient levels we can utilize that to to you know to make lime recommendations or nutrient recommendations the physical aspects of soil you know things like aggregation compaction porosity they're well understood uh they're not necessarily easy to measure because it involves you know field evaluations but they're often things you can see so if you have compacted soil or you have poor in you know poor infiltration that's me something that you're going to be able to you know sense about your soil so um we may not you know there are things that you can physically see and and understand then it leaves us with this biological measurement of soul and that's been the big missing piece of um soil testing for a long time it's not i'm going to say it's not well understood it's pretty complex it's we can say there's certain things that are easy to measure but it's not we're not quite sure exactly what to measure yet we're doing a lot of testing of specific measurements to kind of bring into our soil testing world so as we think about all of these things um you know connecting that function to indicator and maybe i should have that arrow going the other way you know if we want to manage it we need to be able to measure it so if we want to measure those functions if we want to manage for those functions we need to pick indicators you can see this there's a laundry list of things here uh for chemical physical and biological and so we've got to pair down on which which ones we're going to use uh the other aspect of a good soil health indicator this is from a paper put out a few years ago and i thought they did an excellent job in terms of describing you know what we want it needs to be evidence-based so we need to have some research on it it needs to be sensitive to changes in management meaning that if you know if you're going to change a management practice if you're going to add a management practice if it doesn't really it's not really affected by management it's not going to be a good sole authenticator it's not going to give you a sense of uh if you're going up or down needs to be accurate and precise meaning it has to have good scientific methods behind it it needs to be cost effective which really means it needs to be able to be conducted in a soil test lab and um there's certain uh tests that are pretty expensive probably don't fit into our soil testing lab world that easily um so they're probably going to come it's going to be limited in its use and then lastly it has value and that gets the idea of can we connect it to something um some decision making process right it might even just be as simple as did my yield potential go up uh can it be connected to nutrients can it be connected to other decision making for other uh you know other disease or or pest pressures so the part that i want to kind of kind of circle in on here is this idea that well most of these measurements one of the big things we want to do is to get at this idea of a specific measure of organic matter now i'm sure a lot of you already getting soil organic matter by loss on ignition from soil test labs but it might be that might not be the best uh indicator of soil health so because there's different parts of the organic matter and how fast they cycle so we have this idea that there's this most of this organic matter is in this passive pool where it doesn't cycle very fast the turnover is decades or centuries we have another pool that's the slow pool that's years to decades of turnover then we have this idea that there's this active pool of organic matter and that might be something we're interested in so represents recently deposited organic material with that involves a lot of rapid decomposition and cycling of carbon and nutrients so carbon which would be available to the soil microorganisms and nutrients would be available to the organisms and the plant so it represents you know can represent anywhere between 10 to 15 percent of the organic matter and this is a turnover that might happen within a growing season so this active pool of organic matter can be considered an integrator of biology and chemistry and we're going to talk a lot today about two specific ways we can get at that active pool and i'm going too fast so there's two different ways we can get at this active pool so the first one is a soil incubation and this is the idea we're going to let the microbes tell us what's going on so for example in this case we're going to take soil we're going to we're going to incubate it at a standard temperature and moisture in this case we're going to measure the carbon dioxide production over time so meaning we're going to uh let the microbes uh consume that active pool produce co2 we're going to measure that increase in co2 so that's that's one way to go but it does take time in this case this would be a 24-hour uh incubation some incubations might might be recommended for maybe three days so it's a it does take some time to get that the other idea is is there a chemical extractions can we extract that active carbon pool in the same in the same way we might extract soil test phosphorus or potassium to get at some sort of availability and there is there's a there's a permanganate oxidizable carbon sometimes called poxy you might actually hear it actually called active carbon and it's a quick method and these extractions then can be easily conducted by soil test lab so we have two different approaches we've got the uh we have the incubation approach and the chemical extraction approach uh so there's two uh interesting papers that have come out recently that i've talked about some of the value of these organ of organic matter and organic matter pools so the first one on the left is this global meta-analysis on the relationship between organic matter and crop yields and that connected uh organic matter with corn and wheat yields we're saying that as organic matter increases up to four percent so do corn and wheat yield so overall there's a benefit to increasing organic matter and uh especially as it's tied to production but uh um but it uh but it's it's still the uh the big organic matter pool right so it's it's that great integrator now the the other paper that that has come out uh improved soil biological health increases corn grain yield and here we're saying roughly a 20 increase in soil health metrics which include that extractable carbon and the total carbon soil together lead to a five percent increase in yield so all of our indicators at this kind of growth scale here are indicating that as we improve soil health and and build organic matter that's going to help our production systems so now now grant now this is very this is a broad take on this right so uh what the research you're going to hear today is going to is going to get this is we've taken a more regionalized approach to understanding that that relationship and then lastly then so those are the those are the simple measurements and then the question is is there more value in more complex biological measurements and so with this is this is one of the big things we're studying on a lot of of our research is well there are these more sophisticated measurements we can do such as soul amplicon sequencing that can tell us which bacteria and fungi are present we can do soil metagenomics so it gets at what the bacteria and fungi are capable of doing uh we can also do soil meta uh transcript dot mix uh that gets to what the bacteria and fungi are actively doing now uh and so you might hear some of these terms a little bit later so we have the idea of like what are these simple measurements are they providing value and then do we is there something else we can learn by having these more biological uh more complex biological measurements taken and what can we learn from them so as we kind of have more discussions today so soil health um is a young emerging field that needs refinement uh our angle that it needs soil type and region specific recommendations and that's hopefully what we're we're gonna demonstrate today uh to a certain extent uh it might need crop specific recommendations that might be um you know do grain crops and vegetable crops may differ uh in terms of of how they're responding to soil health certainly we do recommend it should be evaluated over time you know i haven't talked about the idea of soil health as a metric you know is it something to see where you're going are you increasing maintaining or decreasing it needs to be connected to all s aspects of uh of i should say output which is yield and quality so that does tie to vegetable and fruit production as well so um with that uh we do have a question um that would like to pose to the group uh before uh miranda starts to talk and the question is if you had funds is i make sure this is the right one if anyone's okay if you have funds to implement or adjust one management practice to improve soil health what management practices would you prioritize and uh dr silva is going to put that up in the chat and um and we encourage you you all to answer yeah i think i put it in this i think i put it in the live q a so you can see it and what we'd like you to do and we're hoping to use the upvote function but i'm not sure if that's going to work um ideally if we were live teal does an awesome job doing live polls as part of the presentation but if if you can um put one of these letters in as a question so we can get a sense of where you might want to prioritize that would be awesome kind of a fun way to to see um what people are thinking um so we'll give that a shot trying some novel things with the q a function while we're waiting for that for a minute we do have one other question in the chat do you want to look at that right now matt uh the one that aaron just posted that says uh with respect to biological testing indicators could you not start with doing biomass assessments of the soil at the root zone for major member components of the soil food web for example uh f to b ratios decomposers symbionts nutrients cyclers etc so yeah so the answer is yes the problem is i would put those in the category of more complex measurements um to get that information and these are becoming i mean these are routine uh i mean these are analyses that we can do you know pretty easily in an academic setting um but our more expensive tests uh for um for soil test labs to implement as of now as of now um so the the big the big struggle we have in soil health and soil health testing is that idea between uh cost and benefits so there are places where you could probably get this information but it's going to be certainly a lot pricier it is not these aren't rapid tests that can be incorporated uh easily necessarily into sole test labs so and i think you're going to be we're going to see some more discussion on those types of measurements later on oh people are putting in answers all over the board which is so interesting as well as options under clarifying the other of grazing and improving soil texture so this is awesome i love the interaction here so so with that and and i and i hope uh i think uh this is gonna be great hopefully we can keep that um all the comments coming in so that i'm gonna turn it over to uh to miranda socorro all right thanks matt um so matt gave us a place to start in terms of thinking about what soil health is and how do we measure it and make sense of it right we also heard from y'all about what management you'd prioritize for soil health and apparently our list didn't encompass it all and of course it didn't um but now we're going to delve into how to answer the questions that we want to know about biological self how are we how are you doing that so we want to know things like how do we design soil health assessments that give us useful information to make farm management decisions and what management decisions should we make that would give us desired biological functions well i hate to break it to y'all but there isn't a single approach that gives us it all as matt said it's pretty complicated um but researchers they're taking multiple approaches to understand what's the most important factors for biological soil health so whether that is related to the cropping system its diversity um what kind of management is being utilized on the farm by the farmers and what's going on with the soil and its inhabitants so each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses but we'll look at three research projects that are happening in wisconsin as case studies and some lessons learned all right so the three research approaches we will look at today cover a huge range in terms of how realistically they represent what would happen on a farm the closest we can get to reality is the field survey approach so this utilizes fields on working farms compared to fields on agricultural research stations so there's no experimental treatments or prescribed management practices implemented it is more so a survey of management that is already happening on the farm so with that management that's happening we can explore and try to explain differences in soil health measurements by the different management practices happening at the other end of the spectrum we have greenhouse experiments so greenhouses are really controlled settings we can make sure that the crop growing conditions are optimal or at least not limiting so that we can look at microbial community effects and processes that are they are performing and how that affects the crops themselves also in these greenhouse experiments we can really limit external factors so that we can focus on specific questions to things like microbial community composition and the functions that they perform so in the middle of these two are field scale and plot scale experimental trials that occur on agricultural research stations so these kinds of trials determine the effect of specific management practices or cropping systems on whatever we're interested in in this case biological soil health so on one side we have the farm fields which represent the most realistic situation but it's really complicated there's a lot of factors and variation involved because there's so much different management and different soils on different fields but this makes them really interesting to understand and identify trends and what's happening on these farms but as i said they're complex there's a lot of noise to sift through because of those differences so it's hard to pinpoint what are the key things happening for those kinds of studies you need a lot of fields to participate so that we can kind of mitigate that effect but in the controlled greenhouse experiments you get rid of a lot of that noise to answer those specific questions but then we are limited to the kinds of questions that we can ask so it's a smaller subset all right so first we're going to look at a field survey so remember field surveys utilize the differences in management already happening on working farms but also has the field differences and soil characteristics as important characters factors to identify so in this case we are interested in important factors for biological soil health field surveys don't necessarily look at change over time but they are more so a survey of what is contributing to differences between fields and what is making those contributions so an example of this is a sare funded project in the southwest driftless area of wisconsin that is down here in this southwest corner of wisconsin um worked with 16 organic grain and dairy farms so um we worked with them to evaluate how differences in soil characteristics things like texture and ph as well as management affect biological soil health so we visited the farms in 2018 and 2019 to take soil samples at 124 fields they were taken in spring before the planting of the next cash crop each field was following a corn year so that we controlled for what the previous crop was trying to mitigate some of that noise all right so in the upper right you see that there's a an icon that indicates we're talking about field surveys um teo will also be presenting results on the field survey so that's a way to let you all know all right so for the study we obtained a detailed history from the farmers of the previous five years of management so that's related to the cropping sequence and its diversity as well as the tillage management tillage management and manure management utilized on the fields we also got some more long-term information such as how long have the fields been organic and what was their previous use to organic [Music] to obtain data on field soil characteristics we use the publicly available soil data from nrcs's web soil survey so you might have seen something like this before if you try to utilize nrcs's tool to look at your own soil it's an online platform with location-based data that's from soil mapping of the united states the information obtained from here is primarily soil factors that are outside of the farmer's control like soil texture and its classification something we want to know is what soil characteristics are the most influential on biological soil health so that soil health assessments when you send in a sample to get soil health testing those assessments take into account the soil differences that are outside of the farmer's control so we can rate them among peers you can get more accurate assessments because not all soils have the same capacity for soil health and specifically for certain functions so we need to include these differences when we rate how well a field is doing so is if like a is a field um median or less or less than a third of its potential or is it meeting greater than two-thirds of its potential you know those are some things we want to know all right so matt gave a little intro into some of the indicators that we measure but we're going to talk about four specific ones so one of those is permanent oxidizable carbon or epoxy so this one is related to carbon as matt was saying and it measures the readily available fraction of soil carbon that microbes can use as an energy source basically it represents how much food do microbes have easy access to to perform their key soil functions how much resource do they have the other method matt was talking about is mineralizable carbon so this is a measure of that co2 release by microbes as a result of their activity so just like how we release co2 when we're performing functions we're going for a walk we're going for a run we release different amounts of co2 the harder we work all right we also measured autoclave citrate extractable protein so this is soil protein and that's the largest nitrogen fraction of soil organic matter in the soil and that fraction the microbes they can convert that via decomposition to plant available forms of nitrogen so represents bioavailable nitrogen that might be crop available [Music] while another measure we use is potentially mineralizable nitrogen so this measures the rate by which microbes convert that organic form of nitrogen to plant available forms so also getting that bioavailable nitrogen but asking more so how fast are microbes able to turn over that nitrogen so this gives us some informations in terms of some biological soil fertility as well as carbon dynamics happening as well how are we moving towards organic matter all right um we're now going to look at a snapshot of the management that's happening on these fields so in this management is only what was happening in the previous five years before the samples were taken so to a lot of the farmers for utilizing management practices that aim at preventing soil erosion limiting soil disturbance and overall improving soil health [Music] and you know it might be performing more multiple functions like that like providing nitrogen so 79 of the fields had a perennial crop within the last five years and that was primarily alfalfa so both providing perennial cover and nitrogen biologically seventy-six percent of fields had prone to legume cover and twenty percent had annual legume cover also you might notice here that um the fields were pretty split in their cover crop use so a little over 50 of the fields had covered a winter cover crop less than 20 of the fields utilize minimum tillage over the five-year period which we defined as a disc implement or shallower tillage implement and you also see that about 20 of fields had at least one year of no-till um within the five years and most of the fields applied manure so that was one of the things that was pretty consistent between fields but overall you see that there's a lot of different management practices happening on the skills but does this lead to measurable soil health differences does it tell us something about management we're going to look at a subset of management practice data to tell the overall story [Music] so over the five year period the number of years of legume cover perennial cover or a winter cover crop did not produce a measurable effect on these four biological measurements that we measured the number of manure applications didn't have an effect either but what about some other practices it did i identify a few management practices but all of the effects were small so the biggest relationship identified was with crop diversity so as crop diversity increased epoxy pmn and ace increased however at most it explained less than six percent of the differences um in soil health measurements between fields um and that is seen by these r squared values um you can measure like take these r squared values times them by a hundred and that basically tells you the percent that um the number of different crops is able to explain in these proxy values so what you're seeing is that less than six percent of epoxy differences in proxy is explained by crop traversing so there's this leftover 94 percent that is from other factors such as soil characteristics and management you can also see that how long a field has been certified organic had small effects so hoxie as um as the length that they've been certified organic increased epoxy increased and ace increased but it was very small so uh these small effects you know they're they're a bit disheartening um but let's look at this a little bit more in detail so we're going to focus in on that duration of organic management piece to kind of think on us more so in the study farms they ranged from being in transition to organic to having over 27 years of organic management so that's quite a long range even with this long range less than four percent of differences in soil health values this case epoxy and ace were explained by how long they've been organic so there's a leftover 96 percent again that is explained more so by other factors such as soil characteristics and other management practices that are happening on the farm farms are really complex systems and they're managed differently for a number of reasons so there is more variation captured on working fields then it recommended experimental trials although i don't think you know there's still an important message here right the important message is that management practices and soil characteristics are more critical than time there's some young fields that have really high biological soil health and there's some older fields with low biological soil health so understanding which management practices contributed the most to the high soil health values is really critical into improving biological soil health to make things a little bit more complicated something we should remember is that not all soils have the same soil health potential regardless of management this is due to soil properties that are outside of the farmer's control for example ball saws soils formed under historical prairie cover have higher soil organic matter than several other common wisconsin soils used for agricultural production and this is due to the long-term contributions of that prairie's root system turning over those roots and leaving behind so organic matter so soil health assessments need to account for these differences in soil potential to properly rate current field soil health values using the publicly available soil data we found that the u.s soil classification system was useful for explaining differences in soil health values this is important as we can separate soils into different groups by their classification to rate their soil health according to their true potential so on the screen is a map of the classifications represented in the study we're talking about in the driftless region so of the 124 fields in the study the soils there's about i think five soil classifications represented in the study and that makes up a majority of the acreage in the driftless area um so basically we have a study with really well represented soils of the driftless region so that suggests that we can use these soil classifications for benchmarking soil health in this region okay so that was talking about on-farm studies now we're going to transition to experimental plot trials with a focus on long-term research trials so this utilizes field scale and plot scale experiments with replicated plots so repeated areas with the same management and it looks at the effect of management over time [Music] in arlington wisconsin there's a long-term research trial known as the wisconsin integrated cropping systems trial or wixed and it was established in 1989 so there's over 31 years of data of how this management has affected the soil that's there in other qualities so this trial specifically its purpose is to evaluate the productivity profitability and environmental impact of organic and conventional agricultural practices in the upper midwest the plots they're about three quarters of an acre size so they're trying to get near um to that field scale size to better represent the reality of what would happen on a farm now going into what the cropping systems are there are six common cropping systems of the upper midwest chosen to look at their long-term effects so the first three in the top row we have cash grain systems so this is continuous corn a corn soybean rotation with minimum tillage and a organic cash grain system which has corn soybeans to wheat and red clover so the bottom three represent dairy forage systems so we have a conventional system that goes from corn to three years of alfalfa our organic forage system that goes from corn to an oats nursing crop with alfalfa and one more year of alfalfa and then the last one is a highly managed rotationally grazed pasture so the catchphrase systems and dairy forged systems they differ in their inclusion of perennials so with dairy forage systems there's more perennials represented the inclusion of perennials also inherently reduces disturbance so these broad categories differ in these two ways you can also see that especially for the cash grain systems that there's a gradient in crop diversity so we're able to ask questions about that as well for both the cash grain and the dairy forge systems there's an organic system represented so we're able to ask questions about organic and conventional management so here's a snapshot looking at year 27 of this project so in the 27th year we have pmn mineralizable carbon epoxy measured these biological soil health indicators and what was found out is that the dairy forage systems had the highest biological soil health values and primarily the rotationally grazed pasture had the highest out of all of these cropping systems so the rotationally grazed pasture is a much different system than the others as it has continuous living cover with no disturbance the living mat protects the soil and the roots are constantly sloughing off and that material that root is fueling the soil system um so the other cropping systems that had higher biological health the dairy forage systems they had more perennial cover so also less disturbance and more living roots presented represented yeah so specifically these derivative foreign systems they had more of that active carbon pool that carbon source of few food for microbes they had higher microbial activity and they had a higher rate of converting that organic nitrogen to plant available forms so the organic systems did not have better biological soil health than the conventional systems within those bins of cash grain and dairy forage um yeah but the experimental trial was able to capture this effect of perennial cover which wasn't previously found in the on-farm study so that these experimental trials are able to get rid of some of that noise that we see on farm studies to like capture more management practices and that's something we saw here miranda it looks like there was one question about whether you have any plots in the green bay or fox river valley areas this study did not it was specifically looking in the driftless area to kind of so we have the effect of different soil characteristics to like look at that but also we didn't want to have super different soils so we kind of limited that way but i know that maybe matt can talk about this later that there's been a wider study all over wisconsin and somewhat in minnesota but that's mostly focused on conventional systems so if that's of interest we can talk about that maybe later all right there's a couple other questions coming in if there can be more information about the specific practices on farms specifically if we can give the names maybe we can't give the names but maybe at least specific practices particularly if there's any doing rotational grazing i think as these were i think all pretty much not all but most organic dairy farms that many of them would have had rotational grazing as part of their management yeah that's right so a lot of them are organic dairy so they did have pastures but we didn't sample from them we were more focused on these organic row crop systems and how those specific fields were rotating but there was a field or there's multiple fields that was transitioned from a conventional pasture system to an organic grain system and those fields um it's been like 10 years since they were that conventional pasture system but they had higher biological soil health values just because they were a pasture at least that's my interpretation of it it wasn't many fields but um yeah thanks miranda and there's another question and and matt i don't know if you want to chime in on this one too from other studies that you have done with um at wixed but there's a clarifying question as to the date the wix data that the chemicals that were applied in the conventional forage system versus the organic didn't seem to be impacting soil health in a negative way um in in terms of the indicators that we've measured right so in terms of the of the thing so you know what the so i guess that that is correct so we didn't see a difference in in our the conventional system there is one year of corn with three years of alfalfa versus uh the organic system is one year of corn with uh two years of alfalfa so it's a longer set of perennialization um those sort of factors kind of work out the biggest differences tended to be from cropping system right so going from the grain cropping systems to those cropping systems so the nuance of it uh we couldn't we couldn't pull out so um it seemed to be the broader carbon input and soil disturbance and manure input effects that would have had the biggest benefit in terms of the the simple biological health indicators that make sense and teal mentioned that she's gonna talk a little bit about that too um so another question related to wix the forage systems appear to give better soil health numbers but how significant are those differences how significant uh it right what is you know i'm sorry what is significant mean right so is it mean that it's um static they were statistically significant do they matter you know what do they connect to um in terms of any of these ecosystem services i don't know i don't know um those sort of that sort of stuff we don't have that quite connected um that's not a very satisfying answer i know the uh what the i know it just gets into such a a goofy little trick of this is you know one location and it's very soil specific right if you're already working on a nice deep malasal soil that you kind of beat the heck out of you know maybe it's just these broader ships and these subtle ships don't really don't really matter but even the even our biological health and our uh grain systems was still probably pretty good um so what does it connect to um i don't uh i don't have a good answer for that i'm sorry that relates to another question matt that's kind of along those same lines what is the soil type on the arlington farm and do you think the results would have been the same comparatively on the boone sand of the person asking the question so the what our one of our goals you know one of miranda's goals and one of our goals for other soil health projects is to create these baseline measurements because you know obviously as miranda showed there's so much inherent the inherent properties of soil do have a syllabus controlling factor on on your your baseline soil health measurement so it really uh i would pare it down to even like miranda's work is some of the best on the subject because it's so geographically and so soil um specific focused um yes in general sandy soils will have lower soil health values than uh you know silt loam prairie derived soils so as we think about how are we splitting these out in terms of what a baseline what's an expected value and then within each soil texture uh soil classification system how much can you influence it based on based on measurement and then at the end of the day what does it connect to and so we have all of these things that you know i talked about up front that we're still we are still scratching the surface on it so right now we have a pretty good handle on the the relative importance of inherent properties versus management properties in which direction these management properties or the management might affect soil health um and generally speaking it fits it fits the general narrative more carbon inputs less soil disturbance um although not all those um necessarily or um were found significant in miranda's work but then the trick is what does it mean what does it mean for your cropping system to to do this and is that something you'd want to manage for or are you just do you just want to manage because reducing tillage means reducing you know fuel costs and reduces and we know it reduces uh you know sold disturbance and improves the soil so uh this is i know it becomes a bit of a circular argument but that's really kind of where we're at we haven't fully connected all of these these measurements the soil health measurements to uh some sort of benefit where you talk about those if you want if it's significance is a significant difference for what and ideally be in my mind one of the big ones would be for plant health and plant production there's a couple questions related to soil testing both you know how useful the usual soil tests are for the average organic farmer that maybe they're they're not very helpful give a specific recommendation for soil tests and how often an average organic rotation with alfalfa corn soy and clover should soil test and specific not only in terms of what tests but are there what are the best soil test labs in michigan was specifically recommended so what's the ideal panel of indicators what should people test for um how often should they test what left should they send to maybe we should have you give another talk matt specifically on on test labs i mean i would always recommend you know i was just like a routine test test your nutrient levels you know i think testing over time i think is really where the real value is for a lot of uh a lot of this so having you know in general we recommend sampling every four years but you know sampling every other year might be good the more data you can build and then graph that across time which direction are you going with your nutrient levels in your soil with your organic matter and um any soil biological tests so a lot of these soil biological tests are being incorporated into different soil test labs so you might be able to find some test labs that are doing something i kind of like it especially if you're just sort of looking at stuff over time again you know i say we don't know exactly what to do with that numbers there's some labs that might want to connect it to nutrient availability i don't know i i don't know i don't have any data to support that but i do like the idea of using that to monitor it over time um and i think sometimes in today's world i really honestly think with all these climate extremes we're facing i think maintaining soil health is still as big of a win as increasing soil health so everything anything we can do to to not further be reducing soil health i think that's this a win for us so if you can be if you can increase that's great but even to know you are maintaining soil health uh with your with your cropping system and management practices is a good thing to know well there's some more questions but i think that some of these might relate to what teal's going to talk about so what i think i'll do is hold off on the questions please keep typing in questions though these are great questions um but i think i'm gonna um hold off have teal present her information because again i think it will inform some of these other questions and then we can go back to the q a from there sounds good so can you see my screen are we good all right um so i'm teal i have been working on some of the same data sets as miranda so you'll see those icons in the corner of my slides as well but i'm going to talk a little bit more about the biological component of soil health and getting into the details of what we we are trying to answer some of these questions of how does this living component of the soil connect to these soil health indicators that we know are sensitive to management know have you know pretty inexpensive ways to measure but we still have a lot to do like matt was saying to connect this in and find out what is the useful information that we need moving forward so you know we do microbes are important they are the ones processing decomposing the organic matter in the soil to make it available for plants and also storing it in carbon so we do want to use our microbes to um and make their function stronger so for reasons like disease pressure reducing chemical inputs helping get maximum yields in our fields and it is pretty complicated as i know you've heard but i'm going to show you some of my research to illustrate this so and there are microbes and other biota that can contribute to a lot of different functions in the soil so in contributing to soil health disease suppression plant drought resistance plant nutrient acquisition carbon sequestration nutrient mineralization so making those carbon and nitrogen phosphorus available to the plants and water use these are some of the functions we're talking about when we're thinking about the microbial component and a lot of what you may hear of a lot of the products that you see that are microbial focus are focused on microbes that have specific relationships with the plants so you've probably heard about mycorrhizal fungi which trade plants plant roots carb they trade nitrogen phosphorus water for carbon sapr troves are taking nutrients from plants rhizobia these are bacteria that fix nitrogen for plants some plants endophytes are microbes there's a bunch of microbes that live in plant tissues and then pathogens you know we got to remember that pathogens are microbes too they're part of this microbial microbiome in your soils they're fungi and bacteria so we're thinking i'm thinking about all these symbionts that have specific relationships with plants um but then there's a lot that's going on for mediating how they mediate plant responses and so for an example we think of mycorrhizae mycorrhizal fungi as this great mutualist so plants benefiting microbes are benefiting they're trading nutrients but in certain conditions if the plant doesn't need those nutrients say phosphorus the microbe is in the microbes are still attached they can steal carbon from the plant so we do need to understand this microbiome better because it's not as simple as mycorrhizae are good for your plants right they can start stealing your plants carbon and what i'm most interested in is thinking about this whole context most of these microbes are not symbionts they are free living microbes that are in the soil they might be associated with plant roots in that they're they're getting nutrients that those plant roots are secreting into the soil but they might not be pathogens or mutualists and they are competing with plants and completing with pathogens for nutrients in the soil so taking the big picture view is important but it makes it really complicated when we know that there's you know more than 10 000 species in a single teaspoon of soil so i'll show you how we're getting at some of this complexity and trying to distill it down and you know we do know that there is lots of evidence that farming practices can impact soil biology so this is important to know there's a lot of studies tons of studies that have shown this but it's not always and the responses vary by soil type and climate and the responses are not always huge not even usually huge so there's a lot of reasons to focus on a small area but it is important to know in a specific area whether management practices do have consistent effects on biology within a region before we ask does it matter right go to that next step and so going to our our field survey you can see the icon in the corner that miranda talked about we asked how does organic farming change soils over time and to do this we use these fields that had been under organic management for different lengths of time and we measured does this change soil health indicators you know what i'm interested in taking this a step further is can we measure differences in the biological community the living communities and we did this with um all these fields from across all these farms and because there's a lot of noise um differences among farms and soil types um we did need a lot of samples so the question here is you know no one's done this before just seeing whether organic farming has a consistent effect on microbes before we can ask you know what are they doing is it helping us and we don't know if that's a consistent increase they just keep going up or if it plateaus after a certain number of years or maybe it goes up and goes down we need to explore this and so this is what we did on 124 field samples to hopefully see some pattern among the noise and here's the data right here so also with biology consistent with some of the measurements or the measurements that miranda told you about we just see no pattern and so there could be high fungal species for as one example we measured biomass we measured this for bacteria as well but there's a lot going on here right so there was probably tillage in the past history and there's tillage still happening on organic farms the manure inputs are variable among the farms your rotations a lot of these farms are doing similar crop rotations but different sequences um and so what to me this tells me one thing that's definitely different is whatever pesticides or whatever non-organic certified inputs those do not seem to have a consistent effect either those are breaking down pretty rapidly and we're not detecting that early on or you know there's a lot of microbes out there that's what i'm always thinking about so there's a lot more that is being influenced at the field scale than specific certified organic management practices so this is interesting and also brings to the point that these long-term field studies are really helpful to seeing like within a region and very precise consistent management can we see effects so we can understand when those when those might be important and what is driving it interestingly this paper just came out this year that shows inconsistent effects of agriculture practices on soil fungi fungal communities across 12 european long-term experiments and a lot of these have been going for over a hundred years so this is in belgium uk hungary and denmark and you can see that just on these outer venn diagram loops there's pretty high highly different numbers in the uk they had 124 fungal species in hungary they had 878 right so determining whether that matters probably is something you'd want to focus on within your cropping system and thinking about how it changes over time because we see this variability so with that i'm going to share a little bit what i found from the long term trial that miranda also talked about looking at the biological components from that system the wisconsin integrated cropping system trial and we measured it took samples from five of the six cropping systems that are represented of the region and we did also find a lot of miranda's work showed that there's differences in poxc and a lot of these indicators and we also found that among these cropping systems there were significant differences in the continuous corn especially between continuous corn the most the two extremes continuous corn and pasture we also saw this for biomass so we didn't see it for bacteria that was significant differences but for biomass we saw the same pattern for fungi and bacteria lowest biomass microbial biomass and continuous corn similar for the organic cash grain system and quite a bit higher but we had some questions for matt early on that is really important to address you know what what do these measure what do these differences mean how much change is meaningful so comparing our pasture um versus corn we can ask well what can 68 additional species do for us right and that is too broad a question for a scientist to do anything with we have to focus in a little bit so maybe we could ask does 68 additional species increase organic matter decomposition and another thing to note here is we're talking about you know 68 species that's i don't know how to think about that so i don't know if you can think about that in a in a useful way but we are talking about 68 species in a quarter of a gram of soil right it's it's very small scale what we're able to measure in the lab so these are super diverse systems i just wanted to make that note because that's what we're talking about um so to answer this question um ecologists think that about this two different ways how what does increased species diversity mean what could it mean functionally well one of the predominant ways in which we think about that is more species means more types of microbial metabolisms oops which means more efficient decomposition you have microbes that are decomposers and i had a question about that there are so many different types of decomposers there's decomposers that focus on lignin on cellulose on proteins on tons of different things so if you have more different types of metabolisms you might get corn stalks turned into you know salvaging that little bit of nitrogen in them or at least feeding the microbes more efficiently the other main hypothesis is that more species if you have more species you're in a huge pool of species you're more likely to have a few that are really good at whatever you want to decompose or whatever your function is so along with the other soil health indicators there's this general thinking that more is better and but here for microbes here's the thinking behind it and these are things that we can test and i'll show you a little bit but i'm going to briefly bring this back to biomass so in this case the question might be you know does this difference matter and probably most of you are not you know you want to grow cash crops so maybe your question is not how much better is it if i don't tell at all and i just have pasture your question might be if i change my practices a little bit and i want to grow corn organically does 19 millimoles more of biomass or 38 millimoles of microbial cells what can that do for us to focus that in maybe your question might be does a difference in six millimoles matter for long-term carbon storage well interestingly the hypothesis here is that more biomass actually does contribute more stable carbon for long-term carbon storage and this is something i didn't appreciate much until recently but there is a lot of great science happening recently that has been showing that a huge contributor to stable carbon in soils is actually the cell walls of micro bodies so dead more microbes means more dead microbes that are actually recalcitrant forms of carbon in the soil that don't break down easily so i think that's pretty interesting that we're finding that they break down less quickly than most plant plant tissues so i do want to follow up with this you know i asked this question is a increase better can we detect a difference in something we might be interested in so we actually did this study in the greenhouse which is pretty rare but i'm going to tell you a little bit about that study now so for this study we're interested in you know how does soil management affect soil microbes and then bringing that back to something we're interested in like plant yields crop yields so we went back to some of the fields that we surveyed in the field survey study and collected soils from them and we use them in a greenhouse experiment and this can allow us to ask this more specific question right because we can get all these soil microbes from different places in a controlled setting and test their function so the question here was do soil micro microbial communities from different farms influence crop growth differently and we really are interested in whether they affect crop growth differently but to really see this we wanted to give the microbes a functional test this might not be enough to detect anything so what we do we did is we give them different forms of organic forms of nitrogen and urea and see if the microbes can decompose these organic sources of nitrogen differently so we added the same amount of nitrogen even those different amounts of biomass and we wouldn't expect to see differences in urea because well the microbes don't need to decompose that at all that is readily available for plants to take up but these other ones we thought we might see some differences so here i'm going to share a quick video this is a 40 second video on this the methods on this greenhouse setup so this is showing we went out to the fields collected soils we sterilized soil for the background soil in the pots from a local soil added that to the back of the pots the 95 of the volume added live soil as five percent of the pots so from the different farms and then on top of that we added an equal amount of nitrogen in the forms of urea manure clover and sorghum sudan grass and then we had the microbes decompose that and then the corn was at a v4 stage we harvested the experiment and dried the plants and weighed the plants so that was a very quick method section there and as we expected we didn't see that different communities microbial communities from different farms we didn't see any effect on plant growth on corn or rye growth in the urea addition pots we interesting we also did not see any differences among farms for clover and manure which had a similar carbon to nitrogen ratio but we did see that it mattered which microbes some microbial communities allowed for more corn and rye growth and so how we're thinking about that is that you actually might need more complex or more diverse microbial communities to efficiently break down the lignin the cellulose this tougher form of nitrogen to make that available to the plants and some communities might do that better perhaps that is related to management and what those fields were receiving recently i haven't looked at that to see if we can detect that so wrapping it up here we can say that soil biology does matter these processes are done by soil microbes but biology is persistent if you're in the midwest you have a ton of microbes in your soil so we're really interested in detecting small changes and thinking about small changes i think that's my personal perspective i do think that understanding biology better may be able to help us understand soil health indicators better but i think a take home i would like to say is that we're not at a point where we can give specific advice on how to manage your microbial community to get these benefits but the best practices we have for soil health are likely to help your microbes so if you're having your fields covered more doing minimal tillage as possible doing things to build so organic material in your fields those are things that feed the microbial communities right so more diversity and more biomass on your fields is going to get you more microbes and more diverse microbes so i think that's kind of where we're at happy to answer some questions thanks teo um and related to that last point um there was a question um is is there either through your work or through other work that you know an inverse correlation between the amount of tillage and the amount of fungi um hearing that tillage is bad for fungal communities and may be related to that and again that this may not be measured in this study but maybe from other literature if you do have tillage how fast quickly do those fungal communities recover how bad is tillage that is a great question um i'm actually starting some new work in a new postdoc position that's going to be tilling up some fields that haven't been tilled in 10 years to see if we can measure that on a fine finer scale there's been some work on it and in general the thinking among the science we do have is that um you know tillage does decrease fungal biomass um it has maybe slight negative effects on diversity but there is enough variation among the studies that um it's it's not super consistent um how fast it happens so i do that is a great question on recovery that's exactly what we're going to test and do these fine scale measurements over short periods of time to try and track that recovery the thinking behind the fungi specifically is that the fungal bodies are these networks of mycelium of hyphae and so the tillage breaks them up and parts will not recover very super quickly as opposed to bacteria which are so tiny that um that their bodies are not going to get broken up by tillage but i would say that from what i'm seeing that fungi diversity actually does recover decently well after one one tillage event that's about all i have for if maybe if you could expand on that a little bit more teal um talking more generally about you know as you get an estimate of the fungal biomass how does like general fungal activity differ from amf specifically in its function in the soil um amf being a symbiont that we know helps with phosphorus acquisition water acquisition but more of the function of fungal and the fungal activity more broadly in the the soil community yeah so the mycorrhizal fungal species those are dependent on the plant for their carbon so that's the main difference is that the fungi in the soil they have a different metabolism and that they get carbon from breaking down organic matter some type of organic matter just like a lot of the bacteria do and so the symbiont you can measure you know actually something that's interesting is mycorrhizal fungi our dna is i the techniques i use are these dna sequencing techniques to get a snapshot of everybody in the community and those are actually biased against the mycorrhizal fungi so i can i do not feel comfortable looking at my data set and saying what how mycorrhizae you're doing that is the case where you probably want to go look at the roots themselves and do it that way which is not easy you know it that is a pretty hard method to do well but just thinking broadly the fungi i think of fungi the free living fungi in the soil similarly to what i do is bacteria they're doing a lot of the similar decomposition functions and are competing with bacteria and plants for some of those nutrients thanks teal and this question maybe it relates and this could go to any of you with respect to enhancing soil aggregation through practices but the question relates to armoring the soil against extreme rainfall events obviously more perennials fare better but what else can we do differently in grain systems no takers on that well okay so just collecting my thoughts here but i'm happy yeah if anyone else wants to chime in too but i think see this just gives me an opportunity to delve into some soil science really deep discussion so the idea of how water is held into soils is driven by the texture of the soil right we all know that right sandier soils don't hold on to as much but also about the idea of the aggregation and the soil aggregates so soil soil that has less disturbance over time is going to be able to build more aggregates and then um and then be able to hold on to water um between aggregates you know if you have these stable aggregates it's going to create a better environment so so anything you can do um you know in grain systems so there's the trick to building aggregates is reduce disturbance but we also need to um bring in more organic matter as well to help basically be the uh you know to build organic matter let me phrase i'm going to rephrase it the idea of building more organic matter that's going to be stable and and stay in your soils the idea of you're adding carbon to your soil but you're keeping it there in that stable aggregate form so generally speaking building soil organic matter connects to that process so then in grain systems we've got to figure out a way to get more organic matter inputs into our grain systems right so dairy systems have a little bit of a leg up more root biomass from perennials we do have manure inputs maybe more opportunities for cover crop use if it's if it's corn and soybean focused don't we lose a little bit of our ability there so um if we have some small grains and rotation that gives us some um that gives us more opportunities to get cover crops so it's about thinking about your overall system and all their their crops they have a rotation how can you are there places where you can add carbon into your soil through manure or cover crops really based on your cropping system it is a great it is a big challenge for us in in our organic grain systems and that's a great segue for this next question which i think is a really good question to answer in the next 10 minutes or at least give some perspective which you just mentioned they're matt intensifying cover crops and adding biomass to the soil but generally from this work that miranda teal described if you had to distill down some suggestions of how this work might help inform farmers to make decisions with respect to enhancing their soil health and their soil biological soil health what would be some practice recommendations that you might make uh sir can you repeat that so from this work if you were going to advise farmers what changes and practices that they might implement on their farms to enhance soil health and soil biology what would you recommend and you had mentioned intensifying cover crops and adding biomass into the soil but suggestions like that well the the joke i like to make is the best way to increase your soil health is to start a dairy all right so um because there you're gonna have opportunities to use your perennials and and manures um i i i don't know if i have a good answer to that question aaron i think that we have these big shifts you know in inherent soil health among soil types for like a better term and we have these shifts between basically farm operations green annual grain based operations versus uh perhaps animal agriculture-based systems that have some level of perenniality to them um that's not that's not a very good answer the otherwise it everything then devolves into really i think i think all of the work that we've presented today does support these the general push of of reducing uh reducing soil disturbance and keeping the soil covered and increasing the carbon inputs into soil so what does that look like i i don't know if there's a i don't have a general record i don't have a general recommendation for that you know usually and i would probably guess the same thing for miranda and teal and even you right when you thinking about different farm operations and chatting with different people everyone has a slightly different uh approach to management so figuring out how it works but working within those processes working within those i don't know uh principles yeah so this is not too much different from the side five sole health principles right so keeping the soil covered adding maximizing carbon additions back into the soil and reducing soil disturbance you know and i was i was yes and so and i was always uh not skeptical but because those we generally think that's true it's just like how are they you know these are general things how true are they and i guess most of this work is really kind of cycle back to like yes they're they are directionally correct they do they they they're they're uh those are the those are the principles and um the the work that that then you know teal's getting into is like all those the beneficials and the more detailed work that's really the future of how does how to specifically manage for some specific things i agree with matt about those general principles i didn't highlight um in the management practices i showed but in our field survey we did see like we looked at the number of passes from fall to spring and then um there was a relationship a very very weak relationship again because there's so much noise but the less tillage you had the less tillage passes you had the higher your soil protein values were so again it's like it's really hard to measure these things but we kind of have this like you know common sense idea of like what to do but it's like how do you implement that within your particular operation right like you have your own ways yeah and so there's a lot of questions about manure um so maybe and that i know you've done a lot of work on this on the conventional side of things as well but questions about how liquid manure applications might differ from um other manure via grazing or bedding pack perhaps and how if heavy manure could actually decrease soil health particularly perhaps if that was anaerobic liquid manure well i'm and uh teal miranda i don't want to uh if you have any thoughts please uh i will so here's my thoughts on this and that's it's about the carbon input so we when we apply liquid dairy manure we're not applying a lot of carbon as much obviously as when we're applying solid manure so it really if we could ever like balance out that carbon they're equal but generally speaking liquid dairy manure it's everything's been worked over more it's more available it stimulus get that quick stimulation um but the long-term you know there's still there's some evidence even with long-term use of of the slow building so generally speaking we tend to think about the composted manure the solid manures tend to have um maybe a bigger benefit in terms of uh maybe long-term soil health building but it might just simply be based on the fact that we're adding more carbon to the soil with those manures so um and it's a slower they tend to break down a little bit a little bit slower compared to liquid dairy manure uh in terms of making the soil go anaerobic i mean you would have to apply quite a bit and pack it down pretty tight um um perhaps uh person asked the question as a specific yeah i think um and i don't know if this came up in any of the literature review for this work um and maybe this is the way i'm interpreting it is maybe just the suite of microbes that are in an anaerobic dairy manure versus the microbes that may be part of a other manure management and maybe this goes back to the mechanism of why manure benefits it's more of the carbon editions than the the microbes being applied to the soil directly but is there a difference there as well there's a question related to ph too how ph might drive soil communities yeah i have done quite a bit of literature review on manure effects on microbial communities and soil health and it is one that's really interesting it's like adding manure is a great resources to have to get carbon more carbon on your field to feed the microbes to build soil organic matter that does seem to be great what's interesting is that in different long-term studies that are specifically interested in testing the effects of manure we see different microbial species or taxa dominate in these different systems that are probably more about the soil type and the uk experiment versus the wix experiment we did but that is one thing that is is coming out of these data is that you have even at the the largest scale that we can look at the phyla level there are pretty big differences in who is dominating those communities so we have a lot of work to do if we're going to understand um which of those are decomposers of which types of materials and can is that even is knowing that information going to get us a little bit further in management recommendations if it is it's probably going to be small and there is a clarification to that too which is really helpful in that this is actually related to a question that came up i know that you were answering earlier this week on a different topic but whether that manure could potentially bring in too much nitrogen that would actually more rapidly cycle c so too much n in the manure burning up the carbon um i i i need to uh think about this for a second so i only have a long complicated answer for that because so in general i understand the point right if we if we add a lot of nitrogen to soil we stimulate the microbial activity the microbes then uh stop becoming nitrogen limited and then can perform more tasks by decomposing more organic matter so the so the so the trade-off in our agricultural systems is we're also so we're applying the the nitrogen and it and it's feeding the microbes it also uh can lead to feeding the plant so as long as we're getting still a benefit in terms of more like in a corn system if you're in if you're able to increase yields with your input with your nitrogen input so you are still returning more carbon you could it could have a net neutral effect right so the the trouble so but the but the overall point is interesting right if we're adding nitrogen without carbon um there's a negative effect but sometimes we can get that carbon through that plant process um and that's what we've noticed in in some systems uh as long as we're civil to maintain that now the the you know i'm complimenting you know manure quite a bit here in terms of its benefit on the carbon side but obviously i want to acknowledge there are some obviously limitations in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus and their effects on the environment with manure that we need to manage so i would be more concerned about managing for those principles first i think we're applying within the realm of of proper nutrient needs i think then that's beneficial going beyond that uh is probably where bad things happen all around yeah that's an interesting and interesting question um there's a question related to if if anyone is um uh any comments on um uh ryze's ryze's why can't i say that word rise of and how that just i don't i know that wasn't tested within the scope of this research but any comments in general [Music] all right my work hasn't been um at that level of function of the metabolisms of different microbes so i'm not i'm not super familiar on how management or anything would affect rhizophy or eating of roof all right um so we're at the top of the hour um thank you all for a really informative presentation on on so many different aspects of soil biology and soil health and particularly as it relates to organic grain and dairy systems um so with that um can i make my final oh yeah of course matt just as we wrap this up just you know as you think about those three circles and why soil biology hasn't been incorporated i i hopefully this you know it's it's it's a huge challenge we've done a lot of work just to you know and our main results are now we feel really comfortable that you know this is the this is the correct direction and then but we still need more work by miranda and teal right to get at those very specific things and that's going to be the grand challenge for a lot of soil science research but it's not going to come quickly but we appreciate everyone's patience it's an exciting area there's a lot that we still have to learn but it's exciting to see this this research coming out and appreciate the efforts of all of you [Music] you",
