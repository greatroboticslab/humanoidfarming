00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,679
hi everybody bill manning here from

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,160
northwest local land services

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,720
just thought we'd remind everybody of a

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,199
few summer cropping issues we've had

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,279
some great rain around the northwest and

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,600
prospects for summer crops are looking

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,680
quite good at this stage

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,000
but we have had many issues where

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,960
paddocks have been flooded and inundated

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,800
with moisture and that can create a few

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,480
issues for cropping

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,040
one of those is that flooded paddocks

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,640
can seal at the surface our high clay

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,559
soils can seal off somewhat like a dam

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,440
and this can reduce moisture

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,079
infiltration into the soil profile

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,360
so if you have had a flooded paddock and

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,199
you're thinking that it's full of

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,320
moisture

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,399
best to go around with a soil corer or a

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,640
probe and just check those moisture

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,000
levels before you make a decision about

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,720
summer cropping

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,960
the other issue that can occur with

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,920
very wet verticals is denitrification

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,240
the soil microbes that live in the soil

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,799
and feed off organic matter

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,759
like you and i require oxygen to carry

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,920
out those processes usually they obtain

30
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,799
that from the air like we do

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,119
but

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,680
under conditions of water logging they

33
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,759
can get their oxygen from nitrate

34
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,840
molecules in the soil

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,439
nitrate is the main

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,159
form in which soil nitrogen is stored

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,040
after they extract that oxygen the

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,759
nitrate component of the molecule can

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,240
then be lost to the atmosphere as gas

40
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,799
and this represents uh a loss from our

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,439
cropping system

42
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,200
and so once again

43
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,479
if you have had soils that have been

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,000
flooded or

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,240
inundated

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,479
think about doing some soil nitrate

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,159
tests before you make nitrogen

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,479
application decisions in the summer

49
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,399
remember that the nitrate may not have

50
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,560
been lost it may have just been pushed

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,879
further down the profile

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,760
in which case it will not become

53
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,239
available until later in the crops

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,959
growth cycle

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,280
a few people are already talking about

56
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,480
double cropping this year maybe putting

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,440
some mung beans into this cereal stubble

58
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,000
i would urge caution in that we still

59
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,560
have a few months of

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,560
crop growth to go and our winter cereal

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,599
crops still have plenty of time to draw

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,840
down that soil moisture

63
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,560
before maturity

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,599
and if we get a drier spring early

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,000
summer

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,720
our soil moisture levels could be

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,400
depleted under our cropping country so

68
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,800
once again

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,360
this is an opportunity for you to inform

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,040
yourself about paddock conditions before

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,400
you make a decision

72
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,400
okay then thanks very much

73
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,040
you
