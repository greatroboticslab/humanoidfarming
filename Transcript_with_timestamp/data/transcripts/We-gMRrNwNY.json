  "text": "[Music] well you've done all your planning you know what where you can build a dam you know how big a dam you want you know you're sitting within legislation uh you're right to go there's three probably different types of dams or construction you look at so you've got a one wall or a single wall two wall or a three wall we're looking at here today your landscape will determine what type of dam you need and your your operator or your designer will understand exactly what is needed for that situation everything you do when you're constructing a gym is about longevity good planning when you're pegging your dam is is very vital and to consider where your outlet's going to be and where your trigger pipe's going to spill the outlet is where the water leaves your dam so that outlet needs to match the amount of water that's coming in your dam so when you've got a storm the water needs to be able to exit the dam as much as it's coming into the dam so they need to match each other you want to see a good outlet you want to make sure that outlet is outletting free of the dam it's not running beside a damn bank and causing damage to your dam it's not causing erosion so you need your spill area to go into nice grass flat area other considerations are do you need a trickle pipe is it a trick or flow to have that trickle pipe in your dam will keep your outlet dry and it will keep your paddock dry where that water's leaving your dam so that trickle pipe will exit that small flow straight behind your dam into the existing area of where it would have naturally went a bad outlet you'll see your damn outlet will start to erode you'll start to get channelizing of your outlet and your dam is basically starting to break down or deteriorating so a good outlet is vital a key point when you're building a dam is you want to make sure that all your water is covering your excavation so whenever you're excavating material to build your dam water's got to cover that if that's exposed and water can run over it when it's filling that's a potential point to start erosion you want to make sure you've got good clay coming up over your banks you want to make sure they put a key in so when you strip all your topsoil off you take that to the back of your dam and then you build your dam out of good clay you want to make sure where the clay is touching the ground they've put what they call a key line in so it's actually clay laying on clay and when you're finished you bring that topsoil back up over your dam and so your dam can be grassed up in the future if you've got a really good operator they'll understand that you need good compaction of your soil so when they're building it they need to be compacting that clay material as they build it that's a determination of whether a dam can fail whether it'll leak so in this example we've got a really good well constructed dam this dam's probably 10 to 12 years old and you can see it's still in really good nick you've got a good batter on the back and a good batter on the front you want to be seeing a three to one on the front and minimum two and a half to three to one on the back side of the dam you'll have a crest so the width of the top of the bank you want to be looking at a good three metre so you're after a big fat bank the other consideration is what we call freeboard so that's the amount of material above top watermark to the top of the bank you're looking at a minimum of a meter free board and if you've got all them aspects you're going to have a well constructed dam as you can see if you can get your dam construction right you'll have a good reliable dam into the future [Music]",
