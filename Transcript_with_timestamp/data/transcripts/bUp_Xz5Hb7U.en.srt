00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,959
department, Priscilla Kodra, in

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,040
emphasizing the importance of equipping

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,120
students with both theoretical knowledge

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,920
and practical skills that align with

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,840
national priorities says she stands

64
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,640
ready to partner with allied

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,879
institutions and relevant authorities to

66
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,519
help bring about a greater awareness and

67
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,400
appreciation for the benefits of local a

68
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,800
food offerings among her students. It's

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,800
a step in the right direction. This is

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,959
the kind of thing we want to be doing

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,879
with our students. What we did today,

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,280
educating them because they are the ones

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,519
who will cater for us later and cater

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,720
for themselves and we are supposed to

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,959
guide them. So tackling over consumption

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,680
help us help our students open their

77
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,599
eyes. I was even surprised that even the

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,400
art students some of the creations that

79
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,440
they came up with in showing how to take

80
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:18,040
care of of over consumption not just

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:21,280
with food but how to manage the

82
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,920
waste you know so it definitely started

83
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,159
the students

84
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,680
thinking you know about our future and

85
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,360
how they are eating

86
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,280
because look at our situation with the

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,680
NCDS the non-communicable diseases

88
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,440
diseases. These are seriously on the

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,680
rise in St. Lucia and to me we need to

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,879
do much more. We need to have to me

91
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,360
weekly activities, monthly activities to

92
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,200
address those issues. The event also

93
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,159
tied into St. Lucia's independence

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,879
theme, Duva Assam, health and well-being

95
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,200
for a prosperous nation. Reinforcing the

96
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,439
message that food security is integral

97
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,439
to national development with discussions

98
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,120
on school gardening projects and

99
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,599
upcoming agricultural training

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,760
initiatives. The foundation was laid for

101
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,000
a continued relationship between

102
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,480
Castra's comprehensive secondary school

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,319
