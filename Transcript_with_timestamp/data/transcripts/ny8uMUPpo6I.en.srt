1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,359
they say that for everything there is a

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,000
season

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,120
but tried telling that to a farmer niger

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,120
this year

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,120
normally hassam's millet harvest will

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,759
yield enough to feed his family for a

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,920
year but this time it will only last

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,039
three months

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,199
you say

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,519
if the rainy season is good

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,439
the graft is good like this

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,439
but now it's small like this

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,320
drought has caused crop failure

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,160
throughout the sahel

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,160
and the effects are already being felt

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,800
at the market nearby

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,559
millet prices have risen by 30

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,559
since the same time last year

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,680
even in the best of times poor education

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,000
and bad diet keep the beds full of

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,160
severely malnourished children at this

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,160
hospital nearby doso

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,640
the red means they may never reach their

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,800
full potential another generation

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,879
blighted by hunger

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,960
the devastated harvest has authorities

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,559
watching out for an increase in

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,320
admissions

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,119
nigeria struggles with some of the

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,760
highest rates in population growth and

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,159
poverty a drought like this year can set

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,040
many people over the edge from hunger

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,680
into starvation the last thing they need

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,119
is another hungry mouth to feed

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,000
no food

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,880
but that's exactly what is happening i

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,360
gon do in the end easy abdullah was

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,600
working as a garbage collector in libya

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,439
during the uprising he barely escaped

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,439
the lynch mob

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,320
he was evacuated by ship and then

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,520
airlifted back to niger he has five

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,079
children and his wife is in the hospital

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,320
now back home with no job he can't pay

45
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,520
her hospital bill much less finish the

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,840
house he was building with the

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,840
remittances he was sending from libya

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,200
hunger is forcing people to leave their

49
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,320
homes looking for work in nigeria benin

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
and the ivory coast

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,799
in this town only woman children and the

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,720
elderly remain

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,640
now even they have had enough

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,280
this woman says she has decided to go to

55
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,280
the capital miami to sell sand

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,879
it doesn't have to be this way just a

57
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,280
few kilometers away in gabi malal koia

58
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,440
tomatoes are growing in the desert the

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,959
world food program paid these women with

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:33,360
food to reclaim a silted lake

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,360
now it provides water life and hope

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,720
but humanitarian organizations are

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,200
fighting the perception that places like

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,599
niger are basket cases that there's no

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,200
point in trying to help nobody's asking

66
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,879
the world food program for a free

67
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,519
handout in niger

68
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,200
nobody not the government not the local

69
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,879
authorities and certainly not the women

70
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,040
in the community they're not asking us

71
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,760
for a free handout they're asking us for

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,239
some assistance so that they can stay in

73
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,959
their homes in their villages work in

74
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,239
their fields maintain their families

75
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,239
and keep their life going

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,720
niger's future begins and ends here

77
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,640
meals given to these children at school

78
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,400
ensures that they can concentrate on

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,519
learning instead of their hungry

80
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,000
stomachs

81
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,560
if tomatoes can flourish in the desert

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,879
then so can they

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,879
for the world food program i'm jonathan
