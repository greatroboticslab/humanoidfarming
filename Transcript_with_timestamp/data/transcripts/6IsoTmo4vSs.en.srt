Northwest a dynamic company is growing

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,400
this company has served the equipment

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,000
dealer market for 30 years they did it

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,880
by following their principles by being

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,520
the best and by being honest to their

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,640

focused

10
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,000
well inventory is a dirty word used but

11
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,680
you got to have used inventory for the

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,399
person that comes in on a given day to

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,000
have it not everybody can afford the new

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
one way or another if you don't have

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,239
some on the lot they drive through the

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,920
lot they don't even stop and the way our

17
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,120
lots are

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,640
located people are driving through all

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,720
the time and they'll say they'll call

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,479
and say well on my way through the pier

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,240
we looked at something we seen it what

22
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:10,920
have you but if it's sitting on the

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,840
country and you don't trade for it you

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:18,680
don't ever have it now unit wise we're

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,600
very heavy I'll admit that but

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,680
dollarwise because we don't have 10

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,640
combines 10 four-wheel drives things

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,439
like that thing there we can have

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,040
smaller inventory which looks outlandish

30
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,360
in most people's eyes but we're just one

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,560
small dealership with a huge inventory

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,280
that's covering a a very vast area and I

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,960
think because of that people are

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
stopping through on the way by seeing

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,960
what we have and we're getting phone

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,280
calls what enhances our sales through

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,200
the internet and things like that which

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,200
has been very

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,479
helpful in a small community in the
