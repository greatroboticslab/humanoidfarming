  "text": "in 2013 the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service entered into a cooperative agreement with the South Dakota no-till Association and I grow SDSU Extension for delivering the latest soil health and productivity technology to South Dakota farmers and ranchers a series of two local events were held in South Dakota in lemon and Fort Pierre ok thanks Ruth when I pass these out I have a handout if you already have it don't worry about it but I want to make sure everyone has that because I'm going to refer to it a little bit in my presentation now I'm going to be talking about cover crops oh yeah I remember that cover crops are just going to be one component of that soil health system do we talked about crop rotation diversity no-till we have cover crops in there as one component nutrient management and integrated pest management are the other two components are that five component cropping system designed for soil health we talked a little bit about the Saline areas okay I do have some soil test results from a saline area right in that Lantry area right around Ridge view east of RIT are west of Eagle Butte zone ten is going to be a very high saline area it's going to be weight on the surface look how much nitrogen is in the top two feet 1342 pounds I think that's enough to last for a while I was kind of surprised with the phosphorous they're not quite as high as I thought it's 37 per per million down below down here sodium 50 400 parts per million sodium so yeah there's a lot of a lot of different things in and those those saline areas sulfur maxed out on the scale 120 and in 360 okay how you mentioned before I mean just be talking about one small component of the soil health management system and just to give you a quick definition of cover crops to make sure we're all on the same page any crop does plan between periods of regular crop production to prevent soil erosion provide organic matter provide nitrogen the list goes on and on and on and on and we'll cover more here in a little bit but it's mainly looking at that for you guys is going to be looking at that intercrop period where where it's gonna be wheat harvested and then prior to the corn planting time for the most part or oat piece taken off for hay and then prior to the following year's cash crop if you're at all interested in cover crops you need to go to this website either order this book it's like 25 bucks or you can download it in a PDF format it is very valuable and it discusses a lot of these species in great detail that I'm going to be talking about throughout the this presentation another publication is overview of cover crops and green manures you can access that at this website there anywhere I give this presentation of something similar we talked about rainfall while you guys say I'm way to go to plant cover crops and we look at different periods throughout the year as far as your your rainfall goal is to determine that and I was kind of shocked I mean again growing up just south of Morristown I was shocked lemons 30 year average from 1971 to 2000 is a little bit over 18 inches that shocked me I I'm used to 1516 and if you look at Macintoshes 30 year period it is an exactly an inch eighty less than lemon but eighteen point two four inches so let's look at a couple of these inter crop periods where the cover crops may fit in and look at that rainfall period or amount of moisture that is a received in that period so when spring wheat would stop using an appreciable amount of water around August first again I realize that could they could shift anywhere from two weeks depending on the year to win corn would start using an appreciable amount of water twelve point four inches or twelve point twelve and a half inches of precip August 1st to July 1st for for spring wheat to sunflower a little bit over 15 and a half winter wheat to corn 13.8 16.9 for winter wheat to sunflower so what's that telling me is I think you do have a decent amount of moisture be able to get a cover crop growing in in that situation now you got to remember when you look at these preset values how much does it show a hole how much can in the top 5 feet how much water can that soil hold plant-available water usually no more than 11 inches and a lot of that's going to be dictated by soil textures so you're saying you're going to hold a lot less of plants available water it's going to be way less than that 11 inches it's going to be around that 8 7 or 8 inches compared to the heavier soils you you can't approach that 11 inches so what I'm saying is your cup is overfilled and you can you can spare a little bit of wire to to grow a cover crop and the reason the central part state was was gung-ho on cover crops was we were having a lot of trouble gaining corn planted in the wheat stubble and this is actually on Cronus farm this is a field north west of Gettysburg it's on really heavy clay soils it's actually cells promise oils which would be similar to Stanley County that they have some ground up there and the one on the right is where there was no cover crop planted in there after the previous year's wheat harvest compared to the one on the left now they ran on a seed raid in this area and they actually had to quit planting this corn the spring of 2008 because it was just balling up the planner they came back about ten days later looking straight north and the exact same spot through a little area very little stand corn stand there compared to where there was cover crops so it allowed them the traffic ability to get across that that field timely another concern is well okay it's using too much water and it does it will use an inch to inch and a half of water in the fall but by spring when you're planting your next year's crop what is it then and this is a subsidy from North Dakota near Bismarck this is on some fine sandy loam soils where they had cover crop plants available water was three inches no cover crop 3.11 so very little difference when it comes to planting corn difference for what that cover crop used the fall before so when we're selecting species you need to know that your objectives are for that cover crop on that particular field what do you want it accomplished we'll talk more about various objectives what will the following years cash crop be will it be corn will be sunflower that was going to dictate of what kind of mixtures you're going to want to be planting or what species are going to want to be planting for that for that cover crop big one herbicide applied to currents here's cash crop what did you put on that wheat crop that may carry over and damage that cover crop that's another huge concern so again a big list of objectives provide nitrogen add organic matter improve motivate sustain soil biology is a huge one huge one as you learned earlier today review soil erosion reduce compaction there's some species four that are going to be better that deeper compaction compared to surface compaction manage nutrients basically basically sequestered nutrients bring up those ones that are down in the root zone bring them up closer to the surface provide weed control that's a big one provide livestock grazing is a huge one and reducing soil salinity there's not a lot of species though to be able to plant and grow in those really white areas of the field as I showed you earlier you're going to basically be using that water to keep that white area from growing any larger but in the severe cases you're better off with with perennials in that in that situation just remember it two-thirds of the organic matter comes from the roots so don't get discouraged if your cover crops four five six inches tall you're still getting some some benefit down below not only from that sustaining that soil biology from moving forward but also a little bit from some organic matter that's being put into the system and increasing soil how should be the main focus for any crop plant system sales have been mined for years under tillage systems restoring soil resilience is the key and dwyane hid a lot about that on that earlier why resource or resilience increase soil organic matter again going back to that biology keeping that thing sustained in the live and movie improve water infiltration decrease soil compaction improve crop production or productivity and just an impact we'll talk a little bit more on some of this water and filtration some on some aggregates stability and so forth I like showing these next three slides here this is actually taken right south of Isabel about ten twelve miles I believe I took this on Labor Day of 2013 corn fuel bill as you can see or kind of a poor cornfield but it was all burnt up the history on this was and the field I'll show you next this one it was CLP for 20-some years it was taken out with tillage it was farmed conventionally with tillage a wheat there was the way like a wheat sunflower millet crop on there again all done with tillage new operator took it over and fall of 2012 late fall 2013 he planted corn out there you seen that very good cornfield and very close by another cornfield was taken out exact same time however it was strictly done with no-till it was never there was no disking or anything like that going on a streak strictly Modi servants no-till planting corn on both of these fields and they're very close together so he can't tell me that that that CRP he didn't provide some some benefit as far as long-term no tell water infiltration and so forth of what's taking place there so like believe said carbon is is huge what we need to do to mitigate mitigate drought impacts your own up here we're always 5 to 7 days away from drought always don't appear were about 14 days away from a drought but here we're always very very close to seem like we're always on the edge so that carbon is huge in this area especially and we need to include make sure we include obviously greater than 50% Dwayne once that 75 to 80 percent carbon into the system it's a fine line there it just depends on your patch nursery on a given field of what's going to sustain you but greater than two-thirds or greater would probably be ideal alternate sequences corn behind wheat corn behind soybean corn behind fuel P and I know you guys could raise some really good field peas up here like to see some some some more of those growing up in here eliminate crop residue removal if you got to take straw off of that for the livestock go to the neighbors whatever neighbor isn't here see if he can get his next year's corn stalks or wheat straw or whatever oat straw and use that because that's that's something that's extremely critical and if you're trained or hoping to we have no more does that come in the office that I always want to increase their main objective is the increased organic matter with these cover crops you are out there and the wheat field is all baled up I'm sorry to tell you there's no amount of cover crop out there that's going to to replace of what he removed with that wheat straw no-till with low disturbance openers and cover crop at cover crops were possible but monitor the percent brassicas you want to talk more about that in a little bit here so on some of those sheets that I gave you a lot was handed out there's some characteristics there but I try to summarize some of these in these next two tables of what species will do what as far as objectives and really it's just kind of kind of a bad government's recommendation it's not it's nothing science behind it but there's some things that that we can observe there of what what's good for what basically compaction here a lot of guys see these big radish ribs and they do do they do do some good for some deep compaction a lot of the surface compaction is better off with some finer root systems and that's where the rape is probably a better fit if you have more surface compaction and then some more the the very very fine species out there like teff produces a lot of fine roots and they get into the real small areas that break up mainly platy soil structure moisture I'm not gonna worry about that has more for over yeast where we try to get try to plant some species that are going to survive the winter and grow the following spring to use more and more yet over east nitrogen fixation basically any of the other legumes out there are you going to fix some nitrogen some of them are a warm season versus cool you need to keep that in mind there's a lot of these warm season ones if you're going to be planning after spring wheat you're just wasting your money they're going to die at 34 degrees and not even get close to freezing at all residue safety brassicas do a good job of that and we'll talk more about that in a minute nutrient cycling anything to go down deep in that soil profile and set up whatever nitrogen the leftover salinity these species here the barley sugar beet rape canola all handle some salts fairly well rice should also be in there so that pand all they gave you there that frontpage is just the characteristics of each of those species we have identified four for NRCS purposes you'll see the first seeding leader listed on there for each of the species and that's just there for if you wanted to design a system let's say you only want 20% of a species you just take point two times that full seeding rate to get 20% but the next two pages I put together last year and I debated whether or not to break it up into four different regions or five different regions across the state and I didn't it was easier to do it this way but I wanted I don't like to give you recipes and our old standard our old way of doing it we used to have premix is already built in there well the mixture I would recommend up here for a guy would be completely different for the guy down in the southeast part of state but you could still use the similar guide it's just going to have different different percentages in there of each of those types and I broke those species into different types you got the cool season broadleaf legumes the brassicas cool season broad leaves that aren't too legumes cool season grasses etc there's a percent range in there that I thought personally I thought would be would be ideal for meeting those objectives that you would want to select okay the Wunder cover crop more than likely doesn't exist it'd be awesome if we could just plant one it's going to grow it's going to accomplish everything we want but they just don't do well singly so we're going to be looking at mixtures and cocktails and a number of you guys are piping up to Bismarck I've heard Jay and Gabe preach that over and over and we're seeing the same thing in South Dakota now you need to look at your crop rotation what are you missing as far as a crop type is going to help determine which species or which dominant species are going to be planted you always want to be planting even the majority of your cover crop species need to be an opposite crop type of next year's cash crop so if you're planting corn next year you want to have more the majority of the species in this year's cover crop be grasses no of course these and Rowdies and some cool season grasses should be in the majority of the mixture you really don't want to put a lot of the one season grasses in there so again cover crop to be planted should be an opposite type of cash crop to be planted falling here so let's talk about some of these brassicas you always hear the word brassicas these are non legumes and there's a number of them brassicas and mustards so let's go through these canola if you do any canola oil make sure it's a winter type got law problems with spring types going to seed producing viable seed and some of that viable specie is actually from Roundup Ready canola so make sure it's a winter type I prefer to use rape it's very very similar to canola but it's actually better for grazing rate that's better than grazing then compared to canola just because it produces more leafy material and there's other hybrids out there with turnips and rape and so forth and we'll cover a few of those in a minute turnips another Brassica most common ones going to be the purple top kernel you're going to produce that round bulb and I have a picture of that here in a minute but most of those are the wrong ball there are some turnip varieties like Barkin that is more of a radish type looking root system the market is going to be more of Forge more valuable for Forge radish two main types I'll see the Forge I have a picture on that in a minute crabby kale Swede and then mustards and we haven't dealt a lot with some mustards one year we did some lady mustard that decor Lakes and in mich or in here on and that's leftist scum bomber not to go and look really good it produced a lot of biomass as I went to see but I don't think it was viable seed right you sprayed some of it because you were concerned with that but you also rolled some and then you left one strip no I think yeah yeah I don't think you sprayed much but you did do some my kale is going to be the part of the cold hardiest of Lamar's gonna tolerate temperatures down in the single digits for several nights in a row sweet is one we really don't deal with unless it's going to be a full season cover crop something you're going to plant in the spring it takes usually you don't want to start grazing it for about 180 days so it's one of those longer season ones they're known for the rapid fall growth great biomass production it produce a lot of biomass but most of that's 85 to 90 percent water protein content on a number of these brassicas are anywhere from 12 to 18 percent depending on if you're looking at the roots versus the top growth so pretty decent protein content they're assic excellent nutrient scavengers you go deep and their profiles suck up whatever nutrients are left over pest management characteristics most species release chemical compounds that may be toxic to soil borne pathogens and pests such as nematodes fungi and some weeds mustards usually have a higher concentration of these chemicals here's 30 days after growth left-hand sides turnips these middle two are radishes here then winter canola and then sugar beet that's 30 days after planting sixty days after planting here's your purple top turnips here's your radish dwarf s6 rape or winter canola I guess listed there and then your sugar beet so you see the different root architecture and again going back to deep compaction versus surface compaction this was probably better at surface compaction and this one is probably a little bit better at deeper compaction just a illustrate what it can do what brassicas can do for nutrient scavenging at s and Western so Lee County west of Oneida the cover crop was planted August 18th we split the field the soil test on it right after planting where the cover crop was at 88 versus 19 the top two feet you would expect them to be the same you could hopefully be the same and they were you compare that in late October went back out back out there the soil sample um 112 pounds where there was no cover crop compared to 18 pounds where there was a cover crop left over so that nitrogen is in is in that and that cover crop biomass being protected not able to leach down but it's going to release throughout next year's growing season and that's one of the questions that a lot of the researchers are working on for uni given area because the soil moisture and temperature dependent on how much of that nitrogen is going to be released to next year's cash crop we just can't come up with one number it's going to be a range if you're warm and wet it's going to be a high percentage of that is going to be released if you're too cold and dry it's gonna be a very low amount looking at manure they fit very well in a manure application time setting or a period these soil tests were taking in march 9th of or 2008 where there was cover crop there was 49 pounds left over in the top four feet compared to 233 pounds in the top four feet where there was no cover crop was that tell you they were over applying to burner maybe a little bit just to slide on fertilizing cover crops a lot of guys you know we're trying to minimize the input cost on a lot of these species and the last thing you want to do is throw more money yet when your grant however if you're planning on or hoping to graze them you get that timing rain right after planning you got an excellent stand you're going behind wheat you had a excellent wheat yield your protein was less than 12 or lower for low on the low side you know you're short of nitrogen you're probably going to want to throw a little bit of urea or 28% out there to to get some growth out there for biomass need to be considering that as fertilizer for next year's corn crop or whatever crop you're going to the more you want out of your cover crop the more it makes sense to nurture the cover crop just some examples on what cover crops can do for weed control this is actually on North Duane's north unit no cover crop on the left the previous year this is in the spring and the one on the right you see how the eating weeds going out there whatsoever no it's planted it was just planted you know you said you had the hard time hard slot to speak in to try the one right after lunch this another example we control of the guy was planted a few cover crops over here on the tree belt for hunting purposes went across the field to empty out the drill and and the rest of us didn't have it you see the huge difference there for weed control now a lot of guys get intimidated we get guys will release that do a lot of it just on prevent plant acres and they see this big amount of biomass out there and they're wondering how in the heck am I going to get out there next year the plant corner of that stuff so they don't listen to us on 1st thing you still go out there with their big discs and working under because they're still concerned but if you happen to leave that it just melts down especially if there's a lot of brassicas in there and millstone - absolutely nothing there's this nothing leftist they said it's 85 to 90% water even those big radish roots are just so tender and mild and it really does it there's no interference that whatsoever a lot of guys worried about their residue managers plugging up with these big rash roots or puts there's no way she's gonna cross that and we talked about those residue decomposes very quickly very low carbon and nitrogen ratio and I said before a lot of these tolerate cold temperatures LOM will handle in that mid to upper teens for several nights in a row if not weeks in a row and be just fine and keep growing here's an example of oil steel as compared to forge raddish Forge radish obviously after the name better for livestock grazing more leaf material produce and then I said there were hybrids hybrids a turnip and rape called Pasha hybrid of turnip and winter canola called T Raptor and hunter hybrid have turned up and kale called Winfred and this is going to be since there's kale in there it's gonna be extremely winter or tolerance of cold temperatures and if you're doing some late season grazing I would definitely include some of that in there now with these hybrids are a little bit higher in seed costs seed size is just a little bit bigger but for the most part it's it's it's we still use the same seeding rate and maybe maybe we need to change on those but I'll work with your your seed supplier on some of those as far as some of these hybrids and they can give you a pretty good figure in there to include in that mixture now remember that one slide I said monitor your percent Brassica why is that at the coal lakes in 2008 this is picture taken in July this is on the rotation on dry land when our wheat corn fuel P rotation there was no cover crop put in there there's actually corn grow out there right now in 2008 but the previous year after winter wheat there was no cover crop planted Dwayne planted several different treatments out there some of them included a hard percent Brassica and it would have been after two years of wheat so this would have been the cover crop would have been placed right here two years a wheat look at the bear gown July central South Dakota you don't want that 25 to 30 bushel yield hit 100% brassicas not a good plan so again as West you're going to want to take this sheet I gave you and monitor that percent Brassica you don't want to go over I don't think there's any of them over there maybe for the wildlife one there might be one that's 50% where all the rest are at 40% it's zero to 40% so throughout here you're gonna want to be in that 25 to 30% at most four percent brassicas brassicas like sulfur so if you're following corn behind that or even spring wheat behind a certain property had cover crops in I've seen sulfur deficiency in both of those crops you're going to want some salt sulfur out there I don't care what your soil test says just leg Anthony I don't rely on sulfur soil tests at all I think personally I think it's more of a sampling error than it is testing the air but maybe maybe I'm wrong there you're gonna want some sulfur out there depending on how you put it on that surface supplied you're going to want to about 25 pounds 20 to 25 if it's banded you can get by with that 8 to 10 maybe 12 pound range okay let's switch gears the cool season broadleafs non legumes sugar beet flax camelina sugar beets are tolerate or tolerance to salinity residue decomposes quickly good tap right palm is germination is very very poor at least we get the rejects from the seed companies and I have yet to be able to find a seed that you get a real good establishment off of sugar beets so I had quit recommending them but it's still one out there that if you happen to get a good seed supplier and the quality is good that germ is good I throw some in especially if you're looking at trying to address some salinity and cows just love these they love them pardon she do - okay fact small seed produced tap red does not tolerate quality drain soils or those high in soluble salts fairly tolerant to frost once once established and it's one facts is very mycorrhizal I started including a little bit of flax and ever and every mixture when in camelina we did a little bit of work with us in the Watertown area like its name says it's winter we're hoping that to survive the winter take off early in the spring it's a broadleaf we're trying to look at that opposite cover crop going to corn and we had limited limited success we had some come back but it was just I don't know I just maybe we need to revisit that again but we tried to work with some guys on it and it didn't do overly well it should but it didn't Christi's and broadleaf legumes we've got a whole host of them elfelfa sweet clover could be probably in that warm season one but we had red clover white clover else eight clover hairy vetch calm and veg notice two vetches very very different very important to know the difference hairy vetch versus common veg crimson clover chickling vetch third vetch feel pea and lentils the clovers I'm not going to talk a lot about these these are more more over East the sweet clover might have some fit here only thing I don't like about sweet clover 50% or more hard seed a gift that keeps on it keeps on giving hairy vetch a little bit of hard seed in there but the seed size is very similar to wheat so it's hard to get separated out it's one live not quite as bad sweet clover it's one of those that will keep seem like you plant at once and you have it for the next 15 years so I'm very hesitant I only recommend this the guys that I really really know well that they'll do a good job and controlling that volunteer because it will overwinter this one will overwinter well almost all the other ones I covered here for the most part will not overwinter the frost will kill them out for the most part we've had some dwarf Essex rape overwinter and very mild winters and if you're going to corn you need to be mixing a sulfonylurea in with your burn Dahl do not do a roundup Banville roundup 2 4 d it will not work it may look like it will work for 14 days but it will not work make sure you throw a little bit of Express or Harmony SG in there to take care of that but hairy vetch will overwinter just a picture of that crimson clover again more for over east picture that chickling vetch i like this one a lot produces a lot of nitrogen it's actually one of that the organic farmers grow a lot of it it it fixes a lot of nitrogen very quickly it's draw parent only problem seed costs aside seventy five cents a pound so if i know the guys not going to grieve because some of these can be toxic to cattle and sheep and it's mainly if it produces seed it's not the vegetative portion that is toxic it's mainly the seed but in some cases if you happen to plan it get it planted early it doesn't take long for them the flower and maybe produce a little bit of seed so you got to be watching there so if the guys don't raise graze that i recommend a little bit in the mixture but i'll dilute it out with some other cheaper legume species like common vetch like lentils those sorts of things and and and there's a picture of chickling vetch also known as grass pea i don't have a picture in here of in the end chickling vetch tolerates or handles the competition from these big leaf brassicas very well so it does a really good job in there that's just a picture of the mixture there there's lentil in there radish door 4-6 rape and chickling vetch I don't have a picture of the few peopie like few peas a lot but somewhat similar to chicken and veg to see can get kind of expensive because their seeding rate for a few peas I believe you look on the sheet I think it says seventy pounds so even if you're doing twenty thirty percent of that the seed costs gets up in a hurry a lot of these I'll do a small portion of the species that are really light depending on what cost is and then I'll do loot it out with some cheaper ones but they're in the same family there they're still a cool season legume lentils a lot of rentals out there Indian has red berries Rose town Morton's are some of the common ones smaller seed results in cheaper cost they're a little bit slower growing and not as aggressive most of these legumes lively you won't really see very robust early on depending on how much free nitrogen you have left remaining in the soil you we don't see these coming on until mid mid-september so before they really start taking off it's a picture of Indian Head lentils in Gettysburg warm season broad leaves legumes warm season broadleaf cow peas soybeans non legumes sunflowers and buckwheat safflower should be listed there also although safflower is kind of on the edge of cool and warm buckwheat short season crop residue decomposes quickly excuse me not as well tolerant scavengers nutrients phosphorus that are unavailable to other crops and what Mike was alluding to earlier this morning it actually releases a slight mild acidic exudate from its root system and anytime you throw an acid in the soil is actually gonna release some some phosphorus there so that's kind of where that's gets that from cow peas warm season broadleaf not not frost tolerant whatsoever but it likes it hot and dry so you guys in August I mean if you haven't planted timely you could throw some copies in if you don't get them planted up here by July 15th I would be very hesitant throwing throwing cow peas in there clear season grasses so I won't spend a lot of time on these since we grow a lot of them up here we know a lot about rye barley very salt tolerant and like that from that standpoint I do do some with some barley and oats is probably the biggest one that I add to every mixture I always put 20% it's in about 14 14 to 20 pounds depending if you're going to be grazing it or not fairly mycorrhizal does corn loves oats you plant corn and oats double does very well Trey Kelly a cross between Ryan durum wheat spring and winter types we got some guys messing with that that sort of stuff anyway I guess I don't think for the most part you and do a lot of that just watch where you get your seats if you do try some of it just not one of it's one of those cool season grasses that I love the whoop system it's very somewhat similar to test tough grass has a very fine root system but it's just very this is a very spindly plant in a cover crop mixture and most of the guys are using this over east and into Iowa the other cover crop if you want to start growing some seed Rye suruli and we've used to raise some cereal right when I was growing up up here I will take all your cereal rye you want I guarantee you that they use a lot of cereal right down there one of season grasses green and for sorghum millet Sedan grass sorghum hybrids corn TIFF grass we do a lot of these up here I'm not going to spend a lot of time tough grass is one that you probably haven't heard a lot of once these annual grass is very very small seeds generally and it comes coated or uncoated to help with the seeding process but anywhere from three to eight pounds depending on the thickness of the coat again a good root system as far as being very fine getting into small areas to help develop soil structure yeah it's very good hay quality very very good hay quality and there's a number of guys in the pier area some guys raised it for seed some guys have raised it for just strictly for hay get two or three cuttings off of it and done quite well with it now magic bait at least where I am at I want Covercraft planted by August 5th produces the most growth consistently this window we've studied this for three years that window was two weeks either side of that all the time some years this year probably would have been the year you could have got by with August 20th 25th and then just fine we just don't know secret is is what October is gonna be if I knew what October was gonna be every year I sure wouldn't be working for the government but for the most part earlier the better I have to get those established there's just a picture in McPherson County over there by Leola turnip radish German military own 6,500 pounds of dry weight now other guys want to bail these up so Ottoman bail them up compared to dis grazing him North Dakota study where they looked at grazing him the following year raising him that fall versus chopping him off looking at the following year's cash crop impact on yield grazing 91 bushel corn where they chopped and remove the residue 68 bushel corn removing that Armour is extremely valuable now this is just like it's just a quick study that I did on some corn stalks I sampled the field November 1st and it was graze this one field was grazed right next to it about it less than eighth mile away both of these fields have been managed by the same guy for the past 15 years and the soil tests were taken unfortunately after grazing I wish they would have had some so test before the grazing period but the producer was shocked looked at his own to here 24 parts per million Olson here compared to the ungrazed 11 again both of these both of these were managed the same way for the past 15 years that was your one after Daisy your - after grazing I thought that's a fluke never going to happen again same thing again they weren't graze that was sunflowers this year the other field was grazed this current year 18 compared to nine still holding steady I wasn't a fluke and actually held off her I have slices I forgot to add them in this one but I do have slides further for year three and they were still there they're getting closer together but it's still higher for where it was grazed the challenges are trained to figure out how to mix these together to see them most days with the air Cedars a lot easier if you do happen to do maybe some larger seat at fuel piece all of that chickling vetch chickling vetch seed do you have some of that here okay the chick vej she looks like Pete Rock and it's bigger so you probably need to keep that separate and put in a different tank and with air cuts easier to do with a 750 drill a lot more difficult if that's all you have a 750 drill I'd still throw them all together put in there only feel about half ways for because you know by the time you get it empty dollar is going to be started to get separated but most guys just throw them in together and this has been by far our best way to establish cover crops we've did this with a beet turnip truck and standing wheat back in 2008 and we did this six weeks be hard before harvest and it was way too early way too early we got cover crops to come and that wheat was still too green got shaded out and they died too early if you like broadcast understanding wheat I would not do it any more than maybe three weeks beforehand preferably two but the drilling method has been the best the main issue with the drilling that I see my part of the area with the biomass that we have over there guys seed set the drill to shallow most of time I tell guys depending on how worn their discs are is one notch less than wheat possibly two notches less than wheat I want you to cut through that residue I've seen too many fields where the guys started bright and early in the morning a shitty stand nice nice stance starting about 1/2 o'clock in the afternoon you can tell right where is that lady evening it goes back to crap again just because they were not cutting through this thick matter residue I know these seeds are small but you need to get them in the seed to soil contact I'm not going to cover that but we do have some termination guidelines and it does affect this area area if you do summer fallow and you try to put a cover crop on summer fallow it does affect this area because as of right now RMA insurance says that that cover crop needs to be terminated in 90 days before planting that next crop okay so the guys with fellow with winter wheat definitely going to impact you the guys with fallow going to spring wheat and you may be able to get by with that but check with NRCS we have this part of a it's attached to a practice standard if you're not familiar with it but one of your offices know and they can get that for you but in summary the benefits of cover crops accrue over several years you will see improvements in crop yield pest management and soil tilth if you commit to cover crop use whenever and wherever possible in your rotation and that's all I have so with that do I have any questions so let's write that for lunch I know it's just as hard for me as if for you guys great I got off easy",
