  "text": "good afternoon folks we have recently had some very cold weather here in Missouri and I've wanted to give you an update on the greenhouse to let you know how it did we got down to six degrees the lazy way outside and the greenhouse temperature got down to 1630 typical d'affaires results of course that's a 22 degree difference in temperature and when it was six below it was blowing outside it was pretty nasty we still kept 22 degrees warmer inside the greenhouse considering we have not had enough Sun and warm days to actually get our heat sink charged I'm pretty happy with those results as always thanks for watching if you have any questions about the greenhouse or growing a mittleider garden let me know",
