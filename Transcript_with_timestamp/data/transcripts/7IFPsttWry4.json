  "text": "now these quick hitches that we sell here good works tractors the spikos these red ones here they're going to be good for everything from a big 40 66r about as big of a compact tractor as you can get all the way down to a little subcompact like this 1025r the great thing about these speako quickhitches is that they don't use bushings okay so this little slot here is designed to be a direct fit with your category 1 your 7 8 pin that goes right in here a lot of the other quick hitches out there require you to stack on a category 3 bushing there's no real point of that besides spending more money we can ship these all over the country to you now let's get to that tip of the week this was a real scenario that happened with a customer recently that just purchased a quick hitch and went to hook up to their frontier rototiller it wasn't matching up so this isn't going to take care of every problem that's out there but this is going to be a common thing found on things like rototillers could be a sweep all like what we have right here i want to show you what it is so if you go ahead and you're backing up your tractor with the quick hitch to mate up okay with the pins you got two lower pins for your three point then you got the top middle so if your alignment with your bolt pins right here are not equal to the quick hitch spacing take a look and see if this lower bracket is welded or bolted on in this case here you can see it's going to be bolted on and what that allows you to do is loosen up the bolts slide this thing in or out same thing with the other side you still want to maintain an equal amount of spacing on both sides of the center pin back up accordingly get your center line for your quick hitch here and then just loosen it up see where you got to be center it and then you can go ahead and tighten these bolts back down really quick while we're bolting this lower link on let me tell you all about this sweep all here this is a lawn sweeper on steroids okay you're going to see it's pto driven it's going to have an electric dump from the seat bagger that's on here foam filled tires quick hitch compatible it comes in 48 or 60 inch wide increments there i'm gonna have a lot more information coming out about this going over a product overview as well as a lot of field test videos of this thing it picks up walnuts pine cones leaves aeration plugs the list just goes on and on nice good call well hopefully you found this helpful we gotta finish setting up this sweetball sweepster here and get it ready to go but it's not gonna solve every single compatibility issue there with a quick hitch but it's something to take a look at again this customer called in they weren't sure what was going on there the frontier was supposed to be quick hitch compatible the quick hitch is built to a standard specification there's no variation there besides this a fraction of an inch which isn't going to matter so take a look see if you have adjustable lower links on there that could solve the problem you're having if you like what you see here hit that like button and subscribe as well that would really help me out read through that description below there's going to be all sorts of helpful links for where you can buy this quick hitch the sweetball all sorts of cool stuff for tractor owners now we got to finish putting this thing together here before the sun goes down until next time stay safe we'll see you [Music] soon is it on yeah i didn't hear an action action we're shooting the same view though the whole time well right way to do it because it could be as simple as simply sliding your pin in or out left to right are you worried about saying sliding did i yeah thank you those are good catches i don't know what's going on",
