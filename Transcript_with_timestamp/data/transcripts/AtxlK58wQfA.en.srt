[Music]

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,080
the smell of that stuff you know

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,400
it's it's alive it's not dead

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,440
i just enjoy watching mother nature

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,000
working

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,600
i mean it's it's it's intriguing i mean

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,800
if you've never been around

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,720
doing composting and then you see it

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,160
change on a daily basis as you turn it

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:34,480
it's impressive most people say well

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,960
that can't be that to this

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,960
it is

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,680
we've been farming roughly around 1500

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,800
acres

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,000
of uh last year was probably the most

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,120
diverse that we've

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,680
ever been and having we had rye we had

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,039
peas

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,399
we had sunflowers edible beans soy beans

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,359
alfalfa and wheat so

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,800
we from a few years ago we were just

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,840
basically doing

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,119
uh soybeans and wheat and so we have

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,400
gone to to more of a diverse farming

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,280
operation

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,320
which i think is is is helpful in

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,759
management or

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,479
or to try to get your biology going so

29
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,960
this is our feedlot facility which we

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,000
call hollywood feeders

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,439
here in toronto south dakota and

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,720
we're a permitted facility for 34.99

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:36,400
head of beef cattle

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:40,479
so in a standard monoslope type barn the

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,520
livestock are bedded with straw and

36
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,479
and then that combines with their manure

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,479
and you have

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:52,799
a bed pack situation olsen custom farms

39
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,920
we farm about 12 000 acres in

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,719
in minnesota and south dakota so dual

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,320
county

42
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,439
lincoln county uh minnesota

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,719
and a little bit over in hamlin county

44
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,560
south dakota as well

45
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,759
right now we farm we're right around

46
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,399
2200 acres

47
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,360
soybeans corn sugar beets and and we do

48
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,680
have wheat every so

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,520
we don't have any wheat this year we'll

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,720
chop some of the corn for silage but we

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,920
tend to feed a lot of the

52
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,560
beet pulp from the from the factory but

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,160
it's nice

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,160
again to fit in with spreading the

55
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,000
manure if we're chopping silage we know

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,520
we can spread some manure and compost so

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,239
that works out really well

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,120
so with the feed lot we're um we're

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,800
allowed 999 through the state

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,319
we normally run about oh there's

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,080
probably 500

62
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,560
that we feed in there almost all

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,040
finishing so the feed lot processes is

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,080
i'll go in about every well right around

65
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,720
this time

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,599
every year with the excavator and pile

67
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,760
our piles

68
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,480
pile our piles where that we put our

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,680
bedding i'll pile as high as it'll go

70
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,280
and then we have we have our sloped

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,040
feed lot that goes into lagoon so all

72
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,440
that leachate runs in the lagoon

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,200
the manure starts to dry out and then

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,440
after a while normally it's

75
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,239
normally it's mid-august we'll start to

76
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,159
haul that

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,440
that manure out we try to do it in about

78
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,440
two two and a half days

79
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,000
that's our goal anyway so we tend to

80
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,519
we'll hire a contractor to come in with

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,879
one of those big trucks to haul and then

82
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,319
i just load them with the excavator

83
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,000
which works really well

84
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,159
normally we have about um per year

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,040
we have about probably 4 000 tons of

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,720
manure

87
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,480
but like this year it's a double year we

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,840
really had a wet year last year so we're

89
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,440
trying to figure out

90
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,599
what we're going to do there we try to

91
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
plant our acres based on

92
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,280
the crop that we're going to go into i

93
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,000
like to go into corn but we have in the

94
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,360
past

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
done it where we'll spread on ground

96
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,959
that's going into sugar beets because

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,799
normally that's weak

98
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,239
sometimes wheat ground so we can get it

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,159
we know we're going to get it spread we

100
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,000
can spread lime we can spread manure

101
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,599
so we've done that the last couple years

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
like i said before not all of it gets

103
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,519
turned to compost of the feedlot manure

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
that we take out but the stuff that we

105
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,720
do i'll either put

106
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,879
close to the farm and run my windrows

107
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,200
there or in the past i have gone

108
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,319
on the edge of a field dumped the manure

109
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,840
and then just turned it

110
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,840
you know four or five times and then

111
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,200
it's right there we're able to spread it

112
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,199
on the ground so

113
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,720
as far as spreading we've done a little

114
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,519
bit of both we've had custom guys come

115
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,720
in and spread

116
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,680
our compost and our manure but the last

117
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,199
few years we've bought

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,960
our own vertical spreader and so we've

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,320
been able to

120
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,320
spread with that and then have another

121
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,160
neighbor that brings his over so

122
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,360
but we've got a lot of material now so i

123
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,759
think we'll probably end up doing

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
something

125
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,040
just to get rid of it all we should be

126
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,560
able to spread

127
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,919
you know probably 500 of those acres i

128
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,280
would imagine this year is kind of my

129
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,160
goal that's how much we have a lot of

130
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,840
material

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,360
normally i'd only like to put on about

132
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,800
five ton but with the material we have

133
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,560
it might be closer to 10 maybe 15.

134
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,400
i'll i'll end up doing trials with that

135
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,160
too just to see the difference but

136
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,680
with the compost i'd like to spread a

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,320
little being that i have enough of the

138
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,080
product

139
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,240
i would really like to see what more you

140
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,840
know a higher amount does

141
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,600
to kind of maybe offset some of that

142
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,880
fertilizer side of it

143
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,639
that's one thing i really want to learn

144
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,639
though too is you know can i move

145
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,680
forward using a lot less fertilizer

146
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,199
because it's hard

147
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,039
it's hard to move away as i said before

148
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,280
from the npk mindset

149
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,440
but i know especially the p and the k i

150
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,160
know i can replace that with the compost

151
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,120
through

152
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,520
through time i live here on five acres

153
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,960
in

154
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,520
eastern wright county with my family who

155
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,080
is now just two of us because all the

156
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,560
other all the kids are gone now

157
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,639
but we still have four horses we've got

158
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,880
the two you can see in the background

159
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
two big boys and we got two little boys

160
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,600
out and back

161
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,199
clean stalls every evening before

162
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,880
everybody comes in from

163
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,720
being out here on the pasture or out in

164
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,639
the dry lot manure goes into a

165
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,120
wheelbarrow wheelbarrow comes out here

166
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,280
and we

167
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,600
just dump it here in front of the pile

168
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,280
and maybe once a week or so

169
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,840
kind of depends on how much manure we've

170
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,840
had i'll take the tractor and we'll load

171
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,039
it back up under the pile and stir the

172
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,039
pile at the same time

173
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,080
the reason i i started first of all is

174
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,280
i'm concerned about

175
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,319
first of all organic matter and second

176
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,840
more so infiltration

177
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,400
i think we have a real problem with

178
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,880
infiltration and

179
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,720
how do you remedy that and i still don't

180
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,160
have an answer for that

181
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,840
the other thing is that we've been

182
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,600
losing organic matter

183
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,840
in our soil and and we put in

184
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,639
most people feel we put all this residue

185
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,400
into the ground

186
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,400
it's got to go into organic matter but

187
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,039
most of it goes up into the air

188
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,280
i went to uh acres conference and there

189
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,400
was a guy there that

190
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,560
he showed the extract

191
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,680
and he showed it up on the screen and

192
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,599
you see all those critters moving around

193
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,960
and it says you know those are live in

194
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,800
our soil

195
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,319
and i think we need to get them get them

196
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,599
back in there again

197
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,240
the fertility is here this is one of our

198
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,440
business

199
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,639
entities of the farm but it was

200
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,080
very underutilized and

201
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,360
it's just was begging for the

202
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,080
opportunity because it's the best

203
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,800
fertility

204
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,319
we could have for the farm but how are

205
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,199
we going to get it

206
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,840
out on to the acres when i joined the

207
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,199
farm

208
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,479
as the agronomist i quickly identified

209
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,759
in

210
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,960
fall of 2016 that we needed

211
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,240
we could do a better job with this

212
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,479
fertility

213
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,319
and make it kind of the hub of our

214
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,599
fertility program

215
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,599
but the only way we were going to be

216
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,599
able to do that was to get it in a

217
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,400
transportable

218
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,120
package so to speak and that's where you

219
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,479
fall back on the idea of composting

220
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,720
diversification is is important

221
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,759
utilizing the acres that you have soil

222
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,039
health

223
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,080
all those buzzwords compost is at the

224
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,599
peak of that

225
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,120
yeah it's been 15 years since i've

226
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,120
started to do this and

227
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,960
every year is a new experience but i

228
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,000
really enjoy doing it and i enjoy

229
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,319
talking about it and i i just think um

230
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,919
it's i like to use the term it's the

231
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,599
right thing to do and it's also i think

232
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,960
it's it's the way things are going i

233
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,039
think it's um

234
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,400
is we're we're taking that that

235
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,039
management that

236
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,720
stewardship to the next level and we're

237
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,319
taking a waste product that people don't

238
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,280
want to look at they think it smells

239
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,120
they think

240
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,640
it looks bad and we're turning into

241
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,880
something that you could

242
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,159
give your kids and when they could eat

243
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,919
it and it wouldn't harm them that's an

244
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,839
amazing thing to me so

245
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,680
for me personally i think the

246
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,000
combination is is really

247
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,080
a really good way to go and i think from

248
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,560
a a sector side from an agriculture

249
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,560
sector

250
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,920
sector side we're gonna have to start

251
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,200
moving away from the synthetic

252
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,440
fertilizers from

253
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,120
relying on that and and if we're about

254
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,040
building our soil health it's putting

255
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,720
that organic matter back on the soil

256
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,760
every spring i spread it out on the

257
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,080
pasture

258
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,320
give the grass some nutrition and we use

259
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,839
it for garden mulch

260
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,200
and it reduces the the volume of the

261
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,519
manure

262
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
probably by a third it's a very

263
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,880
inexpensive thing to do you do have to

264
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,600
have equipment to keep your

265
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,200
the compost pile turned over i would

266
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,160
hate to have to do this with a shovel

267
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,640
that's for sure

268
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,560
it would be a better operation here if i

269
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,160
had started this on a concrete slab

270
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
because one of the problems is over the

271
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,760
over

272
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,240
well we've been here for 25 years and uh

273
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,399
the the ground around the manure pile is

274
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,399
starting to go down just because it gets

275
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,240
caught up in the in the bucket of the

276
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,959
tractor once in a while when we

277
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,560
turn the pile over the manure pile

278
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,959
itself is a composted

279
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,720
stays at a fairly high temperature but

280
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,640
it'll only do that if you keep it

281
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,160
turned over and keep it aerated and give

282
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,200
the bacteria some

283
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,080
some oxygen to live on good farming you

284
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,080
need a mix

285
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,399
of of the fungal and bacteria

286
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,560
and that's why i've done some more of

287
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,360
the of the static that i will introduce

288
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,320
the static

289
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,560
in with the with the regular compost

290
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,160
because most of our compost i can show

291
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,880
you those numbers but

292
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,760
most of the of the uh of the compost

293
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,800
that we build

294
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,600
in the row like this it's two gets too

295
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,600
hot

296
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,600
and the fungal material doesn't survive

297
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,279
and i'm hoping that we can once that

298
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,640
these piles are probably getting cool

299
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,839
enough now

300
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,240
that that we can do the the fungal

301
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,600
material add that to the compost

302
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,720
this is some finished compost

303
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,640
and uh here so

304
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,800
this is this is what this came from and

305
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,000
most people have a hard time

306
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,440
visualizing well this is soil i mean but

307
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,040
it's compost that

308
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,440
that's gone through the process of of

309
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,839
with

310
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,760
all the microbes and everything else and

311
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,839
and and digesting it

312
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,519
and this is the final result of that and

313
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,560
which is very

314
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,839
impressive stuff i use straw i

315
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,800
i've used pea straw i've used

316
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,200
soy bean straw i've used corn straw and

317
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,399
we also try to get wood chips if we

318
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,480
possibly can

319
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,680
this is the first time we've been using

320
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,440
a larger amount of hay because

321
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,680
we had some of our alfalfa that was left

322
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,640
over from last year we're using that and

323
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,399
we have

324
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,959
in the mix that we're doing right now

325
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:35,440
it'll be 30 bales of straw

326
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:38,880
on a roll with 15 bales of alfalfa

327
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,640
this is last year's alfalfa

328
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,240
so this is a really good nitrogen source

329
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,079
to add then with your because what kind

330
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,320
of straw is this then it's rye straw

331
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,320
okay

332
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,959
from the seat of the pants

333
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,160
it's it's basically what you've got

334
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,880
available yes

335
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,079
we normally green chop our road ditches

336
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,839
as as another

337
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,760
forage area so that would be another

338
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,279
nitrogen that's right the second type

339
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,440
too you put water on your

340
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,639
probably a few times before you put the

341
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,839
manure on top of it

342
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,279
it'll get a nice even

343
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,680
and so do you think you'd be able to

344
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,680
compost here without water

345
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,279
no i think water is important because

346
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,760
this stuff is so dry

347
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,720
when you start with so we will probably

348
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,279
dump like three semi loads of manure

349
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,880
into this here which would be 150 000

350
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,920
pounds and is that manure coming out is

351
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,240
that a bedded pack

352
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,000
that bed pack that back yeah and that'll

353
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,399
have some hay and straw

354
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,240
also in there too but it should make a

355
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,240
pretty hot mixture i would think

356
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,519
i usually don't have any problem with

357
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,360
temperature

358
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,279
you said that pile over there was even

359
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,200
up to 120 already well

360
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,959
when that got turned with that moisture

361
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,279
in there now that'll probably by tonight

362
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,880
or tomorrow morning it'll be up to 140

363
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,320
150 degrees and that's where your

364
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,959
biology starts working

365
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,760
on there and and uh breaking down

366
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,800
everything

367
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,320
uh in in there so that'll be a good

368
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,320
material for the soil

369
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,240
when your compost gets down to ambient

370
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,160
temperature you can use it

371
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,160
or another method is i think if you put

372
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,399
it into a zip lock bag

373
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,000
and if it doesn't smell ammonia you

374
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,720
you're okay to spread it

375
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,839
you notice that this is is this ideal

376
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,720
place

377
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,760
it's it's you've got a slope on it so

378
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,480
anybody that

379
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,680
you you you can't have it in a in a slew

380
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,320
hole i mean

381
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,760
you've got to be able to access your or

382
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,880
do your turning

383
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,120
even though you've had rain so

384
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,760
that's this here has got a nice gentle

385
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,320
slope and it hit heads off over to the

386
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,079
side

387
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,800
we've got the analysis of both the

388
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,920
regular windrow composting and also the

389
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,000
static compost

390
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:52,720
from the same material coming back

391
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,760
so if we have twelve thousand acres we

392
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,680
hope to apply

393
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,800
compost to four thousand every year

394
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,440
so every field will see compost

395
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,240
hopefully

396
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,839
once in every three years some people

397
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,040
work under their state

398
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,079
regulations others work under an epa

399
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,440
permit

400
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,440
but with this facility

401
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,160
it's easier to work under the state

402
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,680
regulations versus

403
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,800
an epa permit this particular county

404
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,639
you had to get a special use permit and

405
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,120
of course

406
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,959
the the neighbors concern was oh you're

407
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,279
gonna have more flies

408
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,160
more smell because now you've brought it

409
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,600
out

410
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,959
out on one particular site and not land

411
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,480
applied it

412
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,560
but with the inoculants and the

413
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,360
composting process

414
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,360
within one or two turns it's not manure

415
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,399
anymore it's compost and

416
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,120
it's basically odor free and then we'll

417
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,920
have

418
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,839
two pads where all the wind rose are

419
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,639
contained so we can hold

420
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:04,000
36 windrows that are 14 feet

421
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,399
by 160 feet long and

422
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,680
they're 160 feet because that's the

423
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,880
length of our

424
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,760
felt covers that we'll have over the

425
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,639
windrows

426
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,760
the felt covers are from for moisture

427
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,120
management because

428
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,440
in the composting process the microbes

429
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,639
want to stay at a consistent temperature

430
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,839
and moisture

431
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,279
and so excess moisture messes up that

432
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,560
process and

433
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,920
and the windrows getting too dry would

434
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,160
also shut that process down so

435
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,519
if we have them all covered we control

436
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,959
the moisture with

437
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,639
the compost turner and the car the water

438
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,320
cart that follows

439
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,800
uh we control and rain snow whatever

440
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,560
doesn't uh interfere with that or like

441
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,519
this summer we have a lot of hot windy

442
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,279
days

443
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,720
you would have to be adding water to

444
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,839
your windrows like

445
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,519
constantly the longer you have a run

446
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:07,440
the harder it is to get water away from

447
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:10,800
the windrows even on a design pad

448
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,560
so we shorten them up to 160s so

449
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,000
there'll be a

450
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,440
diversion channel kind of right in this

451
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,880
area

452
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:24,240
where the first runs water collects and

453
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,440
gets diverted to the containment pond so

454
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,959
within this site all the water

455
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,639
from a rain event excess water goes to

456
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,120
the containment

457
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,000
pond down there we didn't have a lot of

458
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,040
slope

459
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,079
to work with here so we have to kind of

460
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,120
create

461
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:46,480
this this the necessary slope

462
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:50,399
because most compost sites

463
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,199
you have to be able to work in you know

464
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,440
all the time and so it can't be a place

465
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,839
where water accumulates

466
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,199
it has to drain away because excess

467
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,279
moisture

468
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,160
uh doesn't lend itself well to

469
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,839
composting and that's why

470
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:11,120
we discover too that most large-scale

471
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,000
composting sites tend to be in more arid

472
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,319
areas

473
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,799
but over here where you have more

474
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,720
moisture you have to create

475
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,480
that condition where you can work with

476
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,760
your compost

477
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,120
on an almost daily basis because the

478
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,679
wind rose

479
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,720
will demand that this will be our

480
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:34,240
loadout spot that we're standing on here

481
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,559
to bring in trucks and we'll haul it to

482
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,840
the field

483
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:43,520
we're thinking with a live bottom truck

484
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,880
and then we'll meet the composter litter

485
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,559
spreader

486
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,919
out in the field and that'll have a

487
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,919
conveyor

488
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,600
so we can just back up with a live

489
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,640
bottom so we don't need another

490
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,720
payloader

491
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,960
we don't want a double handle in the

492
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,160
field that we're spreading we want that

493
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,360
to be efficient

494
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,280
the equipment to compost really

495
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,559
in the scope of what farm equipment

496
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,679
costs

497
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,240
isn't the obstacle because there's a

498
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,039
scale of composting equipment for every

499
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,880
size

500
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:19,200
operator it comes down to

501
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,160
the site and what how extensive a site

502
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,200
do you need

503
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,880
we probably wouldn't be able to permit

504
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:31,440
this facility had we not taken on

505
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,120
this type of manure management system

506
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,360
they would have had to redesign

507
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,520
something within

508
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,720
the barns or how the manures handled

509
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,880
because

510
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,760
under the new south dakota permitting

511
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,320
you can't

512
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:49,919
we can't store minerv for very long

513
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,240
outside the barn if at all depending on

514
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,080
what your situation is out here with the

515
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,520
feed lot when my father-in-law built the

516
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
feedlot

517
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,039
it was kind of nice because he had to to

518
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,480
come under

519
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,919
the guidelines of the feedlot runoff and

520
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,160
so in dealing with the manure we had a

521
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,080
best management practice plan

522
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,760
and then with the composting it fit

523
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,280
really well into that and and we're able

524
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,600
to utilize

525
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,559
a lot more of that product on on a wider

526
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,480
acre

527
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,160
basis as you can see out here the beets

528
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,679
have been the biggest challenge

529
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,520
most of the time you're dealing with

530
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,679
either a carbon source or a nitrogen

531
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,280
source and what i've found is

532
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,200
it almost goes from a carbon to a

533
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,679
nitrogen back and forth depending on

534
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,520
on the how the beets feel i mean they

535
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,720
start off really spongy but then as they

536
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,960
dry out

537
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,480
they get really hard basically like a

538
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,480
carbon source and so

539
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,919
finding that happy medium of of what to

540
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,480
do with the beets has been

541
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,840
has been a i won't say tough because it

542
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,120
it really isn't tough it's just

543
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,120
it's it's interesting and it's uh

544
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,640
i like the interesting side of compost

545
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,320
too so

546
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
what i found with this and and again

547
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,120
that's one of the main reasons i bought

548
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,559
my turner is

549
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,480
you know if a guy could start off with a

550
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,400
smaller particle size you would be way

551
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,400
better off with my machine

552
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,400
after two times it really breaks that

553
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,679
stuff down the ingredient part is the

554
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,559
main thing i

555
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,480
i have found with our manure we use we

556
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,640
use straw throughout the year

557
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,240
so we tend to have a pretty good mixture

558
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,840
based on just the straw

559
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,000
that we put in with the manure in the

560
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,320
feed lot i don't have to add a lot

561
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,520
with the beets like i say the the

562
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,760
moisture level can

563
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,600
vary so much that it's more of kind of a

564
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,360
feel and a look for me

565
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,960
so i don't really have a recipe at this

566
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,520
point again

567
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,799
um you know there's a few things i try

568
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,480
to do to

569
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,320
to start that process a little quicker

570
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,679
but you know over time it

571
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,440
you know it starts to heat up even

572
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,360
without turning it and then

573
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,640
getting that particle size down is is

574
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,320
kind of the main thing so

575
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,760
talking about mistakes and i made a lot

576
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,520
of mistakes is

577
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,200
is the carbon side of it i've i've

578
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,960
really come to find out

579
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,640
and my dad has too that you know the

580
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,440
manure is good but but you can have too

581
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,400
much of it

582
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,840
you know what i mean and if you're going

583
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,440
for a good product you don't need a

584
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,120
whole lot of manure i consider the

585
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,679
manure to be kind of a

586
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,400
magic elixir but you can you can get in

587
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,720
trouble with

588
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,400
with it heating up too much as far as

589
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,440
when you apply it especially repeat

590
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,799
customers

591
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,200
because they think a little is good a

592
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,799
lot must be better so i've really tried

593
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,720
to go away from

594
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,240
just doing straight manure piles out of

595
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,080
the feedlot we still do it

596
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,760
but if i'm going for a good product i'll

597
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,039
basically start with my carbon source

598
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,799
and then add the manure

599
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,640
here it's almost trying to keep the

600
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,840
moisture out of it

601
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,360
i deal more with with puddling which

602
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,000
creates a challenge even with

603
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,760
with the equipment you know sometimes a

604
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,440
two-wheel drive tractor is not enough to

605
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,360
even pull sometimes which is

606
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,600
kind of frustrating but the heavier

607
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,280
ground out here poses a challenge but

608
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,960
i've been able to get around that now

609
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,159
that's where hankinson comes into play

610
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,159
i've got some

611
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,919
some compost ground down by hankinson

612
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,799
north dakota where it's basically blow

613
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,159
sand

614
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,840
and it can be raining and i can be

615
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,520
turning so i love making

616
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,360
compost down there and it makes a really

617
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,320
good product too

618
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,159
well here it was just uh the the

619
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,840
closeness to the feedlot

620
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,000
um i didn't want to have to haul it very

621
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,720
far and we had a spot

622
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,640
uh that was close enough that that had a

623
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,320
you know a good enough

624
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,080
drainage site um that that worked and i

625
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,600
and i try to move my piles around so i'm

626
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,799
not putting it on the same spot but i

627
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,760
also don't want to take up a lot of

628
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,840
ground but

629
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,520
i've also done where we'll we'll pile

630
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,799
manure on the end of a field i'll turn

631
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,200
it and then we spread it right away

632
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,039
which

633
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,440
really works nice and that's a year

634
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,400
process the trucking cost is always

635
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,200
something that

636
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,799
i really take into account because it

637
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,000
can get expensive but it's no different

638
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,600
than

639
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
you know if you're having to haul manure

640
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,360
i try to take into account that and and

641
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,480
with the compost you're hauling a lot

642
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,000
less material too

643
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,200
the marketing side of it of course i

644
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,120
want to get to the point where i can

645
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,559
market almost all of it

646
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,320
i'd like i'd love to get to the point

647
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,320
where i have a really good product

648
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,440
i can find growers especially organic

649
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,200
guys that that

650
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,720
they would really appreciate a good

651
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,159
product that they could use

652
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,840
um and maybe even some of the

653
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,360
conventional guys to see that

654
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,799
you know the big thing is soil health

655
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,559
right now i don't know of a better way

656
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,840
to build your soil than put compost

657
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,840
other than maybe cover crops

658
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
my dad had this this exact machine he

659
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,679
bought his brand new

660
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,760
about 15 years ago i was able to find

661
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,520
this one used and i knew i wanted to

662
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,000
find the same machine if i could do that

663
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,720
just because

664
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,760
i knew it it's simple and to be honest

665
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,799
it makes a really good product

666
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,559
it's not aggressive but once the

667
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,320
material starts to break down it really

668
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,320
does a good job of incorporating

669
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,400
the material and also incorporating the

670
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,360
oxygen and

671
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,880
the biggest thing that i found and in

672
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,320
most cases you would think that you

673
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,919
would want the machine to turn really

674
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,480
fast when i start off i do

675
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,039
run it fast but as time goes on those

676
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,720
those mic

677
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,320
you know the microorganisms do more of

678
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,600
the work than the machine does

679
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,520
and basically what i do with this

680
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,679
machine is is i'm basically just

681
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,600
fluffing that material

682
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,960
and and just trying to

683
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,320
you know if it's reaching that

684
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,159
temperature that i want to turn it out

685
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,039
that's kind of my basis for when i turn

686
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,279
but

687
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,960
i'm not looking at being aggressive once

688
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,279
once it starts to break down and

689
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,120
those piles get get small by the by the

690
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,760
end of the process so

691
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,440
one of the downfalls of this machine is

692
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,640
is it doesn't quite fit a dump truck

693
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,320
when you're dumping

694
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,240
your material so you're constantly in

695
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,919
your loader sizing up your windrows and

696
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,159
that's the only downfall

697
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,320
that i have with this machine so now

698
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,559
this machine right here

699
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,159
was i think this cost me about fifteen

700
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,360
thousand dollars which i felt was a

701
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,080
pretty good price

702
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,799
um so and they're they're not easy to

703
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,039
find

704
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,159
but um but if a guy can find one and

705
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,279
they're they're beginning there's

706
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,039
beginning to be more and

707
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,120
with the internet you can find you can

708
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,799
find them more and more this machine new

709
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,880
with the water is is probably 50

710
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,320
000 i think so yeah this machine has

711
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,559
been a big boon to

712
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,080
our operation um as you can see i've got

713
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,520
all the flails off but i did put a

714
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,320
couple

715
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,440
a couple on here just to show you can

716
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,279
see how

717
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,480
how big these knives are compared to the

718
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,120
other

719
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,679
the other machine now the reason i

720
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,279
bought this

721
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,320
machine was is i was getting a lot more

722
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,880
material

723
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,240
and i wanted to get through it quicker

724
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,640
than i was getting through with that

725
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,559
other machine and i wanted to do

726
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,640
i wanted to to start with a smaller

727
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,919
particle size was the biggest thing

728
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:29,279
it just really um

729
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,720
this thing is really aggressive

730
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,480
it doesn't make as good a finished

731
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,360
product and i would recommend that's why

732
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,440
it's nice

733
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,360
i really don't want to have two machines

734
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,080
but it's worked out really well

735
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,000
that i can i can start off my piles and

736
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,000
and get going on them fast and handle a

737
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,640
lot of material i can do almost 2 500

738
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,480
tons

739
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,480
an hour with this thing

740
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,240
and then when the piles start to get

741
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,799
smaller i come through and and use that

742
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,799
other machine

743
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,440
of course it's it's more expensive

744
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,320
and they're harder to find and i didn't

745
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,880
like the self-contained engine but

746
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,360
it was kind of just what worked at the

747
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,440
time

748
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,240
so every one of those then will have a

749
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,880
knife it's got 80 knives on it yup

750
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,799
it makes you know going through manure

751
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,559
pot heavy manure

752
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,799
can cause a lot of issues with that

753
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,919
other machine if you if you

754
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,880
um if you have a too big of a pile this

755
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,200
thing

756
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,720
i it will go through anything it's it's

757
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,279
unbelievable

758
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,760
what's nice about the vertical beater is

759
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,600
i

760
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,039
i've used compost spreaders in the past

761
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,200
and i love them but we still spread

762
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,200
manure and you can't spread

763
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,720
and i'm not i'm not an all or nothing

764
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,159
guy i mean sometimes

765
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,919
you just run into problems where you

766
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,760
don't have the time and manure is still

767
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,480
a great product in my mind

768
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,159
so we're able to uh to kind of kill two

769
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,360
birds with one stone we spread lime with

770
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,120
it too

771
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,840
spent lime from the beet factory so for

772
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,120
us this was a no-brainer

773
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,559
we probably need a couple more but

774
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,799
this works really well and the nice

775
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,559
thing and what i've looked at doing is

776
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,840
i can take these beaters off and build

777
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,480
windrows also

778
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,000
as a barrier to entry our our feed lot

779
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,360
corresponds with the composting

780
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,440
equipment just perfectly

781
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,200
the only excess piece of equipment i've

782
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,799
had to buy ism is a turner

783
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,960
i mean everything else i can use in the

784
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,559
feedlot the manure spreader this this

785
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,000
has worked out really well for adding my

786
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,279
carbon source to to

787
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,039
my piles um and then you know of course

788
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,880
the the spreader and then trucks and

789
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,760
loaders you know you have those your

790
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,240
you have those already so that that to

791
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,240
me was

792
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,520
was just was awesome when people ask

793
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,840
about you know getting into

794
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,600
into composting if you if you have

795
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,279
cattle already and are feeding or

796
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,640
you know even just a rancher you have

797
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,440
the majority of the equipment already

798
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,600
which is

799
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,120
which is just huge because it's pretty

800
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,399
easy to go and spend a lot of money on

801
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,440
equipment if that's

802
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,720
you know if you're looking to get

803
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,200
started without without that already

804
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,000
this is basically straight manure with

805
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,200
you know we mix

806
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,720
um corn stalks and wheat straw yeah and

807
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,559
this stuff was screened with a quarter

808
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,320
inch screen this is about

809
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,840
oh two two-year-old two-year-old

810
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,120
material so

811
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,640
this would be something i would sell to

812
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,240
a gardener the stuff that i would apply

813
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,120
would have bigger chunks i mean this

814
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,399
stuff

815
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,880
as you can see there's chunks here but

816
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:16,399
it breaks apart it's it's friable so

817
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,320
um but nothing like it

818
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,320
when i start to turn my product i do

819
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,240
have the end user in mind of what

820
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,440
i i don't want to sell to a local

821
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,200
gardener

822
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,360
or a local landscape or a product that

823
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,399
doesn't look good and so

824
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,159
um i've i've come to the conclusion that

825
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,840
you know that's my machine to make a

826
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,760
good finished product and i also want to

827
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,000
try to screen it if possible so i do

828
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,559
have access to a screener

829
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,159
and that makes a huge difference um and

830
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,600
there's a difference to compost most

831
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,880
people think compost is just

832
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,320
one big thing but you know some of that

833
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,039
finished compost i'll turn

834
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,880
15 times if i have to do it the stuff

835
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,880
that i put on my fields i'll do

836
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,640
a minimum of four normally it ends up

837
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,840
being about six

838
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,840
seven times

839
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,159
it's more of an art than a science is at

840
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,760
the end of the day you have different

841
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,960
conditions it might rain and then you've

842
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,240
got to decide

843
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,000
you know you might have a smell that

844
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,520
doesn't quite smell right i got to go

845
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,200
add some carbon to it so

846
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,159
it does take take some time especially

847
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,120
if you're trying to make that high

848
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,480
quality product

849
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,159
figure out what you're trying to do we

850
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,360
made the mistake of buying one for a

851
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,360
skid steer right away and it was a

852
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,919
complete waste of time it made a good

853
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,679
product

854
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,440
so someone on a small scale i would say

855
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,679
that's a great way to start

856
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,440
we were dealing with my dad's business

857
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,480
in probably three to four thousand tons

858
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,520
a year

859
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,640
and i would say even a loader is too

860
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,600
is too small and it's too slow to to do

861
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,440
a good job

862
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,880
i would recommend right away someone

863
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,960
getting a machine whether it's by

864
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,480
yourself or with a neighbor you know

865
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,880
you're not turning all year so

866
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,159
it's it's probably a machine that that

867
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,120
you can trade with you know

868
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,279
trade time and and labor with but i

869
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,120
would recommend getting a machine now

870
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,039
size wise this is a good way to start

871
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,039
but like i said if if you're wanting to

872
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,080
to be the most efficient a wider machine

873
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,919
would probably

874
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,919
be the best way to go the other mistake

875
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,080
i think a lot of guys starting out

876
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,000
might make is is thinking they can can

877
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,799
get away with just a normal transmission

878
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,679
tractor um you basically have to have a

879
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,240
creeper

880
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,200
an ivt or a hydro to do a good job

881
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,480
because you're

882
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,559
when you're starting off with a big

883
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,840
windrow no matter whether it's this

884
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,120
machine or the other machine i'll show

885
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,120
you you're wanting to go probably less

886
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,919
than half a mile an hour and even slower

887
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,000
because

888
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,960
you're moving a lot of material and once

889
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,799
you start

890
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,640
breaking that material down it does get

891
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,480
easier but you

892
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,960
you'd be riding the clutch a lot on a

893
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,399
tractor so if i were to start and budget

894
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,960
was the biggest thing

895
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,840
a vertica or a horizontal beater manure

896
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,919
spreader

897
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,120
would be able to do would would be able

898
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,039
to do a pretty good job

899
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,880
especially on a small scale because it

900
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,000
starts that process it starts to heat it

901
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,279
up

902
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,799
and then if you have a loader you can

903
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,480
come and turn it later and and you've

904
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,840
got a a decent product especially if

905
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,360
you're just putting on farm ground

906
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,120
i'm never concerned about what other

907
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,880
people think in in

908
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,960
if i was i wouldn't be doing what i'm

909
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,000
doing uh

910
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,320
and i you don't always win

911
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,880
you probably lose more than you win but

912
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,960
i i'm always up for a challenge

913
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,000
and this is probably a real real

914
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,399
challenge

915
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,480
the thing is you've got to be committed

916
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,080
and if you're not committed don't even

917
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,840
start because

918
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,000
it can be trying you know a lot of

919
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,279
people say well compost isn't worth it

920
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,519
or whatever but i

921
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,360
i still think it's got a lot of benefits

922
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,360
you know to composting so

923
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,760
you just don't think that this can have

924
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:41,519
but this is mother nature

925
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:41,519
working at its finest
