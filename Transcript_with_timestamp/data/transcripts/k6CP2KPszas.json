  "text": "Hey. Hey. Look at here. Look at here. Oh my gosh. Heck yeah. Heck yeah. So, typical Oklahoma. We recently had some thunderstorms, some rain, and uh we was in Oklahoma City for a wedding and it was snowing up there. Just don't count out April. Well, me and the girls pull up to the ranch. I noticed a turkey pin has moved a little bit and I saw something standing outside the front of it and I was like, we've got a turkey out. There's a hen on the outside of the [Music] pit. Think that water gap is okay, Jessie? Yeah, we'll go check that water gap. This is Interesting. Bison already been here. Well, look at that. I think the water got up just a tad. This is our normal crossing. There's some of them cedars I cut down or somebody cut down. It's something that you cut down. I don't know. It depends on where it came from. I don't think it could be anything. Maybe Yeah. Always a good time to look for arrowheads. All right. Well, guess we'll go around it. We go around it. Oh, yeah. They come. Well, they're not out. That's good. Oh, there they are. Yeah. That's They heard us. Positive is that they're in here. Oh, they're excited to see us. Let's hope that fence gap water gap. [Music] Hold [Music] [Applause] [Applause] on. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Where are you going, guys? Bullet. He's back here behind us. What are you doing? Here, Jazz. Okay. It's not got a limb on your head there. What are you all jazzed up for? Who's that? Peter Cole. She is fiery. Um, Elanor. Yep. Eleanor is from Seek of Observation. Did that limb start to snap or has it always been that low, doesn't it? It's always been low. [Music] Oh, also got a T-Rex out here, huh? Well, it's still holding up. I can't believe it didn't wash more of the Oh, did you not lock the gate, hun? No. Back. Stay in tight. [Music] I did clearance the light. How about that? I do like that. You like it, too? It's nice, huh? We the lane. Dad made us a little lane sneaker route so we can sneak back out of here. Yeah. Get her. She's still at it. Oh, look at her. What? Well, that's all. Is this Peter Cole still? Yes, it is. Chase a [Music] She's running. Yeah. What is going on? She met all the way over here. Yeah, that's crazy. I saw that. It was weird. Why the storm? Oh, she ran Eleanor into the She can't see. She looks good. Yeah. Hello. [Applause] Now the wind got for sure. [Music] Easy there, T-Rex. Well, I don't worry about um I like Big Joe and Elanor together, but Elanor go somewhere else. And I That was That was last year, babe. Yeah, it was last year on the other video. [Music] Bullet, get in. Load up. It's very funny actually. Bullet. Oh jeez. Oh my dog. Bullet. Load up. You're going to stay. Stay. Great. She's going to come jumping in here and then But it's pretty interesting because that's what they probably do to wolves and coyotes, right? Oh, yeah. They do. Just they all gang up and they're not letting her anywhere near. Well, Jackie's taking her somewhere. Well, we'll have to go get Maya. I want to give a big thank you to our sponsor today, AG1. So, I do a lot of my video editing and taking care of everything early in the morning, social media wise. It's one of the first things that I do and something I do before I drink my cup of coffee as I start with AG1. Don't get me wrong, I love coffee. Coffee can sometimes lead to crashes in the afternoon. AG1 is going to fill in the gaps with whole food nutrients that your body needs on a daily basis to keep me energized and going through the rest of the day. Or maybe I'm don't get so hungry in the afternoons or in the evenings. If so, if you start your day off with water or any type of juice, little secret, you can add orange juice or pineapple juice with your AG1. It's pretty good. Get a scoop of AG1, throw it in there with your water or your juice before your coffee, which I highly suggest. Shake it up and you're set. Over 75 vitamins and minerals just in one scoop. As humans, we have to have a healthy bacteria in our gut. So, what comes in your starter packet is the AG1 can, the powder, also comes with this really neat bottle. It also comes with a solid scoop to get all that goodness. Comes with the liquid vitamin supplement. And don't forget about your to-go packets. When you put the powder in your can, and make sure you keep it refrigerated, just a little side tip right there. Get started with AG1 for less than $3 a day when you subscribe. Just head to the link in my description or scan the QR code or you can visit drinkag1.com/crossimbers and order your AG1 for less than a cup of coffee per day. Here comes Jack. He just put the brakes on and stopped grazing right there. Started grazing right there. He had to know how to hand it with his tail up and everything. What are you doing, bullet? Yeah, I'm the dinosaur. You are the dinosaur right now. Well, since the Big Joe herd is out in the burn unit and this cover crop is growing so good and so crazy right now because the moisture we've had, uh we decided to let our breeding bulls and uh some other bulls that we raised and we are selling uh for breed bulls. So, these are incoming 2-year-old bulls, including our knucklehead blackjack. He'll join the Big Joe herd eventually again. But this cover crop is doing so well, we just let them in here and let them graze some of it. Meanwhile, the chickens are hanging out. [Music] So, there's the hen. Have to figure out how to get her back in. And the panel moved. Wow. We had quite the storm. It moved this entire panel. Poor hen. She got out something. All right, guys. We're going to try to move you. There's the eggs. Dang it. Got two turkey eggs, guys. I must had a wild party. What What are you doing in What are you doing in here? Oh gosh. You do not belong in here. Okay, there's the hen. Maybe she'll come around. You guys are going underneath it. Not Not right now. Jeez. Let's see if I can get this hen to come around these chickens. Get back. Don't want the whole group out. This is going to be challenging. Get back. Keep coming, Hen. Keep coming. Oh, keep coming. Oh, just a little bit. Dang it. Take a lot of risk right here. The gobbler, he can see it. Oh, come on in. is about to escape. [Music] Come on, Hen. Make your way around. This is quite the challenge. All right, so I'm going to set these eggs down right here. That gate just shut. Let's move this pin a [Music] little. Have to move this. I got the wheels up. So nice this thing rolls like it [Music] does chatter bugs. All right, we got to get you back in here, girl. It's your family. There we go. Oh, there's another one. Oh, we got to be easy. [Music] Look at there. So, I made a box for him a couple days ago. Let's see if this open for her. She's hanging out with the chickens. Keep going around, hun. She's taking a ris. She wants to come back over here. Let me put these eggs back in here. Oh, lookucky there. Lucky there. Oh, don't escape. Please get get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Not for y'all. Oh dear. Put that there. Shoo. Shoo. Shoo. Shoot. Okay, Hen. Oh, yes. Hen is back in. Now, what I want to do is I got to This needs to really be in that corner over there since they're laying eggs now. At least she's back in here. That's good. go ahead and get feed for him. So, I'm assuming when I came up here first, one of the wheels was lifted up on this. Must have got enough wind from the storms here recently to lift it up and she was able to get underneath it and kind of escape like these chickens were coming in a while ago. It's get underneath it. So, when you lower these wheels, see, now it's completely flat. The wind must have picked it up enough Now I've got it pushed up against this trailer right now. Now it's completely level to the ground. Must have happened. But she's back in. And this is so exciting. So, the question is, guys, do we let the hens, they just keep laying them? I put a box in here and they keep laying the eggs um just out in the middle. And so, I don't know what to do. Um I need some help here. Do we go ahead and collect all these eggs and start the incubator? Do we do that? Or my intention was to let them naturally sit on these eggs once they had their clutches and would have them naturally and set on them. And turkeys take 28 days uh to hatch compared to a chick uh which is 21. So, need your help, need your guidance. We do have some incubators or do we let them have them naturally? It's a chance. It's a risk. Whatever you do, it doesn't matter. You're dealing with a wild turkey egg. I do know that it is hard to incubate. I've heard that. So, anyways, you guys let us know what you think. So, why we kept these guys was for this right here. We wanted to keep these three hands and four toms so that we could get lots of these right here. We could hatch them out, raise them up till about 3 or 4 months old and then let them all go at the ponderosa. We wanted a larger flock. So, that was the whole point of it is right here. And it's so satisfying to see this and so exciting to see it as well. Next stage is probably incubation more than likely because the hens aren't setting. I want to give a big thanks to AG1 for sponsoring today's video. You guys can go to drinkag1.com/costimbers or check the link in our description here. Thank you guys for watching. We'll see you guys soon. We're going to keep on buying ranching and turkey ranching.",
