00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,400
hello viewers welcome to elim TV a

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,560
station where you watch interact and

3
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,920
also learn your teacher today is Mr an

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,879
agriculture teacher in today's lesson we

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,000
are in form four Lesson 12 and the topic

6
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:40,480
is Portrait production and the subtopic

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,160
is routine management practices in poy

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,440
on to the lesson objectives uh by the

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,800
end of this lesson you should be able to

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,399
explain the various routine management

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:55,440
practices in ptry uh number two uh

12
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:57,359
methods used in identifying a good uh

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,440
layer uh the routine management

14
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,199
practices in portrait include number one

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,439
feeding and number two control of

16
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:07,439
diseases and and um the disease that

17
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,759
you're supposed to control uh you're

18
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:14,680
supposed to control goomo then we have

19
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:17,479
nucum and uh you have full typhoid and

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,840
number three we have control of parasite

21
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:23,360
using appropriate method you can do

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,759
dusting also you can use a dust bath and

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,000
as uh the dust bath uh dusting uh and

24
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,079
also the waras so that you can uh get r

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,759
of the worms then uh we'll go to the

26
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,680
control of parasite and the control of

27
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,240
parasite you have the dusting as I've

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,840
said then we have warmers and then

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,240
number number four we'll go to egg

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,159
collection that is another control

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,719
management practices that is supposed to

32
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,920
be carried out during pot production

33
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,280
you're supposed to regularly control the

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,200
to collect the egg so that you can

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,119
control the vies of egg eating then the

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,159
perpetual egg eater and the Perpetual

37
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:08,080
cannibals are supposed to be deied uh

38
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,120
this is the process as I explained the

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,360
previous lesson of cutting short the uh

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,120
some section of the upper P to control

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:21,040
the egg eating Vice and also cannibalism

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,680
curling is also another one and we'll go

43
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,080
to the characteristic for birds to be

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,599
Cur what are the characteristic what are

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,319
the traits are we supposed to check so

46
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,760
that we can know that this bir is

47
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,760
supposed to be called and this is this

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,120
bird is supposed to be left to continue

49
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,200
with production uh the first one poor

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,760
growth those birds which have poor

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,760
growth should be C out then number two

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,519
chronic disease then number three old

53
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,200
age those birs which are old of age they

54
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:53,800
are supposed to be called uh by selling

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,840
them you sell them or you slaughter them

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,280
uh because they have a less level of

57
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,680
production they normally lay few eggs

58
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,519
and also so the body weight is also very

59
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,560
very small so they it is uneconomical

60
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,799
because they are feeding a lot but they

61
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:16,000
don't produce a lot of uh eggs then

62
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:18,280
portra VI uh that is also uh the eggs

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,840
which are the Potter which normally feed

64
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,920
on egg egg eaters and also the cannibas

65
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,280
are supposed to be C out then you have

66
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,239
the poor layer uh how do we know a poor

67
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,879
layer and a good layer how do we

68
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,200
differentiate a poor layer is the one

69
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:37,599
that allow only one egg in between the

70
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,159
pelvic bone well a good layer should

71
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,560
allow two to three fingers and that that

72
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,560
that is it then methods used to identify

73
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,680
good layer and poor layer as uh you can

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,280
see the first one is observation of

75
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,599
physical treat of the BL uh for example

76
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,159
the the peak those which have yob Bic

77
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,799
poor layers and therefore they supposed

78
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:02,280
to be eliminated then we have trap

79
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:06,319
nesting method and in trap nesting

80
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:10,680
method uh you can identify uh which bird

81
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:14,040
is a good and which B is but in uh trap

82
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:17,359
nesting method uh you put a nest where

83
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,720
the bird goes to R and upon laying it is

84
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,759
trapped there and therefore you mark it

85
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:26,120
then you remove it then next time

86
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:29,400
another B is is is U is trapped and

87
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,880
marked and uh after several uh occasions

88
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,240
you find that there are few Birds which

89
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,199
will remain unmarked meaning that those

90
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,280
birs which will not have any Mark

91
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:42,400
meaning that they are all poor layers or

92
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,960
they don't ex then characteristic of a

93
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,840
good layer we have coms and a large warm

94
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,360
wax and red number two eyes are bright

95
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:56,360
orange and the bird is very very alert

96
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,759
then number three uh vent is oval moist

97
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:03,479
red and active and number four

98
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:07,919
temperament they are alert and active

99
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:10,039
then bigs is pale and six space between

100
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,280
the kill and the pelvic

101
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:16,960
G pelvic bone or gido should allow two

102
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,319
to three fingers uh then broodiness is

103
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,639
rare for those good layers they rarely

104
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,840
come brooded then we have the space

105
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,319
between the pelvic gido you can see in

106
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,680
the diagram there for a good layer there

107
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,039
is a wider space and for

108
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:37,919
for n layer there is a smaller space and

109
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:42,120
also you can see the finger one finger

110
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:46,039
uh that is for a n layer n layer then we

111
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,840
have three fingers for a good layer then

112
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:51,479
the three fingers are supposed to fit

113
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,479
exactly in between that space then we go

114
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,160
to the images of coms and wats uh for a

115
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:01,160
good layer you can see these are good

116
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:04,400
layers uh then we have car of shuns uh

117
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,720
you can see this one uh the shuns are

118
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:13,479
red for a good layer and those that are

119
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:17,960
yellow is for a poor or n layer then n

120
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:21,960
BR and BR hand you can see uh Nan BR the

121
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:26,120
appearance of Nan BR and The Brood uh

122
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,080
you can see it in the second image and

123
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,800
you can see even in the third image we

124
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,280
have a brood head there and then uh

125
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,440
there is a continuation of good layers

126
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,639
you can see uh them the diagrams and we

127
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,919
have come come to the end of the today's

128
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,080
lesson and the following questions are

129
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:47,039
supposed to be answered by you number

130
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,840
one explain any two methods used to

131
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,160
identify a good layer and number two

132
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,840
discuss the routine management practices

133
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,000
in a port are four reference you can

134
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,840
refer from secondary agriculture

135
