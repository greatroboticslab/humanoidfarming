  "text": "Grapes are a popular fruit that holds great potential for us in North Dakota. Here to teach us the basics of growing grapes in our state is Dr. Harleen Hatterman Valente. Harleen was born in Nebraska and raised on a crop and animal farm. And then she came to North Dakota in 2000 as an assistant professor in the high value crops project. Harleen has conducted research on over 20 crops, but grapes have been one of the most predominant crops throughout her 25 years at North Dakota State University. Harleen, welcome to the forums. Okay, thank you Tom. Welcome. Okay, so we're gonna get started here. So the goal in this next 15 minutes is that going to see handouts or slides where suggest grapes that'll overwinter in North Dakota. Very important. Determine some of those cultural practices that'll help you grow those grapes. Also very important. Um, if they don't ripen, I suppose in jelly and juice, you could still add more sugar and make that work, but to have the best quality, you want to go and have ripe grapes. Thus, going to those first two is very important. And if you get all three of those, you'll probably get this fourth one. So site selection, a lot of us don't have a choice. I just bringing this up so that if you did have a choice, there's some things you want to avoid. Um, so if you are able to have that 1 and a half to 3% slope, you're going to that's going to help move that cold air down to the bottom. You don't want to be down in that bottom. You could see on the uh on that picture on the left hand side your vineyard if it's not in the bottom now you can be at 35 to 40 degrees there while someone who had something to lower is going to go and um get froze out. And I I've seen this happen more in Montana where actually I have some big differences in terrain and in which they actually did put grapes into a low area. It was a nice flat level low area, but they had this huge mountain that you know that cold air would just come down. um you can go and uh avoid that those kind of frosts about 3 weeks if you're on those hillsides instead of those valleys. So big important thing if you can get it on a south slope you're going to um be able to uh control more of your bud break. Now, it might be earlier, so sometimes the south slope can be can be bad, but you're going to get your maximum daily temperature. You're going to get a lot more foliage drying, which will avoid a lot of your diseases. You're going to get radiant heating, which is going to be very beneficial. Um, and your mid your winter temperatures are going to be minimal. um and your season length is going to be as long as possible by having that south uh slope. But sometimes that south facing slope because of our location we actually oh I'd say maybe about a month ago we're getting a lot of that sun has a lot of warming capabilities. So, um, what we see a lot of times is on that south facing part of a trunk, it it warms up, but then we, you know, when the sun goes away, it really drops down. That trunk has that darker color, so it warms up, but then we get back into the the real cold temperatures and we cause some splitting of the trunks. So um in those cases if we can do something to minimize that warming uh I think the long practice uh with apple trees where they and some other trees would be they go and paint um white on the on the south facing part of those trunks to avoid that heating up and then cooling down. Wind. Now we all know that North Dakota is windy. Um maybe not this windy, but um wind really can influence temperature. A calm condition, as you can see there, 18\u00b0 higher temperature on those leaves than if they're open to the wind blowing. And that also is really important for the fruit because heat, it controls the ripening. And thus we try to get as much light uh heat onto those uh grape clusters to go and hasten ripening, which is very important in North Dakota because of our short season and the fact that we want those um vines to start to acclimate for dormcy as quickly as possible. So you can use shelter belts, you can use south sides of buildings, fences, and like that to help go and reduce um that real strong wind. You want a light breeze. A light breeze isn't bad. Um but really strong winds aren't good. Um, as far as soil, really the only time you have to be concerned is if you have a a hybrid grape that has a lot of labusa in it. Um, so Concord, something that says it was I know they're seedless concords that when that soil gets above seven, they tend to show iron chlorosis. Um, an example that we've have seen is Bluebell, which you might have heard. That's a Elmer Swansson one. Uh, here's ES5471. Another Elmer Swenson one. Well, all three of them are, but this one never got released, but could be available. And then Louise Swenson. All of them have quite a bit of labus labusa in them. Uh thus they have larger berries kind of like concord grapes. Um and we have seen where you'll have u problems with some iron chlorosis. So if you because we do tend to have soils that are above uh a soil pH of seven. So in those cases you need to add some sulfur if you're trying to grow those crops and you start to see those iron chlorosis symptoms. fertility. Too much fertility is a problem because instead of going and those vines putting that into the fruit and into the production, it usually puts it into canes that go to ta um uh to I was going to say Carrington, probably not that far. Um but Castleton and you know just you got end up with 20 foot long canes which isn't needed and then starts to cause all kinds of problems. What I generally tell people about 50 pounds of nitrogen per acre um on a yearly basis. Now, in the in the Fargo area, we have clay and and higher organic matter. So, you need to count that in. So, 1% organic matter releases about 20 pounds of nitrogen per acre per year. So, if you don't go and um in those um soils that have higher organic matter, if you don't go and incorporate utilize that, you're going to be putting way too much on um and thus have that excess growth. I've also seen the opposite where you know after 10 years they haven't put on any um nitrogen and they have a lot of grass growing right up next to uh the vines competing for any kind of nutrients and out competing and thus they aren't they don't have enough growth. They got um canes that are only about um a foot and a half, two foot long, and that definitely isn't a a hybrid grape. So, um it's important to know what type of grape what you want to do with these grapes. If you're trying to make, like I said earlier, juice, uh, jam or jelly, uh, if they don't ripen completely, you can go and and easily add some sugar and and still be able to go and and make your juice, jam, and jelly. Uh, table grapes. the the problem with table grapes is we don't have a lot of cold hearty table grapes uh which are seedless. Now if you consider something like uh these three that have seeds in them as table grapes well then um but nobody wants uh grapes to eat that have seeds and that you have to spit seeds all the time. Uh, University of Minnesota is working on this. So are we on trying to introd um find and develop some really cold hearty um seedless table grapes. Wine wine's a little bit more difficult because um there's all kinds of characteristics that you need uh those grapes to be at when you harvest them so that you can make a proper wine. PH is important, titratable acidity is important, as well as the bricks or the sugar. Okay. Um, grapes for North Dakota. Uh, well, of course, we know that we need to have low temperature tolerance. We're in a 4A, as you can see here in the Fargo area. If we went out west to the Williston area, they're closer they're closer to a 3B. Um, and I think there's still that there's been some uh re redoing of uh actually the cold hardiness zones, but for the most part, most of North Dakota is a 4A. Um, there could be some parts that are more 3B. Um, you need to also consider uh your growing degree days. Uh, you can see here now it's supposed to get colder in Willist than it does in Fargo, but they have more heat during the summer or during that growing season than we do. Just a little bit. And but the Fargo area has a few more days that are frost free. So, we're talking from the last spring frost to the first spring freeze. And once that happens, those grapes don't ripen anymore. Um, so um you might have a cultivar that is marginally uh adapted to this area. So, you see some it dies back and that that's the worst part about it. it dies back or um you lose all uh it breaks bud really really early and you lose all of those on a consistent basis and then you don't get any fruit because the fruit comes on the previous year's buds. So if you don't have those buds survive, you won't get any fruit that year and thus you'll have one year without as you're starting all over. Okay, cultivars. And you can see here I put there's like I said there's a lot more wine grapes available than there are um those strictly for for juice and and um and that's be or table. And that's because really um for our season and for what's available so far, it it just that's a market that works for us. Uh two white grapes that we recently u introduced and released by NDSU are Dakota Primis. Uh which you're looking at that you're like, well, that isn't white at all. And it it's more of a gree as far as the color, but that skin color, even if you were to ferment on the skins, which you usually don't do with whites, you'll maybe get a little bit of more of a pinkish. and and actually the darkness that you'll get with this um cultivar has a lot to do with how hot the summer is. If we don't have a really great warm summer, um it might be a little bit more kind of closer to the prairie star a and then you'll see with uh and maybe just a little bit of uh light reening in in those uh berries. The other one is radiant and you can see it looks green and um but still is is a white wine and it may turn a little bit more yellow similar to uh Prairie Star as it ripens, but it's more of a it's um more of a a a green type grape for uh that is used for white wine. Uh you can see there's a whole list of things here. Um and the only one for table is what we call summer well it is called Somerset seedless. It's a release by Elmer Swenson. Um we call it somewhat seedless because there are seed remnants in there. Uh however um they're they're you know really no problem whatsoever. gives a little bit of that you can notice it. You never would notice it in a raisin if you dried these for raisins. Um and so and oh if you were to dry those for raisins, you would never buy a storebought raisin again because these have so much more flavor than anything you could ever get in the store. raisins from the store are just like little chewy sugar drops, you know, um versus you you really get some good grape flavor. This year we're going to start evaluating some of the seedless um I'd say advanced selections from the University of Minnesota. uh and you know they can't just like um they can't put down what the numbers are uh for uh purposes of patenting and like that. So they called it grape r which was the red one. And you can see how um how that shape is. And they feel like this is an improvement over Somerset seedless cluster. Looks a lot similar to Somerset Seedless. Uh grape B or blue. Uh again, it has this uh unique uh blueberry taste to it. And they've been looking at it uh in processing for frozen as well as baked. And um because it isn't real large, you know, maybe some mechanical harvesting because it is rather tough though um unlike some most of your other table grapes. You would never consider um a red globe to go and try to do any kind of mechanical harvesting with that. And then the last one is this uh G or green um grape. And you can see it almost to me it looks more like a lac crescent cluster. Um and uh it talks about having those aromatic and tropical flavors which is a lot like lacrescent. Um but this is a a seedless. So, uh, the only thing I do know about these is they they feel like they're good in zone five. Well, which is down by the cities. We aren't zone five. I'm going to try these on campus where we have a little bit more protected um microclimate. Uh but we'll we'll it'll be a wait and see and maybe there's something that we can do to try to hasten because they all um the harvest time is um well you can see for the grape G it's over 3 to four weeks but they're all towards the later part of the season not real early so it it will be diff um interesting to see what happens with these three and hopefully we can keep everyone a breast of what's going on, let alone um we're planting our first ones in the field this year for seedless um evaluation. Okay, so let's go and start talking about some um production. Oh boy. Um you most of the time you're going to go and get dormant rootstock. They're not going to ship that to until towards the end of May to be planted. Maybe they'll ship it sooner and then you have to keep it in a cooler or do something to keep that cool um unless you go and get those at a nursery that has potted up plants. Um because you only wanted one or two. Nice thing about grapes is almost everything that's going to be available to you are complete flowers. So you don't have to go and have something go and pollinate it. So they're not like apples. You don't need crosspollination. So if you just wanted one, you would you could actually just get one. Um, if you got green material, you want to probably wait until the end of or until June after that May 31st, which is usually the time for the last the latest risk of frost in North Dakota. Dimensions for planting, I think that all depends on the space that you have. Um, and again, if you're only having a couple of plants, then a lot of this doesn't make um isn't important for you. Weed Whoops, got ahead of myself. Weed control is kind of important um because anytime you have a lot of weeds growing around that basin um competing with that root system, um that's not good. Likewise, if you're going to put a mulch down right away, don't use something like straw. We've done a study where we've gotten um one-year-old dormant cutings. We put them in the ground and we use straw as a mulch and the microbes are going to go and be using all the nitrogen that's in that soil to go and break down that straw because it has a very high carbon to nitro or high carbon amount in comparison to nitrogen. So those microbes are going to need nitrogen and the only place they're going to find it is in the soil. So those vines will really struggle if you use something like um straw that first year. Now later on, you know, when you got nice established vines, I I suppose straw would be just fine because um they're just have a good root system and you're going to be applying some of that nitrogen on an annual basis anyway. Uh you want to start then your trellis construction afterwards. And uh but really that first year all you're trying to do is get those vines established. A lot of people will say, \"Oh, do I go and put well let me go and do I go and put road tubes around them?\" Yes. If you have problems with anything like rabbits, um deer, then this is going to be helpful. What we found is that a grow tube isn't necessarily needed. Um, as long as you're you're um acclimating if you're using plants, they're acclimated before you put them out there and thus aren't going to go and be thrown into a different kind of environment. for as long as you don't have a lot of those little critters that want to go and destroy everything for you. So, the first year we're really working on the root growth. I wouldn't do any pruning. I wouldn't try I just try to keep them growing as much as possible because that they're uh whatever you get for the root starting there, it's going to be the basis. That's going to be like your foundation for your house. you have a poor foundation, the rest of the house isn't going to stand up very well. Second year's going to start working on your vine architecture, doing some pruning, and you might leave a few clusters to taste, but really most of those clusters you should remove because you're still working on that foundation. Finally, your third year, you can go and keep your fruit. I'm going to go over that because I could see how much lack of time I have. Um, and again, those kind of m trellis materials all depend on how many vines you're going to get and and um and your location, but you're going to need something. Uh, even though I say they have a trunk, they don't have a really good they need support. So, you need to find some way of supporting these so that they're upright. And stuff to consider are, you know, your physical limitations on on how you're going to grow them. Can you go and put them on a high wire that generally is six foot tall? Well, do you want to always have your hands up in the air when you're working on those? Do you want them maybe a little bit lower? you want to maybe go with a midwire and train everything to grow upwards and thus have that fruit um at that midwire which is about three foot. All of those things are important. Okay, pruning. It's important that you go and have balanced pruning because um you need to control your crop. Um, most of the time you'll remove 80%. You can see it almost looks like maybe 90% of what was there. Um, because if you don't, you're going to overcrop it. And especially in in North Dakota, that's really important that you don't overcrop. Um, um, yeah. bud fruitfulness. Also, another thing on um so having all that growth and like that if you didn't go and take any of these uh canes off from the previous year, that means you're going to have lots and lots of layers of leaves. And the more shading onto those clusters, the less fruitful those buds will be um at on those clusters, the slower they'll ripen. But also those nodes and buds for next year, they'll get less light too. So they're going to be less fruitful. So sunlight exposure is really, really important. Here shows differences for different locations. Generally, we use this 30 + 10 for any kind of grapes we grow, especially the wine grapes in in North Dakota. And that plus 10 means if you get more than uh two pounds of pruning from that wood, oh, one pound pruning. What am I I getting off? So, um No. So, if you if you're pruning and from a vine you get more than two pounds of pruning, you can add 10 more buds and have a total of 40 for this. But we're using this lowest one right here um for almost all of ours. Now, if you've got more than 2 lb and you're way up here at at 4 lb um and you can see um where we have, you know, the um number of fruit like that, you are this means you're undercropping and you're you're not leaving enough fruit. But if you're way up here, um then you're overcropping. I always try if I have two pounds per vine and we take out just a little fish scale. After a little bit, you you don't even need that scale. You kind of know what's what. Um but 30 + 10 is lot what we use. And I'm not going to go over all this because I can see I'm already at that time. Um some characteristics. Shoot density. So per foot of shoot or canopy. um you want three to five shoots to be coming out. So that means um three to five nodes per foot more on that you know hopefully on that usually in a foot you can get three nodes. If you get more than that um it it means that that vine might be under stress that it has shorter nodes. Well I'm going to go over that um chute thinning. Okay. So, this is done to open the canopy, but it all depends on what kind of trellis. If you have your um trunk going up and then you put out cordons or arms and thus have uh just removing most of that cane wood leaving two shoots at each of these what is called spurs. What happens on that is then as those vines grow, they get longer, you comb them down, and then when they're about to touch the ground, you want to go and prune that off. Um, they talk about a lot of times shootute thinning before those canes get 18 in long. That's because you don't need um that much. You need 15 to 20 leaves to to go and ripen those two to three clusters that's on a chute. All that extra is is just extra stuff that might help might go and actually go and cover up and shade a lot of that. The problem is minute you start doing some pruning you get what is called lateral shoots. These have no kind of fruit on them and they start to shade things out. So shootute thinning a lot of times is very helpful on on going and keeping enough light onto these and removing those lateral shoots. It comes to a lot of work. Some people will even actually remove leaves that are around the clusters to help expose those grapes to um that uh uh the sunlight to those clusters. Crop thinning. Well, um oh, but if you're going to go and remove those leaves, you don't wait until you know the clusters are really huge. you need to start before you get to verasion because otherwise um and maybe you only do it on the west side or or on the um east side. The west side is going to be warmer than the east side. So you remove them on the east side to help get those um leaves or the clusters a little bit warmer and you don't have to worry as much about suncalding or sunburning those clusters. um crop thinning. If you're going to do something like that, you you would do that, you uh would wait until about four weeks after fruit set. Fruit set occurs in um early June. So, um so by early July, you would know whether or not you have way too many clusters to go and get them ripen in time. And then then you can start to go and oh, I got three clusters on this cane. I don't need all three. I'm going to just remove one and keep two. A lot of times one to two clusters per cane is good. So, and of course you always want to if sometimes there's a stress and they might throw out some more late clusters or do some flowering and then you have um some late clusters, always remove those because they're just going to go and cause problems. Okay, last little bit Fred. Okay, herbicide injury by 24D is going to be can be really common. Grapes are really susceptible to 24D, even more so than dicama. So, you see this fanning and if they're in your backyard, there's a lot of people using 24D on their lawns. Thus, you might see something like this happening. Um birds, especially for homeowners, you might need to do some netting because uh birds really like grapes. They like a lot of fruit. So, and when you only have one to two, that really puts a target on those. So, dear raccoon rabbits, I'm going to questions. I did poor Tom. Sorry, I warned you. You're You're just too knowledgeable. Got too much information to share. Well, I got too many stories, I think. I know. It's because of all your years of working with this prop. Now, listen. So, we got rapid fire questions. Really quick answers. We're going to be done in five minutes. Okay, Arlene. First of all, would any grape varieties work well in a high tunnel? The problem with that all of these if they're hardy enough for outside they're they're good for a high tunnel. The thing that you can't do is you can't think because I have a high tunnel um which is going to give you more heat that you're going to go and be able to have something less hardy cold hearty because in the winter um especially at night you don't have that the plastic doesn't retain that heat. So your outside temperature is going to be the same as what's going to be in that high tunnel. Uh, thus okay, that's good. Pick a hardy variety. They'll all work. They have to be hearty. This person is, is a grape seedless due to genetics or is it seed or can I make a grape variety seedless by eliminating manganesees away from the plant? No genetics. It's genetics. Now, what was that variety you liked for raisins? Oh, Somerset seedless. Yeah, you want a seedless variety. And that's really the only hardy reliable hearty variety we got. Now this person lived in Dickinson and they grew Fontineac Gree Prairie Star and Lac Crescent. But now they moved to West Fargo. Which one of those would that would you recommend? Oh, actually all three of them would be even better. we get more rainfall and um and so um depends if they w you know L crescent is more fruity but if you if we ever get a really bad winter then L crescent has it really likes to throw out volcanes and uh uh it can be difficult but all three of them um front or front gree will will make more of a a straw colored wine But they could do all three of them would be fine. West Fargo, this person has an old neglected grape vine. Should they cut it to the ground or just dig it out? Uh, you can rejuvenate old grapes, grape vines. Um, but you're going to again, um, what happens with old vines is that if you haven't done anything, it's only that one year old wood that's going to have fruit. So you're going to have to do some major cutting back um and then keep pruning. So I would u cut it back to uh generally we like to have two arms and do cordons. Uh you might have uh you know do a little bit more cutting back. Also, you could also work at a lot of times they'll set up a um a sucker will come up from the base, make that your new trunk, and then you can go and lop off everything else or two trunks. How about uh when's the best time to prune a grape vine? Before it starts to um open the buds. Those buds become really easy just to knock off. So, um, now we just had a pruning clinic, uh, by, um, air, um, yesterday and they were still dormant and so this is a good time. Other people go out when it's colder and they have their gloves on, but boy, this kind of weather is just perfect. If you can go and get it done quickly, do it now. Are all grape leaves edible for Greek recipes? Yeah, but I would probably avoid the ones that have all the white tomatoss on the backside. I don't think those would be as tasty as something that um isn't as pubescent on the underside. Okay. How about what variety is best for up north in the Turtle Mountains? Oh, well, what are they trying to do with it? Well, ju I would guess juice. Okay. um our only choice. Our overall our our heartiest grapes that we've ever tested are valiant and king of the north. Um it's good. Is spotted winged a concern with grapes? Not unless you have problems where with rainfall in the fall that you start to get little fissures or little openings by where they attach to the stem that then um valiant has been the only grape that we've seen anyone report um spotted Wayne Drosophila. And again, um, we feel like it was because of some rainfall which then put a crack and then the spotted winged or soft said, \"Hey, thank you.\" and laid some eggs. Start my own grape vine from a wild grape and just take a cutting and stick it in a pot and get started. Yeah, you can. Okay, that's good. What's the best mulch you would use in an established vine? Shredded bark. Uh shredded bark would be good. Yep. Um because the and the larger the chunks, the the slower the degradation would occur. How about Marshall Foch? Are those Marshall Foch? Are those seedless? No, that is a French American wine grape. Yeah, that's not a party here, is it? Or it's marginal. Uh kind of iffy. Yeah, not looking the best out in our variety trial. Okay, well that's going to do it for for this presentation. Thank you. Was loaded with information. I couldn't get to all the questions, but you can contact Harleen and or you can contact your local county agent. They can help you and also myself. We'll be happy to help you. Okay. Thank you, Harleen, so much.",
