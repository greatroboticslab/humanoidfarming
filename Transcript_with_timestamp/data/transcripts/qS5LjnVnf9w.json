  "text": "well good morning everyone welcome to the grain storage webinar on hygiene and structural cleaners my name's Chris Warwick I'm a consultant based in Horsham Victoria and I manage the Jerry Caesar own storage extension project now my role in this project has developed over the past 10 years and since the very save loss of Peter brought up last year and their service the GAC is southern region we've grown storing workshops and information such as this as I mentioned the quick housekeeping the Q&A window allows you guys to ask questions already just click on the Q&A to open a window type your question in the box and then click send if you'd like to send an anonymous question you can select send anonymously if you don't want to be identified and please feel free to ask questions as we go you might have already come with a few questions so feel free to put those in straightaway or as you think of them the way that adds them as we go or at the end by all means top those questions I'd like to think the base AJ for facilitating this session for us today appreciate their support and providing these workshops for us if you have any trouble hearing me or can't see the PowerPoint presentation please let me know and by that question box well let's get into it on-farm storage hygiene and structural treatments you know just as an overview to help us figure out where hydrogen and structural treatments fits into the bigger picture of manging on-farm storage it's really the first step so if we look at in the whole system we're really about trying to prevent pests prevent the infestation of pests prevent the damage but they're great if we don't get that right and we still have to do a pest control then we're looking at phosphine or on-farm pest control or a commercial fumigated and then lastly we also want to consider grain quality so imagine moisture temperature but in the pest prevention side of things hygiene is structural treatments along with aeration cooling protectants and monitoring there about pest prevention so that's what we're going to talk about today best prevention trying to start clean and start with a good fresh storage with no pest contamination to the research to kick things off with this is some research done by the post-harvest research team up in Queensland through the department okay this is to give you a bit of an idea of how quickly growing straight pest can breed up so we've got months along the bottom so you can see my mouse so you can see after three months this is in a one-ton bulk bag after three months that boggle they've just left in the shed we've reached nearly 5,000 beetles after six months the numbers really spiked up - so you can see that those few maybe half bag for all bits are growing that's long around throughout the year often left there for longer than six months we get it you know really good understanding of how quickly they become a breeding ground so that's part of Hygiene is to use to be able to - the other Queen those bits of growing up as well not just in in the solos themselves but around the sheds and very decline around the place something else that some who have recently found again for a bit more research some aside note actually to some research was someone asked the question will for every adult insect because that's what we're seeing that's what we're monitoring you is the adult stage of the life cycle how many adolescent insects if you like how many egg larvae pupae can we actually expect for every one adult and the research found that for every adult you can find in Grain expect eighty to ninety egg larvae pupae so it's easy to see how numbers build up quite quickly so that's what look at prevention is better than cure up we really don't want to get to the point where we find insects because as we've just seen they'll breed up really quickly and I came to me and to what the research shows is really about preventing an unwelcome environment for pests and what we know is that they like primarily they really like shelter they like to be sheltered from the extreme conditions of the enemy so they don't like getting really cold or that like you really hot so somewhere they can shelter from the heat and from the cool and then secondly they need a bit of food so anywhere that you can think of solos are the obvious spot nice and sheltered a little bit of food left in there other things around the brand the farms like your seed silos or the choc feed or machinery that's in the shed that might have a little bit of grain residue left in it all those places that are really good harvest for insects even consider hoppers and things left around the silos that might be overturned so they don't fill up with water but actually create a nice little shelter and if there's a bit of grain left on the ground that they're covering up then there's shelter and food all the sudden so consider those places as insects happens as well even hay and grass around the side that can provide a bit of shelter see the team that sort of stuff lying around silos can provide a finish every one but that's the hygiene a lot of things the second one we've done hi Jen we've won a look at structural treatments so that's about killing any insects that may be left after we've done the cleanup let's of the fire Jane first so as I said hygiene is not just limited in in the solos but if we look at the picture on the top left here we've got a bit of grain left you know in a hopper underneath Asolo really quite a nice training ground there for insects to to start bringing away and quickly infested me into silos the bottom left there we've got in the back of the truck and remember equipment anything you clean up make sure all the trucks chaser bins other bins trailers and all those sorts of things that the grain go through I really cleaned up well we're looking at silos even consider the design of the silo and they've had that the solar sits on the scene silos on a concrete ring rather than a concrete pad it really it makes them a bit hard to clean if we use a nice smooth concrete pad it that really does make hide them a lot easier to sweep that growing up when we're looking at spill crane around silos people often get it quite panicky about spilled grain around silos to be honest grain that's the spill thinly across the ground sort of one grain thin doesn't provide enough shelter for insects to live that well grain piled up if you've left a pile of grain this other side that provide enough shelter for insects to live so just consider that when you're doing your claim again headers are really common spot on insects in the top right and picture there we've got some trench aeration in a big flat one silo something that we often see is particularly input of silos now come in with the full floor aeration systems false wall perforated floor aeration the issue with those sorts of setups we find is that they're they're impossible to clean under so after a few years will be a bit of dust residue be the grain residue fall through that floor and again create a perfect Arbor for insects to breed under that floor come along and put hub fresh harvest grain in and in as soon as you put it in the insects are investing so that trench aeration for aeration cooling trench aeration is is quite adequate and in the real advantage is that it's easy to lift up and clean out so again when you're looking at new silos whether it be flat bottom or cone bottom look how easy they are to clean any spots that grain can get stuck with we're looking at types of cleaning obviously the broom and compressed air and water for the comb bottom silos is a good idea to dispose of that waste grain so not leaving it in a bucket or really been beside the the silos or in a pile we actually want to get rid of that grain so come on various benefits and the livestock many peopre live at some here even spread it out thinly across the ground south of germany machinery similar research just to try and highlight it goes up in Queensland again did some research for us and and asked how was contractor who considered that he'd clean he's had a fairly well at the end of the season they said can we catch the first 40 litres of grain that goes through the header at the start of the next season we said wait so they went along with the bucket and collected the first 40 litres of grain that went through the header and actually stopped counting when they found a thousand less of grain bore in that first 40 ratings so that's a head that was thought to be reasonably clean but they hadn't used dry side you know haven't used a diatomaceous earth product so again encourage you what you think might be clean is still an insect harbor if we don't use a structural treatment or look what Tommy you shall be clean up again we look to research to tell us these answers we rely very heavily on research finds and what it finds is that insects will breed and travel when when the temperatures warm up so you can see in june/july there where the temperature is cold insect reproduction is slowed right down insects don't tend to move around as much so that's the best time to do our grains drug hygiene so even this time we were in August now before the temperatures really start to warm up in the spring good time to do our hygiene clean them up get rid of them before I start breathing and moving around the Flies so that's how a gene structural treatments where we're trying to do is structural treatments the main one that we would suggest people look at is a diatomaceous earth so that's a naturally occurring product at the mine product not chemical based it's actually if you put it under a microscope it's actually it's very abrasive shaped and it actually scratches the waxy cuticle on the insect and they end up dehydrating so it's a physical mode of action so the insects can't develop resistance to it that's why we like the product and therefore is effective on all the main grain storage pests so that's what we're trying to do is clean the storage app create an unwelcome environment and then we're really trying to kill any insects that may be left there often get asked about other products people think look similar like lime again the testing that's being done shows that lime was really not effective we did we need a diagnosis earth product something like a dry side we're looking at how much we actually need it's really not much take example of a hundred and twelve tons silo we only need about 420 grams I'm not talking about feed volumes here for something like a harvester we might need a couple of kilos through the harvester in the front not not large volumes we're not performing a heap of the people just happening just enough to really light dusty shall we do it I'll reply de diatomaceous earth for solids comb bottom solos a little blowback gun you can see here so we opened the top lid of the solo open the bottom lid we measure out now our quantity of diatomaceous earth in the bucket or something similar and then using the air compressor and the venturi gun the blowback gun we blow it up through the solo and you'll quickly hear the clatter - see you like in the right hand picture once you've measured quantity in step back have a look and the dust and start floating at the top of the solo when you see that start to happen shut they'll be closed the bottom manhole other people I've seen and heard used leaf blowers and most sorts of things and to get the dry side or diatomaceous earth dust in the silo anything like that would be effective while we're trying to do within an even coating around the solid walls the roof even in face it can be applied as a slurry which is particularly good for sheds concrete up the walls and ceilings in the shed next work it is pretty hard on pumps so be aware of that if you want more information I'm Adam I'm certain definitely hopefully they do consider personal protective equipment I'd asked mask and some gloves and certain goals as I say bracing so it's a nasty in the eyes make sure we do there goes the other warning on put out there as I said it's not chemical based they product to use I would hate for people to run into trouble though store impulses or oil seeds if they happen to get a bit of this diatomaceous earth settling in the cone of the silo and then you've got a bit of discoloring on possible seed I hate that two different great to buy the grain so my suggestion there is to to you to do the hygiene do the structural treatment do automations birth and then just before harvest if you cannot store part of the royal scenes just give that's all I couldn't sell just to make sure there's no no no quantities of do that it compiled somewhere that that might be in your sample few key points on on diatomaceous earth takes about five to 10 days to ticular insects but to thank you for the in the six to twelve month range so again that's why we suggest can be applied in the abstinence yes as near as 10 days before harvest but really the better is that he's became message there can we apply there's a dust or a slurry it's most effective in the dry environment so under 65 don't know what it means so think about inside your solos is relatively dry inside your equipment machine the shedding begin is relatively dry it's not chemical based no pest resistance which is a really good thing main structural treatment as I just said I crack them into green silos just before storing all sated parcels for that added extra security to make sure we don't get downgraded on those those high value commodities and again make sure we wear gloves dust masks in and actually gold so I need to add to that just a warning it is registered product it can be added to grind it 7-eleven actually edit to grind that used to be thing these days we see more and more grain buyers actually prefer that it's not used in that way it really does change the flow of the grain we're talking about cereals only here of course so we actually don't recommend it the other two remain there's other suggestions I hear people say what if you add a little bit to the first bit of grain that goes in the silo and add a bit to the last bit of grain that goes in the solid form bit of a cap or a barrier in theory yes good theory happens in practices we can expect will be some insects in that grain box somewhere and if we've got a barrier on the top and the bottom we're not only trying to stop Intex from coming into that grain but all stops also stopping is a giving me out so we might go and have a look at the grain in storage at any point and say long walks clean or counseling so a teeny insects even seem a bit of grain from the top but what could be happening is insect bringing down in the middle of that grain stack they're just not coming to the surface because of the DA so actually wouldn't recommend that of the practice or the risk that they could be insect activity in the middle of the grain stack in the middle of a silo and we can't see it at the top of the bottom because of the DEA effect key points to run through again clean up during the cooler months so this time of year is well worth doing actually including machinery in the cleanup dispose of that waste ground and then follow up with an application of structural treatment to the Plains Georgia so that's that's why doing those structural treatments it's really quite quick and simple if there's nothing too complex to it which I really like anything that's simple and also cost-effective I think is a good thing so it doesn't have to be complicated common sense but really does make a big difference starting with our grain storage Queen gives us our best chance for a group as well so I'll ask a minute in a minute for you guys to certainly use that question and answer window type your questions in now and I'm sure there'll be some questions if you've got to come with or a bit amorous part what are you doing that I'll just reiterate if the people would like more information stored grain comm that are you the website you can go to you can contact us we're going strong extension team on info at store grain con blame you or you can call the hotline at any stage 1-800 level and that will put you in contact with your closest grain storage specialist well you're typing the questions another amount of that the next webinar will be on the 10th of September same time 10:00 a.m. and we're going to have a look at upgrades to existing storage that one also keep an eye out for an email that will be sent to you shortly we just put a a second survey in there to get some feedback on this webinar and check if you guys have been very aware of them and what we can do to improve them so we've got any questions any question that would like to ask happy to take those now if you want to type them in the question and it's a window just while you're thinking of your questions there one of the ones I often get asked at workshops is can we use a product like diatomaceous earth around the silos so around the base of the silo what we can as we said in the previous couple slides there it works best in here is the dry under 65% meaning so for those areas around the silos we were actually bit off to use a spray on product something like a for nitrile thorn as a structural treatment is good for the grass and gravel or concrete areas around the silos we can actually use very sort of products as a structural treatment purpose in K the diatomaceous earth the inside the store these needs are dimension can say any questions coming here I think those questions you guys if we ask them by all means if you if you do think of something later please refer that call that hotline 1-800 weeble and that will come straight through your huge grain storage specialist certainly consult with store grain calmly new website there is a fact sheet on there on hygiene and structural treatments which includes most of the content that we've just been through there's no further questions thank you again for joining us and thank you to the BCG for hosting we look forward to catching up with you again on the 10th of September for a webinar on upgrading existing storage thanks again",
