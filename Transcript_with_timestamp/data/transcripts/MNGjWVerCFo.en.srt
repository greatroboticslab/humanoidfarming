1
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:23,760
this is sweet potatoes that we had just

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,800
planted okay um we planted some of them

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,480
a week ago and then the ones that are

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,519
being irrigated now we planted yesterday

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,559
okay and it's very important if you

6
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,600
don't get rain after you're planting to

7
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:39,040
to if you don't have irrigation it's it

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,719
makes it real difficult for the for the

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,719
plants to get get established after you

10
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,640
PLS so this is a pump

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,880
see how far you got a dig Bill before

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,880
you get any moisture not even hitting it

13
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,479
yet so that rain is really critical

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,439
right now very critical

15
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,200
so some people go to Las Vegas to gamble

16
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,360
and you choose to farm I guess huh

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,680
that's exactly

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,000
right well so here's the potatoes that

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,000
we get at the farmers

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
market nice

21
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,320
tell me a little bit about then what

22
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,159
you've done what you've done here since

23
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,560
the last time I was out here um actually

24
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,600
all we've had to do is cultivate them

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,079
several times okay and um that's to get

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,159
the weeds out and along with getting the

27
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,920
weeds out it pulls the runners from the

28
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,920
sweet potatoes so they don't set down

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,719
okay and it gives you a better set under

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,800
the hill okay so there's two benefits to

31
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,000
cultivating getting the weeds out along

32
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,000
with pulling the runners back in so they

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,680
don't if you get a lot of Runners it's

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,640
set down then it takes size away from

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,959
the sweet

36
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,000
potatoes so this is called a potato

37
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,480
Harvester that's a potato Harvester and

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,840
how does it work um it just it runs on

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,640
hydraulic rather than rather than PTO

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,160
it's got a hydraulic pump and does it

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,239
have does it go down dig or yeah you

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,080
just set it whatever depth you want okay

43
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,920
and with sweet potatoes as you see once

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,760
we get digging we have to go rather deep

45
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,200
with it okay all right so they don't get

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,200
skimmed up

47
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,440

48
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,320
