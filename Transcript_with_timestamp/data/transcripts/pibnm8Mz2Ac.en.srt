00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,840
hello my name is ire Manuel the lead

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,540
maker for the gravity fed model and gas

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,980
and kit prototype in this project we are

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,900
collaborating with students from

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,520
background Secondary School

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,039
who are the members of the school

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,100
science and Innovation Club

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,900
our project is at a completion stage

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,900
we are now documenting it

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,800
for us critical making is about making

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,000
things that are aimed at solving

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,039
challenges of the community

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,280
our intended beneficiaries are the

14
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,840
vulnerable refugees to support them with

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,280
this gravity fed model

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,619
irrigation kits so that they can be able

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,920
to grow

18
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:13,340
basic food crops in times of reliable

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,280
rainfall and also during

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:20,759
dry seasons this will help them to

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,640
improve on their nutrition the overall

22
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,600
well-being so in a sense that our making

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:31,259
is a small contribution towards the

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,780
sustainable development goals of UN

25
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:39,200
yeah so we would love to produce as many

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,200
of these kits as possible thank you
