  "text": "what's going on my dudes welcome to the channel I'm Cody Banks and today my news I'm going to be teaching you how to make a very simple and efficient crop farm so let's get started on today's video to get started on this Farm we're gonna require the following materials eight water buckets three stacks of blocks of your choice two stacks of dirt one stack of glass of your choice two Hoppers a handful of redstone one redstone repeater one button eight dispensers two chests and then any crop of your choice you could do seeds for wheat carrots potatoes or beetroot on the side here are two water buckets you're gonna need just two pails of water to make an infant water pool to lay down some water to keep your crops hydrated so let's get started and build this Farm to get started we're gonna go ahead and build a double chest right here and behind it we're gonna go ahead and Crouch and place our Hopper on the first chest to verify your Hopper is connected correctly you will see a tube coming off of the hopper in whatever Direction the chest is if your Hopper is placing the wrong way it will not go into the chest and your items will not be collected properly next day we're gonna go eight blocks backwards from this chest we got one two three four five six seven eight just like that then we're gonna put one block here and one block here we can hop up on top on top of the chest Crouch Place piece of glass and let's go seven back two three four five six seven make that eight so that way there's two blocks right here next thing we're gonna go ahead and grab your block of choice and beside the hopper one two three four five six seven eight just like that and nine so it should look like this so far alright so we're ready to put our field in our first field we're gonna start back here Place one piece of dirt Place another piece of dirt and we're gonna go eight across so we're gonna go all the way to the glass just to make it easy and we're gonna go eight back so we got two three four five six seven and eight then we're just gonna go ahead and meet ends and then we'll fill in the center all right there we have it we have an eight by eight field our next field we are gonna do one up here and we're gonna do an eight by seven so we're gonna go eight across here just like that then we're gonna go seven back so we got two three four five six seven just like that and then we're gonna meet ends just like this and fill it in there we have it so first field again is an eight by eight second field is an eight across by seven back now we're gonna take our block of choice and we're gonna make a trough for the water this is basically a little path here using our blocks so we're gonna make these paths around the whole farm that way the water can sit beside the actual dirt that way it keeps the field hydrate now this back one here we're gonna go up like that and then we're just gonna fill in the back side here and then we'll start from the front again make our little water area here going up like that and then back here just like that so it should look like this pretty simple so far next thing we're going to go ahead and make a wall that our water is gonna stay in because we don't want the water splashing about so we're gonna just gonna make that wall kitty corner that block there that way our Hopper is protected and the water doesn't get all over the place then we're going to do the same thing for this side go ahead and make a wall that way again the water stays inside of the trough here it's got its own little pathway and then put a block there again all right pretty simple so far this is the top view just in case you need help the dirt matches up with the walls here dirt matches up with the walls here all right so we're gonna grab our water buckets we're gonna make a two by two hole in the ground put a water bug here water bug here and then we're gonna go and start so we're gonna put a water bucket here it's gonna flow we're gonna put another water bucket down there it's gonna flow to the end another water bucket here and another water bucket right here that way water is all in these spots make sure there's water in these spots all right so we're good to cover this up now so what we're gonna do is just go ahead and just cover this up and do a two high wall that way our crops don't actually fly out of the farm again do that to this side cover up the water and then just do a too high wall and just do that to the other side as well a too high wall all the way down the farm here that way the water is covered up and our crops don't go over the over the actual wall and then at the end here add those walls there [Music] just like that so that way your whole Farm is encased next we're gonna go ahead and grab our dispensers and we're gonna go one two three four five six seven eight and then I want you to put water buckets in every single one of these dispensers all right once your water buckets are in the dispensers we're just gonna go ahead and grab our block of choice and put it over top of the dispensers and we're actually gonna put a block behind the dispensers just like this and then break that one at the end and then we're going to meet these blocks up here like that and then we're gonna grab our Redstone out and then we're gonna make a redstone path with a button okay go ahead and grab your Redstone and put it on all these blocks back here that way you're going to be able to power up these dispensers and the water will flow out and auto crop for you all the way till the end here now at the end you want to decide where you want to place your buttons so I'm going to drop this block out put a block down here put a piece of redstone there and then put the button here now when you click this button you'll see the Redstone path travels but it doesn't make it all the way to the dispenser so we actually have to place a repeater down now I'm gonna go two blocks right here so basically two blocks after the jump and we're gonna try it we're gonna test it make sure the water flows all the way okay all of our buckets are dispensing so that repeater position is correct if your buckets aren't dispensing then you know you'll obviously have to adjust the repeater accordingly so you either put it this way or that way um well you'd put it this way you'd put it to the left one more but it should work fine long as you've used the same blueprint as this one all right now we can go ahead and just put some glass walls here just to make it look a little prettier and our last water bucket is going to be in this corner right there now I said you can use two Hoppers it's totally up to you guys but if you use two Hoppers you can break that block there Crouch and place another Hopper there that way it's connected to this chest all right so we're going to turn the farm off and as you can see the the crops are going to go back to normal now what we're gonna do is we are going to quickly grab our hoe and we're gonna till the land and plant some seeds all right dude so as you can see all the wheat or you know carrots potatoes beetroot is grown in and all you're gonna do is go and click this button and watch the magic happen as you can see all the crops are getting harvested automatically and they are now being placed down into The Hoppers collected and here we go ready to check this out we look in this chest real quick and boom it's all getting collected up slowly but surely making its way down into that chest once you click the button again we can go and replant the field and then you can do it all over again once it grows in all right my dudes if you guys enjoyed this video don't forget to like comment and subscribe I really appreciate the sport and if you guys want me to make another Farm don't forget to comment down below what farm you want to see next have yourself an amazing day my dance peace out [Music] foreign [Music]",
