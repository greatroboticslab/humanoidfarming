00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,000
agriculture-based economy has seen

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,160
worsening impacts of climate change

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,080
including intense rainfall high

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,399
16 million dollars

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,440
the livelihoods of farmers are

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,440
especially affected

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,360
because

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,879
the asian development bank with support

15
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,440
from the pilot program for climate

16
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,039
resilience of climate investment funds

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,120
assisted the royal government of

18
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,800
cambodia to prepare the strategic

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,960
programme for climate resilience

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,040
consisting of seven investment projects

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,040
and one technical assistance project to

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,520
provide overarching support for the

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,360
seven investment projects two investment

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,840
projects relate to the agricultural

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,680
sector including the climate resilience

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,840
rice commercialization sector

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,159
development project this project is

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,159
helping farmers increase rice production

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,280
in three largest rice producing

provinces battambang kampong tom and

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,320
pre-venge by rehabilitating and

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,560
climate-proofing irrigation systems and

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,400
other rural infrastructure

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,159
specific engineering measures were

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,479
integrated into the design of

36
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,960
infrastructure to cope with more rapid

37
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,960

[Music]

39
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,879
the project also demonstrates the

40
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,360
benefits from laser land leveling to

41
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,560
conserve water and improve irrigation

42
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,560
water use efficiency

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,120
to assist farmers in reducing the

44
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,760
climate risks associated with rice

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,080
production the project is pilot testing

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,800
a weather indexed crop insurance scheme

47
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,640
in selected areas

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,360
the project is also improving the

49
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,599
availability and quality of rice seed by

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,159
developing a certification system that

51
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,560
will result in a more resilient crop

52
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,879
the project also helps create more jobs

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,519
for women all in all the project

54
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,000
contributes to economic social and

55
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,640
environmental sustainability of rice

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,640
