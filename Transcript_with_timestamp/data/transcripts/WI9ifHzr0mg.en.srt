1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
don't go buy milk and bread that you

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,510
don't need because milk sandwiches are

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:14,559
not going to get you through the store

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:16,560
[Music]

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,000
what do you think titus what do you

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,359
think this precipitation is going to

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,960
bring us huh

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,600
what do you think it's going to be rain

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,760
let us know he says i don't know

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,599
i don't know i'm just going to stay in

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,080
my shelter the whole time

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,440
or maybe i'll just lay in it because i'm

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,520
a dog that likes it cold

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,000
all right so we are dealing with some

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,840
serious winter weather that is coming

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,160
our way in georgia

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,200
georgia is not the kind of state that's

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,440
prepared

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559
for snow and ice accumulation on the

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,120
roads

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,039
we don't have the infrastructure for it

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,559
because it's such a rare thing that

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,559
happens here

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,840
that we don't have

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,520
the big salt trucks and snow plows that

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,160
some of the northern states have so

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
there's a lot more risk involved with us

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,760
getting an ice storm

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,240
than in other states and areas of the

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,080
country winter storm izzy

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,400
2022

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,040
is headed our way this weekend

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,360
it should be here tonight and in all day

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,680
tomorrow we're expecting

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,439
rain ice snow

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,040
really all the models are showing

37
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,520
something different and nobody really

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,320
knows what to expect but there is a very

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,560
high probability of the ice being the

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,200
most common thing that we experience

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,600
and that can be really bad news for the

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,280
homestead and the state of georgia so we

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,520
have to get prepared to make sure that

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,330
our homestead and family and property

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,390
are all safe from the coming storm

46
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,390
[Applause]

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,759
i don't know if you can see but peaches

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,920
bill bowser and

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,159
peter pepper are all snuggled together

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,680
in the buck shelter

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,119
some things that we want to take into

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,119
consideration

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,520
with the animals is to make sure that

54
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:12,239
they have proper food water and shelter

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,000
so for the water what we do is we fill

56
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,080
up every trough

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,239
that we have on the property we also

58
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,200
fill up every five gallon bucket we can

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,280
find with water that way if there is a

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,920
power loss which is very likely in these

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,440
ice storms we will still have water to

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,000
give the animals

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,640
and we also need to prep for water for

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,640
ourselves

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:41,120
miss piggy and her three gilts are nice

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,480
and warm inside their shelter

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,280
we've got a solid roof

68
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,160
somewhat partially solid walls and lots

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,239
of nice bedding we will be adding an

70
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,080
extra layer of straw

71
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,519
for tonight's

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,200
weather as well

73
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,480
for their food we always give lots of

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,239
extra hay

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,480
for them to eat when it's going to be

76
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,920
cold or bad weather in general where

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,000
they're going to want to stay in their

78
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,200
shelters for the majority of the day and

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,200
not be out browsing we need extra hay we

80
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,040
also usually give extra grain in the

81
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,800
evenings to help them stay warm through

82
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,720
the night and that goes for all the

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,360
animals cows

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,599
goats pigs poultry

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,440
they all need just a little extra boost

86
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,159
to warm them up as they burn through

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,159
those calories

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,440
yes oh

89
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,599
good puffer

90
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,239
this has got his shelter

91
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,159
he's got the solid roof and then a tarp

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,040
over this part of it

93
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,280
so he can get in out of the weather

94
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,280
but

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,519
he's a good job yeah she's a good boy

96
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,720
khaleesi has

97
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,959
her dog house here and she most of the

98
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,080
time goes under the barn where she likes

99
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,400
it the best

100
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,920
we just recently acquired this dog house

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
she does not want to go in it so i'm

102
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,040
going to try giving it to titus and if

103
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,680
he doesn't like it then i'm going to

104
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,959
give it to the guinea hogs

105
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,599
but they have all this lush spring

106
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,320
growth that is just

107
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,160
incredibly healthy and vibrant right now

108
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,680
and i'm hoping that the ice doesn't kill

109
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,320
too much of it

110
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,919
all right titus what do you think

111
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,360
are you gonna go in there

112
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,479
got a bunch of

113
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,560
straw in that dog house

114
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,520
got a bunch of straw up in that hog

115
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
house

116
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,199
that's the one he's used to he likes the

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,720
space i think he seems like he's not

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,639
that into this one because it's kind of

119
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,400
small

120
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,600
you let us know

121
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,280
if you don't like it we'll give it to

122
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,160
the pigs

123
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,160
okay

124
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,680
yeah oh sit on my foot

125
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,759
thanks

126
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,360
goofy dog

127
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,440
you love your tartar

128
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,479
we also make sure that their shelters

129
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,040
are sound and secure we evaluate each

130
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,400
shelter to determine its strengths and

131
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,880
weaknesses

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,280
and make sure that if there's anything

133
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,639
that we know is going to cause a problem

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,639
we go ahead and repair it or improve it

135
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,400
now that might look very different for

136
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,960
people in colder climates but we're not

137
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,199
even going to get below 32 so we're not

138
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,600
as worried about a low temperature

139
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,720
harming any animals as we are

140
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,840
making sure that they stay dry because a

141
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,680
wet cold animal is bad news

142
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,160
but if you can keep them

143
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,560
from getting wet in the first place and

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,120
make sure that they have a nice warm dry

145
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,560
place to rest they will be just fine in

146
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,400
32 degrees

147
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,800
so it's not so much the temperature as

148
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,639
it is the precipitation that is a danger

149
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,880
to our animals that we have to make sure

150
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,120
that we are prepared for

151
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,800
so this is our recent

152
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,479
change to the buck shelter we took the

153
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,600
small blue tarp off

154
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,639
and covered it with a much larger

155
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,520
tarp

156
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,840
given

157
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,440
extra lean to area for other animals to

158
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,440
take shelter that weren't going to

159
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,800
cuddle up in here

160
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,759
inside the buck shelter

161
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,800
we have lots of hay to keep them

162
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,400
warm and toasty and it's deep litter so

163
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,240
it stays nice and warm

164
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,600
but we're gonna be making some changes

165
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,479
because

166
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,319
the roof does not hold water correctly

167
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,759
it'll pool and it'll start to cave in

168
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,240
because we just have these boards kind

169
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,919
of haphazardly holding it up

170
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,600
so ryan is at lowe's now getting some

171
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,520
roofing material that we're going to

172
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,840
replace this top with

173
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,440
one of the things we do is on top of the

174
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,080
deep bedding that's been accumulating

175
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,479
over the year that warms up at night for

176
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,000
them and keeps them warm and cozy as

177
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,039
they snuggle together

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,800
we also add extra hay

179
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,919
for the ones that don't have a thick

180
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,120
deep bedding in their shelter we add a

181
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,440
good amount of straw straw is a great

182
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,520
insulator as it has hollow

183
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,080
stems and that provides an extra layer

184
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,160
of insulation oh yeah that's a lot of

185
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,080
straw to bed down in i think they're

186
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,160
gonna like that

187
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,960
what do you guys think

188
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,710
you can come check it out

189
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,770
come on

190
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,770
[Applause]

191
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,880
yeah

192
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,240
oh you're gonna eat it huh you silly

193
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,919
girl

194
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,120
go bed damn in it

195
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,120
she's like that's not food

196
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,560
okay so something just occurred to me

197
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,560
that could be a problem

198
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,000
when i was over here

199
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,360
getting

200
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,880
the

201
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,319
pigs where are we

202
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,199
right in there

203
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,800
i can see them shuffling around

204
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,039
um

205
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,479
they love the straw by the way

206
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,240
but i had to unplug the electric fence

207
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,120
so that i could climb over and put it in

208
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
there

209
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,479
and then i

210
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,360
went to go plug it back in and i'm like

211
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,599
oh

212
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,639
if we lose power

213
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,039
this group of animals can get out

214
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,560
now once they get out

215
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:09,039
they do have some perimeter fencing but

216
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
it's mainly barbed wire which is not

217
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,919
gonna

218
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,840
you know it's a foot off the ground the

219
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,520
little pigs can go right under it no

220
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,120
problem and mama could go under it if

221
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,280
she wanted to

222
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,800
so

223
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,599
we are gonna have to keep an eye on

224
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,879
things most likely they won't know that

225
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,639
it's off

226
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,319
and we'll be safe and they'll stay

227
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,639
inside the fence and they won't try to

228
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,159
get out but if they do then we're going

229
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,800
to want to

230
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,320
lure them into the buck

231
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,039
shelter

232
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,200
and

233
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,440
hope that the board doesn't mess with

234
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,519
them he's the only one i'm kind of

235
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,240
worried about peaches is in heat and she

236
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,000
is a little bit moody right now so

237
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,240
i don't know if she would be dominant

238
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,120
acting with miss piggy

239
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,240
but it would be the safest place for

240
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,240
them if they do get out but i don't

241
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,839
think that's going to be an issue

242
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,240
cross my fingers

243
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,240
we also like to make sure that all of

244
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,320
our animals have a buddy have a friend

245
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,600
somebody to snuggle up with that helps

246
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,920
keep them warm

247
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,920
right now the way we have it set up

248
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,519
because lashes keeps getting out

249
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,440
unfortunately she's not going to be able

250
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,360
to snuggle with her mama tonight but her

251
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,240
mama has the best shelter on the

252
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,160
property so she's going to be just fine

253
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,880
this is the shelter i'm the most happy

254
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,720
with i find that it is

255
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,240
provides the best

256
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,560
comfort level

257
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,680
and this is friendship shelter

258
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,519
the chickens also

259
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,120
tend to go in here and sleep with her

260
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,240
they usually lay their eggs in the

261
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,760
corner

262
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,640
they're there

263
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,360
but we do scoop out the poop

264
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,920
every day the big clumps

265
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,160
and make sure it's a nice thick layer of

266
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,800
hay for her to bed down on

267
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,320
that provides warmth as well so those

268
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,120
are the things that we do to make sure

269
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,120
that our animals are going to stay

270
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,680
dry and warm

271
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,240
well fed and well watered through any of

272
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,720
the storm issues we might face

273
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,120
the biggest issue that we do encounter

274
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,839
here where we're located in georgia we

275
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,959
are west of atlanta in carrollton area

276
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,600
and we do often lose power

277
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,000
in these bad types of storms

278
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,160
um there's a lot of rural areas where

279
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,040
the power lines have trees that fall on

280
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,519
them causing power outages that could be

281
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,240
widespread meaning it might be a couple

282
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,240
of days before we get our power back we

283
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,120
are crossing our fingers and hoping that

284
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,680
that's not the case so as far as prep

285
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,600
goes for losing power there's not a

286
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,160
whole lot we can do because we don't own

287
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,640
a generator we don't have a wood stove

288
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,560
if we did we would be making sure that

289
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,920
we had tons of firewood inside to keep

290
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,000
us warm

291
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,839
but we're just gonna have to have all of

292
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,519
our blankets ready and we're gonna have

293
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,760
to all sleep in the same bed if we have

294
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,839
to if it's cold enough but it's not

295
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,279
likely to get that cold here having a

296
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,279
generator would be ideal we do have a

297
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,240
few friends that aren't too far away

298
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,800
from us

299
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,079
that have been willing to bring us a

300
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,399
loaner generator in the past so if worst

301
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,560
case scenario comes and we lose power

302
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,760
and they don't then hopefully we can

303
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,760
phone a friend

304
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,760
yes james i might be calling you

305
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,160
so

306
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,000
having other friends in the homesteading

307
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,440
community around you is an important

308
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
thing because you might need to reach

309
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,480
out to them for help with firewood or a

310
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,720
generator or getting a roof on a shelter

311
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,720
that's not quite stable enough for the

312
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,120
rain that's coming ahead

313
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,120
so reach out to those people in advance

314
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,200
let them know that you're hoping that if

315
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,880
you need any help that they're available

316
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,640
and also think about the people who

317
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,839
might be in a worse situation than you

318
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,519
that you can help um we recently offered

319
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,040
firewood to a friend of ours that's

320
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,480
slightly north of us that gets

321
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,079
temperatures that are a little colder

322
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,399
and they heat their whole house with

323
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,880
firewood they were running low and we

324
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,040
offered oak firewood but unfortunately

325
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,720
it was too green for them to use still

326
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,959
just try to do what you can to help

327
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,240
others check on your neighbors check on

328
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,240
your elderly

329
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,920
community make sure that you know that

330
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,160
the people around you are safe and

331
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,839
protected and that they have everything

332
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,120
that they need to get through the storm

333
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,560
whether it's food water or warmth

334
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,200
having a heat source is a good idea for

335
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,880
your house that's a backup heat source

336
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,160
that can keep you warm when you don't

337
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,079
have power we don't have that here but

338
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,760
we have had our heat

339
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,560
not working

340
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,040
in the past before we got it fixed

341
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,720
and it was temperatures as low as 32 and

342
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,560
we stayed pretty warm inside so i'm not

343
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,720
too worried about that but if you live

344
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,440
in an area that's colder i know some of

345
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,600
our waters are even in canada where it's

346
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,600
getting negative 20 degrees

347
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,399
then you might want to reach out and

348
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,320
find out who lives near you that has a

349
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,959
alternative heat source so that you can

350
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,519
go to their house and stay warm extra

351
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,560
water is extremely important during a

352
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,680
power outage and a winter storm

353
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,000
so our well runs on power so when the

354
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,320
power goes out we have no water source

355
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,720
so we are going to be filling extra five

356
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,959
gallon buckets with lids for our water

357
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,120
source we're also going to be filling

358
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,880
our bathtub with water so that we can

359
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,440
flush toilets we're also going to be

360
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,360
filling all of our extra food grade

361
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,160
buckets so that we can have drinking

362
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,480
water and water to cook with

363
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,959
cooking that's a whole nother

364
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,560
issue if you don't have propane

365
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,959
or gas

366
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,639
stove and you only have electric then

367
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,959
you have no way to cook

368
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,160
so have an alternative cooking source

369
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:47,040
for us it's our grill we got plenty of

370
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,839
charcoal we'll we have food that we know

371
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,240
that we can put on the grill and cook if

372
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,800
we need to but having other foods that

373
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,240
are easy to prep or don't have to be

374
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,120
cooked is really important don't go and

375
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,519
buy

376
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,440
10 packages of food that you don't need

377
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,440
from the grocery store and end up wiping

378
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,440
out the shelves don't go buy toilet

379
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,760
paper you don't need don't go buy milk

380
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,279
and bread that you don't need because

381
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,519
milk sandwiches are not going to get you

382
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,160
through the store

383
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,240
what you should do is get a little bit

384
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,320
of the things that you know you will use

385
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,240
in a couple of days time it's only a

386
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,880
couple of days that you won't have power

387
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,440
if that so don't be greedy make sure you

388
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,519
lease enough for others because there

389
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,519
are people who are wiping the shelves

390
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,760
clean and making it hard for people to

391
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,000
actually have what they need you also

392
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,560
want to evaluate your property

393
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,720
especially around your houses or other

394
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,839
buildings making sure

395
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,720
look at the trees evaluate any branches

396
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,720
that are overhanging around your house

397
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,320
and see if there's any trimming that you

398
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,000
need to do to make sure that you're not

399
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,279
going to have any limbs falling on your

400
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,040
roof another good step to do for people

401
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,560
especially in the farm

402
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,800
is to

403
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,120
put an extra layer of mulch in the areas

404
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,120
that are muddy or that get puddles of

405
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,519
water so that you can have a safe

406
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,360
area to walk across so

407
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,839
if you just get a couple of wheelbarrows

408
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,199
of mulch and dump them on your pathways

409
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,399
it's going to save you a lot of

410
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,680
heartache

411
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,600
when the

412
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,199
storm is here and you're having to go

413
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,360
out there and take care of animals in

414
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,600
the storm it's much easier to walk

415
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,959
across a layer of mulch than it is a

416
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,470
thick mud pit and we have a few of those

417
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:42,470
here that we need to address

418
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:42,470
[Music]

419
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:51,680
[Music]

420
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,639
it's also good to know how you're going

421
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,880
to keep the ice off of the water for the

422
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,240
animals the animals are going to want

423
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,720
their water

424
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,040
to be free of ice they would prefer that

425
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,199
you warms them up for them if you don't

426
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,959
lose power and you can warm up a bucket

427
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,639
of water for your animals it is a good

428
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,199
idea so

429
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,279
have a way to break the ice

430
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,600
and remove it from the

431
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,279
water for the animals and do that

432
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,759
frequently

433
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,680
also don't forget to make sure you know

434
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,240
where your candles lighters and

435
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,839
batteries are for flashlights

436
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,680
if you need a light source you're going

437
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,440
to want to know where those are before

438
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,519
the power goes out

439
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,279
if you have a weather radio make sure

440
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,079
you have batteries for it that's a good

441
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,720
idea to keep on hand all of the time

442
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,519
overall just remember to be safe don't

443
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,079
go out on the roads if you don't have to

444
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,000
and stay inside as much as you can if

445
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,800
it's bad weather

446
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,639
so check on the animals frequently

447
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,639
but you don't have to spend a bunch of

448
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,079
time outside just make sure that they

449
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,320
can get to their water and that they

450
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,320
have food and for our family we're

451
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,360
making sure we know where a deck of

452
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,560
cards

453
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,040
and a few

454
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,720
board games are so that we can have fun

455
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,039
if we do lose power

456
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,839
we won't be worried about which devices

457
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,000
aren't working or how netflix isn't on

458
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,319
we'll have each other to have fun with

459
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,480
and we'll play some games and really

460
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,039
have a fun family time

461
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,880
having a power loss can actually be fun

462
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,720
for family with kids

463
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,000
if you make it that way

464
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,160
don't let them get scared or worried

465
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
make sure you show confidence

466
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,640
make sure you show confidence throughout

467
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,880
it so that they stay feeling safe

468
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,280
and make it fun make it like a picnic or

469
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,720
camping out and just teach them

470
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,640
different ways that they can do things

471
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,919
without power i hope that everybody

472
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,880
stays safe and sound through this storm

473
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,280
and that nobody has any damages from the

474
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,880
ice or power loss

475
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,960
make sure that you

476
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,880
check on the community around you and

477
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,200
make sure that your friends family and

478
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,760
neighbors are all safe and warm too

479
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,640
so as we are out here working trying to

480
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,760
get everything ready for the storm

481
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,840
it is noticeably colder

482
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,919
every hour that we work the temperature

483
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,400
is definitely dropping

484
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,039
we have sent the boys inside to snuggle

485
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,440
up and watch a movie while we finish up

486
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,320
what we have to do out here

487
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,919
and

488
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,110
i'm getting a little chilly i might have

489
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,170
to go get some gloves

490
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,170
[Music]

491
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,000
all right that's a roof

492
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,039
[Applause]

493
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,039

checking it out

496
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,120
peter pepper's waiting and here comes

497
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,799
lashes she says i'm coming in too

498
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,080
and we're getting all this mulch put

499
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,600
down

500
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,320
where it was muddy

501
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,200
so a nice path

502
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,679
for easy travel all right

503
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,240
ryan is finishing up the last touches

504
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,160
he's putting walls on the shelter to

505
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,799
block from the wind

506
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:05,039
i've added straw to the beds i've

507
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,760
oh i think we've done everything we can

508
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,520
do for tonight i've mulched areas that

509
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,840
needed to be mulched i filled up water

510
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,840
buckets

511
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,080
now we just have to give everybody

512
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,919
a little extra food for the night to

513
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,440
keep them warm and they'll get a little

514
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,720
extra food tomorrow night to keep them

515
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,120
warm

516
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,799
and we should be good to go and i did

517
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,120
the i didn't get it on film but i

518
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,160
reinforced the chicken coop

519
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,640
shelter

520
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,600
for them to block out some of the wind

521
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,520
so

522
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,600
everybody should be good for tonight the

523
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,280
storm should be starting around midnight

524
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,360
it's gonna start out with some rain

525
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,360
turning over to ice

526
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,360
probably turning over to snow after that

527
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,600
but we really don't know even now the

528
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,280
forecast is all over the place depending

529
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,160
on who you talk to

530
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,039
so wish us luck and hopefully everything

531
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,440
will be

532
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,240
safe and sound here on the homestead and

533
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,320
remember to be storm ready and prepare

534
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,200
as best as you can and make sure you

535
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,200
check on your neighbors
