00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,000
[Music]

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
oh

3
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,640
all right welcome back

4
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,280
richie aldo are you there

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,480
yes how are you i'm doing well how are

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,800
you

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,800
all right looking good in summary

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,399
there he is with his chickens

9
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,600
all right well um for those who've been

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,239
attending

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,360
thus far you don't need any introduction

12
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,399
um

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,840
we have you know laid out a

14
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,520
series of presentations where you're

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,920
going to start with the

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
the deeper framing of you know

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,400
colonization and indigenousness

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,200
and work us through our own process and

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,400
then

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,840
towards cultural um engagement more

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,920
deeply with those insights

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,840
so um i think it's the stage is yours

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,880
so we'll let you uh take it away

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,680
welcome everyone we're gonna go through

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,320
a high level continuation of the

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,600
previous

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,880
conversation on decolonization

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,880
of science process methodology and

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,159
management within the context of

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,920
regenerative agriculture

31
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,479
thinking and to

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,680
be clear there is a lot in the previous

33
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,600
two presentations

34
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:53,280
that uh is is um

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,280
critical in order to understand the

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,719
the points that we're going to go

37
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,159
through today

38
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,600
now the there will be a lot of questions

39
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,360
i am assuming because of when when we

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,520
address these kinds of large-scale

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,120
issues and conceptual

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,000
uh frameworks there is a lot of

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,480
detail that needs to be worked out so a

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,680
lot of that detail has been also

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,480
um addressed in previous presentations

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,480
not all of it this you know business of

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,599
systems change is quite extensive and

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,200
complex

49
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:32,239
uh so today we're going to focus on

50
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,599
just thinking through the mindsets

51
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,480
the processes that we use to

52
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,680
in the methodology that defines how we

53
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,280
manage

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,920
our our presence as as organisms of the

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,480
earth

56
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,599
within the ecosystems that we inhabit

57
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,400
and so on

58
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,319
and so you will find that we will be

59
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,640
addressing

60
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,800
yeah you know specific issues as to

61
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,760
property plant and equipment management

62
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,560
when do we bring equipment um to what

63
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,519
end

64
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,840
uh when does nature needs us to do those

65
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,400
things and how are we approaching this

66
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,200
from a conquering colonizing extraction

67
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,040
perspective or are we seeing it from a

68
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,360
you know perspective where we are part

69
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,959
of the system that we are working with

70
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,360
instead so to that end there are certain

71
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,080
key outcomes that we need to be familiar

72
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
with

73
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,120
and in this case when we look at you

74
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,560
know

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,080
um regenerative agriculture there are

76
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,360
some some things that we assume

77
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,840
uh to be regenerative when they are not

78
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,280
they are neces they are not necessarily

79
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,760
part of a regenerative framework they

80
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,200
are just simply part of our colonized

81
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,840
uh ways of being which is it comes

82
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,680
natural

83
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:53,120
in to us and it's also more of the

84
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,480
mmo that we all are accustomed to and

85
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,680
trained into and domesticated into

86
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,439
so in this case when we look at

87
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,239
the acceptances perpetration of

88
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,319
extractive and exploitative practices

89
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,920
i mean think of organic farming for

90
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,000
example is

91
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,120
not conventional completely but it's

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,799
still conventional

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,560
it's still about row crops about

94
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,720
confining animals

95
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,479
and so on it's still about extracting

96
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,440
volume and exploiting

97
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,720
uh the space and all of that i'm not

98
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,639
saying it's good or bad

99
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,759
simply i'm saying those are facts those

100
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,680
are indicators

101
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,440
that we are still using a colonizing uh

102
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,840
process in when we design and engineer

103
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,479
agronomical

104
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,680
processes and economics and management

105
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,199
and so on

106
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,280
community social and economic

107
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,800
independence is compromised

108
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,320
when we operate as individual farms our

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,960
whole community and social

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,440
infrastructure and our interdependence

111
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,479
with other species and also with other

112
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,400
farms

113
00:04:52,479 --> 00:05:00,320
is compromised and there is a tremendous

114
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,880
challenge in trying to work with farmers

115
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,600
within collective systems most farmers

116
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,720
are

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,120
are really radically individualistic

118
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,720
and so that is a colonized way of

119
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,520
thinking as well is the result of a

120
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,680
colonizing culture that we act that way

121
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,639
the legitimization and legalization of

122
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,800
violence against

123
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,479
anything that is counted to the system

124
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,880
so when we talk about ancestral

125
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,600
traditions and knowledge and culture and

126
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,479
food sovereignty and it's it's most of

127
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,000
the time

128
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,880
relegated to those who are suffering

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
minorities

130
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,960
and so on and so forth because they are

131
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,400
the ones who are in trouble the rest

132
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,240
is somehow okay well no it isn't

133
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:46,160
we are not okay as a society uh so

134
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,320
this legitimization of violence uh also

135
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,520
somehow we use it to legitimize our

136
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,639
attitudes

137
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,440
when it comes down to talking about uh

138
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,240
food sovereignty justice injustice and

139
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,240
um

140
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,919
and diversity and so on the legalization

141
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,360
of abuse of government sponsored

142
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,160
corporate takeovers and market

143
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,680
manipulation

144
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,479
this is this is like day-to-day stuff

145
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,160
we're looking at government sponsoring

146
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,800
corporations to take over whole

147
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,039
countries

148
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:20,720
food systems uh or whole regions or

149
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,800
or industry sectors and then those

150
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,080
corporations you know manipulate their

151
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,160
way into

152
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,479
into creating artificial markets but

153
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,479
then make it infinitely impossible for

154
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,440
real farmers to succeed

155
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,919
so really important because that is at

156
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,319
this

157
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,520
core of colonizing structures that we

158
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,600
have been building for a long time

159
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,440
that also results in the concentration

160
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,600
of ownership and control of

161
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,680
whole systems i mean we are no longer

162
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,080
looking at farms we're looking at the

163
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,360
whole

164
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,199
system from who owns the brands all the

165
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,199
way through who owns the capital

166
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,960
who owns the infrastructure that

167
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,599
produces that capital

168
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,479
and also the concentration of ownership

169
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,440
and control

170
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,759
on those elements of the system that

171
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,880
make

172
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,680
money versus the the

173
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,280
offloading of all of the risky aspects

174
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,960
of the system to

175
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,240
unsuspecting farmers workers and so on

176
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,919
that's a really important indicator

177
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,120
of a colonized culture that is actually

178
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:28,000
getting us to this brink of um

179
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,680
you know global collapse the

180
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,199
systematization of vibration of

181
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,080
indigenous knowledge and science i mean

182
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,120
we tend to always want to

183
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,000
um verify so is it scientifically proven

184
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,840
right

185
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,639
so say we are doing poultry with

186
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,800
with the foundational indigenous

187
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,800
knowledge that we inherited and

188
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,720
we're putting poultry back into their

189
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,199
natural environment where they evolved

190
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,840
over

191
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,120
millions of years and yeah that's

192
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,440
indigenous knowledge

193
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,840
and that's in digital science and it is

194
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,759
proven and tested to be more effective

195
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,039
and to be superbly effective and

196
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,560
efficient

197
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:10,000
yet it has to be somehow

198
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,560
tested and verified by the conventional

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,360
community of science scientist community

200
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,080
in order for

201
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,720
for it to be real yet it's more real

202
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,759
than the

203
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,479
recent inventions of of colonizing

204
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,759
science

205
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:28,160
and management uh so we don't

206
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:32,320
we don't require that say

207
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,159
monsanto monsanto scientifically

208
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,719
you know or bayer in this case

209
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,519
scientifically demonstrates that

210
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,159
their chemicals will not harm and

211
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,599
instead

212
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,560
enhance the ecosystems if used yet

213
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,160
we demand and we don't accept indigenous

214
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,320
knowledge which is proven and

215
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,640
tested for hundreds of thousands of

216
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,480
years to enhance the environment and to

217
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,920
feed people so

218
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,519
very important uh you know uh systems of

219
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,600
repression that we have

220
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,760
built into our narrative and then our

221
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,160
management systems

222
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,040
now at the end what this results in the

223
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,440
uprooting of

224
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,880
spiritually grounding traditions

225
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,600
individually

226
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,080
raising to the bottom consumerism

227
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,399
climate disruption ecological collapse

228
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,600
war conflict disease and social

229
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,600
breakdown

230
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,040
i mean if you are not seeing those

231
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,600
indicators

232
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,360
scream at us from everywhere in every

233
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,279
corner of the earth right now

234
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,279
um then we are in the wrong room

235
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,360
now there are some also some key outcome

236
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,200
indicators of a decolonized regenerative

237
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,480
bipolar system

238
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,959
and we'll look into a few things that

239
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,000
uh hopefully shifts your paradigm in a

240
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,440
second here

241
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
but one of them is that natural

242
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,800
resources are managed in perpetuity not

243
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,279
expected

244
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,480
for short-term gains and it also happens

245
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:00,560
that managing ecosystems in perpetuity

246
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,839
is at the end more conducive to regular

247
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,959
to generating

248
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,399
wealth than the extraction short-term uh

249
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,519
gains that we can achieve

250
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,800
through exploited colonizing systems now

251
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,560
the difference is

252
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,200
that when natural resources are managing

253
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,000
probability a corporation can't just

254
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
come

255
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,560
and extract all the value from an

256
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,600
ecosystem walk away and

257
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,240
leave their locals to to pay

258
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,440
in the communities at large to pay for

259
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,079
the consequences

260
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,000
of the extraction of that value now they

261
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,040
may only be extracting

262
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
five percent of what we could extract in

263
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,680
perpetuity

264
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,040
but they do it right away and they are

265
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,240
very efficient at it

266
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,600
and that somehow is validated more

267
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,600
above the more wealth creation and the

268
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,959
more well-being that we can generate if

269
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,360
we manage resources

270
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,360
in perpetuity under a decolonized

271
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,680
process of management

272
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,920
the social and economic independence is

273
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,760
supported as a foundation of success

274
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,600
if that is the truth then you know you

275
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,399
are not in a completely colonized

276
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,480
uh setting ancestral traditions

277
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,320
knowledge wisdom are validated to ensure

278
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,360
collective mental physical and spiritual

279
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,839
well-being

280
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,720
this is central to indigenous ways of

281
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,200
farming

282
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,600
and living community building governance

283
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,760
ownership control

284
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,839
governance organizing and production

285
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,760
infrastructure reflect community needs a

286
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,640
priority for collective wealth creation

287
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,760
distribution

288
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,760
it is not about someone making a profit

289
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,120
it's about everyone being collectively

290
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,360
wealthier

291
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,959
and that at the end of the day generates

292
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,360
a much better quality of life

293
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,800
when resources are distributed on the

294
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,120
basis of how they

295
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,560
their governance infrastructure is built

296
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,200
then the management

297
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,360
of all of that wealth is also done

298
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,880
differently and because of that

299
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,200
more people benefit and there is more

300
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,639
um you know less conflict less war less

301
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,519
of volca these kinds of things that we

302
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,720
have seen under

303
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,000
the colonizing systems we did today now

304
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,399
all supply chains

305
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,440
from land to fork are collectively

306
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,279
controlled in government

307
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,560
you don't have a single company owning

308
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,279
the whole supply chain

309
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,040
and dumping all of the high risk assets

310
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,279
onto farmers such as the

311
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,040
uh as a land and property plant and

312
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,519
equipment in this case

313
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,519
um defending protecting enhancing

314
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,600
collective interest is structured within

315
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,360
the system level governance structures

316
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,880
at all levels at this point we're

317
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,600
talking about indigenous governance

318
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,160
systems that

319
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,720
have survived in the case of guatemala

320
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,120
over

321
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,639
500 years of colonization and are still

322
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,680
defending in protecting

323
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,800
and enhancing the interests of the

324
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,160
communities

325
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,240
that are within those territories so

326
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,360
that is because though we still have

327
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,399
some of those

328
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,279
incredibly structurally sound

329
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,920
and also resilient uh governing

330
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,880
structures from ancestral traditions uh

331
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,440
the current

332
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,120
governing systems have have paired up

333
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,040
completely with the extractive system

334
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,320
that is destroying the very foundation

335
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:06,240
of what they are governing so

336
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,839
when you focus on this um kind of

337
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,079
outcomes you will recognize

338
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,079
a regenerative system when you see it

339
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,360
the verifiers are simple

340
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,560
spiritual introductions are uplifted um

341
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,639
i'm sorry that i i

342
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,600
got this whole thing in a in the wrong

343
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,560
order so

344
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,560
just stick with me ownership control and

345
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,519
governance are called a collective

346
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,279
affair

347
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,639
okay you don't have a board of directors

348
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,680
of a nonprofit

349
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,240
or a corporation that is actually

350
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,000
or even a country's government that is

351
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,959
actually in control

352
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
of the whole system it is a collective

353
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,399
affair

354
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,279
if if you see that then the system is

355
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,120
regenerative

356
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,560
if not it isn't meeting basic food needs

357
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,160
of communities and regions

358
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,959
is the priority not the production of

359
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,480
cocoa for export or coffee for export or

360
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,600
corn and soybeans or

361
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,320
it's not about the practices on the land

362
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,079
i mean that

363
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,920
is part of it of course but it's

364
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,120
regenerative outcomes

365
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,959
can be verified are verified from a

366
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,279
whole different angle when you look at

367
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,600
it

368
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,279
from a decolonized perspective the

369
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,079
environment is protected locally and

370
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,160
globally

371
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,279
but why because if you pollute the

372
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,600
mississippi river

373
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,560
out up all the way up north in the at

374
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,680
thai scale

375
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,360
itasca park for example that pollution

376
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,199
is going to go down the mississippi all

377
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,240
the way to new orleans all the way to

378
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,160
the gulf of mexico

379
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,760
and then from there spread across the

380
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,519
globe so

381
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,680
the whole issue of environmental

382
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,040
management ecological management

383
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,680
it isn't it it's a global priority

384
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,959
it's a global management plan and then

385
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,160
verified yes

386
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,320
locally resilience non-profits

387
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,839
and extraction is a central system level

388
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,240
goal but why

389
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,120
why not profit because we don't really

390
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,480
need to make profits to hit the world

391
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,880
they the communities have fed themselves

392
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,279
for

393
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,680
centuries thousands of years by

394
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,560
exchanging the value of the different

395
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,240
things that

396
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:13,279
they they generate and yes exchanging

397
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,639
value is the term so but not

398
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,120
profits necessarily a profit is a term

399
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,639
that is is completely connected to

400
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,279
extracting something

401
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,839
out of something else owned by someone

402
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,279
else

403
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,720
normally that's the case so social rule

404
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,880
central and accountability

405
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,519
interdependent and interdependency

406
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,320
well this is where the accountability

407
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,360
then

408
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,720
moves it moves us into the um

409
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,839
the um the objectives of the

410
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,000
of the system so governance for example

411
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,600
is the result of accountability who owns

412
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,800
and controls that's a result of

413
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,000
accountability

414
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,600
and and and so on you know health

415
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,279
focuses on well-being

416
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,120
rather than the management of disease

417
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,759
now think about

418
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,800
the the whole thing we have right now

419
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,800
with uh

420
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,320
diet related diseases in the united

421
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,079
states and

422
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,079
i can remember we're like 10 years that

423
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,120
i heard that it was over 400 billion

424
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:14,160
dollars um cost to the

425
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,000
society now why why would you really

426
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,279
manage a disease that shouldn't exist in

427
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,320
the first place

428
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,880
right and again the the

429
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,199
health of a community is not it's not

430
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,360
measured by the absence of disease

431
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,199
but but the ability of the organisms in

432
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,320
that community to resist

433
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,600
and bound back from disease that is

434
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,880
called well-being

435
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,480
and that is a foundational principle of

436
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,560
health management

437
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,839
not managing diseases which is where we

438
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,959
focus the colonial

439
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,240
the colonizing processes no wealth is

440
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,680
built and shared

441
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,480
not extracted delivering nutrition is

442
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,519
not simply

443
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,800
food or fill it's the top system

444
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,320
priority so delivering nutrition is the

445
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,560
top system priority

446
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,040
notice it's not about food it's about

447
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,040
nutrition

448
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,600
this system simply is

449
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,120
or isn't regenerative certifications or

450
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,720
outside control schemes are

451
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:18,559
unnecessary and they are also irrelevant

452
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,120
for a system to be regenerative

453
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,679
if it is then it's regenerating if it

454
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,000
isn't

455
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,919
it isn't regenerating it doesn't matter

456
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,799
if anybody has certified it

457
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
labeled it uh built a brand around it

458
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,919
put all these

459
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,919
claims on it that doesn't matter it's

460
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,039
either we tell the court is not

461
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:40,480
simple as that the focus is also on the

462
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:44,000
system level indicators outcomes

463
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,600
as products form a farm

464
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,120
or fund practices are simply not

465
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,160
regenerative on their own because only

466
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,480
systems can regenerate that is a

467
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,080
fundamental mistake we're making today

468
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,720
on how we are approaching

469
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,480
this aspect of regenerative thinking

470
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,760
because we are still using

471
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:09,760
colonizing practices management

472
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:13,360
science and methodology to

473
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,320
enter this space and instead of

474
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,280
enhancing the ability and preparing

475
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,320
ourselves

476
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,760
in our own approaches to optimize

477
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,120
the incredible magnificent uh

478
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,160
benefits of regenerative ways we are

479
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,039
instead

480
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,000
colonizing this space appropriating it

481
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,840
labeling it

482
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,360
naming it and then building

483
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,600
infrastructure to

484
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,960
protect whatever it is that we think it

485
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,840
is rather than just

486
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,840
allowing it to be the generator

487
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,480
so understanding decolonization

488
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,679
you know this is really critical because

489
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,679
i just what i just said results out of a

490
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,640
mental process that we are

491
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,400
indoctrinated into and domesticated into

492
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,480
so the first step here is the

493
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,400
discovery you know you heard this before

494
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,840
right it's a new land there's new people

495
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,720
there's a new concept there's a new

496
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,840
story

497
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,720
this new discovery then is named then

498
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,960
after his name

499
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,400
is legally appropriated and expropriated

500
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,880
from those who

501
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,000
have preserved it in this case the whole

502
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,039
idea

503
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,919
of how we regenerate ecosystems uh

504
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,080
held together for all you know despite

505
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,280
the incredible forces of colonization

506
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,520
and depression

507
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,600
killed by native communities who are

508
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,559
still practicing indigenous ways

509
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,960
across the world uh according to the u.n

510
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,520
over

511
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,240
80 percent of the biodiversity on the

512
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,280
planet

513
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,640
is held under indigenous communities of

514
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,000
native communities

515
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,799
why because they have always

516
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,840
operated on on mostly decolonized

517
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,480
processes

518
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,160
and so this legal exploitation is

519
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,960
happening to that concept of

520
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,760
regenerative

521
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,039
thinking right now as well um the

522
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,960
standardization and

523
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,400
scale depression ownership and control

524
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,120
systems think about

525
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,640
what we are doing by what we did to

526
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,640
organic by bringing it

527
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,080
under a government institution now

528
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,000
corporations can decide what

529
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,720
organization is and then to a great

530
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,960
extent

531
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,559
and because of that we have still

532
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,840
animals in confinement

533
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,080
and and we still got corn and soybeans

534
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,039
and

535
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,320
row crops and tilling and you know you

536
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,240
know release of

537
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:32,720
co2 into the air and an organic matter

538
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,840
into the water systems and excess

539
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,000
fertilizers and inputs uh organic or not

540
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,640
they they still destroy the balance of

541
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,840
life

542
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,520
on the ecosystem so this is important to

543
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,760
understand as we think about

544
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,440
what the difference is between you know

545
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,000
conventional regenerative

546
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,000
and organic and all this other uh

547
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,200
terminology that is thrown around all

548
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,240
over the place

549
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,440
now build systems the the the process of

550
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,760
pronunciation

551
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,720
you know optimizes that the last piece

552
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,799
which is the

553
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,799
what i call the colonization of the mind

554
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,400
where with the systems to repress

555
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,080
indigenous thinking and attempts and

556
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,039
indigenizing ways of living and

557
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,159
intellect

558
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,080
are actually consolidated with the

559
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,919
purpose of invalidating

560
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,159
you know in fact scientifically

561
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,960
invalidating or co-opting indigenous

562
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,280
knowledge

563
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,720
the subsidization the subsidizing of

564
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,720
pseudo solutions

565
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,240
such as you know genetically engineered

566
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,159
crops and things like that

567
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,240
are the cost of real and permanent

568
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,760
well-being and progress

569
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,159
so to understand decolonization then you

570
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,159
got to

571
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,480
revert that process in your head you

572
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,520
know we need to go back and rediscover

573
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,559
aboriginal systems and and so on ideas

574
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,080
concepts stories

575
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,720
names of places in in start reversing

576
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,039
that in

577
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,919
in our heads but also in the day-to-day

578
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,679
practices

579
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,440
we need to rename these things we

580
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,720
reclaim and we insecure

581
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:00,240
so if we're going to name something

582
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,440
a way of uh doing things uh such as

583
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,000
legendary

584
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,640
let's not define it but rather let's

585
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,120
just

586
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,760
rename it it's indigenous agriculture

587
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,080
actually

588
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,159
indigenous not from the perspective of

589
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,640
people who are native to minnesota

590
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,240
or or to my my native country in

591
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,480
guatemala but rather

592
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,720
are indigenous to the earth right this

593
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,520
is a way of farming of thinking of

594
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,000
managing

595
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,880
our relationship as beings of the earth

596
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,919
in you know

597
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,880
as as beings of the earth that depend

598
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,520
on all life on earth and so as we become

599
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,039
more indigenous with our own nature then

600
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,840
we can i absorb this concept and we can

601
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,039
start

602
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,679
you know uh either even naming it we may

603
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,400
name it

604
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,320
a hundred or a thousand different ways

605
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,520
as long as the concept the idea the

606
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,200
story the length

607
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,120
all of those things the rituals and

608
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,919
traditions are actually

609
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,520
uh representative of a way of thinking

610
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,679
that grounds us back

611
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,200
with the original geo evolutionary

612
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,360
processes of the earth

613
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,440
and the magnificent design that we were

614
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,240
delivered for the transformation of

615
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,799
energy

616
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,400
from non-edible into edible forms

617
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,200
through biophysical and chemical

618
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,039
processes

619
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,480
that have existed forever and that are

620
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,600
more than tested to deliver

621
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,760
sufficient food for all of us

622
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,200
so rebuild community governance and

623
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,080
protection systems we're going to

624
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,960
address this

625
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,039
and the last uh of this series uh

626
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,440
indigenizing governance we

627
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,640
we have been you know bringing this back

628
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,640
as a process of

629
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,280
of um of um systematizing decolonization

630
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,559
processes

631
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,320
where governance and the

632
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,120
re-indigenization of it

633
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,440
the holistic governing systems and so on

634
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,400
are

635
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,520
our central standardizing processes to

636
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,120
reclaim and return

637
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,320
aboriginal systems to their original

638
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,720
purpose the purpose of a system and food

639
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,880
from an indigenous perspective is really

640
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,120
to support the holistic thinking

641
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,960
appreciation and enjoyment of life

642
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,200
design and engineering to ensure the

643
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,720
full expression of all living organisms

644
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,159
is materialized now it just happens that

645
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,440
all of that is already going

646
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,919
on we don't have to be engineering a lot

647
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,919
of the

648
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,400
stuff that we are engineering all we

649
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,360
need to is understand how it was already

650
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,159
engineered

651
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,520
and by nature itself and ensure that

652
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,000
every organism

653
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,679
you know expresses itself in the fullest

654
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,840
potential that he was giving

655
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,000
through the geo evolutionary processes

656
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,440
and what it means is simply

657
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,200
you know accepting that a

658
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,760
corn plant may not produce 400 bushels

659
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,960
of

660
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,080
corn per acre if uh managed

661
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,640
in a more holistic way and that is not

662
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,360
a measure of inefficiency or it's not an

663
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,559
indicator

664
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,360
of inefficiency for efficiency

665
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,799
in agriculture in the in in under a

666
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,919
decolonized process

667
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:56,080
is measured not on the output

668
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,919
of product and pounds and stuff but

669
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,720
rather the throughput

670
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,159
and the transformation ranges of energy

671
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,679
within a system

672
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,039
and so this is um this is an area where

673
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,279
we're going to have to expand

674
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,640
a lot more in the you know and if we

675
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,880
expand it a little bit more on the

676
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,279
previous presentation

677
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,080
and watch that that part of energy

678
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,919
management and

679
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,360
stewardship as a foundation of our

680
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,480
relationship to food

681
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,039
rather than producing things so

682
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,080
expand and organize new systems so we

683
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,480
need to scale up

684
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,840
organizing across communities locally

685
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,360
regionally and nationally

686
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,600
we need to build aggregation of

687
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,679
representation from local

688
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,679
localized governing councils all the way

689
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,159
across the board until we reach

690
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,039
the national levels of building you know

691
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,799
a rejected

692
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,880
congress agriculture congress or

693
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:48,240
something like that that is actually

694
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,559
growing up from the the communities that

695
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,080
are

696
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,840
embracing degenerative ways so

697
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,400
basically regenerative thinking is a

698
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,720
radical um

699
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,240
is a it's a radical perspective it's a

700
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,840
nature-based foundation

701
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,480
it is subversive uh it's it's it

702
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,200
happens when we become intellectually

703
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,039
insurgent

704
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,720
so what we need is an intellectual

705
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,039
insurgency so that we can

706
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,799
flip the paradigms on which we operate

707
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,760
and build the systems with the integrity

708
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,840
and commitment

709
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,440
when you think as an insurgent then that

710
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,600
integrity and that commitment

711
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,080
becomes the thing that drives you

712
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,880
forward we need that level of passion

713
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,559
but an insurgent is characterized by in

714
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,159
order to actually achieve this

715
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,320
decolonization goal

716
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,799
the beauty of it is that this the

717
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,520
regenerative is an evolutionary process

718
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,159
because

719
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,840
it ignites engagement at scale there is

720
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,400
no better time in the history of human

721
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,960
beings

722
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,760
where we need disengagement at scale

723
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,760
under

724
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,600
structures and organizational processes

725
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,159
that allows us permanence

726
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,039
i'm not talking about a scale as in

727
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,600
protesting

728
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,240
and then going home but rather scale as

729
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,600
in

730
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,799
as in liberating the the consumer from

731
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,120
conventional products

732
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,000
the land from conventional practices

733
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,480
asked from

734
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,520
bank debt of the farm and on and on

735
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,880
adults

736
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,679
um evolutionary we can

737
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,320
adapt we are agile we are resilient when

738
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,320
you

739
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,360
when you operate under a regenerative

740
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,640
framework

741
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:22,240
this characteristics are the uh

742
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:25,440
part of the um what defines

743
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,520
what you do this is how we arrive at

744
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,720
this uncompromising destination

745
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,960
called together so no longer think of

746
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,320
regenerative agriculture as

747
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,840
no-till or soil health or or

748
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,919
rotational crops or those are practices

749
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,840
that they are important they are

750
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,000
critical in transitioning

751
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,679
towards regenerative they are i mean

752
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,440
they are all good

753
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,799
they are not the destination though a

754
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,200
regenerative destination

755
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,200
is way way way beyond that

756
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:01,760
now here's a quick view for one

757
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,480
one process that we have followed in

758
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,240
terms of

759
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,000
how we approach poultry from this

760
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,399
indigenously colonized

761
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,279
way of seeing and working with these

762
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,840
systems

763
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,799
you know first of all we saw the the

764
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,960
landscape

765
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,080
uh from the perspective of the chicken a

766
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,039
landscape the chicken

767
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,480
wants shade it wants canopy he wants to

768
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,159
be protected from the sun

769
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,799
aerial predators it's

770
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,000
wants to have a sheltered or a protected

771
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,919
area to sleep on

772
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,360
normally they will do it on trees blah

773
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,159
blah blah it's a

774
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,120
long story but that's the way we started

775
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,320
the process of

776
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,039
engineering rather than um thinking of

777
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,520
from homo centric perspective what would

778
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,240
we

779
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,880
how can we grow and produce chickens

780
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,840
rather than thinking it that way we said

781
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,120
what would make the chicken express its

782
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,240
maximum potential as an organism

783
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,720
and that's how we ended up with our

784
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,600
current design and our current design

785
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,159
really goes

786
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,559
back to the foundational currency of

787
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,760
farming which is carbon

788
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,720
the the process of managing that

789
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,600
so that we can achieve efficiency

790
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,159
efficiency

791
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,120
not in necessarily the measured in

792
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,240
productivity

793
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,880
or or pounds of chicken per acre or for

794
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,840
building

795
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,760
but rather transformation of energy and

796
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,240
so when we think of it that way

797
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,360
we also achieve the outcomes we want the

798
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,080
pounds and all that

799
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,559
and exceed the expectations but when we

800
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,480
focus on the pounds as a beginning point

801
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,399
then we go quickly into heat conversion

802
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,279
rates and we get locked into that five

803
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,679
percent

804
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,159
of possibilities for innovation and we

805
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,480
ignore the other 95 percent that could

806
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,600
come

807
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,039
from a decolonized point of view

808
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,799
they're naturally occurring energy

809
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,720
transformation systems is really the

810
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,240
foundational production engineering

811
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,360
management sciences

812
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,640
uh in regional economics uh think about

813
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,480
agronomics

814
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,559
in the political system we are deploying

815
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,480
now uh you won't find

816
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,640
a lot of that traditional you know

817
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,480
linear recipe-like

818
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,399
uh process rather what you have is a lot

819
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,720
of indicators observations

820
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,600
and knowledge and wisdom building

821
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,600
formulas

822
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,159
so that we can actually interpret what's

823
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,520
going on so that we know whether that

824
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,919
chicken is actually uh uh

825
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,080
achieving that optimal state of

826
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,880
performance as an organism

827
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,679
and as a result you know we can have

828
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,440
more margins

829
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,840
lower cost less work and so on

830
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,679
uh and then governance the integration

831
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,520
of local regional national collective

832
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,360
enterprises so that we can move

833
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,279
the management systems into the

834
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,159
structures that allows us to

835
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,960
to govern um collectively but also

836
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,679
achieve

837
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,520
those scale level scale levels that

838
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,679
gives us that competitive advantage

839
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,399
in management and so on at that point we

840
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,480
can use a lot of the colonized sciences

841
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,840
because the science itself is not what's

842
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,200
bad the

843
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,600
the corporate structure is not

844
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,120
necessarily what's bad it's the people

845
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,080
and the objectives and

846
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,320
to what end those systems and tools are

847
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,399
used that's what is wrong today

848
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,240
and fortunately for all of us it's a

849
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,159
very small amount of corporate

850
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,159
executives and folks around the world

851
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,799
that actually dominate the colonizing

852
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,039
system

853
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,159
so to actually change it as long as all

854
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,080
of us get together

855
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,679
and start doing this they really don't

856
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,279
mean very much they get all the money

857
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,760
right now because we give it to them

858
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,320
but it is just just that you as he was

859
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,360
given

860
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,360
can be taken away

861
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,600
here is the process by which we

862
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,000
structure a

863
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,440
a multi-dimensional way of thinking

864
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,600
about the chicken

865
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,080
the three places where energy is

866
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,399
transformed at a mass scale on the earth

867
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,120
is one the photosynthetic processes of

868
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,960
plants

869
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,039
so that more photosynthesis for the

870
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,880
synthetic surfaces in your farm

871
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,799
the more effectively you are you are

872
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,240
achieving that first level

873
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:58,320
of transformation of free accessible

874
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,440
freely accessible energy in the air and

875
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,360
all around us

876
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,600
four times and so on and then bringing

877
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,760
them into that space that you are now

878
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,640
overseeing from an energy transformation

879
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,320
perspective

880
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,480
the second place of transformation on

881
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,480
mars at a mass scale

882
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,399
is the the intestinal gut and the

883
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,240
chewing mechanisms of

884
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,840
animals so whether it's cows and sheep

885
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,440
and pigs and so on so forth

886
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,679
in this case chickens well they don't

887
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,320
have teeth on their beaks but they do

888
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,039
have

889
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,159
uh gizzards which act as a chewing

890
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,640
mechanism

891
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,840
and so that process breaks down

892
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,679
molecular

893
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,200
structures that are molecularly more

894
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,600
difficult for microbes

895
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,720
and other organisms to break apart into

896
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,039
it into

897
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,320
dissolved into the the original

898
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,399
foundational nutrients

899
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,679
so that process in the intestinal gut

900
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,760
and the animals

901
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,440
chewing mechanism is the next place that

902
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,440
on a global perspective

903
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,240
the next level of energy transformation

904
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,399
happens and so as that happens we get to

905
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,360
harvest certain forms of energy

906
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,919
such as eggs and fruits and nuts and all

907
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,559
the

908
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,480
things that we would take on the farm

909
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,840
but it's not about production it's about

910
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,960
energy expressions

911
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,640
and so the next level of transformation

912
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,000
happens in the soil where

913
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,200
again microorganisms both the at the gut

914
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,919
intestinal

915
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,799
microflora and the organisms of the of

916
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,640
the soil

917
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,159
is the equivalent of the intestinal

918
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,360
microflora in our

919
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,039
in our our guts and so those three

920
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,159
places is where

921
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,279
most of the energy is transformed on

922
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,440
planet earth

923
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,519
in between these processes there is a

924
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,399
magnificent assembly of

925
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,440
millions of micro transformation

926
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,720
processes that are

927
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,279
that resulted from the adaptation of

928
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,720
micro and large-scale ecosystems over

929
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,360
geological time

930
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,640
and governed by the laws of

931
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,919
thermodynamics that define

932
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,519
the biophysical and chemical

933
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,480
processes that go into ensuring that

934
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,840
this energy

935
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,519
is endlessly transformed and endlessly

936
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,480
being put into

937
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,720
embark into feathers into eggs into

938
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,840
vegetables into nuts and fruits and so

939
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,480
on so forth

940
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,520
that system never stops to the extent

941
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,720
that that energy

942
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,720
is freely allowed to flow and or is at

943
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,079
least not interrupted as much as we are

944
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,200
doing today

945
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,679
and as long as each of the organisms in

946
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,960
this whole system including ourselves

947
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,679
are expressing the maximum earth given

948
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,119
genetic potential we don't need much of

949
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,000
the engineering that we have

950
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,399
we have done today to colonize the world

951
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,720
the

952
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,919
engineering we have done is mostly for

953
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,879
the purpose of

954
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,960
profit and extraction of it not for the

955
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,520
purpose of feeding the world that that

956
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,159
if anybody doesn't have that clear yet

957
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,679
um

958
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,760
meditate on that um so anyway

959
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,599
out of these processes we get to harvest

960
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,760
energy in different expressions

961
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,680
some of it is not immediately edible so

962
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,839
it goes back into the process again

963
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,280
and again and it becomes different

964
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,440
expressions of energy

965
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,119
you know like the manure from our

966
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,240
chickens is taken out of the barns and

967
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,480
then put into

968
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,599
different agroforestry systems so we can

969
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,000
generate grains and

970
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,000
vegetables and there is no herbs and

971
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,720
anything in the grocery store

972
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,359
uh pretty much or on your table every

973
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,359
day

974
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,720
some of them energy comes back into the

975
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,839
system and that

976
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,839
is how we see energy transformation

977
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,040
as a foundation of the efficiency in

978
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,880
agriculture

979
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,960
now it just happens that according to

980
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,599
some scientific

981
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,079
scientist partners that i work with that

982
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,880
we estimate that no more than 30 to 40

983
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,000
percent of the

984
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,040
energy that is uh um

985
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,119
processed in this cycle needs to it's

986
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,079
actually harvestable immediately

987
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,720
which means that 60 to 70 percent of the

988
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,440
energy

989
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,240
that is captured in the cycles is put

990
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,960
into the system for the next cycle

991
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,760
which means we start energy rich so

992
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,599
meaning

993
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:06,000
wealthy if we understand that energy

994
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:09,119
is the currency of agriculture

995
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,560
basically what i'm saying is we

996
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,520
don't operate on flat or linear

997
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,560
uh equations flat surfaces or linear

998
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,240
equations

999
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,400
we think of the landscape as

1000
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,599
three-dimensional

1001
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,880
first starting from way down under the

1002
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,720
ground where the deepest roots can reach

1003
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,400
all the way to the top so that we can

1004
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,599
optimize the

1005
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,800
the every organism capacity

1006
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:40,079
to be the best it can be and to

1007
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,200
process the most energy possible if we

1008
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,599
do that right

1009
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,680
then we will add and we will

1010
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,240
automatically become

1011
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,160
connected to the fourth dimension to

1012
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,880
this space and organisms

1013
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,440
which is the spiritual aspect when we

1014
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,720
would connect on the spiritual level

1015
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,480
then we can achieve the

1016
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,040
three-dimensional view

1017
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,320
in the three-dimensional capacity to

1018
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,079
transform or

1019
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,160
support the process transformation of

1020
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,560
energy and as a result of that

1021
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,760
achieve what many are calling the triple

1022
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,119
bottom line

1023
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,400
for for the the the economic

1024
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:19,440
social and ecological outcomes are

1025
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,680
not in isolation they happen when we are

1026
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,359
able to see this three-dimensionality

1027
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,440
and as a result of that connect

1028
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,599
spiritually then we can achieve a triple

1029
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,880
bottom line

1030
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:34,720
and feed of animals the healthiest

1031
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,720
foods you could ever find

1032
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,200
so this next aspect

1033
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,280
is really about just um taking all of

1034
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,640
this from the land from the farms

1035
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,280
and building collective uh assemblies

1036
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,000
of all of these different expressions of

1037
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,000
ice

1038
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,280
so whether we are farming chickens or

1039
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,839
vegetables we

1040
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,040
are part of these affinity groups that

1041
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:00,000
can be layered

1042
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,680
or across the landscape to build a

1043
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,040
collective impact on the basis that

1044
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,000
those affinity groups

1045
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,720
have common goals and objectives and

1046
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,920
measuring

1047
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,680
the wealth creation um on the basis of

1048
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,240
indicators of collective well-being

1049
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,800
so in southeastern minnesota for example

1050
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,200
where we

1051
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,160
are working right now with 20 farms of

1052
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,280
which 11

1053
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,440
are bipod community members we

1054
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,119
are measuring our collective wealth at

1055
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,359
just around 32

1056
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,320
million dollars in property plant

1057
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,680
equipment

1058
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,800
and probably up to 20 million

1059
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,480
in intellectual uh property

1060
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,480
and uh brand value and all of that so

1061
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,680
we are right now collectively sitting on

1062
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,040
around 52 to 60 million dollars worth

1063
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,680
of collective uh wealth and what that

1064
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,880
means is

1065
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,880
that we are achieving a level of

1066
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,119
collective well-being for example when

1067
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,880
we feel depressed or when we don't

1068
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,599
have enough time to do the work on the

1069
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,599
farm such as last weekend when i needed

1070
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,560
to plant ten thousand nasal nuts

1071
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,599
there were over 15 of our partners in

1072
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,800
the region that

1073
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,040
came out and we were able to plant all

1074
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,839
of the 28 21 acres

1075
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,119
of hazelnuts in three days that's a

1076
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,520
collective well-being

1077
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,720
why because i'm not suffering mental

1078
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,359
depression or

1079
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,720
any of those other problems um

1080
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,119
individually

1081
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,200
while because i have a collective wealth

1082
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,680
that we can tap into from the uh

1083
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,599
have a little deficit like that that's a

1084
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,240
very different concept and it's very

1085
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,560
hard for

1086
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,520
traditional linear economists to

1087
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,760
understand

1088
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,920
what it means to actually operate in a

1089
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,320
circular economy

1090
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,640
thinking designing for and building at

1091
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,200
scale we're not compromising scale in

1092
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,000
any way

1093
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,839
in fact we can design systems that can

1094
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,200
deliver much larger scale than the

1095
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,440
current conventional

1096
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,520
uh system and we can change the numbers

1097
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,760
with you on that too

1098
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,920
but we don't compromise the small scale

1099
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,560
why because in this case for example

1100
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,599
these folks from uh urban community in

1101
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,520
our region

1102
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,880
came to the farm bought the chickens at

1103
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,200
eight dollars uh

1104
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,000
and then processed them because we have

1105
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,920
equipment that they

1106
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,520
can use we took all of the byproducts

1107
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,079
put it back into the

1108
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,560
layering composting systems that we use

1109
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,760
we are

1110
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,800
able to utilize 100 of the chicken but

1111
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,920
more importantly

1112
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,480
these families who have traditionally uh

1113
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,720
use

1114
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,599
the whole chicken they understand that

1115
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,640
the value

1116
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,800
of the chicken isn't in the breast it's

1117
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,680
actually in the thigh the dark meat and

1118
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,400
especially

1119
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,800
the medicinal value is in the giblets so

1120
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,800
the heart delivered the gizzard

1121
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,720
all of those parts that i discarded

1122
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,440
that's where most of the value for some

1123
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,880
of us

1124
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,400
is this way they were able to walk away

1125
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,200
with about 30 worth of

1126
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,240
value for each chicken they purchased at

1127
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,440
eight

1128
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,240
and which would have sold you know if

1129
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,319
they had buy

1130
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,359
that chicken in the market they would

1131
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,920
have gotten

1132
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,359
not only uh not only would they have had

1133
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,400
to pay about 22

1134
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,440
22 for that chicken but they would have

1135
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,640
gotten

1136
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,960
about 30 to 35 percent less volume

1137
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,839
in terms of nutritional quality so this

1138
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,480
way

1139
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:23,440
we can actually deliver food that is so

1140
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:27,359
inexpensive keep in mind inexpensive

1141
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,240
naturally is the most most expensive

1142
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,560
food

1143
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,000
in terms of nutritional value delivered

1144
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,800
at the least expensive

1145
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,599
cash value at eight dollars in general

1146
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,880
terms this is

1147
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,599
cheaper um or less expensive

1148
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,440
to a family in the inner city than

1149
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,079
taizen chicken that is going to make

1150
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,319
them sick

1151
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,319
or that or other kinds of chicken that

1152
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:51,359
is actually loaded with

1153
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,079
antibiotics in in in pharmaceuticals of

1154
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,160
all kinds

1155
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,000
and also loaded with exploitation of

1156
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,960
people and pollution of the

1157
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,079
water systems and so on and so forth so

1158
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,160
whichever brand

1159
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,359
is coming out of conventional systems

1160
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,400
out there

1161
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,240
is never going to be able to deliver the

1162
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,880
kind of nutrition that we can deliver

1163
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,440
this way at the cost that we can deliver

1164
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,000
now this

1165
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,040
is a whole different aspect of food

1166
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,599
access thinking

1167
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,200
from a decolonized perspective and yes

1168
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,599
people have to do their part

1169
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,280
these families came to the farm if

1170
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,079
they're not willing to do that

1171
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,599
i don't know how an inner city family is

1172
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,640
ever going to expect

1173
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,400
that high quality nutritious food is

1174
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,760
going to be delivered to them

1175
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,319
at a um affordable price

1176
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,520
uh without having to go back and

1177
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,760
recreate systems of

1178
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,760
subsidies and all of that and remove the

1179
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,359
dignity that comes with regenerative

1180
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,680
being

1181
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,880
so the next layer beyond the farm is

1182
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,520
mobile movements

1183
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,960
we have one of these in in pinewood

1184
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,640
reservation in partnership with my

1185
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,160
coaching agricultural systems

1186
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,480
they can process up to two thousand

1187
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,800
chickens in a day on one of these units

1188
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,480
and the next step again layering the

1189
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,480
scalability of things

1190
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,760
uh we bought a processing facility in

1191
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,520
staceyville iowa

1192
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,960
collectively between all of us in the

1193
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,200
region last year and now is deployed to

1194
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,640
process up to one million chickens and

1195
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,400
then the next layer

1196
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,920
we partnered with the state of minnesota

1197
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,400
and the city of alderley

1198
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,319
to deploy a regionally branded

1199
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,560
regenerative agricultural development

1200
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:27,680
park where we can do up to 10 million

1201
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:32,000
chickens and at least 500 million eggs

1202
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:35,520
and about 14 other products that

1203
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,640
are um generated as part of the poultry

1204
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,359
system

1205
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,200
we've also built a brand it's called

1206
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,480
chilean chicken and now we are deploying

1207
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,760
two inch farms

1208
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,640
this is a collectively owned and managed

1209
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,480
company but this also integrates all

1210
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,800
everything from grain production

1211
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,720
grain processing grain sprouting poultry

1212
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,319
production multi-processing

1213
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,560
all the way to the distribution

1214
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,240
at the end what you really have is fully

1215
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,880
integrated systems

1216
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,440
rather than farms or products and it's

1217
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,599
at this

1218
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,800
level that this system becomes

1219
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,720
regenerative

1220
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,079
the product that comes out of this of

1221
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,920
the system then

1222
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,640
can be regenerative but a single product

1223
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,920
through a

1224
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,680
linear supply chain it simply doesn't

1225
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,160
does the knot up from a horizontal

1226
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:28,640
perspective

1227
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:31,760
so as you go think of this fundamental

1228
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,400
elements of decolonizing all of these

1229
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,319
processes

1230
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,280
management science and systems that we

1231
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:40,319
have put together if you're a farmer

1232
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,280
farm but be a producer no more be a

1233
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,359
steward of energy transformation

1234
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,079
engage money if you're in the financial

1235
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,560
sector that be an extractor of wealth no

1236
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,720
more

1237
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,200
be a partner and allied in building

1238
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,599
collective wealth

1239
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,040
if you work for justice and equality be

1240
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,359
a savior no more

1241
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,560
be an insurgent in your own colonized

1242
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:05,440
world and change from within

1243
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,280
buy food but be a consumer no more be a

1244
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,400
steward of your body

1245
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:18,319
your mind and your spirit and we all

1246
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:21,200
be better off because of it

1247
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:23,119
we have gone through 45 minutes and i

1248
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,920
don't even know if anybody's listening

1249
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,920
so let's check

1250
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,560
i've been listening with great attention

1251
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,079
i i continue to think you're brilliant

1252
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,680
um and

1253
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,040
um i i'm i'm i'm hoping people feel

1254
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,079
sufficiently

1255
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,520
um yeah there's a few comments coming

1256
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,880
into the chat yes people are expressing

1257
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,200
positive

1258
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,040
positive responses i was just trying to

1259
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:55,040
think about how to how to say this

1260
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:59,440
um the bar that you hold

1261
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:03,280
is is so high that um

1262
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:06,319
i think we all can hopefully

1263
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,160
see where we can do better um i think a

1264
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,160
lot of times when you hear

1265
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,200
presentations or or concepts and people

1266
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,920
want to feel like they're part of the

1267
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,720
in-group

1268
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,000
um there's this sort of okay now i'm

1269
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,680
good enough i'm one of these people i'm

1270
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,960
superior i've i've

1271
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:24,480
i've arrived but it's it's so it's so

1272
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:28,400
um it's so comprehensive and so

1273
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:31,200
and so um revolutionary um

1274
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,520
i just i really really appreciate your

1275
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,760
the

1276
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:38,000
the place it comes from and the um

1277
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,520
yeah the call the call the call to rise

1278
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
to that to that level

1279
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:46,400
um so yeah um i'm i'm happy to engage

1280
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,520
engage questions we i mean 45 minutes of

1281
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,520
conversation

1282
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,800
um is probably better if people are up

1283
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,560
for it so

1284
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,160
um i can start with a couple other

1285
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,760
things that have been posted here

1286
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,359
but um anybody who's

1287
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,880
would like to engage with questions

1288
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:04,319
please put them in the q a

1289
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,119
um so roger asked uh what are examples

1290
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,280
of success

1291
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,800
the maori in new zealand that was about

1292
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,160
25 minutes ago

1293
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,440
i think you certainly expressed

1294
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,119
quite profoundly what you're doing with

1295
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,319
the you know chickens in the midwest

1296
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,400
it's really impressive

1297
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,680
um did you say how many pounds that

1298
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,240
eight dollar chicken

1299
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:27,280
was if you did no but it was

1300
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,760
all of our chickens weighed between 3.75

1301
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,760
and 4.25 pounds and

1302
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,440
and in this case that specific picture

1303
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,079
was taken out of

1304
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,800
dress chickens that were four point

1305
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,520
closer to 4.5 because they included

1306
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,359
giblets and

1307
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,800
all of the actual edible parts rather

1308
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:46,400
than just the carcass

1309
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:49,680
so those are four and a half plus pound

1310
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,640
packages and they're certified organic

1311
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,800
or certifiably organic now we are

1312
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,359
certifying because a client is willing

1313
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,200
to

1314
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:59,200
pay the premium for certification but we

1315
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,559
have always been certifiable all of our

1316
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,480
protocols meet

1317
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,240
the certification we always make sure of

1318
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,559
that and then we certify

1319
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,440
when when consumers actually care about

1320
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,839
that

1321
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,640
but the point i want to make is that you

1322
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,800
are able to

1323
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,119
economically produce certified organic

1324
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,359
chicken at two dollars a pound

1325
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,960
i mean for any business for a while

1326
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,880
that's ridiculous

1327
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,240
not to be called somewhere in there i

1328
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,480
mean we're not

1329
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,079
we are because we have we internalize

1330
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,680
all of the costs we're not

1331
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:31,440
we're not dumping any cost on anyone so

1332
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,720
i couldn't give you this specific number

1333
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,079
because right now we are

1334
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:39,359
30 percent higher higher grain values

1335
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:42,640
um so the the price just

1336
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:44,800
significantly changed this uh spring but

1337
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,000
yeah i mean if you talk about afford

1338
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,160
affordably

1339
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,200
affordably producing chicken that is

1340
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,599
free of confinement

1341
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,640
free of antibiotics free of everything

1342
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,839
we don't want

1343
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,839
and full of everything we want uh we are

1344
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:01,119
probably your most competitive chicken

1345
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:02,559
out anywhere the picture behind you is

1346
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,240
i mean exactly what i saw when i went to

1347
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,319
your house that's what it looks like

1348
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,079
they're not in houses they're not

1349
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,599
you know i mean they're not confined

1350
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,760
except by a fence that's something

1351
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,720
of an acre and a half it's it's really

1352
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,119
quite inspiring

1353
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,160
um and i i don't know if people have

1354
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,079
grocked that but i

1355
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,359
i i certainly as someone who's been

1356
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,880
raising chickens for

1357
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:25,440
i don't know 35 years or something um

1358
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,119
you really i feel like i have yeah and

1359
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,599
and think keep in mind that

1360
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,720
our our methodology and our management

1361
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,640
process

1362
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,880
is is is grounded on some very simple

1363
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,559
principles like for example when we

1364
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,240
design something

1365
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,640
we always ask everybody to think about

1366
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,119
it

1367
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,000
from a perspective of being allergic to

1368
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,119
work

1369
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,760
yeah so if you have to work

1370
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,440
find a way not to that's not the point

1371
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,160
we don't want to work

1372
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,000
now if we have to work on something then

1373
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,880
let's make sure that that work is done

1374
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,200
in the more in the easiest most most

1375
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:06,160
pleasant and more enjoyable

1376
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,960
possible way and that those are simple

1377
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,119
things that

1378
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:13,280
have incredibly transformed the way

1379
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,760
we actually operate our farms it's

1380
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,359
actually really enjoyable

1381
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,559
and it's not a putter because that's all

1382
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,680
you're doing because the system's in

1383
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,440
place and you're just doing a little bit

1384
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,480
here a little bit there and it's not

1385
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,240
hard we're not hauling chicken tractors

1386
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,760
across for a few chickens

1387
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,800
we our flocks are 1 500 broilers per

1388
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,400
flock

1389
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,160
and those chickens don't even like

1390
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,280
people because they have never had to be

1391
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,640
close to us

1392
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,760
they are as as naturally behaving as

1393
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,079
possible they got a canopy of trees that

1394
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,319
those hazelnuts produce between three

1395
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,520
and four times more hazelnuts over the

1396
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,680
chickens than on the

1397
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,839
where there is no chickens those basil

1398
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:55,040
nuts are also expressing their full

1399
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:57,359
capacity the ground i mean we had soil

1400
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,559
scientists geologists we had all these

1401
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:00,640
people come out and

1402
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,680
they're like kids in a candy store when

1403
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,800
they come out to

1404
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:07,680
evaluate the soil here so anyway

1405
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,400
that is beautiful there is no need for

1406
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,440
us to be

1407
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,400
stressed out about work or getting up at

1408
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,000
5 a.m every day i mean i don't really

1409
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,640
like that i was

1410
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,359
i was a laborer i grew up in poverty i

1411
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,920
had to work

1412
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,880
from sun up to sundown every single day

1413
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,119
and go home

1414
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,160
still hungry and poor i don't like the

1415
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,000
idea of work

1416
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,760
so if i can avoid it believe me i'll

1417
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,079
avoid it and that probably

1418
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,000
is our greatest competitive advantage

1419
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:35,680
because it just happens that most of you

1420
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
capital on the farm

1421
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,520
goes in this case for poultry goes into

1422
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,880
feed and labor

1423
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,480
yeah um so i just going to

1424
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,319
go back to this question what are

1425
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,680
examples of success and

1426
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:49,359
roger asked about the maori in new

1427
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,000
zealand i don't know if in this

1428
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,480
presentation

1429
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,160
you have you've referred to it um and

1430
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,079
because i've talked to you in the past i

1431
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,079
i think i know what you're saying but

1432
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,200
i mean you in today you also talked

1433
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,760
about the the

1434
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,559
you know the culture in guatemala where

1435
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,920
you grew up

1436
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,680
and how that is still operating along

1437
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,160
these principles and you

1438
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,839
referenced i'm not sure who it was some

1439
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,960
international agency that said 80

1440
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:18,319
of biodiversity on the planet is

1441
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:21,680
um on land where the people living there

1442
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:23,200
are still indigenous in their mindset so

1443
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,240
i mean there's examples of this globally

1444
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,680
but are there things you want to say

1445
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,280
specifically about your experience in

1446
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,760
guatemala or other things

1447
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,640
other models where people can see or

1448
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,760
understand

1449
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:37,359
where this sort of ultimate paradigm is

1450
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,160
is is dominant yeah i know for example

1451
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:41,599
we have

1452
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:43,280
um era and iota those two

1453
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,800
they're not girlfriends they're actually

1454
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,119
two hurricanes

1455
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,000
that hit guatemala honduras and el

1456
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,520
salvador

1457
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,240
last uh the end of last year in october

1458
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,440
now it happens that some of the

1459
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,280
communities we work with

1460
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,119
are so remote and there are so many

1461
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,400
rivers in between and all the bridges

1462
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,599
were taken out

1463
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,880
uh so those communities actually

1464
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,440
reported

1465
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,079
having having just they protected the

1466
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,000
chickens

1467
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,599
and they fed the chickens because that

1468
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,240
was their source

1469
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,880
of at least one egg a day for every

1470
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,119
person

1471
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,160
for a few months while the roads reopen

1472
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,559
and all that

1473
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,520
and it was something that they they they

1474
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,400
could feed them

1475
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,960
herbs they could harvest the forest they

1476
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,640
could do

1477
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,720
so many other things they had so many

1478
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,400
more options because of that that's a

1479
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,520
success story to us

1480
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,359
um we also just launched the regenta

1481
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,400
poultry cooperative in southeastern

1482
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:40,160
minnesota

1483
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:43,119
all led by minority mostly

1484
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,160
you know as hispanic latino um

1485
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,119
african-americans

1486
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,720
and asian uh farmers and then you know

1487
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,400
fully inclusive of a lot of the white

1488
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:53,280
farmers in our region of course

1489
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,040
but you know led by us only because we

1490
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,440
seem to be more connected to that

1491
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,640
indigenousness and these folks were were

1492
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,559
interested in that

1493
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,319
so they join and of course we're

1494
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,720
welcoming them too but

1495
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:06,160
that is another level of success why

1496
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,480
because we have succeeded not

1497
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,480
necessarily because we built a co-op and

1498
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,000
now we're gonna you know we are raising

1499
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,000
one and a million dollars and

1500
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,680
more people will have access to land and

1501
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,079
we've got more more cash flow

1502
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,559
that's not a measure of success the

1503
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:24,079
measure of success for us is the fact

1504
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:27,520
that we are able to liberate about

1505
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:30,480
in this case about 1 million chickens

1506
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,079
from confinement about i know calculate

1507
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,760
how much pharmaceuticals are no longer

1508
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:37,680
going to be part of that

1509
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:40,160
and we are liberating a very large

1510
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,760
network of people who would have been

1511
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,240
enslaved and meet packers

1512
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,880
in other places while having all this

1513
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:49,040
wealth of knowledge and capacity

1514
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,160
those are the success stories for us

1515
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,760
that's how we measure

1516
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:56,720
success now if we break even

1517
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,359
that's like fourth in the list it's

1518
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,640
important

1519
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:01,920
of course but breaking even for us is a

1520
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,640
whole different

1521
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,440
concept i i can't use a regular bep

1522
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,200
formula

1523
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,040
because it doesn't have enough lines to

1524
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:12,160
include all of the value we create

1525
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:15,040
and so as we think of success those are

1526
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,480
those are the the the indicators that we

1527
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,520
are succeeding is when people are

1528
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,559
liberated

1529
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:22,319
from from stationary exploitative

1530
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,040
inhuman conditions

1531
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,680
every person is a success story uh that

1532
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:30,720
comes out of a factory farm or a factory

1533
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,799
meat packer every farmer who instead of

1534
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:35,520
you know being limited and discriminated

1535
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:38,240
against now owns and operates a farm

1536
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,799
uh that they can market where they can

1537
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,599
regret

1538
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,079
grow driven chickens uh that's a success

1539
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,240
story

1540
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,000
every chicken that is now in the market

1541
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,640
that is not coming from a conventional

1542
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,160
system

1543
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:52,960
that's a success story so we have

1544
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,839
so many success stories that uh we will

1545
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,440
need a bonfire

1546
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,040
in some more time to tell you all of

1547
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,799
them but also

1548
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:03,920
we have built a super competitive

1549
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:06,640
uh system level scale solution

1550
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,559
that is also a success story but most of

1551
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,880
the time people start there

1552
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,839
that for us is the total outcome of the

1553
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,680
individual

1554
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,880
success stories that collectively

1555
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,880
aggregated

1556
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,880
uh signify a system level success

1557
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,480
you brilliant and i i would just say

1558
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,720
what is coming to my mind right now

1559
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,280
is the comment you made about you know

1560
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,280
if you're uh

1561
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,760
you know if you're a farmer don't you

1562
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,440
know harvest crops anymore be a steward

1563
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,359
of energy if you're a

1564
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,480
you know you work with money don't be a

1565
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:38,960
um

1566
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,480
extractor you know however you frame

1567
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,079
that i'm sorry i don't have it

1568
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:46,720
um integrated yet into my subconscious

1569
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,359
but i think i mean you made the point

1570
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,559
about

1571
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:52,640
um how we the people are

1572
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,000
actually giving our power to the

1573
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,280
corporate system

1574
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,400
you know by purchasing these products

1575
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,839
and and you know and we and we can we

1576
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,640
can give it and we can take it away i

1577
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,839
think

1578
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,599
you know from some foundational

1579
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:06,480
perspective the responsibility that each

1580
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,240
of us has

1581
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,760
in how we choose to engage the supply

1582
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,240
chain is

1583
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,680
the way the world has changed and you

1584
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,040
know it's it's great to have these

1585
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,280
philosophical conversations

1586
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,559
and sort of hopefully be inspired and

1587
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,040
and you know

1588
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:23,040
um you know insights are coming to you

1589
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:26,480
but but but walking the talk

1590
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:29,760
thereafter um you know for all of us

1591
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:32,240
is is uh you know

1592
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,400
i think we need to be grounding this so

1593
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,079
just to just uh just to make that point

1594
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,200
um not sure if you want to say anything

1595
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,839
about that before i go to the next

1596
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,280
question

1597
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:44,000
oh also how how actually easy it is

1598
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,200
now i came to this country in 1993

1599
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,839
technically

1600
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,040
and immediately after i arrived i made

1601
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,280
contact with farmers

1602
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,640
i made contacts with grocery stores that

1603
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,200
sold organic

1604
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,079
products and all of that and i think

1605
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,359
since

1606
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:02,799
i lived here from since 1993 forward

1607
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:05,040
i have never given profits

1608
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,920
to conventional corporations in the food

1609
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:10,319
sector

1610
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:14,559
beyond basis and if they have a role

1611
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:16,880
maybe emergency basis and you're hungry

1612
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,559
for a rental car and i i am not

1613
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,040
malnourished i am not unhealthy i

1614
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:21,599
actually

1615
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:23,040
all i am well nourished and healthy and

1616
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,960
mentally healthy which

1617
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:27,440
took a long time to get to because of

1618
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,760
the consequences of the war and all that

1619
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,280
but

1620
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:34,319
yet i totally

1621
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,720
totally believe and i have

1622
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:37,599
i am proof that everything i laid out

1623
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,799
for you

1624
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:43,359
is not only possible it is better

1625
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:45,280
when you do that because you do achieve

1626
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:47,359
the full expression of yourself

1627
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,280
and who on this earth doesn't want to be

1628
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:51,520
the full expression of themselves

1629
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,720
yeah beautiful now if you don't want to

1630
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,880
that's fine dan

1631
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,960
uh don't be but i am trying to

1632
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,520
i'm just kidding your your passion and

1633
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,079
vitality is is infectious it's it's hard

1634
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,200
it's hard

1635
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:07,119
i'm going to proceed forward here with

1636
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,799
some questions chris

1637
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:10,240
says reggie i'm completely intrigued by

1638
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,839
your discussion of organizational models

1639
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,319
for creating collective value

1640
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:15,920
and collective impact at multiple scales

1641
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:17,359
where would you point us to learn more

1642
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,839
about the details of designing these

1643
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:22,880
types of organizations

1644
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:26,480
oh boy um there is

1645
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:30,160
actually anybody in the group

1646
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:32,480
is part of the food the farm

1647
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,520
forum for the future good form for the

1648
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,440
future um

1649
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,280
organized by this organization out of

1650
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,400
england because

1651
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,359
she actually just sent a whole list of

1652
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,359
resources

1653
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:45,760
answering that very question because i

1654
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:49,119
actually never cared to look around

1655
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:51,920
very much so i was going to

1656
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,119
maybe i should just send it to you um

1657
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,520
and then you can

1658
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,799
distribute to some of those people if

1659
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,319
you can find a link and post it in the

1660
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,480
chat then everybody

1661
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:01,839
i always uh it's a whole pile of them

1662
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,240
but let me um

1663
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:05,839
let me just um look for it while while

1664
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:09,520
we take all the questions

1665
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:09,520
okay um

1666
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,680
somebody already just put it on here shy

1667
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:18,079
originated farm

1668
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:18,079
just put to the panelists looks like

1669
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,400
oh okay so see if um if you can see the

1670
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,200
last

1671
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,400
update that the director out of england

1672
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,680
sent out

1673
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:33,920
uh was talking about the um

1674
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,920
the this resources uh

1675
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,359
on secular economy collective collective

1676
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,880
management

1677
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:40,559
and so on and they're not calling it

1678
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,480
what i call it but

1679
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,440
that doesn't matter the name doesn't

1680
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:48,319
matter it's the outcome

1681
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,520
all right um greg asked um well says you

1682
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,240
are going forward with tree range

1683
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,000
chickens

1684
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,680
how can we do the same in our own areas

1685
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,599
in this case southern california or can

1686
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,880
we join your collective

1687
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:02,799
yes no it's a very very

1688
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:06,559
methodically structured takeover plan

1689
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:11,839
literally so the way we operate

1690
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:11,839
is it's pretty simple you have to go to

1691
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:20,000
go to that link region poultry.com

1692
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:23,359
um get in touch with us what we'll do is

1693
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,319
instead of us taking our chicken to you

1694
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:26,880
we will work with you as an operating

1695
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,960
partner

1696
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,880
and then you build a system like the one

1697
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,119
we built in southeastern minnesota

1698
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,079
in your own region so those operating

1699
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:35,440
partners

1700
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,559
have a high level of business

1701
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,880
development and ecosystem management

1702
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:41,839
responsibility

1703
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,200
but we will transfer all of that to you

1704
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:45,119
and it will take a little bit

1705
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,040
it will be slower at the beginning it's

1706
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,520
not like just setting up chicken coops

1707
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,760
and

1708
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,880
and processors and all of that those are

1709
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,960
important but

1710
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,440
if you start from there then you just

1711
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:58,559
flip back into that colonizing mentality

1712
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:02,000
yeah so so it's critical that we

1713
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:04,960
that we um we talk about it offline

1714
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,240
we have a methodology a process and an

1715
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,799
organic way

1716
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,400
for building regional systems and then

1717
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:13,520
our goal is to build at least

1718
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:17,119
one regional system per state in the

1719
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,960
all of the 48 continental um um

1720
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,119
territory of the united states the 48

1721
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,880
states so once we do that

1722
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,240
the goal is to reach at least five

1723
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,039
percent of the total

1724
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,000
eggs and burials that are consumed

1725
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,640
technically

1726
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,960
we consume about 20 chickens and 20

1727
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:36,160
dozen eggs a year in this country

1728
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,079
we want us as an ecosystem as a national

1729
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,680
ecosystem of free-range farmers

1730
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,960
to capture one of the egg a dozen eggs

1731
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,839
and one of the chickens

1732
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,720
as a pivoting point to tip over and then

1733
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:50,400
from there

1734
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:53,920
actually scaled to more regenerative

1735
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:56,880
levels brilliant um okay

1736
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,960
dara asks uh when are prices going down

1737
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,720
for families with three four and six

1738
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,119
kids dozens of eggs a week at six

1739
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,960
dollars per dozen is out of reach

1740
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,640
premium pricing is a huge barrier that

1741
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,839
scares off support i think we talked

1742
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,359
about this with your

1743
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:11,200
pounds dollars per pound on the on the

1744
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:11,839
chicken itself but are you selling your

1745
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,200
eggs at six

1746
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:16,000
six dollars a dozen no that's what

1747
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,280
retailers

1748
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,119
sell them up so basically we also have a

1749
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,839
dysfunctional system

1750
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:26,400
that increases the cost of of the goods

1751
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:29,119
unnecessarily in some cases

1752
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,000
necessarily in others some farmers are

1753
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:32,000
are

1754
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,359
increasing the cost of their eggs and

1755
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,799
chickens because

1756
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:36,960
because honestly they are working too

1757
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:38,480
much and yeah i don't want them not to

1758
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,200
be paid for their

1759
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:43,680
for the work they're doing but for the

1760
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,480
most part we have found that we can

1761
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:48,880
we can raise a flock for example on down

1762
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,119
to 80 hours per flock

1763
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,440
when you know some of the farmers are

1764
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:55,839
using up to 300

1765
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,680
hours to flock and that's not we

1766
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:59,839
shouldn't burden the consumer

1767
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,280
with that artificial cost that we are

1768
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,400
incurring because we are not being

1769
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,359
intelligent about

1770
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,480
how we manage our own you know labor so

1771
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:08,000
that's one way

1772
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,599
it's a criticism but also an

1773
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,640
encouragement to think

1774
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:14,960
deeper second um when

1775
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,319
you know we can produce a dozen eggs for

1776
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:20,319
about a dollar ninety

1777
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:23,119
uh organic certified in up to 2025

1778
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:23,920
when it is actually very uh expensive to

1779
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:26,319
raise them

1780
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,839
whether it's because it's dry or because

1781
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:30,480
the feed went up

1782
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:31,039
uh or so and or we had an incident we

1783
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,240
lost

1784
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:35,359
chickens whatever the case may be so but

1785
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,880
at that price

1786
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:41,280
the egg is very affordable still now

1787
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,160
i know not everybody can access direct

1788
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,039
to from the

1789
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,880
from the farmers but because we are

1790
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:49,839
building these farms across the

1791
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:52,480
landscape the idea is that eventually

1792
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:53,359
people will have access directly to the

1793
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,520
farms

1794
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:57,200
uh so that this eggs don't have to go

1795
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,920
through their supply chain

1796
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:00,960
and become triple their value their

1797
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,880
their cost

1798
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,000
so that's one way to solve this the

1799
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,960
other way is

1800
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,760
to really operate collectively at such a

1801
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,520
scale

1802
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,119
that we can move that product without

1803
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:13,200
artificially increasing

1804
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,240
the cost out of inefficiencies in the

1805
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,079
supply chain

1806
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:18,400
i mean the conventional system raises

1807
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,880
the price because they want more profit

1808
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,240
so you know those those organic

1809
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,000
confinement eggs

1810
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:26,319
they don't have to sell at four and six

1811
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,880
dollars they're just making a killing on

1812
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,799
it

1813
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,400
now in our ecosystem collectively

1814
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:32,640
governed and managed

1815
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,319
you know we can be partners all the way

1816
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,799
from consumers to the farmers

1817
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:38,559
and we can all do better and including

1818
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,680
consumers paying only half of what they

1819
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,559
would normally be paying

1820
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,039
and still farmers having a decent living

1821
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,119
and not

1822
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:47,280
in an honorable way of retiring and so

1823
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:48,799
on so yes that that's the way to

1824
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,119
organize this but

1825
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,799
but it will take some significant

1826
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,760
intellectual insurgencies and

1827
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:57,280
more regional uh regional capacity like

1828
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,119
the one we're building in the

1829
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:01,039
bordering region of minnesota i will end

1830
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:04,000
wisconsin

1831
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:05,680
and to be consumers no more as you said

1832
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,880
to not just see yourself as someone who

1833
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,240
goes to the store but actually take

1834
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,559
responsibility for

1835
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:12,079
reintegrating i mean into the process

1836
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:14,400
and that's that's part of it is

1837
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,760
as long as you're colonized in that in

1838
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,119
that framework that's probably what's

1839
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,839
going to be your experience

1840
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:21,119
so that's i mean i've i got my rant

1841
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,240
about occupying the land and not

1842
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,599
everybody has to be a farmer i

1843
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,440
understand but

1844
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:27,119
you know i think a lot of these

1845
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,920
solutions only occur

1846
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,200
as we deepen our relationship with the

1847
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,839
environment and nature

1848
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,799
and community um we can't we shouldn't

1849
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:37,760
expect them

1850
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:40,000
to sort of come sort of magically it

1851
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:43,920
only comes through

1852
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:46,079
engagement uh bill and jay asked

1853
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,960
are the hazelnuts for chickens to roost

1854
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:50,640
human food or feed

1855
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,160
the chickens don't roost on the

1856
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:55,280
hazelnuts um

1857
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:57,280
we have made sure of that um by

1858
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,920
trimming the bottom branches if they

1859
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,559
start doing that they destroy the plant

1860
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,079
and

1861
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,880
the hazelnut is very happy to have the

1862
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:08,000
chickens under but not on top

1863
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:11,760
uh they do better uh the the other thing

1864
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,079
is hazelnuts are a precious product so

1865
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,520
we

1866
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,119
if we don't have to feed it to the

1867
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,520
chickens we don't

1868
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:19,680
uh we harvest them out of the trees and

1869
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,480
it's a product that needs to be roasted

1870
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,520
and processed

1871
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:25,520
so it can be food grade uh even if it's

1872
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:29,119
coming from the chicken paradise

1873
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:32,079
now the um as we scale up

1874
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,760
uh hazelnuts yes we are thinking of it

1875
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,440
as animal feed

1876
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,920
but not for the chickens see the

1877
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:41,280
chickens um technically they don't

1878
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:44,240
truly appreciate this kind of gourmet

1879
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,079
food so and we can feed them many other

1880
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,799
things on the on instead what we are

1881
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,680
doing is

1882
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:51,119
developing another line as we increase

1883
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,200
the production of hazelnuts

1884
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:55,280
and we're going to be producing a

1885
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:58,480
hazelnut and acorn finish finished

1886
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,480
three-range pork

1887
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,880
nice and they also provide shade i think

1888
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:05,359
is one of the key

1889
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,480
and protection from airborne predators

1890
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:09,280
right yes now the

1891
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,039
the hazelnut has evolved over millions

1892
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:14,160
of years probably

1893
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:16,159
um in its own ecosystem right so they

1894
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,480
for example the hazelnut can harvest up

1895
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:19,199
to

1896
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:20,239
300 pounds of nitrogen per acre the root

1897
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:23,279
system sprawl

1898
01:08:20,239 --> 01:08:26,000
up to 15 feet in in you know from the

1899
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,719
you know was seven and a half feet in in

1900
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,159
um

1901
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:32,080
radius from the trunk of the tree uh

1902
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:33,279
harvests about eighty percent of his of

1903
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,960
its energy

1904
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:36,480
within the first eight to twelve inches

1905
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:39,440
of soil and so

1906
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:40,080
it literally is an inverted umbrella to

1907
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,600
capture

1908
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:45,920
especially baltimore and so it's it's uh

1909
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,640
phenotypical characteristics also

1910
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,960
evolved to attract birds to their trunks

1911
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:53,839
so that they can attract the manure and

1912
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,719
so just similar to aronia attracting the

1913
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:57,120
buffalo

1914
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:58,880
and the deer to the wallows in the in

1915
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,520
the great plains so that they could

1916
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,199
thrive

1917
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,920
same thing the hazelnut did the same

1918
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:06,239
thing and he became extremely smart

1919
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,359
at doing this and so the chicken

1920
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:09,759
naturally

1921
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:10,880
recognizes this the hazelnut recognizes

1922
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,040
it and then they

1923
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,880
come become a community there and they

1924
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,880
become you know so they feed on each

1925
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,520
other so the hazelnut produces a

1926
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,560
very thick canopy no hawk can see

1927
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,679
through that

1928
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,799
and also it sprawls over you know in an

1929
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,400
umbrella like

1930
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:28,319
because that's what the chicken needs in

1931
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,640
order to conglomerate in there

1932
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,719
and then guess what i'm scared chicken

1933
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:35,040
because a hawk is going on over

1934
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:36,400
is what they do right after they run

1935
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:39,440
over and stop

1936
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,000
they poop so this is not coincidental

1937
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,279
this is

1938
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,159
all magnificently designed and so all we

1939
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:47,440
are doing is

1940
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:50,880
reading it learning from it developing

1941
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:52,960
our our indigenous intellect by using

1942
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,920
this innate intelligence we were given

1943
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,239
at birth

1944
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,480
and as a result of that we see all of

1945
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:59,600
that 95 percent of innovations that we

1946
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,199
can bring about

1947
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,640
because we are not here to colonize the

1948
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:04,159
space when you colonize

1949
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,000
you operate on five percent of your

1950
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:08,480
capacity when you decolonize

1951
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
you access the other 95 percent not only

1952
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:12,640
of the landscape capacity

1953
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,440
but of your own capacity in your brain

1954
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,760
capacity

1955
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,719
your physical capacity it's just

1956
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,880
magnificent

1957
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:20,480
that is the story of the aston martin

1958
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,159
and the chicken

1959
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,239
wonderful and i just want to bring up i

1960
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:25,760
mean as when i walked around your farm

1961
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:26,800
and saw what was going on it wasn't just

1962
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,880
hazelnuts

1963
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,040
you had you know comfrey and other

1964
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,920
things that were also critical

1965
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,960
ingredients in the in the paddock so i

1966
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,760
mean i'm not sure if you want to share

1967
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,760
any of those

1968
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,120
specific details for people but one of

1969
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,679
the other things that was also

1970
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,320
interesting to me was you said certain

1971
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:44,640
plants

1972
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:46,640
don't like chickens underneath them like

1973
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,760
apples and peaches

1974
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,000
that was nothing i'd never known before

1975
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,040
i

1976
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,920
you know growing up we had the chickens

1977
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,480
in chicken tractors in the orchard or in

1978
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,040
paddocks

1979
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,000
in the orchard underneath fruit trees

1980
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,880
and you said that's really is

1981
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,440
counterproductive

1982
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,400
so any any moment of insight on that

1983
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:07,840
topic which

1984
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:09,040
i don't know think of it this way every

1985
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,199
organism

1986
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,400
has a blueprint that is seeking to

1987
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:14,960
accomplish

1988
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,159
so whether it's or a nutritional

1989
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,400
blueprint

1990
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:19,440
or in the case of northern climate for

1991
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,760
example

1992
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,560
deciduous trees drop their leaves that's

1993
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,719
a blueprint

1994
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,640
they are embedded with and they need

1995
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:27,920
certain conditions in the environment to

1996
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,440
achieve those

1997
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:34,719
those steps in their process of living

1998
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:38,880
so apples for example

1999
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:41,520
the the that whole family

2000
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,880
or the whole species or what you call

2001
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,400
genus

2002
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:48,480
requires an amount of cold hours

2003
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,080
the plant has to accumulate a certain

2004
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,239
number of cold hours

2005
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:54,560
in the root system especially in order

2006
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:55,520
to set fruit to hold it to develop it

2007
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,000
and to

2008
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,199
reproduce and so what happens is with

2009
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,679
the broilers

2010
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:03,360
the broilers conglomerate under the

2011
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,880
trees because that's where the shade is

2012
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,320
and that's what they get protection from

2013
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,920
the predators right

2014
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,920
now the other thing that happens as a

2015
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,159
result of that is that

2016
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,440
they lay on the ground and because they

2017
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:16,400
don't sweat

2018
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,199
uh they the way they cool off is by

2019
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,840
sprawling

2020
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:21,840
and releasing the heat to the cool

2021
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,320
ground under the shade which is around

2022
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,679
70

2023
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:28,080
72 74 degrees on an oval basis

2024
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,440
now if their temperature out there is

2025
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,600
say 90 degrees

2026
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,760
and the temperature of the um the

2027
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,920
chicken body is 98 degrees the

2028
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:39,520
temperature of the soil is 70

2029
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:42,560
or 72 within the next two three days

2030
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,760
and then forward from there the ground

2031
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,440
level temperature

2032
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,000
below the chicken breast when they're

2033
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:51,280
laying there is going to rise upwards of

2034
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:54,080
86 degrees and that's beyond

2035
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,719
what the apple in this case needs in

2036
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,199
order to

2037
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,000
cold on and accumulate it it's called

2038
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:00,400
ours

2039
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,280
and so i mean i learned about cold hours

2040
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,000
in agriculture

2041
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,960
school and so when somebody told me in

2042
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,560
guatemala right

2043
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,320
when somebody told me here that it was

2044
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,440
the chicken minor that was causing the

2045
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,120
problem i said

2046
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:13,199
i don't think so because there isn't

2047
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:15,120
enough defecation in there

2048
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:16,320
to actually affect the tree in any case

2049
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,560
it would benefit it

2050
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,400
oh no because it heats up well i took

2051
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,760
the temperature readings and no it was

2052
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,920
not heating it up

2053
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,880
but it did heat up when the chickens

2054
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,120
were laying

2055
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,400
under so once we isolated that factor

2056
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,640
that's when we learned

2057
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,600
yeah certain trees uh certain fruit

2058
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,159
trees that we

2059
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,280
cut those requirements they will not do

2060
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,960
well so

2061
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:39,360
knowing the phenotypical and the

2062
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,440
genotypical characteristics

2063
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,400
and the environmental requirements of a

2064
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,800
species is

2065
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,800
central so that you can reconcile the

2066
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,000
behavior of animals and this is the

2067
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,640
black applicable

2068
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
not just to the broilers but also to

2069
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,840
sheep and cows and

2070
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,239
and all kinds of other livestock it's

2071
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:59,120
called indigenous intellect for a reason

2072
01:13:56,239 --> 01:14:01,040
and so the next step for us was to test

2073
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,840
egg layers because egg layers don't sit

2074
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,960
around

2075
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:08,239
and so the apple trees took off again

2076
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:11,440
that is the story of the chicken

2077
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:13,440
the broiler and the apple tree and that

2078
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,840
applies to a pear tree and a cherry tree

2079
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,040
and

2080
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,840
a peach tree possibly i didn't try them

2081
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,480
on the pears

2082
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,840
but i know that if they require the same

2083
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:24,880
which i think they do

2084
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:27,600
yeah then yes okay yes and even even

2085
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,320
wild plums had the same exact response

2086
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,520
yeah

2087
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,320
i think that's very interesting and it's

2088
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,320
not the kind of thing you would think

2089
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:34,320
about but i'm sure it's part of

2090
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,360
the the deeper training that you provide

2091
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,600
people so

2092
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:39,520
um for whatever it's worth i you know i

2093
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,520
was totally

2094
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,880
like five times now impressed going to

2095
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,960
see your operation

2096
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,480
um all right we've got about 15 minutes

2097
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,320
left and eight nine

2098
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:50,000
let me see if i can move through a few

2099
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,960
of them um have you looked at black

2100
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,719
soldier fly

2101
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,280
feed to cut some of your grain costs to

2102
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:58,239
recycle some food waste

2103
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,199
no but we hope somebody in our ecosystem

2104
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:01,840
does that

2105
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,719
um bottom line i don't want to do that

2106
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,400
work

2107
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:09,199
um honestly but i understand the value

2108
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,600
i basically you know listen to one of

2109
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:11,840
those

2110
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,520
innovators at a big forum in san

2111
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,120
francisco and i thought

2112
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,719
well that would be an amazing

2113
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,239
opportunity for for

2114
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,719
an entrepreneur to come into one of

2115
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:22,719
these ecosystems and set up a

2116
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:24,080
black soldier fly operation so that we

2117
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:26,960
can do exactly

2118
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,000
that but the way we see these solutions

2119
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,159
is not

2120
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,920
i am it's not on a farm level i don't

2121
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:34,000
want to do that on a farm level

2122
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,440
when we implement something it's because

2123
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,440
it works for the whole

2124
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,480
the whole collective and if something

2125
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:41,199
doesn't benefit the

2126
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,480
collective uh then we don't do it so

2127
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:45,199
that's why

2128
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:46,719
grain is the same thing until we knew

2129
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:48,800
that we had enough throughput

2130
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:50,640
we didn't get into that now this year we

2131
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,640
incorporated a grain elevator because

2132
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,120
now we can incorporate the farmers too

2133
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:57,440
so same thing with these other options

2134
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:59,360
we want an entrepreneur to emerge

2135
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,960
that entrepreneur then goes and figures

2136
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,960
out how to do this part

2137
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,640
and then the ecosystem comes in to

2138
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,800
ensure that we embrace that

2139
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,800
entrepreneur and then solder flies

2140
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,080
become part of our ecosystem

2141
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,560
but that is that the colonized

2142
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:15,040
management process right there for you

2143
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,239
well i mean i think the the idea is if

2144
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,239
there's food waste

2145
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:19,600
and it can be used to produce blood

2146
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,000
shoulder fly larvae that would

2147
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,520
potentially

2148
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,040
be a a food source for the chickens

2149
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,159
which could easily be applied across the

2150
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,960
ecosystem

2151
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:30,000
um oh yeah from uh from a purely you

2152
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,640
know biological

2153
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,239
and you know purely scientific

2154
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:37,040
perspective i think it's an

2155
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:38,640
awesome option um we just need to be

2156
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,840
able to organize it properly from an

2157
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,960
entrepreneurial and management

2158
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,679
perspective

2159
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,640
cool all right cal asks how do you

2160
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:48,080
operate in the winter

2161
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:50,800
layers or broilers taking a winter break

2162
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,760
with rollers we take a winter break um

2163
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,800
with um

2164
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:57,040
and that's why we are setting up new uh

2165
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,040
regional collectives so we just started

2166
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,560
the collective out of omaha

2167
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,400
and we hope we can find an operating

2168
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,040
partner down in

2169
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:06,080
in oklahoma so we can set the southern

2170
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:09,360
collective

2171
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,800
and that way we can produce uh broilers

2172
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,360
year round without ever having to

2173
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,400
produce

2174
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:15,679
in the north uh because we will have

2175
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,960
partners everywhere

2176
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:20,960
the egg layers however is different we

2177
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,880
we keep them in the winter so the design

2178
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:26,239
of the coops the processes

2179
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,640
everything is it's almost like yeah it

2180
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:29,120
is

2181
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,480
completely different animals between egg

2182
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,239
layers and broilers

2183
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:35,280
so just to give you an idea the egg

2184
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,600
layer has a solarium system the solarium

2185
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,400
is

2186
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,719
passive solar the passive solar allows

2187
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,480
us to we focus on heating the ground

2188
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,760
as we heat the ground then we can sprout

2189
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,080
grains in the winter

2190
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,199
we can then sprout grains in artificial

2191
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,920
settings and then

2192
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:52,400
freeze that grain and use that frozen

2193
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:55,040
grain as a way to absorb extra

2194
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:56,719
nutrition from nutraceuticals like

2195
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:59,679
elderberry syrup and

2196
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:00,480
and garlic and onion mixtures with

2197
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,920
comfrey

2198
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,080
extracts and all kinds of things like

2199
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:07,199
that to germinate them

2200
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:10,480
to germinate so sprout the grain before

2201
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:12,800
we freeze it outside and bring it back

2202
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:15,360
into the solariums but then it defrosts

2203
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,360
and as it defrosts then it rehydrates

2204
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:19,440
the whole system of the chicken

2205
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,880
and those those agronomics and

2206
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:23,040
managerial practices

2207
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,040
allows us to eliminate all of the

2208
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,719
artificial manipulation of light

2209
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,800
and everything else and keep the

2210
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:30,159
efficiency at about 85

2211
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,159
during the winter months and the

2212
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:35,120
chickens happy even though we can't let

2213
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:38,080
them out into the open fields

2214
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:39,280
yeah i hope people understood what you

2215
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:42,640
just said that was

2216
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:44,560
it's very impressive um uh

2217
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,080
jarrah asks again or she was we had

2218
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,640
talked about the six dollar a dozen eggs

2219
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,080
she said

2220
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:50,400
the sustainable farmer that delivers

2221
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:53,600
charges six dollars a dozen for eggs

2222
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:56,480
and 15 a pound for kosher chicken so

2223
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,760
that's obviously hopefully they're

2224
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,719
making good money there

2225
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:01,679
um it's a pretty high price yeah yeah if

2226
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:03,679
they are not

2227
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:05,760
um they're just giving it away to

2228
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,480
someone else that's that's the way i see

2229
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,760
it and

2230
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,199
i don't think there is necessarily

2231
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,239
something wrong about it i mean if they

2232
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:12,800
are paying

2233
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:14,000
an immigrant worker a much higher salary

2234
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,120
because of the fact that they are

2235
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,520
selling that egg

2236
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:19,840
at a much higher price well then let's

2237
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,640
all celebrate that

2238
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,159
but if they are wasting it and buying um

2239
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,880
you know machines and diesel and

2240
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,120
gasoline

2241
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,320
and something that extracts the value

2242
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,800
from that supply chain

2243
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,600
well then this be it's been smarter

2244
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,120
about it

2245
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,719
the basic point is it doesn't need to be

2246
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,000
that much right there's there's ways of

2247
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:38,880
doing it much more economically

2248
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,840
but yeah oh yeah direct sells i mean we

2249
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:43,760
can do well

2250
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:46,960
at about 350 to 4 a dozen egg

2251
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:48,719
um you know and that's the wholesale

2252
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:52,239
value we are charging

2253
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:53,760
um for actually for i i take that back

2254
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:56,800
the pound of chicken

2255
01:19:53,760 --> 01:20:00,880
um so yeah three

2256
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:04,719
times um well yeah about 15 bucks

2257
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:08,080
16 bucks per chicken yeah

2258
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:09,199
um okay um dear asks again john kemp

2259
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,639
mentioned that general mills is

2260
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:12,560
transitioning farmland to sustainable

2261
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:15,280
practices how do you feel about that

2262
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,480
corporations changing well if they are

2263
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:19,280
doing that

2264
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:20,560
and it is sustainable let's celebrate

2265
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,800
that too

2266
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:25,040
um corporations have an important role

2267
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:29,040
to play in regenerating the planet

2268
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:32,800
um but also remember that

2269
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:34,000
like i said before the most corporations

2270
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:37,120
are ran by people who

2271
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:40,159
don't give much of a value to feeding us

2272
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:42,800
into community well-being and health and

2273
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:44,239
all of that fortunately for us it's a

2274
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:47,520
very small minority

2275
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:49,440
so if general mills is

2276
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,719
one that is doesn't want to belong in

2277
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,480
that space of

2278
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:54,400
exploitation and extraction and

2279
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,480
destruction of the planet

2280
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:59,600
that's one more on our side of the fence

2281
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,600
and that is always good

2282
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:03,760
now whether they're actually doing it or

2283
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:06,080
not that's what we got to verify

2284
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,440
which now the trust issue is there is a

2285
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,639
real issue here

2286
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,040
i think i've read something about

2287
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:12,560
another there was a was it 15 000 acres

2288
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,400
or 5 000 acres or

2289
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,600
something i'm not sure where it was in

2290
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,360
um

2291
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,040
south dakota that they had taken over

2292
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:22,880
and yeah i think it was

2293
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:25,920
two million acres whatever yeah yeah

2294
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:29,120
yeah i mean you can't you really i

2295
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:31,600
didn't yeah it is laughable because

2296
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:32,719
because that ecology doesn't support

2297
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,920
what they are doing there

2298
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:39,520
so by definition just growing

2299
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,800
oats directly buying them directly from

2300
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,120
farmers that has nothing to do with

2301
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,960
sustainability or resiliency or

2302
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:46,560
regeneration that those are just

2303
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,679
different management

2304
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,760
practices that allows a company to claim

2305
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:53,920
another space and to

2306
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,000
you know build up a little bit more of

2307
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:59,040
that karma with consumers so that they

2308
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:01,360
can push more products down the line

2309
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,080
i mean that's what i see most of the

2310
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:04,320
time but

2311
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,080
hey i don't know the specific story here

2312
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:08,480
somebody can tell it and say

2313
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,280
no this got integrity then let's

2314
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:12,320
celebrate that

2315
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:13,840
but no integrity no celebration greg

2316
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,679
says do you think the healthiest most

2317
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,679
nutrient-dense foods can

2318
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:19,760
should also be the least expensive in

2319
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:22,800
theory and to that point if you're going

2320
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:25,520
to be doing monocultures on 5000 acres

2321
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,320
um you know only producing one crop

2322
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,080
functionally

2323
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,280
increases the the cost of production of

2324
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,400
that crop right it's only when you've

2325
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:32,560
got these

2326
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:34,159
multi-factor systems where you're you

2327
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,920
know cycling cycling energy

2328
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:37,280
and pulling a little bit out here that

2329
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,600
that the

2330
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,719
the actual cost of production goes down

2331
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,800
um yeah

2332
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:44,880
that is correct that's the secularity of

2333
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:47,280
the of natural economics

2334
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,400
and and it is extremely efficient at

2335
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:51,840
producing value

2336
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:55,920
uh value that we can harvest and so

2337
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:58,560
yes now the um the um

2338
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,440
uh nutritional density and the cost and

2339
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,560
all of that

2340
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:06,080
without any fuss right now

2341
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:09,280
we produce nutrients and we deliver

2342
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:11,679
nutrition to consumers at about half the

2343
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:13,920
price of a conventional product

2344
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:14,719
now here's the qualifier dollars per

2345
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,600
nutrient

2346
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:19,040
yeah exactly yeah we are not selling

2347
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,600
pounds of food

2348
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:22,800
we are selling pounds of nutrition and

2349
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,520
from that perspective

2350
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,600
it takes up to seven or eight carrots to

2351
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:30,080
deliver the value of one of our carrots

2352
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,800
now the carrot itself one of our carrots

2353
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,760
may be

2354
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:35,440
two times more expensive than one of the

2355
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:38,080
carrots from the conventional system

2356
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:39,040
but the nutrition in it is about half

2357
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,840
the cost

2358
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,560
of the nutrition that of the that you

2359
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:45,360
will need to

2360
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,960
spend in buying enough nutrition because

2361
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,560
you need about eight of those cheaper

2362
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,560
carrots to get the same nutrition

2363
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,679
so on the nutritional value we are half

2364
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,719
as expensive

2365
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:57,600
yeah brilliant um matt

2366
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:59,440
asks um best guess please how much

2367
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,280
energy can be saved when your model of

2368
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,000
regen farming is compared to an organic

2369
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,159
system

2370
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,280
and a conventional system from fork to

2371
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:08,239
plate

2372
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:09,280
we really don't know we haven't done a

2373
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:12,480
complete

2374
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:15,760
footprint with imprint

2375
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:16,880
mostly because the methodology being

2376
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,600
used actually

2377
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,560
is is not compatible with the systems we

2378
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,400
are deploying

2379
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,159
so the tools are not there to actually

2380
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:26,480
get a full imprint

2381
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:27,520
um i can't tell you that but what i can

2382
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:30,560
tell you is that

2383
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,600
just in general conversations with folks

2384
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:35,120
who do this

2385
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:37,120
day to day like david johnson and folks

2386
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:39,199
like that and even you then

2387
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:41,360
what we have figured out is that we are

2388
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:42,719
not harvesting more than 40

2389
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,639
of the total energy that we are

2390
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:47,360
harnessing in that space

2391
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:48,960
and that by definition means we end up

2392
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:51,760
it's like if you earn

2393
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:54,080
a dollar and then you only needed to

2394
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,600
spend 30 to 40 cents to actually live a

2395
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:58,480
really comfortable life

2396
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,360
and every day you put 70 cents into your

2397
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:02,239
next day's

2398
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,840
pool that's exactly what we're doing so

2399
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:06,320
i'm happy with that equation

2400
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:07,679
um i mean yeah it will come the point

2401
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:09,679
when we need to

2402
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:11,280
figure out the tools that would allow us

2403
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:13,600
to completely measure

2404
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,320
the all of the verifiers of the system

2405
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,080
but

2406
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,360
the problem is we don't have those tools

2407
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,360
right now uh i think

2408
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:21,360
um bio neutral good association is

2409
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:23,440
working on some of those tools

2410
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,280
the instruments are certainly of the you

2411
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:28,480
know the the sort of the colonized

2412
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:29,679
western science you know framework but

2413
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,600
some of those values that you talked

2414
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:32,239
about at the beginning are the happiness

2415
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,520
of the people

2416
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:36,400
and the security and you know stability

2417
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,840
of the culture

2418
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,760
which you know i don't know if they can

2419
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,480
be monetized or captured

2420
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:44,880
in any of those kinds of ways but yeah

2421
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,480
that's a whole different conversation

2422
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,000
and that's why i'm saying we don't have

2423
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:50,639
the tools yeah because

2424
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,719
we we have never built um i mean the

2425
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:53,360
tools we have capture about the same

2426
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:55,440
amount of

2427
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:57,600
what we use of the of the potential of

2428
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:59,280
the landscape is about five percent

2429
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,800
so the tools have been developed to

2430
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,880
measure that five percent but

2431
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:05,040
what about the other ninety-five percent

2432
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,360
we don't know how to measure that yet

2433
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,080
now we know it's there because we can

2434
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:11,280
feel it

2435
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,920
and it actually shows and it's real it's

2436
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,719
tangible

2437
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:16,800
it's enjoyable and all of those things

2438
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,760
and so yeah that's all i need to verify

2439
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,679
that this is good

2440
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:21,679
the rest of it yeah leave it to the

2441
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:22,320
scientists that validated the very

2442
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:24,159
system

2443
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,760
that is wrecking the planet i don't

2444
01:26:24,159 --> 01:26:26,880
think they have the moral authority to

2445
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,480
come and validate

2446
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,920
the incredible benefits that we are

2447
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,920
already generating

2448
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,960
there's a yeah there's various paradigms

2449
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,159
of engagement

2450
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,239
uh just in the last couple of minutes

2451
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:37,920
lenoir asked i'm with you

2452
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:39,520
but given the factors of the way land is

2453
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:41,120
owned by a wealthy few

2454
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,440
laws perpetuate degeneration and

2455
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:44,480
colonization and poverty levels

2456
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,639
i would like to see a practical

2457
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,880
step-by-step insurgency process slash

2458
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:50,560
blueprint of how to transform this local

2459
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,280
global entrenched economic and political

2460
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:53,920
system

2461
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:56,000
to a humane regenerative system come to

2462
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:58,719
your next presentation right

2463
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,120
yes we we do have not a complete

2464
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,880
step-by-step blueprint but believe me we

2465
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,480
probably have as close as it gets to

2466
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,760
building a global intellectual

2467
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:08,800
insurgency

2468
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:10,560
and to and it goes right down to the

2469
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,880
farmer to the consumer

2470
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,159
and the steps we need to take to take

2471
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,800
back the ownership control and

2472
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:18,080
governance

2473
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:21,280
that is the secret and if we can do that

2474
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:24,639
um here's the thing it is so doable

2475
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:26,080
and it is so easy to do uh once you are

2476
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:27,280
convinced that that's what you want once

2477
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:30,000
you become an insurgent

2478
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:31,679
then it's easy the problem is getting

2479
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,199
people from where they are right now

2480
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:35,280
in their position of privilege and

2481
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:37,280
comfort and being willing to be

2482
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:39,920
uncomfortable for a while

2483
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:42,080
and living really in real life so that

2484
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,760
they can experience the real solutions

2485
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,360
and then become enchanted with the

2486
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,560
resolutions to the point that they will

2487
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,920
never go back

2488
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,000
that's the transition but we're gonna

2489
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,600
have the most problems but those folks

2490
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,239
like and i hear this person is probably

2491
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,880
already

2492
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:57,280
on this other side uh there is enough of

2493
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,920
us right now that a global insurgency

2494
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:00,159
now

2495
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,360
is totally doable within the food and

2496
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:03,760
agriculture system

2497
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,480
and if we can just network ourselves

2498
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:07,360
under the

2499
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:08,719
mycelial structures and methodology of

2500
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:11,600
the earth itself

2501
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:13,920
we will replicate the most powerful

2502
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,880
organism on earth which is the mycelia

2503
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:17,920
and that

2504
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:20,719
is our blueprint for the future is

2505
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,280
the mycelial blueprint replicated in our

2506
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:23,440
brain

2507
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:25,040
replicated in the order of the universe

2508
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,600
replicated in the way we have built and

2509
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,239
connected

2510
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:30,000
cities and centers now replicating it to

2511
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:31,920
take over the food system again

2512
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,679
we have done it so many times we just

2513
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,800
don't know we already done it

2514
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:39,760
yeah beautiful um okay

2515
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,480
a couple last little questions uh shire

2516
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,480
um

2517
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:44,239
asks uh what are the first three

2518
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:48,239
ingredients ingredients

2519
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:51,840
of your non-live chicken feed

2520
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:57,600
okay so we have um first of all

2521
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:59,199
high protein um non-live

2522
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,719
i'm guessing i'm guessing what's meant

2523
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:02,800
is like grains versus

2524
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,320
sprouts but i'm not i'm not actually

2525
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:07,760
sure right so

2526
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:08,400
let's put it non-ground okay so

2527
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,760
basically

2528
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:14,159
when you grind grain you are killing it

2529
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,440
so you have deprived it from its ability

2530
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:19,520
to live

2531
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:22,480
and now it becomes mass biomass and so

2532
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:24,239
literally there is no ability for that

2533
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:27,600
organism anymore to

2534
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:28,080
interact because it's dead so what we do

2535
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:31,199
is

2536
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:34,960
in the non-ground up dead

2537
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:38,400
is where we we focus on high protein

2538
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:41,120
low fiber uh forages and so

2539
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:42,239
within that the king of all of them is

2540
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:46,560
country

2541
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:49,360
26 protein only about 10 to 11

2542
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:50,800
fiber and succulent which means the

2543
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:52,400
chickens can roam forever because they

2544
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:54,320
don't have to go back for water

2545
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,760
more than like you know maybe five

2546
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,080
twenty five percent of the time than

2547
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,080
they

2548
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,840
if they were eating dry grain for

2549
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:03,120
example one

2550
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:05,440
two um we look for weeds uh

2551
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:07,760
that are got the same characteristics so

2552
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:10,320
mallow for example lamb quarters

2553
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,679
porcelain all of those are actually

2554
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:14,719
succulent but also

2555
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:15,360
high protein low in fiber we avoid

2556
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:18,639
grasses

2557
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:21,360
all together unless it's just sprouted

2558
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:22,080
so we bring grass seeds in the form of

2559
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,880
wheat

2560
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,880
barley oats and then we sprout them and

2561
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:29,199
we have the chickens roaming in there

2562
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,639
within the first two to three up to four

2563
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:32,639
days after this

2564
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:34,719
the grain sprouts but we don't want it

2565
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:37,280
to grow because the second that

2566
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:39,440
that grain starts to grow a stem it

2567
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,719
completely flips the equation and it

2568
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:43,120
goes high in fiber

2569
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:43,920
low in protein and at that point it rubs

2570
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:48,400
the chicken

2571
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:50,719
of its nutritional needs instead it will

2572
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,760
it works the opposite and when it takes

2573
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:53,440
energy away right

2574
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,920
they sprout what you do is you take the

2575
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:57,920
whole grains you broadcast them out

2576
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,520
in the paddock you cover them with a

2577
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:01,520
little bit of hay and then if it's

2578
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,800
dry out you water them so you're not

2579
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,480
sprouting them in trays

2580
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:06,400
inside and bringing them out to the

2581
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:07,679
chickens you're just broadcasting them

2582
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:10,000
out into the paddock is what i

2583
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:11,760
experienced right it's a whole different

2584
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,920
way of doing things

2585
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:16,000
oh yeah yeah and part of the part of the

2586
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,840
reason we can do this at a scale

2587
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,360
is one because you can just put these

2588
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,679
grain mixes right into your

2589
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,760
tractor spreader and take 600 pounds and

2590
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:27,120
just spread them down the alleys

2591
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:28,960
uh one two it sprays him horizontally

2592
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,960
which means it goes under the trees as

2593
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:34,480
you can see in the in the picture

2594
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:37,840
now three th the the the

2595
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:39,040
the cover crops in the ground they shade

2596
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,960
from the trees

2597
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:43,679
and the amount of organic matter in that

2598
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:45,440
soil means a high level of

2599
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:47,440
humidity in that soil even during

2600
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,960
droughts there is a lot of humidity that

2601
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:51,760
condenses there that means

2602
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:53,199
easy way to sprout and if you're smart

2603
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:55,360
before you get those units

2604
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:56,800
established you can put an irrigation

2605
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,880
system which is what i'm doing now in

2606
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,560
the new farms not for the purpose of

2607
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,760
extracting water out of a system you

2608
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,320
could take drain water

2609
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:06,320
put it into a big pool and then pump it

2610
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,960
and you only have to do a little tiny

2611
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,800
bit

2612
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,400
of that because you already have an

2613
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,600
environment that will preserve and

2614
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:14,000
conserve the water

2615
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,360
anyway and bam you got a massive

2616
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,440
sprouting system and

2617
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:19,199
now i know i'll just tell you this

2618
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:22,000
confidently to all of you

2619
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:22,719
uh two years ago we raised a flock of

2620
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,280
broilers

2621
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:26,239
and we were able to remove the ground up

2622
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:29,360
feed

2623
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:31,520
100 of it for four weeks

2624
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:33,360
and they still mature just five days

2625
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,960
delay than the rest of the chickens that

2626
