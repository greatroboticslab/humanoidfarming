1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,240
is the first day after our horses came

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,219
home we're gonna shoot a morning routine

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,360
we don't even know what our routine is

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,400
yet

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,320
but Sophie and I are gonna do it you

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,420
have to listen to me yeah because I have

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,939
stuff planned out do you have stuff

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,340
Linda we feed them I put honey in our

9
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,019
stalls to eat and then I put Willow

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,119
Chino and let me bring storm out and

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,520
then we put honey back up okay I did not

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,559
catch any of that okay so you guys know

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,600
Sam and Sophie usually do morning chores

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,980
I told Sam stay in bed sleep in as long

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,480
as you want and Sophia and I will do

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,399
chores today because it's only three

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,559
steps from our house

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,360
and because I'm excited to see our

19
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,780
horses so let's go see them I think

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,140
that's the same thing

21
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:54,300
so if you watched our nighttime routine

22
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,280
then this is just basically that but in

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,199
reverse

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,460
we left all the doors open last night so

25
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,460
it'll be nice and cool in here

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,040
today's job I have so many plans for

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,040
today

28
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:13,860
[Laughter]

29
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,380
all right we're gonna let Sophie lead

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,420
because she knows what to do

31
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,159
she knows like but they're kind of

32
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,920
visiting

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,680
so Penny doesn't love any other horse

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,780
ever if she's gonna love if there's any

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,939
horse in this world that she loves

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,579
it's him and I'm praying for a day

37
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,680
they're back together again

38
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,600
here give me storms

39
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,360
wear storms

40
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,520
oh

41
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,280
wow Chino you ate all that hay and you

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,560
pooed he's just staring at his girl he's

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,200
like I don't care about food

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,600
Penny's like I don't care about my food

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,119
while she cares about her food I want to

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,619
see how he did in this stall

47
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,619
did you like it storm

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,460
he

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,000
didn't eat much of his hay pooped in it

50
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,340
drink some water lay down I see some

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,739
some shavings in his tail we'll get him

52
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,580
more savings today

53
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,580
how was it

54
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,440
Chino eat your food man

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,700
so like I said this is going to be open

56
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,280
up eventually we're just gonna like

57
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:41,160
increase the horse's time on grass

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,660
slowly because

59
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,080
I don't want them to go from like 12

60
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,519
hours to 24 hours just like that

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,440
yeah you're

62
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,780
just let her stand right out here I can

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,560
even close this door

64
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,459
oh if she'll go to our food

65
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,019
yeah

66
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,879
that's your food we'll put stalls we'll

67
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,640
put mats in there today we have a lot to

68
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,560
do still

69
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,780
oh yeah she can't get out from here what

70
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,660
the heck and if she gets out she'll just

71
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,800
be in her normal field yeah like even if

72
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,800
you did open that while

73
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,739
I don't know oh yeah I guess because

74
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,500
they're not going to run out and leave

75
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,260
their food watch honey yeah

76
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,019

77
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,580

79
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,400
so we are watching them on the cameras

80
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,500
last night everybody seemed happy

81
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,480
everybody seemed fine

82
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,159
we try to keep our routine exactly the

83
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,159
same as we did at the old place

84
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:45,680
I love those doors

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,680
oh my gosh they're stunning

86
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,780
oh

87
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,700
what's happening wait a minute

88
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,739
this is not you get back in there and

89
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,379
eat your food get back in there

90
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,420
I have to close her in

91
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:04,260
oh storm

92
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,060
no get your face away from her butt that

93
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,099
my friends is why they put bars on the

94
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,720
doors

95
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,260
she let Willow out Willow goes with

96
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,260
Chino now

97
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,340
she's coming

98
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,359
we know you don't want to be alone oh

99
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,460
you could probably go out see if I had a

100
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,040
hook here and I had your uh

101
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,160
your rope I could probably lead you out

102
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,440
so being able to do this I'm just going

103
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,440
to use pennies

104
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,280
um like being able to come out here and

105
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,280
see what we need

106
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,600
is gonna help so we definitely need our

107
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,040
a hook on Storm's door

108
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,040
so if you can't catch Willow now

109
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,560
storm no we're not going that way

110
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,580
this is the house of many gates you'll

111
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,259
get you'll get used to it should I let

112
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,180
storm out

113
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:03,120
or not yet

114
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,380
okay because he doesn't isn't in a field

115
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,199
with with

116
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,400
Willow so it won't go bad it won't go

117
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,220
well

118
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,139
storm came right into this farm and put

119
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,419
his butt up against that wood wall and

120
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:18,540
just started scratching

121
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:22,400
wait storm we gotta wait for Sophie

122
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,400
so your plan did not go to plan

123
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,620
our brains are still sleeping it's 7 A.M

124
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,539
or Willow she just wants to be with her

125
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,160
girls and they will be so I've been

126
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:37,320
explaining this to people but this is

127
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,180
going to be their winter field so once

128
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,280
rainy season happens in just a couple of

129
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,139
weeks

130
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,380
and just

131
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,000
so excited poor thing so once rainy

132
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,500
season happens

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,199
um the horses will trample this to death

134
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,580
especially right here and there will

135
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,060
probably be like a little bit of grass

136
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,060
down there

137
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,919
she's still there

138
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,639
uh oh I lost honey oh crap don't ever

139
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,639
leave me in charge

140
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,840
even though he tries to herd

141
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,100
Gracie she's his best friend and you

142
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,840
know what's weird they have the same

143
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,300
personality oh so she just went out into

144
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,560
that little area out there

145
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,150
come on

146
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:34,040
you can go for grass now little mini

147
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:34,040
[Music]

148
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:43,860
push Penny around

149
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,660
[Music]

150
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,780
they're both leaders in their own way

151
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,060
she's she's like a standoffish leave me

152
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,400
alone leader and he's uh

153
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,380
I'm the boss of you

154
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,360
it's kind of oh Penny must be coming

155
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,720
into heat because this doesn't ever

156
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,720
happen

157
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,960
Penny does not get close to

158
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,310
horses and storm always leaves her alone

159
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,520
so something's going on

160
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:18,300
[Music]

161
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,800
you're crazy for saying interesting

162
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,800
story people have been suggesting that

163
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,139
we use this room for a wash doll and the

164
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,000
flooring like when this stuff gets wet

165
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,539
it's a nuisance it gets stuck on

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,940
everything it is

167
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,800
annoying but then someone today said put

168
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,940
mats out here and I was thinking oh my

169
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,940
gosh I don't know how that would be for

170
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,340
winter like in snow and and stuff no I

171
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,080
love the idea so we can put cross rails

172
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,520
out here or we could put cross ties out

173
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,520
here

174
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,500
we could

175
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,660
literally make this into the coolest

176
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,940
washed all ever it would be in out of

177
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,280
the Sun the hoses here we could put a

178
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,960
shelf up there and put all of our

179
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,300
shampoos and all of our stuff out there

180
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,120
for summer like this could be our summer

181
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,240
on our horses I think would love it

182
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,160
anyway it's definitely something that I

183
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,360
think we can do I need to get all this

184
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,639
stuff out of here and that's going to be

185
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,380
a job that I am working on I absolutely

186
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,419
am working on this like

187
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,160
I haven't been for the few last few days

188
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,139
but I'm gonna get it all out all right

189
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,699
so our morning routine also consists of

190
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,020
cleaning up the bar and cleaning up the

191
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,199
Stalls there's a lot of poop everywhere

192
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,539
getting grain ready for tonight throwing

193
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,160
hay for these two

194
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,360
um but I'm not going to show all that

195
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,580
because you guys know what that looks

196
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,159
like because we have more morning chores

197
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,320
to do horses are not our only chore in

198
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,640
the morning so we're gonna do all those

199
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,979
things and then we're going to show you

200
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,020
our next step I do want to say that even

201
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,720
though the horses are home this Barn is

202
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,779
Not By Any Means finished we have like I

203
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,360
want to put up some stands or some

204
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,160
shelving and some hooks so that

205
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,019
everything is Within Reach like Sophie

206
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,240
has her bag over there and it works out

207
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:59,820
perfect there holy heck it is hot today

208
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,620
you guys anyway I want to do all I want

209
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,360
to get it all set up so that it looks

210
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,019
like a barn

211
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,459
step two in morning chores is letting

212
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,320
our goats out but apparently they got

213
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:12,120
out in the night regardless Sophie did

214
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,140
it up

215
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,779
five these Vines will trip you

216
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,700
so clearly they don't need to be locked

217
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,980
up at night they were watching us with

218
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,680
the horses they're like oh I see you

219
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,600
there Ellie be careful

220
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,940
yeah Ellie Don't Go Near them Ellie

221
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,459
tried to leave her in the house she is

222
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,860
so tiny she can sneak right out

223
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:36,060
like we have a whole routine of how we

224
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,740
keep Ellie in the house when we don't

225
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,560
want her out here

226
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,279
she's right staying right with me though

227
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,279
okay

228
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,480
she didn't get trampled she got charged

229
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:51,180
these are your dogs actually because of

230
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,540
Miss Tilly Tilly and Rosie Tilly and

231
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,540
Rosie

232
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,560
so I don't

233
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,080
know how they got out but they got out

234
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,800
hopefully the cat didn't

235
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,500
come on Ellie Center the fence at least

236
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,560
Ellie's gone

237
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,480
hopefully go look and make sure

238
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,580
because they seem very suspiciously

239
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,720
interested

240
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,720
I abandoned Ellie

241
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,160
boy

242
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,680
so see how good he is he like runs free

243
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,000
in the barn all day all night and then

244
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,779
during the day when we have the doors

245
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,120
open we leave them in here we make sure

246
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:38,279
he has lots of food lots of water and

247
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,380
every time we come down to uh do the

248
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,120
goats which is often

249
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,740
um I come down here like 30 times a day

250
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,140
yeah we come down here like 30 times a

251
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,600
day but when we do come down we come and

252
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,339
we visit him we spend time with him we

253
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,440
give him treats today's not my day

254
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,440
today's not my day either I'm grumpy

255
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,800
sorry Sophie

256
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:04,260
so we come and we visit Ollie and we

257
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:07,019
make sure he has lots of food and water

258
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,720
and

259
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:12,959
he's got good he's all good

260
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,700
yeah it's lots of scratches he's

261
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,899
shedding we should get a brush and brush

262
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,899
him he probably really love it

263
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,560
everybody like any was never like that

264
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,060
before so what I wanted to say is that

265
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,560
we moved him from the other Barn where

266
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,920
the dogs are always running in and out

267
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,920
to down here and he is obsessed he loves

268
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,019
this Barn he's so much more confident he

269
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,060
runs free all night long stays in here

270
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,940
during the day I might have to get a fan

271
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:46,320
today it's hot but this Barn is way way

272
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:48,480
cooler than the other Barn

273
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,740
so much happier down here too so much

274
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,720
happier

275
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,920
and like someone said

276
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,600
um he'll take care of like all the

277
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,060
rodents and stuff down in this barn and

278
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,940
then Ellie will take care of them from

279
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:03,420
another barn oh goodness did you tie

280
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,680
this in a knot what the heck did you do

281
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,380
it well you're gonna have to go out

282
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,959
there and get that open

283
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,120
because I do not know what you did grab

284
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:13,680
the scissors there's no scissors in this

285
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,660
Barn we are going to make like a first

286
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,000
aid kit for this Barn

287
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,040
or a kit of things we need we're gonna

288
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,360
get things to hang up down here we have

289
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,360
a lot of stuff that we have to do

290
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,880
not work

291
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,800
to be honest I think leaving them out

292
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,180
leaving that door open all night is

293
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,560
probably a million times better than

294
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,339
them trying to get through the door and

295
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,339
hurting themselves

296
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,660
do you want me to do it

297
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,360
it's not my good day it's not my good

298
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,060
day either

299
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,320
I don't know if you guys can see Ellie

300
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,959
watch on the other side of the gate

301
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,880
Ellie is afraid of nothing

302
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,620
the goats

303
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,240
we give them they even run for me

304
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,980
anymore yeah we give them little bits of

305
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,260
grain to bring them close to us to make

306
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,959
them friendly

307
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,940
she's like I know that when I'm held I

308
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,079
get grained

309
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,720
hi

310
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,100
I think you miss him

311
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,139
so cute we're really careful about how

312
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,820
much cream we give the boy

313
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:23,519
he he's the heaviest like he

314
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,339
he's gonna be neutered soon he's gonna

315
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,839
get fixed really really soon

316
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:30,180
Ellie's out there she came through she's

317
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,399
like I need to get to my mom I try not

318
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,740
to bring Ellie down here because the

319
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,660
goats think that she's put her on this

320
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,420
side of the gate although the door's

321
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,700
open you're okay might I add that all

322
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,920
these chores are done before we even

323
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,380
have breakfast before we're even awake

324
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,820
yesterday I noticed that penny is

325
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,440
definitely unsettled here she doesn't

326
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,260
understand fully like what's happening

327
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,420
and she's nervous and she if she hears

328
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,339
me outside she always puts her body

329
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,500
somewhere where she's close and she can

330
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,339
see me so she often hangs out in this

331
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,160
field

332
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:04,740
or like no matter where I am if I look

333
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,540
out she's close to me last on the list

334
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,399
we haven't even done like actual chores

335
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,800
yet like clean I need to go have a drink

336
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,660
first because it's hot

337
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,279
it's only going to be hot later hotter

338
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,139
later though there are a lot of things

339
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,920
that we still have to finish on our on

340
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:22,440
this area we're still making uh

341
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,940
room for our

342
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,300

night before they're hay they're bedding

359
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:22,339
from the night before and then I dump it

scoops and it's out and then I dump it I

364
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,180

pond the little pool I know that it can

371
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,480
get dirtier than that and be okay for

372
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,820
decks but I like it to be clean I was
