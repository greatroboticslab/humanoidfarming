00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,110
flagged Ripper's those funny little

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,130
emitters that sort of stand up and wave

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,770
hi

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,480
what's the point of those help Rika

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,650
steel here the sprinkler warehouse bro

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,320
let's talk flag drippers

00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,429
[Music]

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,429
[Applause]

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,759
flagged Ripper's are non pressure

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,220
compensating which is a bit of a

11
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:26,259
misnomer all emitters are somewhat

12
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,750
pressure compensating what non pressure

13
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:30,669
compensating generally means is that you

14
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,309
shouldn't use it on a slope of say five

15
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:35,530
feet or more no slope save your money

16
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:37,989
and buy non pressure compensating

17
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,940
emitters such as flag emitters because

18
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:42,100
pressure compensating emitters cost for

19
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,870
of course other than their price tag

20
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,329
there's no real downside to using

21
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,940
pressure compensating back two flags

22
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:50,890
this little thing on top is used to

23
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,899
disassemble the flag so you can clean it

24
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,370
out should it become clogged which can

25
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:55,680
happen especially if there's a lot of

26
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,000
minerals in the water

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,980
despite their resemblance of little

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,190
inline valves turning the flag on top

29
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,960
does not regulate water flow the flags

30
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,270
are often color-coded depending on

31
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,490
gallons per hour the colors of the ones

32
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:13,660
I'm using today are black for one gallon

33
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:15,220
green for two and red for four that may

34
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,830
change depending on the manufacturer

35
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,369
often flag emitters are rated in litres

36
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,470
per hour

37
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:22,119
in that case just remember that there

38
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,070
are roughly four liters to the gallon

39
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:25,900
flag emitters are perfect for a low

40
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,060
pressure system like a gravity-fed

41
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,280
system where some other emitters may not

42
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,530
work so well let's install some in our

43
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,850
system we can install it directly on our

44
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,850
mainline like this

45
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:48,039
or we can run some micro tubing like

46
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,539
this and install it where it's needed a

47
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:52,789
stake will help direct the water where

48
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:54,860
we want it if you do install it this way

49
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:57,350
remember this piece of micro tubing is

50
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,719
now regulated by this flag emitter in

51
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,069
this case it's two gallons per hour you

52
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,509
don't want to install another emitter on

53
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:04,759
the end of this because you've already

54
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:06,560
regulated the pressure back here you can

55
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:17,480
also attach micro tubing to the barbed

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:19,670
like this remember sprinkler Warehouse
