  "text": "[Music] so so with organic pesticide this one you make it with the local available word materials when you're using the organic pesticide if you also cut the water if you have the cost of production because you're not going to spend some other money in buying some other pesticides of that vegetable all you are enemy they are confessed so what you are producing as vegetable is a food for something so that those living organisms we can come and feed on our plant either by sucking the gross almond or by eating the leaves or by eating the fruits and today we are showing you how to control the infestation of pests in our vegetables using organic material organic material meals you prepare it in the absence of kevin there is no chemical component here the whole chemical will come from the solution will act like chemical commercial family for that in the best okay so we want to know how to prepare it locally so that you are able to make sure that you control pests at the reduced cost or at low cost as you maximize profit in your production okay so the materials here are the things that we are going to use these are all available from today when you go back you have to plant aloe vera red pepper you have to plant bread better right now you are producing onions okay if the onion the real bulb is not there you can use the leaves okay onion beans can also work well because of its fungus [Music] sometimes you wonder why people plant flowers around the corner there are some flowers for us something to beautify the hand to make your problem look beautiful but today is not only making your comfort look beautiful it will make your body to look beautiful because when the garden is having pests all over [Music] [Music] organic pesticides for example i have aloe vera here in my hand which is used as a fertilizer because it has ingredients like mathematics potassium and many harvest it also control and many other festive caterpillars beetles and this is a red pepper alpine filling one of the materials used in making our organic persistent in this in this filipina it is when we are using in five liters of water we take one cup of filipinos we found it and we put it in our container milipeli contains the active ingredients which helps in controlling athletes caterpillars and and also beetles and it's called marigold when you using it you get like uh five cups of the leaves how you found it after pounding you put it in your container the marigold are the active ingredients that works on our first like the the caterpillars and the cat worms so they are actually used in controlling those pests in our crops is one of the materials among them and here i'm having neem leaf it works in thing like control of fungus diseases bananas weevils today i'm very very happy because we are learning about how to make organic pesticides in behind here i have tomatoes leaves when you pound it then mix it with other substances that is used in making organic pesticides and it is some it brings some irritation in insects and definitely kills the insect like it helps in controlling face like heartwarm caterpillars and the rest of it so we have many pets that destroyed our crop so this one would help a lot if you're very very proud to be here in a later training institute here is our one of our material for making organic pesticide this is onion balm if you want to make it you can use this one something like seven of them and in absence of that one you can use the leaf something like half of a kilo and this onion tab you can take it to the mortar and then you pound it and from there this one it acts as a repellent also it is it controls what is so-called hand both red and then and then black and not only that one it can also control it can also control army warm and then up it and then cut one also so that is all about the onion thank you in case one of them okay thank you very much in case of one of the materials means maybe you don't have the aloe vera but you have the you have the like the red pepper the red pepper can also work on artists aloe vera can also work on so in the absence of aloe vera you can use that one in the absence of the red pepper you can use that then you can drop one in the oven of the tomatoes [Music] we're going to pound it after pounding we water them when we keep in this container for 3 days after 30 days we're going to see the solution and we use it for again for spraying our crops in depending again the space like caterpillars this is how you are going to pound it if you cannot pound like this you can chop them chop them into small pieces how you chop a green vegetable when you're preparing it so you make sure that the leaves are broken to leave those inner contents to be able to release their uh substance into the water okay so if you have water you can pound like this now we have this one it's already five five handful of the tomato leaves okay we are also going to add it here okay you add it here and then we found what let us found aloe vera aloe vera we can even you can mix all this material all together and you pound at once if you have a bigger motor i get to that so you can put this aloe vera [Music] so you cut the onions we also found all together the onion leaves okay so why are we using onions it's a repellent and it also controls our foods okay then we are going to put we are going to also pound together one cup of red pepper pants carefully you have to be careful otherwise so remaining two onions now the process the process of mixing all these things together and then put add water into it is to allow what is called decoction decoction it means you have taken tea all right the tea leaves is dry but when you put in water after sometimes you find the color of that water change okay it means the solute the material then the component of the tea leaves has gotten into the water and change the color are you getting that so the active ingredients in these materials will get into the water the process of this material this in active ingredient getting into the water is called the option okay so the process of for us to get what we need to control first those active ingredients we must keep it in water for 3 30 days okay so we are going to keep it we are going to stand it in water for feeding days after 3 days we shall see this material and then we get only the solution down there okay that solution has all the active ingredients which will kill different kind of pests so long as we apply onto the on to them okay so it will give us a contact pesticide now you can see this is a mixture of onions red pepper and the aloe vera okay no you have to take care of your option so you pour it here good then now you can put some water there you rinse pour water in the mortar and then you also add it here so i think this one doesn't doesn't deserve only five liters this material is too much let us prepare a solution of 10 liter out of this okay later so the only challenge with the organic materials we do not know exactly what quantity of any active ingredient present in that solution okay that is the problem because we cannot be coming we don't have the machine to determine to detect the amount of decoction or concoction so so you can see now we have put all the material together inside the container okay it is even starting to irritate i am hearing people are coughing it means now our pesticide has started working it is starting to irritate your throat and some of you will start shedding tears okay so now this material is not is more than four five liter okay let us add here ten liter of water it is very concentrated okay i told you that this is a serious organic pesticide okay i can see people are now coughing it means it means the the pesticide has started working it is so irritating it is so irritating such that when you add onto when you apply onto the pest the pest will never survive okay have you measured water so we are preparing a solution of 10 liter okay a 10 liter solution of organic pesticide you can form foreign [Music] so we have looked at the final steps the final step of preparing our organic pesticide okay [Music] you",
