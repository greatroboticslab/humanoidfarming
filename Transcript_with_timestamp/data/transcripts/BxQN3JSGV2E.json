  "text": "good afternoon this is um my name is Henry newfeld I'm head of the climate change unit um at the world Agro forestry Center ikra in Nairobi in Kenya and I welcome you very much to this uh discussion forum organized by erra together with FAO and um while we start going through a quick round of introductions um I hope that there will be more people coming in and uh so that we take as much time as we can for discussions afterwards the title of this uh session is called using climate Smart Technologies to scale up climate smart Agriculture and forget the practices it's a bit of a toogy but and I apologize um climate smart agriculture has had quite a bit of a um let's say it's it's been a very shiny kind of brand coming up um it's managed to unite sort of the development the Agriculture and the climate change communities under one brand and in doing so it's raised a lot of expectations um term has been around for about four or 5 years there are a couple of Publications uh that have been put forward around CL climate smart agriculture what it really is what it could be and um still we lack we still do lack a bit of an understanding of what it could actually do and this session here is uh also meant to bring shed a bit of light on that question um there has been uh a Global Alliance for climate smart agriculture which was launched uh recently at the climate change Summit in September m in the in New York uh there was also there's also an African uh Alliance for climate smart Agriculture and we will also talk about these um two new institutions and what they can potentially deliver uh in resolving issues around food security uh adaptation and mitigation so uh let me just quickly introduce uh our speakers first um we have Alexandre Maybeck who is a senior policy officer uh on agriculture environment and climate change in the office of the assistant director General uh within the FAO then our second keynote speaker is Todd rosenstock who is an agro ecologist with erra and he investigates how smallholder agriculture affects the environment and Society um and then we have panelists here sitting U next to me we have here uh sorry where is she she Lami in I'm sorry I can I I can't get the name right in inua I think is she's a manager for communications and knowledge at feran the food agriculture and natural resources policy analysis network with 21 years of experience in policy research and advocacy uh then we have Martin Bia he's the head of the comprehensive agriculture Africa agriculture development program katup within uh nepad and finally last but not least Austin Tibu uh he's been working as a land resources conservation officer at Malawi's Ministry for of Agriculture irrigation and water for over 10 years and he's also the FAO focal point for economics and policy Innovations for CSA in the epec Epic program and then um we will have Richie auua who's sitting here in front he is um an expert in business development strategy and spearheads the environmental defense funds engagement in Asia uh he will be rapturing he will give us a short summary at the end of the the session so without losing any more time I'm going to ask Alexandre to say a few words about um what climate smart agriculture is some backgrounds opportunities and challenges and then we'll hear what uh Todd has to say about climate smart agriculture Panacea or prop propaganda okay please Alexander thank you very much and yeah move that yeah y so uh I will very briefly introduce or reintroduce for those of you who who already uh know what climate smart ulture is what the the way we understand climate smart agriculture in in FAO which can be slightly different some from some of the things uh that are around more and more and just extremely briefly giving examples because examples is probably the best way to understand what uh climate smart agriculture uh could mean so once again agriculture has to address a triple challenge more food in quantity quality and diversity everywhere for everyone adapt to climate change and contribute to mitigate climate change the important point I think is that this triple challenge has to be seen at very various scales Global local local and and household and we always need to keep in mind these various scales when you look at systems and and what can be their contributions to climate smart agriculture growing demand all over the world um due also to to diet changes but especially in some countries and and many of these countries which are already food insecure and which will be the most affected by climate change and globally worldwide fa estimates that production has to increase by 60% very briefly main effects on of climate change on agricultural production a decrease of production in certain areas a change in the geography of of production between countries and inside countries and also and especially uh an increased variability of production so the the impacts on on food and nutrition security have have been well described in in the hlp reports 2012 and now in the ipcc report uh recently released with impacts on the most vulnerable countries and the most vulnerable people mainly and with impacts on food security and nutrition which are much more than just decreasing yields decreasing yields and the consequences of decreasing yields changes of the geography of production and so vulnerable all countries having to import and price volatility and the combination of all these effects so agriculture can also contribute to mitigate and the way we see it uh in in FAO given the fact that agriculture has to produce more is to understand mitigation as a reduction of emissions per kilo of output globally having emissions increasing less than production and also uh enhanced agricultural soil carbon sinks which means sinks above and underground so the concept has first been introduced in 2010 it with the title of a brochure that FAO prepared for the the ha conference one so it's amazing how the the word is now all over the place probably because this idea that we need to address various objectives at Farm level at Country level and globally is really needed and also one other important point about the climate smart a culture approach is that it is not only practices or systems but also systems from an ergonomic point of view but also the policies and institutions and the finance which are necess to enable these changes so it's really the three of them with to a certain extent why I climate smart I don't know what is a climate smart technology i' I'd rather think about climate Smart Systems and when you try to take these three objectives together food security adaptation and mitigation globally what we want to do is more resource efficient systems and more resilient systems Sy but be also careful to what we mean want to mean by resource efficient systems it's not only more crop per drop it's also more income per drop more jobs per drop in the countries where agriculture is the main source of jobs and and income for the population which means that it is very country local system specific the the way you imagine the Technologies and the way they are integrated in a system and globally what what we think is that the tradeoffs are not really between food security and mitigation or food security and adaptation but rather because between increasing resource efficiency and increasing resilience and this is where you have to look at tradeoffs and synergies an important point which is why I was insisting on the various levels in the system is that we need to increase the general resilience of Food Systems which means the physical resilience environmental but also the economic and social resilience of the system one of these Dimension being able to compensate for a certain time but not for a very long time but for instance social protection can help farmers resist a physical shock avoid them selling all their livestock for instance and enable them to recover afterwards but resilience has also to be seen at various levels each level being able to compensate for another the resilience of his household depends on the fact also on the fact that they're Diversified the Diversified sources of income but also it can be compensated by social protection for instance trade can play a role to a certain extent provided that there income so that why I we were insisting on the need to understand how the various systems relate one to another household to the farm the farm to the landscape the the farm to the food chain and all of that constitutes various Food Systems so really very very quickly and and you'll hear much more about it after me understanding climate smart agriculture has to be done on the ground in the field in in in real systems so these are just examples of a brochure you'll found you'll found downstairs where we tried uh to look at the various dimensions of the impact of a technique in in other words and to come back to the title of my presentation we believe that there are opportunities to have climate Smart Systems more efficient and more resilient but the challenge is to be able to properly measure the various impacts of the techniques both environmentally economically and socially and in various time frames and these are very different according to the system it's not the same if you introduce Ura de placement in Bangladesh where jobs are very uh low coast and you need more jobs and in China for instance where job labor is much more coly so you need mechanized systems and and the impact on food Security will be totally different in the various systems and very often what happens is that which is what where climate smart agriculture makes the change we've introduced a technology for a precise objective and we measure that precise objective we have the basine on water and we and we measure how water is used very often we don't have the impact on economics on livelihoods on income on social issues on gender sens sensitivity Etc so these are some cases where we have them sustainable grazing for better livelihoods in China this is an interesting project because in the beginning it was introduced as a mitigation project uh to increase carbon sinks but in fact it is totally transforming the systems and the livelihood of the people and it's much more a food security and an adaptation project with a carbon Finance component but it is this carbon Finance component which began triggering the the institutional changes uh you'll hear probably more about these one uh afterward insisting also on the important of genetic di diversity just as an example of of things that that we need in order to be able to react to uncertainties and this is another very important dimension of climate smart agriculture when we say increasing resilience we mean resilience to everything because we do not know exactly what are going to be the changes in 30 or 40 years in in whatever area landscape approach is also a key one um I've already mentioned that one and I will stop here to leave the floor to my colleague thank [Applause] you so what I'm going to be talking about today is trying to answer oh it's cut off hopefully not all of the slides are like that uh what I'll be talking about today is trying to answer this simple or somewhat complicated question climate smart agriculture propaganda or Panacea and here in like this title slide this question is incredibly complicated especially for climate smart agriculture because with climate smart agriculture what we're talking about in many cases is multiple Dimensions we're talking about multiple practices here you can see it's Agro forestry intercropping uh conservation agriculture improved cook stoves as well as multiple outcomes so we're looking at nutrition security we're looking at poverty alleviation we're looking at natural resource management and so how do we even begin to think about and begin to analyze this type of complexity I would tend that it's this type of complexity that has largely made the in and helped spur the debate about whether or not climate smart agriculture can actually achieve some of its Ambitions and it's because of this we need to pull back from some of the sort of IND idiosyncratic case studies and try to get to the real big issues that we can then uh start to bring these these topics to scale so over the next about 10 10 minutes or so I'm going to be telling you about the initial results from a meta analysis that that we've been conducting about specifically to try to answer the question of How do farm management practices affect food security uh add adaptive capacity and mitigation and so I was sort of inspired to take on this topic largely because I was seeing things like this in the news uh the Global Alliance for CSA wants to reach 500 million small holder farming households uh the African CSA Alliance and the knad vision 25 by 25 want to reach 25 million households by 2025 this type of effort will require a Herculean change in how we as scientists and we as development practitioners actually Implement agricultural development and so but the real question here is what is the evidence base all of this type of development initiatives is fundamentally based on the assumption that we have evidence for that improved practices CSA uh will improve food security uh adaptive capacity and mitigation objectives while and also it's based on the fundamental assumption that we have so idea about the synergies and tradeoffs between these different components and so what have we been doing so far we've been trying to make a sense of essentially what is a pile of disperate literature and so we've been doing a meta analysis and a systematic review of 65 practices and 15 indicators and so when I say practices we're not talking about the aggregate level of Agro forestry we're talking about things that farmers actually Implement on the on the ground leguminous intercrop AGR Forestry deep placement of Ura things that farmers would actually need that you can analyze individually and then also aggregate back up when I talk about indicators these are indicators of food security adaptive capacity or mitigation uh for food security we're looking at four main indicator categories of ranging from income productivity and and such in terms of adaptive capacity obviously this is the hardest one we're thinking about things like soil quality we're thinking about gender differentiated labor we're thinking about nutrient use efficiency water use efficiency and things like that mitigation is a little bit more straightforward carbon sequestration uh greenhouse gas intensity and the like and so what we've done is essentially we we utilize discipline oriented keyword searches in the web of science database and we came up with 144,000 candidate papers and with the help of a small team in of of Master's level students including Helena who's in the audience here today uh we went through all 144,000 papers and tried to see how they matched our inclusion criteria so here we were interested in whether or not there was they had information and data on a CSA practice and a non-csa control as well as whether or not they took place in a tropical developing country so from that 144,000 we narrow in Reading those abstracts we narrowed it down to about 16,000 papers and those papers we then downloaded the full text and further analyzed them to see if they met our inclusion criteria that left us with uh 6,000 papers in which we had to actually extract data from that we thought were relevant to answering our main question which is uh climate smart agriculture panace propaganda or in other words what is the evidence based behind climate smart agriculture so far we've extracted data on about 20% of that and so I'll be talking about that based on the numbers that we've already extracted we presume that in the end this database which will be hopefully ready by the MIAA conference if not a little a little bit later on in the year we'll have about 120,000 individual data points in it okay and so if we start and so if we just start to map the where the studies have taken place to see where and how and what information is available these are the studies that we have this is a random sample from our 12200 studies that we've already looked at um where they where they are actually located on the map and these Studies have they're talking about at least one indicator relevant for food security adaptive Capac capacity or mitigation you see that it's a pretty good global distribution but if you look a little closer you also see that there is some Geographic clustering that you see that in Western Kenya and maybe around Acra and Ghana there's actually um quite a number of studies that are in relatively small location and what so what does that mean for when we're trying to scale climate smart agriculture well what it means is or what it suggests at this point is that we may have a biased data set that our information base may be inadequate to be able to say say uh that this type of practice will have this type of outcome in a in a new location when we then go to uh studies that have two practices or two that address two components of CSA like food security and adaptation in the same study the um the size of the data set reduces dramatically you B we basically lose 60% of the studies and so why is that important that's important because what we know from about 50 years of agricultural research and agricultural for de development research is that a lot of time interventions are place-based so we can't presume that the types of interventions and the types of outcomes that we might see in one location are going to be able to be extrapolated to another location quite easily and so these synergies and tradeoffs may not actually U be transmissable and lastly if we look at studies where we have all three indicators May probably given this projector you might not even see any up there there's but there's a seven dots so we we basically reduced it to less than 1% of the studies have looked at all three all three components of CSA in the same study and this is this is important simply because it greatly reduces our ability to characterize what is normally thought of within climate smart agriculture which are these triple winds these win-win winds when we start to look at the data and actually use uh common meta analytical techniques so this is uh they food security response across multiple indicators for six different practices at different aggregated levels and that's sounds a little complicated but let me let me go into uh a little bit more detail and so wrong button so this is an effect size so an effect size measures the relative effect of the treatment to the control and so anything to the right of that red line is a positive effect anything to the left of that line is going to be a negative effect uh if it crosses that line it's not significantly different than zero and you can you may have positive or negative control or negative effects and so basically what you see here is that there's not only a wide variability for any given practice for instance in Agro forestry or but there are some uh clear winners the use of inorganic fertilizer seems to be quite positive uh the use of increasing protein and livestock feeds as well the interesting part is is that in most cases people are talking about climate smart agriculture at a very aggregate level they're talking about agroforestry as climate smart well as you can see in these top two two panels uh if once you start disaggregating the data from AGR forestry to actually leguminous AGR forestry the actual effect changes and so I I would argue that you would need to actually begin to think about it in this more disaggregate level when you're identifying things as climate smart and lastly let's let's look quick quick L at some synergies and some tradeoffs and so this is just the synergies and tradeoffs uh for the adaptation and food security indicators that are are in 130 random samp random sample of 130 studies so as you can see there are only 55 comparisons in that in that 130 study so that's back to the about 60% decline that I mentioned earlier and everything in the red box in the lower leftand corner is where you don't want to be this is lose lose so about 6% of the studies showed that there were lose lose effects between adaptation and food security uh in the opposite quarter in catac cornia there's about 32% of them showed that there were actually synergies so this is what everybody is saying is possible with climate smart agriculture but equally important 60% of the studies that we that we looked at and granted it a small data set at this point shows that there's equal or more likely chance of actual trade-offs between adaptation and food security than there are synergies and so so while today I just really focused on a very small amount of our initial data the merging Trends seem to be clear somewhere clear that there's Geographic uh clustering of the studies which would suggest that we have challenges in actually extrapolating the data there's a likelihood that we will see uh tradeoffs as much as we would see synergies as well as that there's large variability amongst and with and between and within individual practices than [Applause] thanks okay thank you so before we go to some questions we'll have another uh round of panelists giving their sort of views on what they've just heard also just making some statements in regard to let's say the alliance here so let's start off with Martin and then um Lami and Austin in that order and um I'll ask you to be fairly brief so that we have as much time as possible for questions and answers where you can sort of uh elaborate more on any issues you might want to raise okay so Martin you want to kick us off please thank you very much okay yes thank you so much moderator Hy yes I'm going to be very brief and thank you so much to the two presentations I think they do give us a very good scope in terms of the discussion now and I pick it up from the messages key messages out of the two presentations and I would say is it possible looking at what we've just heard in terms of what is clim SM agriculture is it possible then or is it correct to say that in fact climate smart agriculture is just any good agricultural practices anything that is actually good and underlying the word good is going to give us productivity food security is going to give us adaptation it's going to give us mitigation value uh and sometimes when you look back into uh what we have described and what we've known as good agricultural farming when we say climate smart agriculture are we saying anything different what is new in in this ER and I start by saying that yes in fact there there is something new there is something different uh one of the first important issue is that in dealing with and talking about CLI smart agriculture we want to go beyond just the issue of securing productivity so this is more than just productivity issue there is something that is actually very very clear about the threats that climate change or the opportunities that climate change bring on the whole spectrum and space on productivity and on the Food Systems so you looking at the everything that we're doing in terms of farming practices or what you call Agriculture and look at how far is it going to support enhancing ability to deal with the new emerging Trends and and threats opportunities that are very specific to the occurrence of climate change climate variability and this again is about understanding the actual risks which are actually going are very localized is appreciating the actual opportunity unities that you attribute to to that climate change uh the second point I want to make is the is that when you look at clim smart agriculture in terms of what is different and in terms of those practices is actually that is something that is compelling Beyond we talk about holistic comprehensive approaches but in climate smart agriculture we are seeing a very practical compare to look at agriculture to look at farming in a very very integrated holistic and I like what the the moderator was saying in the beginning that is more than just climate Smart Technologies but that we we look at climate Smart Systems because it's about practices it's about policies and institutions as mentioned resources but is also about managing the tradeoffs in terms of different constituencies but also the tradeoffs in in time and space so what are we doing today Visa what are the needs requirements of future scenario and the last and third point in terms of the practices of clim smart agriculture is actually the value and the one issue about clim smart agriculture is actually how much it should bring back the value the benefits into the local circumstances both in terms of environmental resilience social resilience but today especially when you look at Africa the issues how do we support the communities to harness their resources land and water in terms of increasing access to economic or expanding economic opportunities and and actually enabling them to move in that Spectrum towards Prosperity thank you okay thank you you very much Martin um we now have Fabiola um Muno Doo who is the executive director of the national forest and Wildlife service surfor here as well um it's a Pity she couldn't make it to us a little earlier because she missed the the presentations but I'll give her the the chance of listening to the respondents so then she can make something out of that and uh we'll have more chances to hear afterwards okay well thank you very much for coming anyway it's been it's great to have you Lami please good afternoon ladies and gentlemen uh when I was being introduced they said that I'm working for an organization where working in a policy space I would like to throw that into the discourse of you know climate smart agriculture uh I listen to the presentations and I also listen to the the presentations before this session a yesterday what I'm seeing as a missing link it's the enabling environment that we all agree that it's part of what will make you know our efforts for climate smart agriculture to be successful I just want to share with you uh the experience that just we had uh with our organization where we did uh some scoping studies in 15 countries in Africa southern Africa and East Africa to see how the countries are actually responding in terms of you know the climate smart agriculture debates and also climate change what we are seeing is that that the countries do recognize that climate change is there they also respond to the to the calls for climate change and most of the discussions are hosted by the ministries of of environment what we have seen with the ministries of agriculture culture is that uh out of the 15 countries that we we we we did the scoping study there were about four five where they have policies that speaks specifically to climate smart agriculture so as we discuss I would like us to to look at how we can actually accelerate you know really for the countries to have the enabling environment that will complement what is happening on the ground so we find you know the disjuncture that you know on the ground there a lot of experiences there a lot of practices that is happening but there's a gap between what is being practiced and what the policies are saying so as we discussed we need to to also accelerate on that front thank you thank you very much Lami that's a very important point and Alexander already mentioned it that we need not only look at the Technologies that's very important uh Austin please just give us your your thoughts oh thank you very much uh moderator um from the introduction I think I'm the most ta end panelist here um I am from the extension side of uh all these practices so I'll Focus my comment on what it takes to scale up um climate smart agricultural practices um I like the matrics that toad presented I think it's four dimensional but as we go out in the field the matrics could become 100 dimensional um when we are working with um the farming communities uh the issues of productivity yes they come in issues of costs the issues of resource saving environmental issues or indicators and also the institutional uh indicators that we have discussed in um the presentation from uh FAO so uh when we are at that level we must uh make sure that um all those indicators are satisfied and that's the main challenge uh that we Face uh in climate smart agriculture we have observed that those practices uh they do respond to as many of those indicators and my suggestion to the metod study that we are conducting under aircraft is that we should um go on beyond the three indicators to satisfy what the farming communities need or what they expect from this practice IES and uh finally uh I'd like to suggest that we have quick policy briefs to our decision making people the politicians uh that crisply presents what we expect or what we suggest uh uh the winning solutions to the challenge that the farming communities are facing in the the because of the effects of climate change thank you thank you Austin and that's very important for us to talk about the question of scaling up I think we should hear uh more about that um it's one thing to know the benefits in terms of uh adaptation mitigation and food security but then another question altogether might be how can it how can we reach these millions of farmers that uh Todd was already mentioning Fabiola do you want to say a few words with regard to climate smart Agriculture and U potentially uh your own experience here out of the country I don't know e El for l in min min in uh pardon okay buo for [Music] [Music] okay thank thank you so I think you did added a very important element and gave some more sort of depth to the question of what contributes to enabling environments from the political perspective and I think that was very useful for our audience here so we have quite a bit of time for questions and then uh so I'd like to take two or three questions at a time and then uh we'll give a give our panel an opportunity to respond I have Jonathan here in the back um yes sir number two and we'll take one more afterwards what go ahead Jonathan yeah my name is Jonathan Cornelius um a question actually for for Fabiola can you introduce yourself please not the institution okay sorry Henry this is Jonathan Cornelius I'm regional coordinator for World agrology Center based here in Lima okay um yeah a question for faola T your interesting remarks about the need to close the gap between research and policy yeah and coincidentally possibly um in our institutions the CG we spend a lot of time thinking about theories of change and how our research can change what happens uh to its intended or rather can change uh what our intended uh users do should we say in this case how our research can change policy what I'd like to ask you as a as a uh implementer and former of policy is to what degree um the El at end users of research also have to come back down the the the chain of impact themselves and somewhere uh meet the the scientists as they try increasingly to work forwards in in the chain of impact yeah um hope I'm being clear what I'm trying to say is that as researchers we are being asked to be increasingly accountable uh for our research being implemented for example in changing policies so uh what is the role of policy makers in also coming back maybe towards researchers and for the two of us together uh to construct um that impact that we all want thank you okay please yes sir and then the lady behind him um as well thank you I'm Doug Boucher from the union of concerned scientists um my question is for Todd um the graph you showed had what to me was a striking and even paradoxical result which is that a a very large uh quite impressive metaanalysis from the world Agro forestry Center showed that there was no significant effect of Agro forestry um but you were only talking about the effects on food security what were the significant variables that affected uh mitigation okay inter [Music] okay let's uh give the panel the opportunity to respond and uh yes let's start with Fabiola and uh then I'll pass it on to to Todd and um anybody else who wants to say something to any of the other questions please feel free okay famba okay for for for e J pH quantos AOS see for [Music] okay thanks for this uh passionate statement Fabiola um and I think you're totally right about everything uh see Todd why don't you just respond to dog's question I think it's a important question dou easy to follow up great appreciate that um I I fail to see the Parx uh mostly because I'm a scientist and I just I report what the data say and so this is the analysis that that we've done so far in the limited data set what you see and what you saw in that graph is largely driven by the variability in aggro forestry systems that are included there there's border planting there's intercrop there's there's legumes there's Timber species and all of that which which is why you see such a wide such a wide range in the effect and so I would I would presume that before the end of the analysis when you we've included more data um that you we would we would see a different effect how large that effect positive or negative I'm not I can't it's hard for me to predict right now based on my reading of the 1200 papers oh the mitigation effects we haven't looked at those data yet okay Martin do you want to say something about the the question that Jonathan raised in the context of Science and policy I think you might be able to add a few words from your perspective maybe put it into the context of the climate smart agriculture Alliance yes thank you uh indeed that is an interesting issue and it does come up all the time in fact in the in the Africa Alliance one of the work stream we have identified where we saying we need need to make a difference is on is on the on the policy we have one on the policy stream and we have one which we're calling technical support and this is the appreciation of the fact that and I think in Africa you can say the politicians are coming quite a long way in respecting data respecting evidence and beginning to talk about facts and figures and the problem is that this facts and figures data is not existing in the form in the manner that they can actually use it at the moment and that is the problem we have so the the issue in terms of research is actually how we can move and actually move very rapidly not just in terms of Technology development but also support the politicians to answer the questions they need to answer in terms of real with the evidence with the objectivity that is desired and one of the things we are looking at actually as a as a matter of approach is that when you talk about climate smart Agriculture and and look looking at at science is a very open space there's a lot we need to know but is also clear that the climate smart agriculture we're talking about in fact as implied from the various discussions is not the same as manufacturing a kind Laboratory and then take it out on the road to be used the car the clim smart agriculture is going to be developed in situ is going to image within the road that you're using it so it's how we move actually in terms of research approaches in terms of research Tools in terms of the accountability of what research delivers to actually bring them into the field working with the farmers working with politicians working with communities and and actually it's also because it's not just a technical issue is actually political economy and and those things will be critical in making climate smart agriculture image the way we want to see it we've mentioned actually working with the Cs we're working with far and we're saying also that we need in fact just as much political economy research as we're doing on the on the hardware on the on the on the actual agronomic and and technological practices uh moderator if you allow me just one more point I wanted also to say that when you look at the sorry discussions on climate smart agriculture everywhere even in the this this two days of course it's being emphasized in terms of the the comprehensiveness the integrated nature of it the holistic aspects uh but it's also linking to research to understand that I think we have to be careful that we don't end up with a very perfect creation that is unimplementable and and actually the the Excellency of the description of climate smart agriculture is not going to come out of a laboratory it's going to come out of real practices in the field and I want to end by saying in fact in that sense that's why we need to listen more from what the farmers are doing what communities are doing and actually understand that if it's not broken don't fix it brilliant okay I saw I had you sir then um I saw you first and I don't know if you were there so I have you three okay please introduce yourself please can we get a a microphone here see first no I saw this gentleman first he was uh already raising his hand I'm sorry thank you uh Doug brown with World Vision International um my question's specifically to Todd but I think Alexandre might be able to help with it as well um your data surprised me a little bit in a way it was but I think it's partly because it's a ma m analysis and of course you're looking at studies that were designed to measure food or productivity impacts or at resilience impacts but they may not have measured the other ones and so they're dropped out when you sort of start comparing to um so there's a limitation there I guess but I was looking at the grid the quadr here where you have the win-wins the lose lose and then the mixed ones and I'm just trying to wonder I know when in the FAO Source book we know that there's a lot of practices listed there and they're not all equally climate smart some score better on two or three dimensions than others do so I'm wondering if you can characterize what's in the upper right quadrant versus what's in the lower the upper left versus the lower right and what practices are dropping down to those things versus the ones which are clear win-wins okay um and yes sir please now you'll have to go over again I'm sorry can I take about 2 minutes to share how we have achieved climate smart Agriculture and benefited in India yes so TR if you would try to be very concise and also to be I take two minutes and and try to frame a question as well later on but first I would like to congratulate Todd for bringing out a very precise analysis of what is happening and what benefits have occurred and if this taken further then the world Community will benefit now climate smart agriculture we started in Gujarat India about 10 years back and we called it as a new extension approach it is prior to agriculture season it takes place in all Villages together 18,000 Villages team is led by agriculture extension Administration agriculture scientist input dealer and Market people and they go and meet the farmers at their doorstep provide them information what crops they should grow in next season based on prevailing situation three inputs are provided to Farmer one is soil Health analysis which I mentioned in the last uh session that what crops their soil will sustain based on the weather parameters second is what is market demand for the crops which crops they should select based on the market and where the quality inputs are available this is backed by water conservation measure at Village level which is funded by the government with Community participation so not a drop of water goes out 70% % of our area is rainfed focus is on women farmers and Rural Youth and Rural youth are trained to identify what are microenterprises possibilities based on local agriculture produce so it's a comprehensive approach takes place every year prior to agriculture season and what has happened in Gujarat India and which is now going on all over the country uh the all health card approach and everything is that we had a minus 2% to plus 2% growth rate we have now reached 9% growth rate in 10 years at constant price so almost income of farmers have doubled and on par with nonfarm sector so if we follow this approach in a comprehensive manner there will be less social turmoils which are happening in many parts of world and people are trying to grab Justice by brutality thank you okay uh thank you very much for this comment and I'm going to ask uh your your intervention first please okay my name is talent tunzi and um I'm with fan my question is basically on on coordination taking into account that um CSA is at a global level and also we have got the CSA Alliance at at at the African level how are the coordination modal modality is do we have an implementation framework or a monitoring and evaluation framework at a global level that resonates with other regions and are we following a bottom up approach in terms of coming up with those uh with those kinds of Frameworks and the other the other question is on the on the CSA Technologies do we have context specific CSA toolkit or technologies that we have to really say this is what we call climate smart agriculture or it's just the three indicators that were showed here that indicate on food security adaptation and mitigation do we have practical context specific um toolkits that are talking to different eot types uh in in the different regions that we are operating in thank you thank you very much for this excellent question so what I would suggest is that uh Alexandre and and Austin you could try to respond to the Indian gentleman's point which I think was very context specific and I think it makes sense to sort of look at the question from a larger perspective is it transferable can it be done elsewhere you know what are the constraints and because we talk about systems that are context specific we need to make sure that they actually fit somewhere else and then Todd if you answer uh Doug's question of course and Rami I don't know if you want to step in also looking at uh the questions of coordination potentially so Alexander um so the first thing is that which is why I was saying that we're a bit une easy with this idea of climate Smart Technologies and climate smart practices because it is very context dependent it's ecosystem dependent but it's also socially dependent it depends how the communities are organized it it depends how the policies are supporing it depends of the economics and so from our perspective what what we need is is having more examples of what has worked or what has not worked with the various impacts and why it has worked or why it has not work what what what is the context which is around the object the ultimate objective would be I don't know if it would be toolkits but information tools knowledge platforms col it how you want it where practitioners or actors at whatever level from governments policy makers of development practitioners or or Farmers could go and have a look at situations which are as comparable as possible to theirs or one aspect of the situation is comparable to there so that's the objective and you're right it needs a lot of coordination this is this event is part of it uh the huge work with done by Todd is an essential element of that uh but there is still a lot to be done but probably one the biggest from my perspective the biggest mistake to avoid would be to say oh that's a solution just implement it top down this does doesn't wouldn't work and not only it wouldn't work but there is a risk of having wrong impacts in another Dimensions I think one of the important thing with climate SM is that we say in the beginning you have to look at the three things you do not necessarily need to address them at the same level the win-win-win thing is a myth maybe but you need to look at the three and you need to know what damage you're doing in another dimension when you want to do something and that's probably true for all natural resources issues or or even development issued but and and uh uh yeah maybe I'll and and this probably is part of why the quarter and and what so many trade up because it it's not the same everywhere but probably you you'll be more able to enter that way okay uh thank you very much I'll start uh from where Al Alexander has stopped on the two kets yes or no um in some areas we are trying uh to draft some to Kits or some messages on climate smart agricultural practices I'll give an example of the Epic uh projects in Vietnam Zambia and Malawi where we have looked at the we have started looking at the trade tradeoffs uh in terms of medication all those triple winds medication food security and adaptation and we have isolated some examples or some practices that are fitting well within those winwin win uh we are also doing some institutional mapping uh on how to move on or outscale these practices and we have we are also doing some policy harmonization I think my colleague Shema indicated that in some areas or some regions we have a gap between the environmental sector and the agricultural sector uh from policy and institutional setup on how to handle uh the issue of agricultural practices that are climate smart uh from my colleague from India uh that's a very good example that he has indicated and he I'm happy that uh a few months ago I was in martra and I I observed the same uh best practices on what they were calling the advisory Services uh within martra they were able to combine the water budgets uh the Hydromet Services the weather Focus uh the available water for irrigation the onset of the RS and the preing economic and social conditions the markets the agroecological conditions the soil fertility to precisely advise the farming community on how they can um um modify or improve their farming system and I really agree with him that it has really improved the productivity of the farmers but also um the resilience of the farming system",
