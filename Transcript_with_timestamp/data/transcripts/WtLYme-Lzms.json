  "text": "all right thank you um for the opportunity to speak to you today so I'm going to talk for a few minutes about weed management and strawberries and just to put a few kind of qualifiers on here I'm going to summarize what we do in Florida first for weed management so that means everything that I'm talking about is in regards to plastic culture production although a lot of the techniques do go beyond that um I'm going to kind of frame this around an integratedly matched program because one thing we have found is that no single tool will solve the problem but you've got to integrate a bunch of them so I'm going to spend a little bit more time on some components of this than others but uh we're going to highlight some of the things we found the last few years but also highlight kind of the standard practices here in Florida so to start with we're going to start with fumigation the vast majority of strawberries in Florida are fumigated we do have around anywhere from six to eight hundred acres of organic strawberries um in the county where I'm at which is Hillsborough County and that kind of varies depend from year to year depending on the market but as far as fumigation goes we just completed a management survey a short while ago and the most common fumigant in Florida when strawberries is pickle or 60. and as commonly thought of for control of pathogens and nematodes it does provide some weed control as well which I'll talk about a little bit in a minute telephone c35 used to be the most common fumigant but it's no longer as common as 5460 and then there are a few Growers that use k-pam or vapeam as well which its strong point is weed control the one of the reasons that we use these combinations of tone and chloropicarine is because of the fact in terms of weed control they're much more effective when combined now these pictures I'm going to show you the next couple pictures are in tomatoes but you see the same Trend in strawberries so the pitcher on the left is your non-treated and you can see nut sedge coming through the plastic here if you add 50 pounds of chloropicrin it depends a pick you actually make the problem worse and that's because low levels of pick will stimulate not such sprouting if you get up around 200 pounds of pick well then you've certainly reduced the population compared to a non-treated but you don't get great control if you look at same picture on the left as untreated the middle that's still 50 pounds a pick but the picture on the right now this is 15 gallons per acre one 3D it essentially doesn't have any effect on that side's control on its own but this is where you really see the difference once you combine the pick in the one 3D you see a really clean bed and it's that combination of products that gives optimizes weed control and we see that consistently across all crops and um the that combination improves control now here is a key point though is this really weather dependent so those pictures that I'm showing you where we get really good control of nutsedge those are fumigated in January in Florida so that's when the soil is a bit cooler if you look at this picture on the left is Pickler 60 on the right is non-fumigated almost no difference those are fumigated in it's a lie when it's really hot so we for weed control when it comes to fumigation you have to take into account whether cooler slightly cooler soils are going to give you better weed control just because the fuming it moves through the soil more slowly we've done a lot of long-term fumigation trials the last few years and I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this because communication is not kind of where I want to spend all the time but I do want to point out this picture to give an example on the left is non-fumigated on the right is Pickler 60. and again on the left is not fumigated on the right it's the Florida three-way what we call the Florida three-way is a combination so indicate in this case Pickler 60 plus k-pam on the top and early in the season you don't see a lot of a lot of difference but when you move through um late in the season you see where we didn't fumigate we just got hammered with disease Pickler 60 did fairly well but there's a lot of variability in those plants if you look at this three-way a picture on the right you see consistency just to show you another picture of how extreme this can be we don't use Paladin anymore but this still shows the difference of the Florida three-way versus not the bottom left-hand pitcher that's power and pick 21 you can see all those grasses and broadleaf weeds growing in there this is the same field here we have Paladin plus k-pam and you can see how much cleaner it is so consistently if we have a problem field that's going to be fumigated that has a lot of weeds the Florida three-way or what Georgia they call it the Georgia three-way that combination gives you the best control and in our studies it actually gives you the best economic return as well so real quick use combinations if you fumigate cooler temperatures are going to give you better weed control with four or three ways the best in terms of weed control as well as economic return and it's the best in terms of broadleaf and Brass control as well when it comes to herbicides so I'm going to talk about some pre-herbicized pre-emergent server size the ones that you apply before the weeds are up so in our in Florida we're going to talk about herbicides that go underneath the plastic mulch so [Music] you can have this equipment you can see here which is a bed press which has nozzles on the back which can spray the herbicide directly on the bed immediately before we lay the plastic this is not a real common practice in Florida not a lot of people are using herbicides under the plastic it does occur especially in fields where there are problems with broadleaf grass weeds here is a summary of the most common herbicides used in Florida historically the recommendation was a combination of gold and Evernote uh we've moved away from that Chateau is now the most common recommendation and there's a few reasons for that if you look down this is just a few wheat species that we have in Florida strawberries and black medic and Carolina geranium are two common ones you see Chateau provides some suppression of those two species where's the other two products do not um generally speaking Chateau persists a little longer and provides really good excellent weed control of most species a little bit better than gold although gold was also a very good product you might be wondering why historically would they have mixed gold and ever and all well that's simple this next chart shows it devinol is much better on grasses than Chateau orgoal so that Gold Plus Denver and all mix gave you a better um overall we control however Chateau is pretty decent better than gold on grasses and the last pricing I did which was admittedly a little over a year ago but it was so prices changed a lot but at the time Chateau was at around twenty dollars per acre a gold devron all mix costs around 120 dollars per acre so a big difference in cost which is why we've kind of moved away from that mix and settled on Chateau is the best option unfortunately neither one of the none of these products work on nutsedge there are no effective herbicides registered for nutsedge control and strawberry just a real quick blurb on flumioxism which is the active ingredient in chateau um this chart right here we did this trial a short time ago looking at the red labeled rates which is 1x all the way up to ridiculously high rates something that you would never use we were just trying to highlight um what rate would you have to use to see damage and we did this across a lot of different sites and you can see I'm pointing at these dots where the One X rate which is three ounces per acre two x-rayed or the 4X rate this is essentially no damage you have to go all the way up to eight times the label rate to cause damage and Chateau so it's extremely safe if you do get damaged this is what it looks like Chateau if you get it on the bed and it comes up through the roots you can see the Browning on the veins that's what Chateau will do it'll burn the veins up and of course that leaf will die if you have real high rates on the plant is not likely going to recover this graph is Chateau persistence over the season and I know it goes up a little bit here but it's just kind of a little bit of accumulation effect but basically the reason we like Chateau is because the fact it persists throughout our season so it's a really good product just a couple of things um strawberries are extremely tolerant of Chateau you can apply it don't of course but you we went up to four times the label right without any damage it persists for the whole season that's a good thing unless you're going to use that plastic for a second crop then that's could be a problem for you um I have gone to a few Fields over the last few years where we um saw some Chateau damage and the three bullet points in the bottom here these are the three reasons we've seen damage number one inadequate agitation in the tank so Chateau right now is a granular although that formulation is changing and there's been cases where people didn't agitate it the elves and you release a clump of herbicide in the middle of the field and you get a you know a spot where you get some damage you have an inexperienced driver who slows down near the end of the roads and you get really high rates near the end of the row that can happen or Chateau is supposed to be put on the top of the bed right before you lay the plastic there's been a few people sprayed on the flat and pull that bed up and you end up with a concentrated lines of herbicide right where the plants are and that also can cause damage now most of the herbicides that are used in strawberries are used in the Raw Metals um and that's pretty well every single grower does apply herbicides in their own Metals in Florida except for the organic Growers which tend to rely on cultivation we've done a lot of trials in different crops looking at which herbicides are the most effective and this is just a table showing two different seasons and this was weed density in the row middle and you can see Chateau consistently dropped weed death density significantly dual Chateau and dual and gold did fairly well but not really any any better than Chateau alone I mentioned dual because it's recently been registered in strawberries in Florida I don't believe it's registered in Alabama but I'll just we can use it in their own middle I'm not 100 sure of it in Alabama um this is an example of a role model this is again this particular one was in tomatoes but you can see non-treated versus Chateau application we had your maximum exterior to burn down what was green and a big difference so really really good um control this um this is just a summary of the most effective options and the most common used ones in Florida so a lot of Growers will before transplant will use a combination of aim and Chateau to burn down what's there and to give them residual control or from Oxon and chateau fuel use gold and gramoxone and there are a few that use glyphosate after transplant there are a lot of Growers that use glyphosate or gramoxone placato mix that can be sprayed up to fruit set but not after just a couple of things warning with Chateau if you spray it in Raw Metals it does persist a long time that's its strength um but you can there's a risk of if you have a sandy soil like we do in Florida and you get a lot of wind or you can actually have particles of sand blow up from the fruit if you wait too long to apply that application you get little burn marks so something you don't want to go too close to when you think you're going to be picking with glyphosate really common problem is um this yellowing this is a little bit of drift when they were spraying it this is very typical of glyphosate Roundup damage and strawberries where you see the growing points and even the buds down here all kind of Turn of a yellie twin yellowy twins so you need to be careful if you're using glyphosate after transplant careful to do everything you can to minimize drift um I'm going to mention this particular species because we historically did not have ragweek parthenium in our strawberries it started down south of Florida it has since moved rapidly northward um now I pretty much see it in all of our Strawberry Fields a lot of people mix it up with common ragweed and really easy to tell them apart if you look at this picture ragged parthenium has white veins which common Ragweed does not and common Ragweed if you look at the top that's common or agree a little bit more finely divided leaf of course the dead giveaway is these small white flowers look like little puff clouds um and then you have um also the vein as he's really uh sorry the stem is these really prominent veins so why why we're concerned about Ragweed parthenium and why I'm mentioning it today is we've seen consistently it's moving rapidly northward and this is what it looks like just a couple of days ago in some Fields what they had terminated with herbicides and you can see the ragley parthenium is happily still growing it's very tolerant of glyphosate and very tolerant of gramoxone so it will happily grow and if you don't control those few that are left this is a pepper fuel just south of me and you can see these white lines that is it filling the row middles between these rows of peppers and it's very difficult to manage and strawberries you only have two options at the moment one is Chateau again this is the number of weeds per pot so we're looking at the effects of these herbicides on controlling pre-emerge so putting it down before the weed comes up and this NTC is a non-treated control and then you see three and six ounces of Chateau give really good control they won't control the hundred percent but they do certainly reduce the density after that the only options is hand pulling hauling or cultivation there are no herbicides that can be used within a strawberry crop to control the species we do have some products that are working and we have spent some time um working on getting a label for those strawberries and that will be a national label once we make a little bit more progress so something to consider with this species if you do see it in Strawberry Fields it tends to start on the edges on the field edges um you need to make sure you remove it now in Florida we usually terminate all strawberries at some point either with a herbicide or with a fumigant herbicide of course being the most common um approach and Cape ham or vapeam being the ones that are used the most often so this is just a series of pictures where we looked at different rates of in this case it's k-pam vapeam basically you get the same data and looking at how much it takes to kill strawberries this is at the end of the season you want to inject k-pam and the advantage of doing this is that you not only terminate strawberries but you kill the weeds and you also kill seeds in the soil and pathogens and nematodes so at 10 gallons per acre you can see well this red box that perfectly good um strawberry control at a very low rate of 10 gallons per acre so if you have a nice clean field and not really any pest pressure and you just want to terminate your crop this could be an option although it's going to be more expensive than herbicides however if you go to a part of your field where you have a lot of nutsed which is the case in this picture and I'm just using that stage because you can visually see the difference at 10 gallons per acre you still have a lot of green weeds growing because you don't there's not as much spread and there just isn't as you get control in the center this is with one drip tape but you're not getting control in the bed edges if you up it to 40 gallons per acre they're still a little bit of green but you get much much better control and um overall we control which means it's gonna if it will kill nutsedge on the edges as killing other pests that also occur on the bed edges um we use this type of technique if we have issues with these diseases like charcoal rotten strawberry this can be an effective way to minimize um chance of infection the following year we've done a lot of studies looking at rates so you can see this is a non-treated and Petri dishes these black dots this is actually macro firmina growing and petri dish at 10 gallons per acre you drop it in the center but the sides still pretty bad 20 gallons per acre similar story 30 gallons per acre this yellow is not um macro firmina this is a different organism that's not of concern but you're still not reaching the side at 40 gallons per acre you start to get much better control so crop termination with vapam helps with diseases but it also helps with weeds so for example the most commonly we have in strawberries in Florida is goose grass and if you look at this chart here this is the dose of metam potassium or kpam this is percent control and you can see and this is control not of the plants this is control of the seeds and this is what's really important is you can get significant kill of a seed bank with a good application of something like K Camp and this rate right about here would be equivalent to 40 gallons per acre which means that around 40 gallons per acre you're going to get decent control of seeds uh common personal in another weed that we have a lot of this would be a very similar Trend you can see decent control of the application of kpam so summary 10 gallons per acre will adequately terminate a strawberry crop but you need much higher rates right around 40 gallons per acre acre if you want to optimize weed control and control of a lot of pathogens like macro firmina I do want to mention a follow program so our season of course is a little different than yours but generally speaking we are fumigating and putting beds in in August we plant in September and we're harvesting through till March or April depending on markets and things like that that means we have a file a program in from April all the way through to the following June um all right April May and June sometimes in July and then perhaps part of August so several months there where we have bare ground a little over 80 percent somewhere around 85 percent of the strawberry acreage is cover crop every year um there's a lot of important reasons for us to do that that's our wettest time of the year so cover crops help with things like erosion um and helping improve a water uptake for our aquifers but cover crops also do inhibit weeds you can see this picture on the right hand side taken underneath the canopy um see hardly almost no weed seeds germinating there so a good cover crop inhibits wheat growth and suppresses weed seed production and can emphasize the importance of you know there's all kinds of reasons to cover crop for soil structure for soil Health but just in terms of weed control you can really reduce um weed growth and prevent seed production with a properly managed cover crop now that's true for broadleaf weeds and it's true for grass seeds and actually in some of our long-term trials the presence or absence of a good follow-up program whether that's cover crops or herbicides was more important than deciding which fumigate to use that just kind of gives you an idea of how important a good fellow program is that decision of what to grow when you didn't have strawberries there had a much greater effect on what the number of weeks than even what fumigating selected when it comes to nutsedge management cover crops are not a good option and the reason for that is not such will happily grow underneath the canopy of even the most dense cover crops this is a picture of sun hemp even under Sun hemp which can form an incredibly thick canopy uh cover um and that said you'll continue to happily grow now it won't produce as many tubers so you do prevent your populations from getting bigger which is good but you don't reduce the population so if you have a field with a nut such problem you're much better off to use something like cultivation and glyphosate combinations so basically what you want to do is you want to allow the nuts Edge to grow you want to spray um glyphosate when you have not said about I don't know seven inches tall if certainly before it flowers then you want to cultivate to stimulate more um sprouting and then spray again doing that a couple times will optimize your not such control so that kind of gives you a summary of the overall um approach to lead control there's one other thing I want to cover here shortly but again I want to emphasize the one thing that we have know for certain is that effective we control over long term is you've got to integrate more than one tool at a time and one of the reasons that we don't have as many issues with herbicide resistance for example in many specialty crops like strawberries is because we have historically used very integrated weed Management Programs so you want to continue to make sure that you do that we've um last few years we've been doing something kind of fun I'm just going to mention this quickly uh here in Florida we do this practice of relay cropping where we plant a second crop into our strawberries so um in this case you can see eggplants growing in strawberries what would happen is somewhere around January which is when we're full out harvesting strawberries they will come through and they'll plant eggplants cantaloupes or peppers in down the center of the bed so we grow two rows of strawberries in one bed with one drip tape down the center so they'll plant a second crop right down the center along the side of that drip tape and then when it comes near the end of the strawberry season the standard practice right now would be to remove those strawberries by hand and allow that second crop to grow so the advantage and the reason they do relay cropping versus terminating the strawberries and then planting a second crop it's all about timing it allows them to get another crop to Market sooner um without the gap between when one crop ends and another one starts and um there's that there's that advantage of timing the strawberries do provide some protection so it allows you to get basically it allows you to get two crops in a time period when you normally couldn't get them because the part of that time they're growing together the downside of this approach is it as you can imagine hand removal of strawberries is labor intensive so we started um developing this Shield which is really very simple this is just a prototype it's basically a triangular Shield that you can adjust the width at the bottom and then on the outside on each side we have nozzles I'll just show you the back of it as well and we have at the front is kind of flanged out slightly so what it does is as you pull through the field in this case I'm showing you with eggplants again it pulls the leaves of the eggplant up and into this triangular shield and then you're spraying the herbicide on the outside to kill the strawberries so when you pass an open area you can see this dry line down the center of the bed that's where the herbicide didn't touch which is and your plant is covered and then this wet area on the outside both sides that's where the herbicide would have been sprayed so what this looks like is right here the strawberries eventually die and you are continue to grow in this case we're testing hand removal versus herbicide removal in eggplants we've done in cantaloupes and we've also done it in peppers not a great idea for cantaloupes but for Peppers anything growing upright like peppers and eggplants is a great idea it works really well and um no no effects on yield as a matter of fact if you plant the second crop at the right time you actually get a bit of a yield boost um just because as I started to mention earlier the strawberries provide some level of protection against cold periods or colder weather or wind so with that I want to I know I've gone kind of long already and I want to make sure if there's any questions there's a chance to ask those but um I want to acknowledge I've got a great team down here there's a lot of there's a lot of this work for me and we're funded by the sort of strawberry Growers the social Association as well as the Florida Department of Agriculture",
