  "text": "[Music] [Music] my name is Arrow Rella and we're at nessen kig Farm in Lichfield New Hampshire Southern New Hampshire this is a mixed vegetable farm uh 35 to 40 acres of uh vegetable crops and it's a certified organic farm and I've been here 17 years so the vegetables uh that I grow here primarily uh direct sales to restaurants and uh specially food purveyors that sell to restaurants and hotels a lot of culinary herbs salad greens uh more exotic things uh relate to uh Asian crops because most of my workers are are Southeast Asian basically cover crops are the foundation of the farm an organic system one of the ideas is to feed the soil that if you take care of your soil then you're going to have healthy plants that are going to come from that here where this Farm is in Southern New Hampshire uh found that the best way for me to add biomass organic matter into my soil to feed my soil comes from utilizing green manure crops we don't have access to animal manur in this part of the state I'm using two different uh GRE manure crops and and uh they're used a little differently um start out in the Spring areas that either I have bare soil or it's winterkill crops from the previous year I couldn't get into a fall seated cover crop I put in peas and oats and and peas and oats is is quick growing cover crop for the current growing season and um and then starting in August and September as I take pieces out of production and vegetables that were seeded that year then I'll seed fields to uh uh winter rye and hary vetch as soon as I can get on the ground I'll seed uh fuel peas and oats spin it on and then lightly Harrow it in and one of the things I really like about it is that also brings in early income my earliest income in the spring because uh the young peash shoots are very popular with the restaurant trade and also with uh Southeast Asian our Asian Chefs and usually within about four to six weeks of seating I have something I can start to harvest that's a really good starter for the springtime the P tendrils or PE shoots P tips different names for it it's not something you can sell tons T and tons per acre I have tons of it in fact that's one one of the reason I'm growing it for is the biomass of the nitrogen that the peas are fixing that so that's but um on a normal year I probably can realize grow sales between uh say8 and $110,000 on uh five to 7 Acres that might be seated to fuel peas and oats so what we have here is a strip that I started uh it was a strip of Harry Veet and Rye I started turning over probably uh mid April and everything was broken down enough that I was able to transplant my tomato plants probably about the third week in May and um meanwhile the Ryan vetch on the beds next to it we're continuing to uh to grow just about at this stage is the point where you want to knock it down what I'm looking for is for the vet to start to go to flower or the the ride to be a pollen stage and what I like to do ideally is to culate once with my tractor and then I'll knock it down with with the mower and then once it's down we'll use the straw as a mulch for the tomato plants and then we'll bring in some uh some steaks and do a basket weed system to bring uh you know trellising for the tomatoes up out of the mulch I'm utilizing the uh Straw from the strips to start with the mulching process but I try to have a block of of uh Ryan vet nearby as you can see behind here and I'll mow that down as I start to mulch these I'll have a good uh a good close by area where I can bring in more mulch without taking a lot of Labor removing mulch from one area another area of the farm I look at the cover crops as as biomass I mean two things that are very important for the farm is nitrogen from the fixing of nitrogen and the legum that's part of the GRE manure and biomass is very important so I want to maximize my biomass which is bring it to full maturity strip system was Harry V and Ry overwintered and then cutting strips in the in the springtime I use it for wide space crops or crops that I choose to grow in a wide space and that may not traditionally be grown wide spacing but uh pumpkins and winter squash easy to plant and 10-ft centers that work works very well and so I can have 5ft wide beds with uh the adjacent 5ft wide strip of the Harry Veet and Rye Tomatoes I have wide spacing so I can get a good air flow for uh for disease what we're doing here with green manure cover crops is I'm using them to uh confuse Colorado potato beetles I cut strips plant the potatoes I try to do my uh weed cultivation and healing so that the potato plants are are well established and then at that stage I knock down the Ryan vet and usually by then it's late June early July and that's the first the potato beetles even come into the field I don't need to have a big Mulch on the ground like I would put on the tomatoes I just want to have some contact with the straw on the potato plants with this method uh I've never had to spray more than twice and uh for potato beetles and and and at best it's a spot spraying I don't spray the whole field because good portions of the field there won't be any potato beetles at all it's usually on an edge of where they'll come in to the end of the rows or an edge of where a field of Sol acious crops were the preceding year and they'll find a few a few rows this is my sper which is the uh primary tillage tool on the farm I use it for incorporating pretty much all of my cover crops it uh needs to operate at slow speed and so that's you know one disadvantage is that when you're bringing that organic matter in the soil and that I can't move very fast because it's a lot of biomasses chopping in there but once it's in the ground and I've made a couple of passes then I can go in with a Fiel culator and do a very rapid pass make a nice smooth seed bed and then I'm ready to go it's like a number of shovels and just cuts clouds does a good job of of chopping the straw into the soil but you get nice clouds in that and and then over time that they can break down slowly so it's much gentler on your soil structure and doesn't oxidize all that organic matter you're trying to bring into the soil when I first came here there was a rototiller so that's what I learned on for primary tillage but uh I really didn't like what it did the soil really beat the soil up like an egg beater and I and I heard about uh spers being much better for soil structure and better at incorporating biomass not oxidizing it so this seemed to be a much better Implement for improving my soil quality and that's really you know important for me is is uh doing the best I can for my soil",
