  "text": "[Music] jumbo kaributana to this organic strawberry farm this is your farm in geroge and i hope you're learning something and welcome to our strawberry farm we are located along waiaku a place called odero corporation in this episode i'm going to teach you how to manage your pests and diseases organically machacha let's do this [Music] the first pest and disease is what we call leaf spots now this spot is caused by three ways number one through overhead irrigation because when water gets in contact with your leaves you're definitely going to get leaf spots it can also be caused because of rainfall i can also because at extreme scenarios because it's caused because of red spider mites but you'll find red spider mites for farmers who are growing strawberries inside a greenhouse this armed in an open field system is because of the rain so how do we prevent and manage this thing so if you're doing irrigation using overhead irrigation i'll tell you this stop doing overhead irrigation and either adapt either to drip irrigation or do it manually in case you have this because because of the rain all you have to do is just prune off the leaves and throw them away in case you're in a greenhouse and you've actually been faced because of red spider mites and of course the leaf spots you need to use a biological control now remember this there's organic they're synthetic and it's biological let me just explain briefly what biological is biological is using one pest feeding on another pest or one animal feed or another animal think about the ladybird a ladybird will feed on aphids that is biological so there's a biological control from cooper kenya that is called spidex so the spidex is what you're going to come and apply on your leaves and it's actually live organisms that's actually going to feed on your red spider mites we have tested this in different forms of one farm is in cabarack another farm is in nanuki and the results we have actually seen after two weeks all your spider mites are actually dead because the spy decks actually works and see the good thing about it you could hear what you're saying you can also link you up with these farmers we'll talk to them hear it from the horse's mouth itself but with the spiders and the leaf spots that is a done deal the second pest and disease is actually going to affect your throats there's what you call anthrax and botritis so your fruit will look like this honey you're probably wondering ew looks very bad yes it looks very bad it's a good fruit the fruit started off very well but because of anthracnose this actually happens so for you to avoid anthracnose now remember anthracnose is more like a fungal disease so and because once once the food gets in touch with water you're actually going to get such kind of a challenge so you're probably wondering somebody who's inside a greenhouse they'll be smiling all the way to the bank yes they will bother about the outside farmer it's still okay what i'd encourage you to do get your greenhouse paper you see what i've done the low tunneling system i'm going to come and take my greenhouse paper and cover on top of my beds this way if it's raining my fruits are not going to get in touch with water so antarctica's end botrytis is avoided okay and it's something i'd encourage you and every other farmer please in case that happens to you do not be alarmed okay because it actually works the third pest and disease is from slugs yes the difference between slugs and snails i know you probably thought it's one of the same thing but it's not so for slugs what they do they actually come and end up eating the entire fruit or eating a portion of the fruit that becomes a waste so what you are doing so far we're doing our research with the secret to actually try to understand what really causes the slug to come and eat the strawberry fruit what really attracts the strawberry also attacks the slug to this strawberry fruit it is something that really puzzles quite a number of farmers but yes we have tried our own concoctions that well it works but you want to get definitive results and that you're going to get from your cpa so again we'll definitely keep you updated on that and even if you follow us on facebook or facebook page but also in the description and even the comments will definitely ensure to tell you the results that we found from isupe slugs is one thing that you actually want to avoid in your strawberry plantation open field farmer i know you're probably wondering what about the birds yes birds are a blessing but they're going to be a blessing to you so much once they start eating your fruit so how do you get rid of birds now the first thing do not kill birds again i repeat do not kill the bugs so what you need to do you need to prevent them from eating your strawberries so how we do it we're going to use netting so you can use one a button it you can use a sheet net if you're going to use a shade net ensure your shade net is 35 percent go to the shop and tell them i want cheddar that is 35 percent third one you can also use a fishing net fishnet also you can also use the fishing net but also you have to look at it in terms of the cost also okay if not you can also decide to use galvanized chicken mesh okay it'll actually work and remember the key word is galvanized chicken mesh why i say is because let's say trains and elements you do not want that rust to actually fall on your beds or even on your plants or even on your fruits okay but once you've covered the strawberry plants with a different kind of netting you've actually prevented birds from coming to eat your fruits buds are notorious but remember they're also hungry at the same time so for you you need to be very careful and be careful in terms of don't let those birds just come and eat the hard labor that you've done okay prevent them by using the netting system remember you can either do it overhead or you can try to use it the low tunneling system the choice is yours but personally for us the strawberry farm will always choose to do the low tunnel system because of cash money wise it saves us a lot of money in our next topic we are going to learn about costing you're probably wondering so how much does this cost how much will it entail for me to actually set up my own strawberry farm how much am i going to get the mathematics is in our next episode before that make sure you like share and hit that subscribe button because trust you me i hope you're learning something new see you in our next episode you",
