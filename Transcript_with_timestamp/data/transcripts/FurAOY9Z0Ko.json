  "text": "hello everyone and welcome to the growing lentils in 2019 webinar my name is Pru cook I worked at the birch of cropping group and I coordinate the GRDC funded southern pulse extension project this project is delivered by a consortium of researchers agronomist farming systems groups growers and pulse experts to increase the knowledge of growers and advisers on sustainable pulse production improving the southern regions capacity to maximize future growth and profitability opportunities the purpose of today's webinar is to give you an existing lentil growers a snappier overview of what to consider this season to best set you up for success now before we start the presentation just a couple of quick housekeeping items in relation to using the webinar software I've muted everyone's microphones so please keep yourself on mute so that there's no background noise that might distract the presenters and we will have a question-and-answer session at the end of today's session but please feel free to submit questions at any time you can do this by clicking on you should see a speech bubble icon it should be at the bottom of your screen but it might look different depending on the device that you're accessing this webinar on today if you hit that a text box will appear and you'll be able to type in a question and from there you can either send that through to myself if you want it to be anonymous or you can send it to everyone and it can be answered publicly now this webinar is being recorded if you can't stay for the entire thing or if you have any technical issues or if you'd like to share this and then the recordings will be made available on the GRDC website next week but you can also flick me an e-mail or give me a call my contact details will be at the end of the webinar and we can get you a copy of the recording a little bit earlier if you would like now just to quickly help our presenters I've got two quick questions that I'd like to ask you to get a gauge on who's joining us today now hopefully you should popping up on your screen some questions that you should be able to click an answer if you can't see them you get to take a little break for now but it's just two questions asking your experience with lentil growing and where you're dialing in from today so we'll just give you a quick moment to have a look at that and answer those questions we've got some agronomist joining us today and got some of the lower EP your can did nor we've got a few from the miscellaneous category we've got some high rainfall zone growers from southern bit core sa a few more agronomist and a couple people who either can't see the question or aren't wanting to participate I'll give you a few more moments and then what we'll do I'll just share the screen and we can start straight into our presentation for today okay now I'm going to introduce you all for our first presentation is dr. Jason Brown - it was agriculture Victoria you've baked in Horsham Jason heads up the GRDC southern pulse karana me program and has over 20 years experience in the pulse industry over to you Jason I'll just turn your microphone on and Jason will provide us always in a grotto my update are you there Jason just having a little bit of trouble with Jason's audio right now are you there Jason alright what we might do is we might skip forward while we sort out Jason's audio issues we might skip forward and go on to our next presenter who is unless Jason unless you're there now no okay Jason will try and sort out your audio and that meat we'll just make sure that was your audio are you there yes you are there excellent ah just let me quickly provoke through your slides and we will just revise the order ever so slightly and we'll come back to Jason a little bit later all right so dr. Navin eat over was is drivers from siding today and his research centers on improving weed management in high intensity break crop farming systems and today is going to give us an update on controlling rye grass and lentils nap net over to you thank you so much Poole good morning everyone good it can I just interrupt for a moment you're very very quiet can I ask you to speak very loudly and very close to your microphone please okay yeah good morning everyone today it is my pleasure to share my research experiences with you regarding rye grass resistance and its management in hi break crop intensity rotations including lentils first of all I would like to thank GRDC and sorry for jointly funding this research work next like this next slide please my talk today will be focused on previous like this previous slightly is proof previous previous then the previous slide - yeah yeah thank you today my talk will be focused on where we are heading for controlling ryegrass in hi break crop intensity rotations and secondly what are the potential options for controlling rye grass in break crops I will extend this information based on my results from the results research trials on lentils next slide please next slide please as we all know that there has been a significant increase in area under break crops including canola and pulses in South Australia in the last one and a half decade as is shown in this graph this has resulted from improved agronomic practices higher our harvest efficiency availability of new herbicide tolerant varieties like TT canola Clearfield canola and xt lentils and higher pulse prices next slide please in particular like the combination of xt lentil varieties and its high market price have become appealing to many South Australian growers with a record 185 thousand Hector's area sown - lentils in 2019 and which was almost double than what was 5 years ago in 2012 next slide please slide please this change in cropping system has raised new industry challenges for us heavy reliance on Group A chemistry which includes plethora in particular in Bray crops has contributed to increase dry grass resistance to these Group A herbicides consequently herbicides with different modes of actions which includes herbicides from Group D J's and case are used to manage dem resistant ryegrass in break crops therefore there is a need for careful management of these alternate pre-emergent herbicides to minimize selection for resistant build up to any single mode of action in hi break crop intensity rotations next slide please to have better understanding of resistance in ryegrass in high break rock presentations a focus paddock survey was initiated in 2019 in that survey a total of 45 paddocks were selected across different regions of South Australia and these selected paddocks had either either at least two EMA tolerant break crops such as P be a hurricane xt lentil or Clearfield canola in the last five years or the paddocks head to Nanami break crops from conventional lentils conventional canola TT canola field peas chickpeas flavor beans or lupins in the last five years and next slide please this slide shows the results of herbicide resistance screening from these focus paddocks here blue bars represent confirmed resistance and green bars represent ryegrass populations with developing resistance as this graph shows rye grass was found to be resistant to sulfonylureas and dense in almost all the paddocks further high level of resistance to inter VIX and try flora Lane was also recorded in rye grass populations but the key concern is that a total of 46 percent of rye grass populations were confirmed resistant and another 21 public 21 percent populations were developing resistant to plutonium in these high break rock intensity paddocks such resistance levels limits the effectiveness of break crops as useful rotational tools in our systems next slide please further this graph shows that one quarter of the rye grass populations were resistant to boxer gold and one third populations were found to have started developing resistant to another important herbicide Sakura in these systems the only positive outcome was that all the ryegrass populations were sensitive to Group D prappas amide next slide please so when I look back into the history of herbicides usage in those paddocks the ranked first paddock in resistance to group J&K herbicides had two times boxer gold and three times sakura used in the last five years and the second rank paddock insistance had three times boxer gold and one time sakura is used in last three years itself so this is the scale of those group and j herbicides being used in those high intensity play crop systems which is really concerning in the net shell i would say that the concerns for i grass control have now not limited to group a and group b herbicides in break crops distance development in rye grass to boxer gold and sakura is even more concerning for sustaining these pre-emergent chemistry's in our high break crop intensity systems including lentils next slide please next please sorry now I would like to discuss results from research trials conducting during last two years for ryegrass management in lentils next like this next slide please in 2017 to research previous light these previous yeah in 2017 to research trials were conducted at heart in Mid North and Maitland in short Peninsula investigating potential new herbicide ultra with active ingredient kharbut amide and this service ID is a dimer product and belongs to new group ii and is currently in development so the result shows that all true provided similar level of ryegrass control as achieved with pro pisa might Sakura and boxer gold and further ultra provided 98% reduction in high grass seed set over unweeded control at both asides further I would like to mention that in both our trials I had P be a hurricane xt lentil variety at both the locations next slide please similarly in 2018 at heart ultra proved as effective as propose amides for controlling ryegrass in lentils next slide please next slide please yes this is a very interesting slide in the second research trial at Maitland in 2018 ultra proved to be the best herbicide for I grass control followed by propecia amide however box of gold and Sakura did not control ryegrass effectively and were not different to unweeded control for rye grease rye grass seed set as shown in this graph see this trial side paddock was the second-worst paddock for resistance to group J&K herbicides in my focus paddock survey discussed earlier so this illustrates that the magnitude of impact can result from the loss of these important herbicides box of old and sakura in lentils due to resistance buildup in rye grass next slide please so Al and I would like to conclude that it is confirmed that resistance to the in addition to distance in history herbicides rye grass has started whelping resistance to group J&K herbicides in high breaker of intensity systems and expected registration of all through in 2020 will make it an important tool along with group deep rope is amide for controlling regressing break off phase especially lentils and we need to make it sure that rotating mode of actions which we use in high context to break crop rotations we need to rotate those herbicides to delay the herbicide resistance build-up and especially we need to use group D professor MIDEM break prophase and save group J and case for cereal crop phase at the end I would like to thank all the participants for listening to my presentation thank you so much thank you very much nav nation my apologies for my poor driving at the beginning of your presentation there it was a bit crazy in the control room with some audio issues and my phone and other bits and pieces so thank you for putting up with that there now Jason we're going to try for you again can we hear you this time Tunisia it is Sun yes we can go from that fantastic sorry now that and I've got me no idea why close it dump it outside Jim a what I'll take full responsibility for it and say it was my fault Jackson no I wouldn't do that that's right all right straight Oh what about them I've done wrong okay great anyway okay we take such other steps back and just look at a bit of an overview of the season the other thing slide when we get there we're going to just show you a bit of an overview of some of the trial work that we were running up by in Manali so the 12 side up at Olien last year we'll go back to the openings like this a nice one to the highlights the other one before that through we're jumping too fast you still with us yep see come back okay we'll start here and okay we keep jumping well am i the first slide we're just talking about is we're going to trial them and there's a particular interest obviously as we move up into the Mallee to see how we can better produce lentils across sandy soils and the image on that original first slide was just looking at an overview of the site and then some child we're running on ten fuels where we're looking at a whole range of options from herbicides through to nutrition and even potentially amendments working with Michael Moody up there at am and that plot you can see in the foreground here is actually one of the new potential lines being tested and really highlights where lentils have gone to an accent and ability to have and that ability to grow in malli type conditions next slide please so interview 2018 I probably can be summarized in a couple of words as dry and frost for us certainly in Victoria but I cropped a lot of a lot of southern Australia there were some good patches obviously but pretty much a summary here Victoria was dry and frost so the photos on the left-hand side they're actually from the wind rap and some high value ground down in the Weaver and that is what our lentils look like and reflect on the yields in just a moment and then over on the right hand side of the slide we're just highlighting some of the frost issues then I've got some chickpeas in the photo there but time obviously the price down instead of the lentils down bottom there and you know this is from a third alien and you know we were dealing with 80 90 percent frost damage in many of the trials one of the key that came out of this prosper that was really really interesting in that photo there you can see two lines and on the left there you can see a line with that real yellow and you get from the vegetative cross damage similar to what we've seen in PD a hurricane many times over the last few years and there were some questions going around in industry is that related to the anytime straits a particular transformation event that is being utilized to provide us with any tyrants well the two lines you've got there photos have any tolerance in them as you can see on the right hand side the line that we've got there is showing pretty much no vegetative damage from frost I'm not sure the actual impact the vegetative frost is is actually huge on yield but certainly looks a lot better at least many plants remain green after a frost event during the vegetative phase so despite that yodels a huge amount of frost damage next slide please so just a quick snapshot of the season lower yields generally across the board for us so to give you an idea Victorine yields alien and courier in that point 1.2 up 2.5 range and Horsham went to a 26 so nothing really exciting to speak of low lower prices obviously everyone knows what their prices give jump up a bit through December and January and so there were the occasional good catch on prices but certainly the overall trend was on the lower end of lentil prices which generally follow the long term average for prices low disease pressure throughout the industry and something we've always got to maintain and watch but generally the especially but also girls doing a great job in terms of managing at this point of time and obviously due to the frost events poorer grain quality although again it's amazing how well things got cleaned up with seat cleaners and also in the harvesting operations so even if you see a sample like we've got there which I think we estimated to be about 50 percent across now means we're able to bring that back to about a five or ten percent frost damage just through and simple cleaning equipment so so yeah and what's really great by the industry to clean up or you have let's move on to the next slide so I decided to highlight this and just to remind ourselves of what the value of some of these crops are over longer-term and this is just based on our malli site so it doesn't include the Wimmer and so the lentil numbers would be much higher again if we looked at land tools in the Wimmer long term so it's just a reminder that obviously there's a huge variation from year to year based on price and you and so the figures you see here are based on the prices received in December January of the year of crops grown and based on the average view of that site not based on the highest yielding variety but on the average yield of that site in that particular year and Theriot is a low rental or medium low medium rental center and owns a bit lower than Korea and so obviously highlighting the variation we'll go over the years then and last year was the only negative year we've really had in terms of gross margin on lentils in that time period we've been up there so just a reminder that if we just click on to the next flick and if you look at the long term averages there so lentils and chickpeas stack up rather well in terms of the economics because sometimes yeah we tend to just remember the last couple years and or remember some of the issues that we might have had in just even just in last year and forget about the longer term story and how well we've done out of these pulses in the longer term move on to the next one please today in terms of new varieties we have PD a hallmark this will be a really good replacement for PD a hurricane fits into that medium seed size category has a same tolerance to group their size but with improved vigor and botrytis grade mold resistance so certainly has a good fit there and some improvements in terms of tolerance to soil types so may even provide additional benefits in some of the malleus all sites will run into Quarren assault issues and overall higher yields so higher than hurricane less than jumbo two but certainly a great replacement in terms of the any tolerance coming through and the photo down here so that's not meant to say PDA debo to the top there that's just an any herbicide applied across those two two plots and obviously you can see the damage here in jumbo two compared to the hallmark in a season light last year just highlighting the differences that we're going to have so let's move on to the next slide so if you right opportunities I just wanted to bring this one forward because it's actually highlights hallmark as well so if you look towards the left hand side of the graph there this is some longer term Mally granules across Ian and curry a further two thousand and sixteen to eighteen Joe encompasses a wet year a drought and something somewhere in between so quite a variation there and you can sort of see where how much sits out in terms of the percentage of the site mean doing really well compared to other varieties and also highlights the opportunities that there are with breeding lines coming through with that CPR 16:04 coming out at the top of the chart there with a next slide please so moving up to 2019 considerations and obviously we're going to highlight disease because if it does rain we're going to get it again so if we start over on the right hand side we try to frame old obviously varieties fletching can come in pretty important there so you can get some quite big differences between the variety of jumbo two which has got full resistance to try to screen off as compared to a bolt but that doesn't mean the disease can't be controlled so there's some really good strategies out there now utilizing carbon ISM and other products to control botrytis grain order and happy to chat about that later on obviously a spectator blight but again most of our varieties these days have a reasonable level of a skew quite a blow the key thing that we want to message our industry there is to keep an eye on what's going on so have a look at the varieties out there and if it is a resistant or a moderately resistant variety and you're seeing too much s excited by the net make sure it's being reported back to the state body so here in Victoria obviously with us in agriculture Victoria and Josh Manning and then in South Australia through Jenny Johnson and her team there at SIA T so it's about watching what's happening with that's toccata blight because we are seeing some changes obviously with the varieties out there and I just wanted to touch on we do occasional accessibility Nia and those high disease high diseases next slide please you so here side damage in some regions this will be more relevant than others so if we've had a dry summer six a summer you carryovers from a group like RIT B type chemistry particularly Group B if you're not growing any time for lentils like hallmark or hurricane group I've certainly seen that many times particularly in the Malley environment I remember going through some of those drought years with two and three years afterwards we were seeing group I residue damage in lentils so I know many people are well aware of these issues but it's worthwhile reminding myself and looking back in the paddock history you know and even up in trial where we came unstuck last year in a paddock where we've been told that group eyes weren't a major issue but then when all the records came out we found out that they were a bit more of a major issue and certainly a limiting factor for us even the winter last year and then obviously group C damage particularly around the post on pre immersion or IBS application it's an ongoing issue at Landstuhl so it's all of our sowing depth placement all those sub issues at the moment obviously we don't have significant levels of torrents to group C chemistry next slide please the other thing I haven't touched on in terms of 2019 considerations obviously is price and just being aware of the price Janene like other kind on that in as part of her presentation coming up so like all pulses have selection and management are absolutely critical to growing successful lentils where possible growing them into a paddock where there is retained stubble they do benefit from retain residue and in particular standing residue improving harvest ability but also improving yields we've got data going back several years which indicate you know growing into stable versus burns double can potentially result in yields increased by 20% or more particularly mentals and that's not including hub stability benefits you get from standing residue so paddock selection is critical knowing your background history in terms of herbicides and then yes I'll fight understanding of cell types and she walked varieties my village site so that leave naturally on into variety choice and what you're trying to achieve so obviously is very Fiorini chemistry has been in the background that paddock it's probably going to be the good offices is stick to your group feet of tolerant lentils or eating entire mentors like year hallmarks and hurricanes and but obviously getting into some of the more high disease risk areas jumbo to its strongly into that and but then if you're confident in terms of controlling disease now it's a lower risk pba both has a strong feed some of the more mixed soil types and a type of fit in certain regions we've certainly system benefits on some of the acid soils so yeah there are it's worthwhile thinking through variety choice very carefully before you jump into growing lentils obviously starting out of season how do disease strategies in place before season really important to make sure that those fungicides are locked in before we start season you've got a product on hand the last thing we want is to get canopy closure you wanting to put out a spray of control try to spray mold and you can't get product because you know there's no supply in Australia we haven't run into those issues in the past so just keep that in mind obviously pre-emergent herbicides have touched on previously setting rates the longer-term lesson there is that with some of these newer varieties like a jumbo two is another more bulky more vigorous we can get away with slightly lower setting rates particularly on the wide array spacing so when we're out of 12 and 16 inch row spacings but a lot of guys actually are operating on in Victoria now dropping back to in that 80 to 100 plants per square meter certainly we haven't seen too many your losses it's when you get below 80 parts you start to see a bit more of a drop-off in terms of AM yields and inoculants and nutrition so look we know a lot of girls don't always inoculate but if we're going to grow lentils in a new area where we haven't grown them before on sandy soils or even started to push on some of the more marginal acidic soils then these things are absolutely critical and nutrition goes along solid with that ultimately working on-site a good agronomist is essential for a lentil crop so I'd really encourage growers to the yeah getting in touch with their local agronomist and working closely with them and learning what works in their regions because it's very hard to sort of sit here and talk broadly we can give you the broad ideas but there are tweaks for each region and that's where the agronomist come in and then I'm always open for a phone call I love learning about other parts of the industry so well that will make me you're not true sex is very appreciated now we'll move on to our very last presenter for today and next we have Janine's a mess Janine is the commercial manager at PVCC near Horsham and PDC specializes in the production of seed and grain processing and packaging through to marketing sea and grain both domestically and internationally Janina I'll turn your microphone on also I think I'm experiencing a significant lag between that between me hitting the next site slide button the next appearing on the screen so just give me a couple of seconds for the next slide to pop up and hopefully should all work are you there to me yes it's my music hello you're mister guy good to go hello crew okay I'll just there we go all right good morning everyone just before I start I just might follow on a little bit from Jason having mentioned about the new hallmark XT lentil just a bit of a quick update on seed supply there was we had significant seed crops across New South Wales Maui Wimmer and in South Australia as well adults here was bit of a challenging year for seed production but overall we reason with frost at the end reasonably happy have a good supply to suit everybody's needs but it was we're just managing a bit of juggle with a number of stores that do cover orders and just confirming final quantities so we thought we were sold out in January but then we were right in February and perhaps we're down to about five ten percent of supply left so if there's anyone who's still interested in that particular variety of there's potentially a little bit of seed left they look main Lots just to do orders fairly soon as we're working through the lists and dispatching the moment so I just thought I'd give you a quick update on that one to the minute and yes I will move forward into talking about where the markets at and just a bit of a background I just touch a bit more as Jason's mentioned our current situation in Australia with our lentil production supply if you look put on the slide there there's a graph of the last couple of decades of how the Australian lentil area has grown particularly in the last say five years with the introduction of the new PV a lentil varieties which has enabled expansion into a range of areas and high prices certainly drove the uptake of lentils from the sort of 2014-15 familiy to double the area in 2017 with the high prices got everyone excited we've certainly dropped back a bit this year to two hundred and sixty five thousand hectares there's still the third largest area for Australia so we still got a significant area of growing to lentils an important crop in our region that certainly the production will be down going to market this year with generally low yields so I'm not just sort of put perhaps an estimate of 1.2 tonne per hectare overall I'm looking at a bit over 300,000 tonne potentially supply sort of various guesses around that so that's sort of a rough idea and it's always been hard to know exactly what's on farm in terms of old season tonnes but certainly a crop the people store for good reason when the prices are low so there's any guest emits about what might be there but even if I mean it's probably immaterial until people sell it as to how important that quantity is when they're prepared to sell it ok so next slide please proof so looking ahead to I guess the world situation when certainly is strong into strong effects on pricing and demand we're seeing in I mean Canada's are big competitor with red lentils producing very large quantities and having a big impact on the market and they've actually had fairly strong exports over their winter period because if they've got from the previous few years I've certainly stored a lot have a lot of stockpile so same sort situation they're produced a lot people their productions gone up as prices went up a few years ago and they've got a bit of surplus to move and they've certainly been actually moving a bit over their winter months and into the market the US has been seeing a bit slower a little bit been a bit slower people not prepared to sell and our the percentage of exports going out of lentils from Australia has been a lower percentage then perhaps we would we've seen in the past from the sort of October to January period whether we're down at about just a small percentage whether it's 20 percent or depending what the total volume is at the end whereas sometimes at this time of year where anywhere between 30 40 plus percent of exports have happened so obviously people don't want to sell that fair enough so little move on to the next slide please print is so without is a low prices of harvest we didn't know where that was going to go but there was some upward movement and coming into January and it was interesting just talking to growers that were you know finding out the prices we're at and when they're at 500 that I know won't sell maybe wait till 600 I might sell but when they got to 600 grows it on all wait close to 700 but never did' so drop back down just yet the market is what the market is it wasn't prepared to make that folk sort of process and so girls prefer happy to store for a while in those in those periods we saw that the jumbo type was often sitting at a premium 20 40 dollars or so above the medium-sized lentil just the variety that was selling and was required and then again there was another proof that the small lentils were at a discount to that down on that as well though I was sort of maybe 80 hundred dollars off the jumbo type in terms of what was being offered at the time over the past two months so we certainly have a lot of product stored some moved markets just very slow there's not really much happening there is I guess anything that is happening whether it's were we've had had we have had frost events causing some you know high damage as Jason mentioned in some areas of you know maybe up to 30 percent effective with frosted so very poor quality lentils and I guess I mean there's some currently selling for stocks that maybe around 420 mark has been up to 450 per turn but this is really it's not a typical situation we will get these sort of prices the top feed lentils often it's a bit lower in other years but because we've been underpinned by this higher stock feed market I mean really we've got cereals being sold for about 400 or so the stock foods as well so that they're pretty pretty I guess it worked in fairly well those sort of quality lentils that aren't normally going to export that they've been able to have a market to go to okay next slide please proof so just thinking about you know if you're storing illegally we've got new season lentils old season lentils sitting from previous year or years just be thinking about they're going to be preps in quality storage silo storage keep them in good condition if there's some product in silo bags that's that's not much of a long-term option whether they can keep the quality right or not I'm just going to think about those considerations and when we're going with if we're not sure when going to the market we never know don't have a crystal ball to sample the market is going to do and think about when we do market it we've got the the lentils do slowly start to turn color over time which is they're just a visual indicator to the market that well what how does what are the quality of lentils going to be so visually you know you're fresh season off the header it looks really a nice clean bright lighter brown color and after about six months they start they just start to turn a little bit sort of that six to twelve months they come more in line with the product that's you know up to maybe two and a half years old that and when they start getting bit over two and a half years old oh really there's another sort of significant change in that color so it's just thinking about if your marketing old and new season not mixing them together and perhaps marking them as a separate parcel because really it's about how the market will how they present the market in as appearance and at the end of the day the red lentils are milled and it comes can come down to how uniform they split so if you've got new season all season you'll have different properties in terms of split ability I'm occurring so that's why the market would like it separate to go into the middles and just dealing with off grade lentils just taste indicated before you know the potential for cleaning up to a potentially up to higher grades depending how much frost you can get out if there was frosted quality in there if it was 30% has only got 210 might not make much of a difference into a market but if it got it up to 5% or under might make more of a difference in terms of finding a better market than a 10% off grade so just need to investigate - those are the products whether there is cleaning options that will improve it significantly or not and you know how we're a market option might be or how long you might have to store it to make that make a higher-quality grade okay next slide please fruit so in the global terms where the market is going to go it's on everyone's chatter it's talked about a lot what's happening in India what's going to happen I think it's month months of chatter and speculation and because it is a very important market it is the second largest country in the world population wise and their key food item is pulses or including a large amount of lentils which up so I put those pictures on the side lentil dials is a key food they eat every day and that it says it's a large population also produces reasonable quantity of themselves but we over the years of cent percent all of our product to that market and then so at the moment politics is getting in the way some time ago they the Indian country had imported a lot of lentils they had huge stocks and in the end they impose some tariffs to reduce the quantities coming in and protect the local local farmers from a lot of imports coming in higher quality imports and so that sort of put up a bit of a barrier to our price into those markets and continue our bit of uncertainty now in exports to that country so it's all just on hot seems like it's all just on hold until so this at the government election which happens in late May and to the government the local farmer vote is very important so I don't want to upset the farmers before the election so this almost be a bit of a hold this space until that happens and clears everyone's wanting that to happen and be done with and but who knows what happened how long it might take up the election for things to change but at the end of the day the balls got at the considerations will start coming to play that do they need to keep both it's a well we're going to start needing to books and lentils and buy some but when because price is king their harvests will happen sort of April May the area production is area is little bit down there's speculation about their production is their drought effects or not tool what are their supply stocks at so there's many different factors that are sort of all in the air at the moment so it's bit of a hold this base to where the market is going to go until all these things come to light but at the end the day as I said though people still need to eat lentils and other pulses but it's at what point the buyers say well we're going to be running short a product or we need to buy my side things in and whether the market will turn then time will tell the next slide please so just lastly I just thought I'd just put up a ten year of just priced lentil price trend it's just a if an idea that as in all pulse markets products that the dollars work in cycles and it's just hell on the cycle takes and Alicia gives be an idea that we always say well what goes down must come up that then must go down again and same with growers production when the prices were going up everyone produced increased area are here and in Canada the US response to high prices and then the next year they dropped down again so production drops and the supply and demand cycle continues so I guess at the moment I guess there's a closing comment would be well we've been ratted down on the cycle so at some stage it will go up it's just a matter of time thank you thank you everyone thank you very much Jeanine that fantastic alright guys I will now move into the Q&A component of today so this is the opportunity if you woulda like you can type in a question so if you run your mouse over your screen hopefully you'll see a speech bubble icon pop up somewhere if you hit that a chat box will appear and then you can type a message into navneet jason or journey so i'll give you a few moments to run through that if you do have any questions please feel free to type them in we don't have any at this stage but while you're thinking about questions to ask and getting them in if you're looking for further information on lentils then GRDC grow notes are an incredibly comprehensive resource that you can access through the GRDC website also the GRDC southern pulse extension project which this webinar is a part of has a number of activities occurring throughout 2019 which will continue to bring you the latest in pulse information one of our key activities is that have a network of discussion groups across Victoria and si which is targeted at new pop you on your pulse growers now those locations are on the screen if you're knew one of these locations and you'd like to get involved with me an email my contact details will be at the end of the webinar and I can get you in touch with the group coordinator we'll also be having prop walks at southern pulse agronomy trial site so that's the child that Jason was discussing earlier on and they'll be happening right across the region in late winter and earlier spring so keep an eye out for those activities and also this is the fourth webinar that we've run this week so one was the most technical difficulties so I apologize for that we have one to go which is chickpeas which will be happening at 12 o'clock Victorian time today so that's 11 34 people in Si if you would like to access webinars for the recordings of the webinars that we run previously so that's for Seder beans vet infield peas please let me know we can get you in touch with those and please feel free to join in with the chickpea webinar which will have happening after this one but if you've liked today's event and you don't mind the webinar format please feel free to suggest other pulse topics that you might like covered in greater depth later on in the growing season and we might look at rolling some out throughout the year I have seen any questions come in at this stage and looking at the time we might wrap it up there but please if you have any other suggestions or requests for things that you'd like to learn about if you have any questions that you think of later please let me know and I can touch base with our experts today but what we do is wrap it up there thank you very much to all our presenters phenomenal presentations today and thank you very much to all of you for participating I hope you all gross magnificent lentils this season thank you very much you",
