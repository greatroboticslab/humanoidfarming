  "text": "all right so let's um get into this um a little bit about my background I am a biologist by trade nothing to do with plant um I worked at the DNA level at Indiana University um I recently retired last year um but everything I've I've learned in terms of fruit growing and stuff has been in the last eight years typically through people who are doing the growing themselves so why fix um this is not something that is common here in the Midwest however there is a demand for fresh DS in the midwest um especially down um where I'm from I I lived in Bloomington Indiana Indiana University and I was also a student at Purdue um a wide diversity of folks in those areas many of them coming from California or warmer regions or countries where figs are common and people eat them every day if you want to get a fresh fig here in the Midwest kind of good right not easy and if you do get them here they've been shipped from California or someplace else and by the time they get here they've been on a truck for months or weeks or whatever and they're not going to be great so we know that there's a demand for fresh digs if you can get them to grow um you can probably command a very good amount of money for what you grow so it is a niche market um and so our goal in this project is to work out the conditions where more farmers can start growing fresh pigs on a small scale scale or bigger scale and provide them to local markets if there will be an interest okay um the beauty of things unlike other fruits and and I'm not going to get into you know the growth of a big and whether not it's really a fruit or not but um if you're growing apple pear Peach um Simon pawpaw whether it's native or non-native you're going to take years before that tree can give you fruit all right so the beauty of fig is you can actually start to get bigs on Oney old's trees um and if if the stars align and the climate is great and everything is is perfect you can actually get a second prop which is called a breva um the the main crop is in the summer fall mostly towards fall um but the secondary crop can be in the spring right the main crop grows on um New Growth from the season the secondary bre cop crop uh grows on last year's growth I won't talk about the breba crop very much but um I can direct you to some reading if you're interested in thats WR way all right so about this project it's a partnership um and the goal in this part this this partnership it it includes three farms and we're looking at um the production of cold hearty fig varieties there's cold cold hearty and not cold hearty so there's two kinds we're looking at zones five and six which covers Indiana and other areas in the north central region and our goal is to kind of try and establish the best conditions for growing those figs and providing new opportunities to you guys as Farmers so those are the main goals and let's talk about what cold hearty figs really mean so a cold hearty fig typically and if you if you've heard of fig Chicago Hardy is probably the one you've heard of the most it grows beautifully you can get fixed if everything the stars align and you don't get an early Frost but then if you get uh temperatures below 20 degrees that thing is going to dive back to the ground and then it just Springs back on it's like a peral comes back year after year ideally we would like to not let it die back to the ground we'd like to get conditions where the above ground part stays alive and gives you a jump start on the next on the year's growth the following year so that you get F more figs and you get figs um before the frost so that's the goal so when we talk about cold hearty figs we're talking about figs that survive and act kind of like as a perennial they'll dive back to the ground they'll come back but we're also going to look at trying to not get them to dive back to the ground that makes sense for everybody all right so the three Farms involved in this project um I'll just call them Farm one Farm two Farm three like thing one thing two thing three and drus um Farm one is my place down in Green County I'm in Salsbury you've heard of the Tulip Trestle that's I'm just like three miles down the road from the Tulip Trestle in the railroad L of my property um we are Zone 6B now we were 6A we've transitioned to 6B because it's getting warmer um Farm 2 um Mimi and Evan uh you heard them speak this morning about the truffles they're in uh par County um which is right up here um and they are now Zone 6A you wore 5B correct yeah and then Zone 5B all the way up in St Joseph at the very top um we're looking at Big growth up there as well all right so the project overview when we wrote this grant uh we said we would do it on multiple Farms that's part of the partnership in the USDA a program um we said we would focus on three three cold hearty varieties the ones that we finally chose were Chicago hardy which is kind of the the one that everyone has heard of the most and is probably grown the most um the uh other one Syrian dark and the third one Abu George um those are all cold hearty varieties and I will get into why we chose them in a little bit um um and then we're testing those both in ground and comparing that to Big thrown in pots so those three varieties growing them in ground and those three varieties grown in pots so the ones in the ground were winterizing them so that they try to survive and don't die back to the ground and then the one the same ones in pots we're putting them into um a protected uh out building or garage and over win again that way a lot of people do this they grow fix and pots in this area especially hobbyists and pull them into their garage they do need to go dormant um but we're looking at the we're comparing the two to see if we can get those field ones to grow and you don't have to worry about dragging pots in and out every year the third component that we said we would look at and I'm not going to talk much about this today because we haven't done a whole lot on this yet is looking at Living mulches that might complement the figs so um can we possibly get a second crop out of that same space um or can we put something in there that's going to protect the soil or provide more nutrients to the soil so depending on your interest there's you know different ways to approach this but we do want to keep the soil protected um and know maybe get another crop out of it something that um might be worthwhile at Market so the three again that we're focusing on are Chicago hardy Syrian dark Abu George um each Farm is growing minimally four if not five of each of those in ground and also in pots um these were recommended To Us by Darren at brambleberry Farm if you're familiar with Darren um and Darren had a number of other cold hearty ones that he started to play around with and he thought might be fun for us so he uh we got several of those from him um and we're just kind of testing them here and there they're not um on all three Farms across the board un Ely but um we are getting a little bit of data out of these as we've uh started growing them Brooklyn dark Brooklyn white brown turkey that's probably the other one that people have heard of the most Gino's black um Lula LSU gold it was created I believe at LSU University or Lis University magbar Hardy which Darren believes is probably Chicago hardy but there's a story behind it um Magnolia Rond de Bordeaux sunflower and Viet de bordo so let's start with the inground fig what did we do so we uh Darren rooted sign messenger if you're not familiar with what that is is when the figs go dormant you collect um Twigs off of them usually oneye old growth and then for figs you can actually root those in sand or a combination of sand and perite or sand and Peete Moss they root very easily and then you start a whole new tree that way so Darren did this for us last winter and we obtained those from him in April of this past year we got them planted the first weekend in June which is a little late but because the project wasn't awarded until um later in the spring we had to go with what we could do um so we planted them the first weekend in June and we planted them with a lot of compost each Farm got a little a little bit different amounts of compost and that was based solely on how we dug the holes so my farm farm one we don't have a tractor we don't have mechanical stuff we dug our holes by hand um so we did not dig them very deep um and we didn't put a lot of compost in Mimi and Mimi's farm farm two and the farm farm three they mechanically dug their holes so their holes were deeper um and so a lot more compost went into those holes just kind of by default mulching we uh or covering the soil the bare soil that was there we did that various ways my farm on Farm one we put down a ton of cardboard and wood chips so that we weren't um getting a lot of weeds and that we were keeping the soil um from being Fried by the this the hot sun uh Mimi you guys did wood chips and straw or straw wood chips for for um the mulching straw was for for the winter yeah and then Farm three they use landscape fabric up there watering typically weekly but you know we had a drought last year and so in some cases we were watering a little more frequently the original goal in the project was to grow all of these trees upright um so that we could then cage them and protect them in the winter um however between the time the Grant was um awarded or actually around the time it was awarded Mimi went to Japan and was able to see some um installations where they're growing figs in an espalier or Cordon style which means you're training them and in this case they're being trained to load to the ground in a horizontal way so that you can protect them a little bit more and they they can benefit from um the soil or the Earth as a thermal mass in the winter time um like a step overhead no so we'll get into what this looks like in a second yeah so Farms one and two my farm and n's Farm um are using this different support system than what we originally said we would do farm three is sticking with the original upright um support system that we'll go into so this is what the Cordon system looks like so um basically we have taken and um hammered down down in a pipe it could be either aluminum or steel um down two feet into the ground leaving one foot above the ground and then um running a horizontal aluminum pipe down the row and then planting um two figs water bottle in my phone these are two figs planting them with in a foot of each other letting them grow up and then letting them train this way along the pole so you're getting bigs coming up training them to go horizontally away from each other and Loosely tying them down not touching the aluminum pipe but just tying them down so they start to train once they're trained um you don't need that pipe really technically anymore but it'll probably stay there for long it um and then you plant two that way and then eight later you plant another two So eventually two coming up are going to meet each other at some point point but we'll keep them pruned and trained so that they're not um interfering with each other we're also if you'll notice so you see cattle panel off to the right um we put cattle panel both on either side of the figs eventually to protect them from Deer this also serves to help us when we do the winterization this was probably the most expensive part of the project but it's a one andone once you do it you don't have to do it again the panels come down very easily so if you want to get in and weed or pick figs um they're 8ot cattle panel and you just tie them down you know tie them to the to the uh the chost you could just easily take those down and get in there and work with the pigs any questions about this so just give a little plug here so this is an example on the right of what a cordon fig looks like so this is one that Dr Lee Reich has um uh posted in his book growing figs in cold climates um it's a very easy read if you're interested uh but he has grown one of his figs low to the ground um you can't see it in this picture he did not use an aluminum pipe to train it along he actually just bent it over and secured it down to the ground there's cheap and easy ways you can do this um and this one's probably been there for quite a while but then you can see new Season's growth shooting upwards about every couple inches and the idea is that fix start to grow on that new growth every year and so you get multiple places and it's easy to go in and just quickly pick those sticks as they grow all D or what what's they're in in Big World I'm wrong I don't think there's any dwarf or semi dwarf pigs so do all the same yeah yeah and you just you're prone and train as you need it won't if you just let them go they're going to get maybe 15t tall oh really and they'll look like a big bush Okay um we'll do the same thing on the on the go 15 they could training for time you know so if they are in a high tunnel you suspend those new growths the stems from the ceiling yes yes um in terms of D Scott the third F uh he do so and that's true for any fruit tree you can you can train a regularly sized fruit tree to be dwarf it's a lot of pruning so if you stay on top of the pruning you can you can manage a tree and keep it keep it small okay I've seen you know I've seen people growing apple trees in a pot for 20 years and they stay small so yeah and you you sourced your um actual starts I guess brand be from brambleberry brambleberry yeah brambleberry Farm in P Indiana um if you Google them you'll find them Darren is free own that they will not ship you have to go visit and it's worth the visits not been to their place um it's a lovely place to visit because they grow all sorts of cool things down there those all came from anars and I I'm happy to share that information I'll give youil all right let's turn to the Potted F fix so again we want to compare inground versus potted um so we did pretty much the same thing what the same size plants oneyear old or slightly less that had been rooted by by Darren at brambleberry we he got we got them in small pots about a four to a liter in size um we kind of kept them in those small pots to get them well established um probably kept them a little too long but we hit that drought in the summer and so it just it was kind of a half dozen or the other we ended up up potting them to 10 gallon pots in early August um we I did not mulch I don't think you mulched them did you put any wood chips or anything on top not initially not initially yeah um but we will definitely be doing that this year you could do wood chips you could do leaf mulch um anything to kind of keep a lot of evaporation from happening um that way you can keep your watering down a little bit and then we watered weekly or is needed just like with the inrs no support system at the moment um if we want them to grow really tall we could add um some sort of U like a bamboo post or something in there to kind of help stabilize those but again you can you can prune and manage them and keep them small and it depends on your goal do they require a lot of water as well you know um I was watering mine so mine was on the west side of an out building so it wasn't on the south side it was on the west side and so it did get some morning shade I think I was watering maybe a gallon once or twice a week each of those mine was on the west mine was on the west side of an building so it was not getting Morning Sun um they were finally getting Sun about um 11:00 or noon they did do really well yours is in full correct yeah yeah yeah and I looking at yours versus m suffer a little more and that is one thing with with the Paw I mean they're great in theory because they're mobile and you can move them around but if you go on vacation or if you ignore them or you forget about them you know they could suffer and so that's one of the reasons why I think it's really important that they get covered with something like wood mulch I can also tell you I have outdoor working cats um and they love it as a litter box so um so yeah so this year I will definitely be covering mine so that The Cats won't get into it and it won't be this moisture loss and those pots are just plastic pots or they're yeah they're heavy industrial molded plastic pots get them from Amazon I think they were remember what we paid I would say for 20 pots it was like $10 a pot and dra yes yeah but they're not they're just about the right size so if you I let mine almost dry out or get you know low moisture so I can pick them up and move them but you know that's a lot on your back so you could easily take a dolly and Slide the dolly in and roll them from place to place as long as you've got something to roll that Dolly on so that's do that there's a a plant shot Nursery not far from where we live they also do landscaping and in the back of it they have what they call a graveyard and that's where they put all the pots that they from their landscaping and anybody can go in and again with no charge oh nice so that might be something all right so let's talk about buling um so one of the goals in the project that we said we would do was try to explore some living mulches um or perhaps a secondary crop that help keep that bare soil from uh drying out and and and losing nutrients um we have not really explored that too much and if you thought what I said earlier all of us kind of did something a little bit different so um my farm the inground uh figs got cardboard couple layers of cardboard followed by um mulch that I just got at the local Nursery so it's a it was aged um uh wood mulch uh Mimi used mulch originally um we'll talk about what we did for winter mulching and protection that's a little bit different with chip mul we also planted the made of strawberry oh on one end okay just to see what happened and it it's there it grows and it it's it pretty much withstands like foot traffic um so I I it was just a test right so as a as a has a ground cover ground cover just to deter weed and I may consider on my property putting in mint or another herb that's more aromatic that will heat graab away um and I do a lot of later but um so another possibility is an herb that might help protect um and also keep some away winterization let's talk about winterization so um we have to protect them in Winter and again one of our goals to see if we can keep those sticks from dying back to the ground Darren all of his figs down at P he never does any winterization and he says all of them die back to the ground so that's kind of our starting point there um I do know people who have winterized their cold their Chicago Hardies and had some success at keeping them from dying back um what we're doing on Farm one and two again we're using that Porton system so we're growing those figs low to the ground that's taking advantage of the thermal mass of the Earth which means they're going to stay a little bit warmer for a little bit longer down close to the ground and then we're covering them with a ton of straw you'll see a picture of this in the moment um for 16 figs that I had in a row it took 10 to 12 bales of straw to give you an idea to cover those Farm three they took a different approach they used burlap um I'm wrong here in saying wire cages they didn't use wire cages I'll St about what they used and they used some leaf mulch to protect we'll show you pictures of what they did and then the pots they got moved into an indoor space you can let these figs stay out they can they can handle a frost they can handle multiple Frosty frosts they just can't handle extended periods below 20\u00b0 so all of us left our P our potted figs outside until late November early December and that's when you do the you really want them out there because you want them to go dormant the figs need to go through a dormy period so you want them to kind of be um exposed to those cold temperatures so they lose their leaves and they go into that dormant phase and then you pull them inside or protect them so inground this is what the ingr ones look like on Farm one and two um you can see we've got mult couple rows here and the cat cattle panels are down for the moment so they could get in there and cover those figs with straw um and again you want to just cover them as much as possible um I learned um that straw settles with time especially when you get snow so you want to put way more straw than you think you need it's going to settle through time um it didn't take as long as I thought it would and I also had um my nieces and nephews help me and the fun family project uh um so it didn't really take long to do it we just got them covered um and then they just stay there all winter long Shing a little nap Farm three um they approach theirs a little bit differently so they've got the landscape fabric they did if you see the top left photo they first kind of wrapped the fs first a little bit um with some burlap and then they um used tar paper which is the roofing stuff it's it's um used for roofs and it's in permeable terrain they used they used a couple toost and they just kind of wrapped it around the toost put tons of leaves down in there and then wrapped again with burlap you'll see that um Carry there on at the bottom left she's wrapping with burlap over the taret paper and then the final step is put a bucket on top but you're not getting ton of ring there are those pred down before they wrapped them um did you say pruned pruned yes cut down yes I don't think so um we'll talk about how much growth they had eventually in if they in future years they might have to yeah because this is first year this first year yeah they they will get into this but um here their Farm I think um I'll show you the tallest one how tall it got but it didn't get above those two posts so all right so what did we observe these first five months I really did not expect I mean we were just hoping that everything would survive simple you're one get everything to to survive but we did I did do some observations on growth um we did kind of check here and there for disease and pest pressure and then of course we didn't really expect to get figs but we were kind of surprised so we'll talk about that all right so growth in year one so those figs started out about this tall okay um um this is Mimi uh she's on Farm 2 Zone 6A this was the tallest fig uh in in the group um this was the LSU gold fig um and so there was a ton of growth on that particular tree most of the trees depending on where they were in the plots grew anywhere from 2 feet to four feet um in one year's time uh the picture on the right is Farm three and I believe that was the tallest F that they had um on on their plot of 16 quite one year right because this is in like early late summer yes yeah so this is went in brown on June first week yep and yeah so they grow fast that's a plus um and so uh this this year I'll go through and do a very um careful analysis of how much grow on each variety so I I was seeing some uh some differences um and I'll kind of mention those here in a second um I in zone in zone 6B Farm one I had the least amount of growth as everybody which is kind of in a way surprising but maybe not because a I didn't use as much compost as the other two farms and B mine was in a really lazing hot field and so I'm thinking that I may consider in the future using maybe a 30% shade cloth during the really hot months just to to give them a little bit of a break we'll see was that in the system where you were trying to before it it was before we before you yeah this is kind of late summer and it wasn't until fall like before the winter that really started training to yes so get them a good growth before this is the tree not shoot off right so IDE start well this is like you know the first few months so I started training after start training in the fall yeah yeah somewhere in there and then we started I think we started training TI it was cold when I started tying them down start cold so they're really flexible yeah yeah they're pretty flexible so you know I I think you tie them down to where you think you know it feels pretty good and I use cotton by the way all cotton just spray and then and then like you come back a week later or two you can tie it down even tighter because you know you trained Stu give just the compost and what do they require they're pretty I think they're pretty forgiving um we have not done soil test that's something I should have done last year we I'll do this um and I I'll actually give you a little bit of insight so um on me so Mimi has the most figs um there's kind of a story behind that I won't go into but um Farm one and farm three we have 16 figs in ground Mimi that iot 4 or something like that yeah okay yeah she's got a lot so she's got the both of the Oddball ones that we have um but on the space that we planted those in I noticed pretty quickly and I'll show this to you in a easier thing um figs at one part of the property are growing really well at the other end they the growth was really short sted and we do know if there was a house or a building on that place yeah so yeah this was the hill to hill now yeah um and it had old house that yeah I've never seen the house it was already destroyed all it had was like concrete P left or whatever so we were going to do the WAP that's what happened right and the price like okay so all this is planted on top of that hill without any uh admendment to the soil other than the compost where we the that was just and so to see this grow right I'm thinking that the area that you had the least amount of growth was probably where the main part of the house might have been sit the both ends so it's really hard for me to say that okay you would think the house was more Central for some reason that's yeah I don't know and I say that because I have black wall not planting we pl we had an old house sitting down and we can we knew where the house was CU we were the ones who took it down we put black walnuts and you can tell exactly where that house was because those trees are 5T and the ones in the perimeter where the house wasn't they're now 20t so you can tell there's a huge difference in what the soil was I mean I sat there for over 100 years so um interesting so oh now that you mention one so we cleared that entire Hillside or the hill thinking we're gon to put in a wall of paint right so they basically raised all of the trees and leaves whatever was in there and there was a huge Walnut W on the North side and actually Matthew lot of wals yeah it's possible there yeah so they may resist don't know we still have around yeah we got that so disease and pest pressure so um I mean pretty this is first year so it's really hard to say um I think the biggest thing that we battled was the drought you know keeping things from frying and that just required a little extra water here there um I never saw any um I mean we got them in late so I think we kind of missed the Japanese beetle phase um did that how that coincide for you yeah no it overlapped because we got them in yeah it was directly at the same time as the Japan be Japanese beetles in our field this the pigs they they didn't seem to like them or something thank goodness they didn't go up to Fig Hill so I mean they're kind of close by but I don't know we'll just have to see that's interesting so then the next question is Big production so in theory oh go ahead I so I'm assuming that the bigs currently are still covered up yes so you really couldn't report on like B I'll talk about that very good question um so before we get to that let's talk about fig production So in theory first year figs should give um should give fix however considering that we didn't get these until the first weekend in June I point I don't think either one of us really expected to get F right fix at all we did we got things so um all three of the main ones Chicago hardy Syrian dark Abu George I observed figs on all of those at Mimi's place um on my place I had a couple figs on Syrian dark um and I think Farm 3 got a couple figs as well I don't know which one they got it was like me they didn't get that many so we didn't really document that too well Mimi's place she also had figs on Brooklyn dark Brooklyn white brown turkey Gino's black Lillo LSU gold and the Magmar Hardy the uh Magnolia is not in her place it's in my place in a pot no figs um Ronda Bordeaux sunflower and vet they were all at one end and that's one of the areas I think it's the soil um so they didn't grow nearly as much and they also didn't produce very many figs so there could be something with the soil there that we need to um check on a little bit closer um the Potted figs I don't think any of the Potted figs or potted fig trees produce figs so that's something worth noting as well and were they planted pots did you just use um compost or what kind of soil we used to be kind of across the board something that we all had access to we just went to Menards and we bought um The Miracle Grow organic and another one just potting soils ra bed bed soils okay so a question for you on the there's a there's a variety I really want to grow but it's I've avoided it because it's Zone 8 n do you know the zones on these and are any of them like specifically a higher Zone that you actually got fruit on um so all of these are considered quote unquote cold hardy so that they they've been tested they you know hobby Growers have been growing them in these scolder climat okay they might not be zon 89 used to I just want that tiger pach one yeah that's really cool looking but I it just seemed like a waste of money if I knew it was gonna die if you have the ability to bring it into a garage it's well worth it okay um there's a guy here in Indianapolis um who grows 50 different varieties on his little Urban plot and he pulls them into a garage every winter and he get Fs on all of them so all po yes y yeah you different varieties so you could definitely do that if you want to bring it inside I mean one's okay I'm not sure right yeah on it but I I I'm not as familiar with these warmer growth ones but they probably need to go through a slight D SC check that all right so here's the Fig I look like okay um one of things that I know Mimi did when she started to see the figs and it was getting really late in the fall you know to kind of enhance rening she actually plucked a lot of the leaves off so they get more sun um Lee Reich in his book talks about you can enhance potentially Quicken the ripening by putting a little drop of oil on the eye so you can see you know like olive oil or something right there at that little point that little eye that supposedly is supposed to help enhance the ripening um but yeah she got fresh shs so that's pretty cool so let's talk um a little bit about thinking outside the box so if you ever write a USC Grant or any Grant whatsoever I've been writing grants for a long time in my capacity at NIU you always want to think what if what if this doesn't work what can be salvaged from this because people who are reviewing grants and they're going to give you money they want to know that it's worth something in some form fashion whether it's education or can you get something else out of this and so when we wrote this grant we really kind of thought about outside the box what happens if we do all of this and we just can't get a lot of right things you know we don't want Farmers to go through all of this and all of a sudden say gosh you know I invested all this money I did all this work and now I have nothing to take to Market so thinking outside the box um we in the grant that we would look at some other value added things that could come out of these figs even if you didn't get right figs or didn't get very many rights so it turns out that you can make some value outed products from um fig trees whether you get ripe or unripe figs or none at all so you can definitely make Jam jams from Ripe figs if you are familiar with uh Dylan Farm they make something called the Frog Jam which is is fig Orange uhr Raspberry G I think it's grape so they blend three different fruits and make this fantastic Jam if you've not tasted it I highly recommend uh going to your grocery store and looking for dilman you can also it turns out make jams from unrip figs and so this is one of those uh made me collected a bunch of unrip figs froze them down um I just got them from her yesterday or today and I'm going to go play around with some recipes I I know of one farm that has made um jam from unrip figs so I'm going to play around with that and see what that comes out to be okay but that's definitely a possibility you can make teas turns out figs whether it's the figs or the leaves are highly highly nutritional there's a lot of vitamins in them a lot of antioxidants um I can direct you to research uh published papers on that if you're interested um you can have you can make a fig leaf tea of just the Fig leaves Alone um I know me you love just plain fig leaf tea um I collected fig leaves off of these figs and I blended them with some herbal uh dried herbal uh things that are often used in peas you're going to get to taste that today um so there's definitely a market there um I talked to um a woman who owns a um she owns an Apothecary but she also has a wild food uh bar in Greenwood it's it's open to the public and they make um they make drinks and they make uh soups and things out of either wild Foods or herbales and I said if we had farmers who could Supply you with fig leaves would you be interested her eyes went oh yes so there are herbalists out there who would gravitate to this in a heartbeat if you produce this um we talked about living mulches that are a secondary crop so let's say you don't want to collect uh you don't want to make jam um but you got another living mulch under there so you could eventually get um two things out of it you get the tea the leaves from the Fig for teas you could um have a secondary crack of something underneath whether it's strawberries or something um else that somebody might be interested in there's also a fourth thing that I I I'll just mention um I don't know anyone doing it but um sober Mak a farm in Bloomington um if you're familiar with thatan Carlos is from South America and in South America they use uh the sap which is a latex like um sap they use that medically for um skin growths warts and things like that just put a little dat of that sap on it and the W disappears so it's actually very traditional down there I'm sure not well researched here uh but something that that could potentially down the line to get if you are allergic to latex then you may not want to be delving into that and if you are allergic to latex the tees are probably fine but you know don't risk it if you are allergic to latex um but you will get to taste some te here in a second all right so I talked about this early on um part of this grant also was an educational component in speaking here today is part of that um our we promised in our grant that we would reach a wide range of of farmers here and that's why I sent that little uh clipboard around if you are a female farmer um a military veteran farming or interested in farming or bipac or you fall into more than one group um if you would just let me know so that um I can give that feedback to s that would be wonderful um we will be giving more updates through the North American fruit explorers and the Indiana fruit nut growers association again we've got stuff up here that you can take from those groups those were probably be via zoom and I think um we'll try to have a field day some at some point next year this is a two-year Grant so we need to do something in the field before the grant is over and then lastly we'll do some feedback you'll give you some feedback on the sampling of the tea today and with that um we want to thank USDA and sah for funding this project I think it's going to be really cool with um offering some new opportunities to far Farmers here in the Midwest the North American fruit explorers um they're the so when you do a partnership they typically want an entity that um kind of supports you so that all the the money routes through them so the North American food explorers graciously offered to do that for us they get nothing out of this they just are the conduit through which everything goes and then the Indiana fruit and nut Growers assoc nut Fruit Growers Association um again they they help support um all of our local fruit nut growing farmers and so um I I want to thank them too because they are allowing us to publish some stuff in in their journals and give talks and things like that so if you want to reach me my phone number is up there um I don't usually answer my phone you have to leave a message um you can also email me or you can reach me either through NX or the Indiana net Fruit Growers I'm the president of both and I'm the one that sees most of those emails so [Music]",
