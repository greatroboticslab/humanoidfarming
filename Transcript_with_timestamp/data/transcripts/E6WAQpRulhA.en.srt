00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,240
in this video we are going to look at a

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,119
few key words that you will come across

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,199
throughout

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,640
ecology let's start by looking at the

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,199
whole thing the ecosystem an ecosystem

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,160
is made up of all the communities that

8
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:28,279
live in it every single organism from

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,679
Big to small and lots of environmental

10
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:34,760
factors like sunlight shade the Woodland

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,800
streams and other things an ecosystem is

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,879
defined as a biological community of

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,120
interacting organisms and their physical

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,559
environment a habitat is an area or

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,399
environment in which an organism

16
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,760
naturally lives so the Woodland in this

17
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,360
example it describes the geographical

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,239
area occupied by the ecosystem whereas

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,760
the ecosystem is the interactions

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,960
between everything living within it as

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,399
well as the non-living

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,480
factors populations are all members of

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,760
the same species in the habit had at one

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,239
time while populations describe just one

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,400
species a community is all of the

26
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,400
organisms in multiple species that

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,840
coexist in the habitat at one time so

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,759
the community is the foxes rabbits

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,920
insects plants fungi and everything else

30
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,920
living in the Woodland a niche describes

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,400
the role of a species within an

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,799
ecosystem so a bee's role is to

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,600
pollinate the flowers the rabbit's role

34
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,640
or Niche is to be a small grazing prey

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,720
animal with a very high reproduction

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,479
rate which supports many predators in

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,799
the ecosystem a species is a group of

38
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,200
potentially interbreeding individuals

39
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,280
which do not normally reproduce with

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,799
other species to produce viable fertile

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,720
offspring so here in our Woodland we

42
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,719
have foxes and rabbits that are clearly

43
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,159
different

44
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,479
species but we may also have a few

45
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,880
different species of

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,119
butterfly maybe one lives on the outside

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,399
of the woods and likes light while

48
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,600
another lives deeper in the

49
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,960
wood and because they prefer different

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,280
areas of the wood they don't interbreed

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,920
we will look at what it really means to

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,399
be a species in another video and we'll

53
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,840
also revisit all the words throughout

54
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,400
ecology for now you just need to know

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,160
the difference between a habitat and

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,400
ecosystem a population and a community

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,400
and how species have a niche within the

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,400
ecosystem
