1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,120
as part of the beef and lamb new zealand

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,879
north canterbury farming for profit

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,280
program we've come to

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,440
marshdale with agricom to have a look at

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,759
the diverse pasture species

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,839
cropping program um and i've got

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,440
alastair moorhead here who's going to

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,680
have a bit of a chat to us about the

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,640
importance of species selection

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,039
in these diverse pasture species what to

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,160
sow

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,359
why to sew it and maybe what not to sow

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,399
ow oh thanks sarah so we've just

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,680
finished our field day here and uh

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,600
i'm approaching mid-april and we're in a

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,239
complex diverse pasture that we created

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,200
as part of a diverse pasture project

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,039
that involves

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,440
five different farmlets all

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,280
with elements of diversity uh including

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,360
a 50 year old

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
pasture that has been untouched and then

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,760
has naturalized over time

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,360
so i've got a piece of paper all names

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,879
on it because actually we put in about

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,920
28 species

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,600
and for me uh it's probably easier to go

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,680
through the list and

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,280
and look at what's around us a little

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,920
bit too but to

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,000
understand why we chose to do what and

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,720
what elements we came to play

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,439
here and then at the end acknowledge

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,200
things that are

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,960
definitely wouldn't do again both from

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,560
the financial input to putting them in

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,920
but also the environmental damage that

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,439
they may have occurred

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,759
with time so this pasture's been sown

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,200
with the equivalent of 18 kilograms of

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,799
rye grass

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,479
but with about eight or so grass species

43
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,280
sown at very low rates

44
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,720
and what i mean by 18 kgs of rye grass

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,920
i'm using that too

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,920
for you to visualize the quantity of all

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,119
the grasses if they add it up based on

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,280
seed size

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,320
how much equivalent rye grass we might

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
have put in

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,000
so as an example we've got only four

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,159
kilograms of perennial rye grass in here

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,399
a diploid perennial uh we've put four

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,040
kgs of a tetraploid hybrid in here which

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,079
again

56
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,000
because hi our tetraploid seed is bigger

57
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,360
four kilograms that's half the rate that

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,280
the deployed was

59
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,040
that's not an annual it's a hybrid it

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,759
will last over time

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,720
but it adds extra speed to the start of

62
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,200
this

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,280
but at a very low sowing rate uh we have

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,440
four k's of tall fescue in here

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,800
and again our seed size very similar to

66
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,720
perennial ryegrass

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,520
we have three k's of meadow fescue

68
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,319
4k is a batten prairie grass and that is

69
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,800
a shortest term species with a very big

70
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,599
seed

71
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,519
but it's also a natural reseeder as well

72
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,200
and it's quite common in fact you can

73
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,000
see a little bit here where it's already

74
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,319
thrown a seed

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,640
in its first season and and that will

76
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,239
start a regeneration phase as well

77
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,920
we have a little bit of garlic grazing

78
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,560
brome in here as well

79
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,800
and timothy so these are the species

80
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,959
that make up the grass base

81
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,519
this pasture was designed to be a

82
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,280
genuine perennial pasture

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,840
but with uh a cover crop of species that

84
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,159
might have

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,000
other attributes however that's only the

86
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,239
first part the second part definitely is

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,879
the legumes that support this pasture

88
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,519
so we're looking at red clover i see

89
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,440
that as a

90
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,920
powerhouse of this sort of opportunity

91
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879
and system and already it's showing up

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,800
as impressive

93
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,000
the other legume that is showing up from

94
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,120
day one

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,760
to be extremely impressive as a lusun

96
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,040
and luciana's content here is

97
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,920
outstanding so

98
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,400
we've got four k's of red clover uh we

99
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,959
have

100
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,519
three k's of lucerne and i believe due

101
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
to the

102
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,519
slow establishment of the div of the low

103
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,560
sowing rates of the

104
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,200
grass species every kg of that lucian

105
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,599
seed

106
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,640
has germinated and is contributing

107
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,319
really strongly

108
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,280
inside the first season we've got three

109
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,840
white clovers

110
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,680
a large leaf and a medium large leaf and

111
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,560
a small leaf type

112
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,239
and uh we have a crimson clover a

113
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,519
balancer clover

114
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,400
and these are annual clovers both of

115
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,799
which that have

116
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,840
reseeded inside the stand because of

117
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,040
this

118
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,360
lacks start both of them are creating

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,480
longevity through reseeding and

120
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,799
contributing to

121
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,120
mass in the spring and the nitrogen

122
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,439
cycling coming from the legumes

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,600
we've put in some lotus and today we've

124
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,079
had an exercise about finding the plants

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,040
and the lotus is extremely hard to find

126
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,880
to start with

127
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,360
and i would emphasize on the scale of

128
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,160
this mixture the lotus is very expensive

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,600
so you need to have quite a lot of faith

130
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,000
that it works for you before you

131
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,759
probably would want to invest in that

132
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,560
uh what am i looking at strawberry

133
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,000
clover another very resilient uh white

134
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,960
clover like legume

135
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,240
designed for wet hard soils that get

136
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,160
very dry in summer

137
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,759
so we suffer from the dry in summer

138
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,560
we're looking for perenniality over the

139
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,479
years

140
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,600
and strawberry clover is a really

141
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,639
interesting

142
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,600
addition to that legume content ah

143
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,639
the herbs are covered off by chicory and

144
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,639
plantain

145
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,400
and would be fair to say from the

146
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,840
establishment phase the chicory is quite

147
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,199
outstanding

148
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,199
it has a lot of micronutrients that we

149
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,800
know it cycles particularly copper

150
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,960
and the plantain obviously copper and

151
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,280
selenium and cobalt in the right soil so

152
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,520
they

153
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,280
they have traits of both forage quality

154
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,840
but also animal

155
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,400
characteristics we had cover crop plants

156
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,520
for forage such as the milton

157
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,000
oats and the uh the rape and

158
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,720
radish which were used to bulk up the

159
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,639
start

160
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,320
and both those plants all those plants

161
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,720
have played their plant well

162
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,880
the oats to be fair are a fibre source

163
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,680
only and we aim to sow them at quite a

164
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,520
low rate

165
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,520
so they didn't overwhelm the rest of

166
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,320
this really valuable pasture mix

167
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,240
with too much fibre on top of the ground

168
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,680
when they're being grazed

169
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,560
and then after that we've got species

170
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,880
like sunflowers buckwheat lupins facilia

171
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,720
mustard linseed vetch now the key to

172
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,560
many of those vets is a really useful

173
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,479
species as a legume contributor here

174
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,800
both for reseeding and

175
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,600
and for contribution through the grazing

176
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,319
phase

177
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,280
uh the regrets really sit with the

178
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,240
mustard

179
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,319
and to be fair the radish they don't fit

180
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,639
the grazing rotation well

181
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,039
and we did not start the grazing of this

182
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,960
mix until 120 days

183
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,479
and didn't finish the first round for

184
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,319
180 days

185
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,560
and that time that mustard floured and

186
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,479
set seed and that seed has now

187
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,240
contaminated the soil for a very long

188
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,440
time and stop the future uses we could

189
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,280
have of this land

190
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,280
and put a few of our neighbours at risk

191
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,319
with birds moving seed into the rest of

192
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,960
the landscape

193
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,720
the radish is the same problem we still

194
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,280
have flowering radish plants here right

195
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,120
now

196
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,960
the seed will have been moved around

197
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,000
possibly mostly the paddock but also

198
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,720
possibly around

199
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,280
and that creates a pollen bear pollen

200
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,520
risk

201
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,360
to any other neighbor who may be trying

202
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,400
to do radish seed production

203
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,919
so there is a a social awareness that

204
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,680
needs to be had when placing these

205
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,120
plants in these really diverse

206
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,080
and really complex mixes um really

207
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,800
looking at this

208
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,440
uh there's some very powerful plants in

209
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
here

210
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,520
we've created a nice fibre mass that is

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
going to continue to break down over

212
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,759
this winter

213
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,759
they're going to go through winter and

214
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,199
this coming spring go to seed

215
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,840
that's going to give us the opportunity

216
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,919
to elevate our covers pre-grazing

217
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,840
and we're aiming for high covers and

218
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,560
high residuals in this particular

219
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,400
treatment

220
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,080
the other treatments are more intense

221
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,240
using similar species

222
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,319
not quite as great a diversity but in a

223
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,599
much more intense grazing cycle

224
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,599
and we're going to be paying attention

225
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,800
to what's going on underground as well

226
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,120
as above ground

227
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,960
and we'll leave you with that great

228
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,160
thanks al that's really really good this

229
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,120
is the beginning

230
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,720
of agricom's venture into some diverse

231
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,560
pasture species trial so it's going to

232
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,160
be awesome to come back and

233
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,560
see what they like in a few more years

234
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,560
time thank you very much all
