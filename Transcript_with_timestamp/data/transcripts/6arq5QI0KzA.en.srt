1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,200
some Garden crops belong in containers

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,520
and space is money when you're trying to

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,440
grow high value foods for your nutrition

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,000
and your budget containers can solve a

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,120
lot of problems for us like reducing

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,120
pests and weeds to name a couple when we

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,160
have more control in the garden we're

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,400
less stressed in the garden I'm a solo

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,400
Gardener downsizing my 28 raised bed

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,000
garden in just a few weeks and I'll show

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,400
you the top three crops I've been

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,199
growing in containers in my large garden

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,920
and the three I can't wait to get into

14
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,599
containers I'll also show you which

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,230
containers I've found to help these

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,799
plants Thrive and

17
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,799
[Music]

18
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,160
how before we dive way in here are nine

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,879
ways containers can help you grow what

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,320
you want to grow in your garden first

21
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:53,359
they allow you to grow food in small

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,680
spaces and make the best of larger

23
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,640
spaces you can easily move them to

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,399
optimize the sunlight exposure protect

25
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,440
plants from harsh weather or rearrange

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,239
your garden layout as needed since you

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,040
can move your containers indoors or to

28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,600
sheltered areas to protect plants from

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,759
frost this actually allows you to more

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,640
effortlessly extend your growing season

31
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,640
growing plants in containers can help

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,960
reduce the risk of soil born diseases

33
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,159
and pests you have more control over the

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,159
soil which can minimize these issues you

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,840
can choose the perfect soil mix for each

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,759
type of plant ensuring they get the

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,040
right nutrients and conditions for

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,560
optimal growth for example blueberries

39
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,759
they just require more acidic soil than

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,520
many other Garden crops you can easily

41
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,720
Implement efficient watering systems

42
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,360
like drip irrigation to minimize water

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,360
usage and add soil amendments to help

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,680
conserve water growing in containers

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,840
usually results in fewer weeds saving

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,680
you a lot of time and a lot of effort

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,399
maintaining your garden and they can be

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,079
set at a height that reduces the need

49
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,000
for bending and kneeling making

50
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,719
gardening a lot easier on our bodies

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,600
finally I think containers are perfect

52
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,200
for trying out new crops and gardening

53
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,360
techniques without a significant

54
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,439
investment of time or space I've found

55
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,680
over the years that getting out and

56
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,159
experimenting in the garden allows you

57
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,479
to learn so much valuable information to

58
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,039
increase productivity and value now

59
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,679
let's talk about these six amazing

60
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,120
Garden crops and then at the end of the

61
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,959
video I'm going to show you which

62
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,800
containers keep plant roots super

63
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,160
healthy most herbs are extremely

64
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,080
adaptable easy to grow and require

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,800
little attention making them perfect for

66
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,480
containers even though I've been growing

67
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,519
in a large garden space I've always

68
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,680
grown my herbs in containers to keep the

69
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,000
garden beds free for other things

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,640
especially herbs like mint that spread

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,400
are perfect for containers because

72
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,040
they're prevented from being invasive

73
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,720
this way perennial herbs like chives are

74
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,440
also perfect because they need to be

75
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,680
divided every year or two to stay

76
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,400
productive and then it's easy to do in

77
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,519
containers herbs are plants I'm

78
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,000
constantly harvesting from too so I like

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,959
the option of moving them where they're

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,360
easy for me to access quickly instead of

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,519
having to walk all the way out to the

82
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,080
Garden I can move them closer to my back

83
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,159
door even since I've been growing in a

84
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,440
garden with 28 raised beds I faced the

85
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,000
challenge of crop rotation tomatoes are

86
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,800
a good example because they're so

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,640
disease prone and I usually grow a lot

88
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,720
of them because I like to make salsa and

89
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,840
sauce so sometimes it's challenging to

90
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,760
not plant tomatoes or other plants of

91
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
the same family in the same spot during

92
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,360
consecutive growing Seasons planting at

93
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,879
least some of them in containers really

94
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,120
help solve this problem because they

95
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,000
give you more flexibility spacewise here

96
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,000
I have a monino tomato plant and a

97
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,680
container this is an indeterminate

98
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,480
variety which takes some pruning and

99
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,360
staking to keep it under control in a

100
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,280
container and then this right here is a

101
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,360
midnight roma tomato plant which is

102
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,080
semi- determinant most semi determinate

103
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,720
tomato plants are actually just

104
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,200
indeterminate plants with a bushier

105
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,319
growth habit like determinate

106
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,560
determinate plants are more Compact and

107
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,840
can be easier to grow in containers than

108
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,879
indeterminate although both are going to

109
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,480
be fine in containers indeterminant are

110
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:47,319
just a little more high maintenance to

111
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,280
keep them supported I would still

112
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,000
recommend staking and caging either

113
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,959
variety and if you do have a tomato

114
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,760
plant that becomes diseased it's easier

115
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,599
to quarantine it from your other plants

116
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,640
when it's in a container it's also

117
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:00,720
easier to replace the soil and get rid

118
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,640
of soil born diseases and pests that

119
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,159
overwinter in the soil growing peppers

120
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,799
in containers has allowed me to

121
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,760
experiment with different varieties over

122
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,959
the years I've had my main varieties

123
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,040
that I grow for preserving in raised

124
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,640
beds where I usually grow 12 plants in

125
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,919
each 4x8 which are jalapeno Lively

126
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,959
Italian orange sweet bell and pimento so

127
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,280
having containers on hand allows extra

128
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,880
space to experiment with other varieties

129
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,919
I found that some varieties are more

130
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,240
compact than others like these mini

131
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,080
bells that I have right here so you can

132
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,479
grow pepper and containers even if you

133
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,479
have a small garden space and doing this

134
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,479
also can help free up space in a larger

135
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,440
Garden to allow you to grow other things

136
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,840
these are the three crops I've regularly

137
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,280
grown in containers and next are the

138
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,680
three I can't wait to get into

139
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,919
containers when I'm growing in my

140
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,000
downsize Garden potatoes take up a lot

141
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,320
of space in the garden and a large

142
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,960
amount of them can be grown in

143
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,479
containers which frees up space for

144
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,639
growing things like squash I'm planning

145
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,800
on planting some next spring in my 10

146
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,560
gallon grow bags you can fit around

147
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,919
three potato plants in a 10 gallon

148
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,360
container and I've grown things in 25

149
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,440
gallon ones before and they get

150
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,240
extremely heavy the thing I'm most

151
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,960
excited about is just dumping the

152
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,600
potatoes out to harvest as opposed to

153
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,720
digging them up out of my raised beds

154
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,160
which is a lot more work potatoes don't

155
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,080
like compacted soil and you have a lot

156
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,240
more control over your soil in smaller

157
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,360
containers making this a lot easier to

158
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,800
accomplish for a good potato Harvest I

159
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,360
can't wait to plant my potatoes in

160
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,160
containers for the first time next

161
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,919
spring which is going to be April where

162
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,720
I live I've had a lot of garden space

163
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,199
taken up by June bearing strawberries

164
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,039
over the past 10 years plus I rotate my

165
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,680
beds and plant fresh Runners every year

166
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,360
to make sure we have those big June

167
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,840
bearing Harvest every year I made a

168
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,639
video about this if you'd like to see

169
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,199
how to propagate June bearing strawberri

170
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,840
so you never have to buy the plants

171
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:47,600
again if you don't want to so I've been

172
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,120
thinking about how I'm going to continue

173
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,240
my strawberry growing in a much

174
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,000
downsized Garden space since we eat lots

175
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,039
of strawberries and growing our own

176
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,080
saves so much money I'd love to try a

177
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,919
vertical planter and I might try an

178
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,639
everbearing variety since they produce

179
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,120
fewer runners I've seen several

180
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,080
gardening friends have success with

181
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,840
growing lots of strawberries in vertical

182
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,120
growing towers and I think I'm going to

183
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,280
give it a shot next spring and last but

184
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,120
probably not least I can't wait to plant

185
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,000
as much of my lettuce as possible in

186
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,479
containers to free up space for things

187
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,520
like corn which by the way you can also

188
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,120
grow in containers depending on how much

189
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,960
of it you want to grow I like to plant

190
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,960
cutand come again lettuce that you plant

191
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,759
densely and harvest mostly as baby

192
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,160
greens and then the plants grow back to

193
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,720
give you a few harvests before it

194
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,639
becomes tough and bitter This lends

195
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,520
itself well to containers because you

196
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,120
can tuck a lot of cutand come again

197
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,240
lettuce into each one since it's densely

198
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,000
planted succession planting also works

199
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,360
well in containers where you sew seeds

200
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,479
every couple of weeks so you have a

201
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,319
continuous supply of fresh lettuce you

202
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,080
can easily just rotate your containers

203
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,479
as you succession plant lettuce is a

204
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,599
cool season crop so you can conveniently

205
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,639
move your containers out of hot sun to

206
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,520
extend time before the plants Bolt from

207
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,240
heat stress I've been experimenting a

208
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,039
lot with grow bags for the past five

209
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,840
years or so and they're my container of

210
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:01,680
choice here's what I've learned plants

211
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
don't become root Bound in grow bags

212
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,639
because the grow bags are porous when

213
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,639
the roots reach the edges they reach the

214
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,800
air and stop growing in that direction

215
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,479
and they're air pruned there's also just

216
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,199
enough air circulation through the walls

217
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,199
of the grow bags that the root system

218
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,000
thrives when Roots reach the edges of

219
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,400
plastic containers they keep growing

220
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,240
until they're all constrained and

221
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,000
Tangled and the plants become root bound

222
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,919
grow bags are kind of like little raised

223
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,280
beds but they dry out more quickly

224
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,000
especially if they're not sitting on a

225
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,720
Surface like a lawn where they can Wick

226
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
up moisture from below I like to use a

227
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,160
drip irrigation system with a timer and

228
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,599
then I also add plenty of compost along

229
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,680
with wool pellets to my grow bag mix to

230
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,479
help the soil hold on to moisture I

231
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,199
really like these root pouch bags

232
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,520
because they're nice and thick and they

233
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,680
don't allow sunlight through the walls

234
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,400
and they also have nice handles so that

235
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,400
I can carry them around these right here

236
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,599
are 10 gallon grow bags and they're

237
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,800
great for one tomato plant and one to

238
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,919
two pepper plants each and like I said

239
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,800
before about three potato plants will

240
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,680
fit in a 10 gallon one you'll really end

241
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,280
up getting a feel for what you can fit

242
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,960
in them pretty much as soon as you start

243
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,240
growing in them I've used 25 gallon bags

244
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,520
before and although you can fit more in

245
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,319
them the downside is that it takes a lot

246
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,159
of soil to fill them and then it's

247
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,879
impossible to pick them up and move them

248
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,000
around your garden it's just as

249
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:18,120
important to add mulch to grow bags as

250
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,039
it is in raised beds or in ground

251
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,240
Gardens I like to add a good couple of

252
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,360
inches of natural Mulch on top just like

253
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,319
I do in my raised beds adding compost

254
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,560
and wool pellets to the soil mix helps

255
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,520
it hold nutrients but I do feel like

256
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,839
grow bags could have a tendency to Lee

257
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,880
out nutrients more quickly if I notice

258
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:36,680
my plants needing a boost I'll Water

259
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,880
them with a tablespoon of fish Emulsion

260
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,519
per gallon of water every couple weeks

261
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,000
or so one of the things I want to do in

262
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,640
my next Garden is add more grow bags

263
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,600
with planted flowers because they

264
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,399
attract pollinators and scattering them

265
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,040
around your garden area reduces your

266
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,080
need to hand pollinate plants like

267
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,760
squash if pollinators aren't plentiful

268
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,160
enough if you're ready to start planting

269
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,720
your grow bags you're going to want to

270
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,160
watch this video next and as always

271
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,800
thank you for joining me out here in the

272
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,920
garden and I hope you'll join me as I

273
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,560
move to a new location and rebuild my

274
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,399
garden from scratch in the next few

275
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,160
weeks this will be my third time in the

276
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,880
past 11 years building a garden from

277
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,560
scratch here in South Carolina and I

278
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,600
can't wait to show you how I'm going to

279
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,880
apply everything I've learned of course

280
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,720
getting out here and growing our own

281
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,360
food is a learning experience every

282
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,360
single day we're out here doing it
