  "text": "we're now almost one week after we seated and behind me we've got a field that's and even to say the least now one possible reason it could be uneven is rats we do have a rat population here at Erie I've got dr. grant singleton with me who specializes in rats to tell us a little bit more about our rats indirect there I'm also thinking over here looking around here there's an area with a rat fence Oh to our to my left and now that that can be good because if you do have a rat problem last year there was a rat problem just here it's good to have what we call a trap crop where you plant an area early about two to three weeks early and then have traps with more will capture traps entrances like this or the rest they'll go in but can't get back out again the other thing is yeah where and when should you conduct direct control the when is now because the main we know from the breeding ecology of rats for every female rat that to remove at this time of the season it's equivalent to removing about sixty rats come the ripening stage of the crop particularly after the fellow period the rats there's a big disturbance during a fallow period and the working of the soil so the rats then get move out get moved to the edges and they aggregate and that's the best time to manage them and so along these areas where there's cover also here in the missus farm you have irrigation canals underneath and so the entrances of those canals because they're good habitats for rats as well so they need cover and they need areas are not being disturbed now we have here trap either rat and trapping is is used often when I talk to farmers and will show that they will enter into the trap here and he will force his way through and the right thing yeah trap is big but see how they sort of crunch down and rats can do that as well the only thing that limits our rat so they can dissipate their shoulder shoulder its width of their head which indicates as though how big the hole is they can get in and with a mouse and push your finger in a mouse and get into a hole we're a rat it's more sort of a probably of a large thumb so it's usually about 12 millimeters if you got a hole bigger than that then the rats can get through and so often you know you don't need a very big opening here the rats will force their way through hey when we first seeded I came and I were most concerned about rats what we didn't think about was birds what do we know about birds and their interactions with suited rise in agricultural system there were two approaches one is they will will spread something to feed the animals just prior to the crop coming to the stage of seed the other approaches is is going more here in the Philippines and elsewhere in Asia often its is using of what you've got here the flags to this caused a bit of disturbance not by the hedge scene not far from here where they have they're all like a little windmill the little ratchet on it making a noise and that's to persecute the birds away as well so it's looking at at noise as a deterrent but really we don't know much at all about the bird problem and again one of the big questions is where are they breeding were they aggregating and tried to see if we can prevent the problem before it does escalate",
