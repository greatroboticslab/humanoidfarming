00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,830
animal agriculture looks very different

3
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:21,140
from farm to farm but there are many

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,230
common threads farmers and ranchers

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,480
manage complex systems to be profitable

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:30,220
and productive while also protecting

00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:37,090
NRCS conservation practices commonly

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:37,090
used in animal agriculture

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,910
the Department of Agriculture's Natural

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,180
Resources Conservation Service or NRCS

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:51,210
and the Environmental Protection Agency

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:55,040
or EPA each have a role in encouraging

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:58,170
farmers to use conservation practices

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,239
NRCS is role is to provide technical and

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,460
financial assistance to farmers who

17
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,610
voluntarily implement conservation

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,410
practices EPA's primary role is to

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,290
ensure compliance with federal

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:14,220
regulations such as the clean water and

21
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,470
clean air acts EPA also provides grant

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,680
funds that are often used in concert

23
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,280
with USDA program funding to accelerate

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,070
voluntary conservation practice adoption

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,570
these funds can be used to demonstrate

26
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,880
innovative practices coordinate

27
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,950

technical assistance and landowner

29
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,440
outreach state governments do and local

30
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,660
governments may have additional

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,289
regulations or guidelines beyond the

32
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:45,420
clean water and clean air acts NRCS

33
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:47,820
conservation practices can provide

34
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,250
numerous environmental benefits and

35
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,520
often help farmers meet environmental

36
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,530
regulations at the same time a variety

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,900
of practices are available to farmers

38
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,240
and ranchers some practices may be

39
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,850
relatively easy to implement while

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,670
others may be more complex this is

41
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,670
because every farm is unique every

42
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:12,030
situation is distinct and every solution

43
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:14,430
is customized the conservation practices

44
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,010
selected need to reflect the values and

45
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,019
priorities of the producer and the local

46
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,290
resource concerns and landscape

47
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:24,269

48
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,540
not implement the same conservation

49
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,340
practices there is one very obvious

50
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,829
similarity among all animal operations

51
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,430
the need to carefully manage activities

52
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:38,730
and sources such as manure silage

53
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:42,000
leachate milk house wastes chemicals and

54
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,430
animal mortalities to prevent nutrients

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,850
and pathogens from negatively impacting

63
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,510
many conservation practices aim to

64
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,110
prevent manure from contacting clean

65
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,690

66
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:16,780
gutters direct water around production

manure keep it contained until it is

69
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,390
applied to fields where nutrients can be

70
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,880
recycled by growing crops manure storage

71
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,800
allows farmers to avoid application at

72
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,410
times when there is a high risk for

73
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:36,040
nutrient losses such as when soils are

74
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:39,090
saturated frozen or snow-covered losses

75
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,340
by runoff leaching and/or volatilization

76
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,940
can result in adverse effects on soil

water and air quality manure treatment

78
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,920
often addresses both air and water

79
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:53,260
resources two of the most common

80
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,500
treatment processes are composting and

81
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,630
solid liquid separation treating manure

82
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,150
can reduce its volume and moisture

83
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,640
content this adds value because it's

84
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,890
more economical to transport to fields

85
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,030
where nutrients are needed or to other

86

for pastured animals common conservation

88
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,280
practices include prescribed grazing and

89
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,380
access control prescribed grazing is

90
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,960
managing the location of animals to

91
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,840
maintain healthy vegetation soils and

92
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,750
habitats farmers and ranchers can also

93
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,420
use fences stream crossings or livestock

94
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,090
watering systems to restrict livestock

95
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:38,600
access to surface water while providing

96
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:40,670

trapping runoff at the edge of a field

an inevitable reality for livestock and

127

poultry farms is animal mortality

128
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:07,240
farmers can use conservation practices

129
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,699
to plan for both a small number of

130
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,340
animal losses during normal production

131
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:14,740
and for a large number of animal losses

132
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,080
during a catastrophic event good

133
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,389
mortality management protects natural

134
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,590
resources by preventing the spread of

135
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:25,750
pathogens or disease-causing microbes

136
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:28,479
farms of all types and sizes can engage

137
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,340
in conservation efforts farmers can

138
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,199
protect natural resources while
