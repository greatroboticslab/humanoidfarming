  "text": "right i think we'll make a start now uh welcome back everyone really nice to see you all again and uh this is the the fourth and the final webinar in the series of the iedq workshop on indigenous people's food systems biocultural heritage and the sustainable development goals great so this final webinar is focusing on exploring research methods interdisciplinary methods and decolonizing methods for research on indigenous peoples food systems so we've had a very rich discussion in the last three webinars we've heard from many indigenous experts and i would like to start by highlighting some of the key points that have been made particularly relating to the priorities for research so we've heard that indigenous people's food systems and biocultural heritage are fundamental for indigenous people's food sovereignty identity spirituality health and well-being and for everyday life and that's um we heard that they also play a significant role in the transition to sustainable food systems and can make important contributions to economic uh national economies as we heard yesterday from hindu ibrahim a pastoralist from chad i think a key message i've got also is that there's a really strong urgency um but indigenous food systems face many threats traditional knowledge is disappearing very fast and research must focus on these threats and challenges and not only on the indigenous food systems themselves the threats include restrictions on forest use and resource use spread of of modern agriculture and modernization of cultures and inappropriate economic development and also education western education systems the second message that i got from yesterday is the critical need to do more research on indigenous people's land rights as hindu ibrahim explained most land belongs to governments and land that is vital for pastoralists is being sold off to sedentary people and that is a massive threat to their indigenous food system we heard um also from the uh representative from the arctic region of russia that the introduction of industrial development has almost destroyed their traditional way of life and that traditional food culture of hunting and fishing is very close to nature and that that diet is actually essential for survival in that harsh climate and that in response to the challenges of climate change and they must return to their indigenous food system and for this they need to preserve the land and we learnt that for hunter-gatherers in tropical rainforests who are mobile egalitarian very culturally diverse they are also facing many threats from economic expansion and from protected areas so we also heard from um from the academic side that land rights is an issue which is under-researched we heard from hindu ibrahim that indigenous peoples don't call it food security they call it food sovereignty and this is a priority for research as well as food sovereignty is essential to sustain indigenous knowledge systems and also she emphasized that maintaining seven generations thinking is really important not only in chad but we also heard that indigenous peoples in china have this seven generation thinking hindu also stressed the need to get traditional knowledge respected on the same level as science and we heard from fao that um traditional knowledge contains ancestral wisdom whereas often science is just information frang roy uh stressed the need to gather evidence of how destructive industrial agriculture is on indigenous peoples for example in asia and he also stressed the need for researchers to respect the value of indigenous knowledge rather than viewing it as backward as this sometimes happens and the need to mainstream indigenous perspectives in research and to respect indigenous people's rights and the rights enshrined in the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples and to support indigenous methods of knowledge transmission like storytelling and he stressed the need for a multicultural research approach that blends indigenous knowledge and science and we heard that the multi multiple evidence-based approach is one method to do this we heard that indigenous peoples would like academics to recognize them as equally expert and the academics can play a useful role in helping to show that indigenous peoples are experts and that they should support research that is led by indigenous peoples conventional research that is externally led is not useful to indigenous peoples and can never fully understand them is something that hindu ibrahim emphasized but there's also we also heard that there's much scope for collaboration when there is mutual respect and um we heard on the interdisciplinary issue that indigenous peoples don't have separate fields of study everything is interlinked so community-led research can provide a framework for interdisciplinary research and we heard that it is crucial to empower indigenous communities and to support community networking and to also understand the governance issues and engage at policy level and that more research is needed on gender and women's health issues and finally we heard from fao about the new global hub on indigenous people's food systems that brings together universities un agencies and indigenous peoples and seeks to inform policy processes like the the world food system summit in in 2021 and um uh just to mention that um john uh fernandez de linoa uh from fao replied to my question after the webinar because there wasn't enough time but um he confirmed that uk universities can become members of the hub and that the emphasis is placed on institutions and research centers that are doing hands-on research with indigenous peoples and they're respecting the principle of free prior and informed consent so for this webinar we will explore indigenous and decolonizing research methods and we'll also explore interdisciplinary research methods so the first session will focus on interdisciplinary methods methods that draw on more than one discipline to better understand and protect indigenous people's food systems and to enhance the evidence of their importance and to help address the challenges they face and then after a 15-minute break we'll look at the um we're having a panel um of indigenous peoples talking about decolonizing and indigenous research methods that seek to empower indigenous peoples and help to address the key challenges they face through the research process so they strengthen culture indigenous knowledge and help to strengthen rights to land and to to strengthen biodiversity etc so i will hand over to philippa now she's going to chair the first session um just to briefly remind presenters that we are a very diverse audience so please don't use um academic jargon and also for the q a that follows um each session today we would prefer if everybody can raise their hand or use the raised hand function and briefly introduce themselves rather than using the chat but you can use the chat if we run out of time okay thank you so much i'll hand over to philippa morning everyone um so yeah this first panel on is on interdisciplinary methods for research on indigenous and traditional crops whole food systems and temporal changes and i'm going to start by talking about combining ethnobotanical and historical approaches so ethnobotanical approaches to studying indigenous food systems can include documenting crop diversity and uses the relationships between crops and land use and between crops and foods all these elements are connected and subject to dynamic change there are multitudes of reasons for growing crop varieties as we all know including for different uses such as food or fodder for their taste and cooking properties for their resilient traits or yield and for their suitability to specific moments within seasonal cycles or specific patches of land for documenting crop diversity and uses within the local ecological context could include recording which crops are grown in different micro environments and patches created for example by differences in soils or altitude or through land use systems and management such as terracing and home gardens and studying crops from cultivations through to cooking practices can include all the practical steps from harvesting food to storage and food preparation and how they connect with material culture technologies cultural practices and knowledge so many crops considered minor today have been more important in the past and documenting farmers memories can provide valuable information about crop pieces about the advantages of different crops about growing methods that are useful in being forgotten and reasons for any of these changes historical documents and archaeobotanical data can then provide further information on the long-term crop histories and less insights into their local environmental suitability over the past years i've been collaborating with sudanese colleagues in nubian communities studying traditional crops the project is based in the hyper arid north where agriculture is centered on family farms and dependent on the river nile so i've got a couple of slides to show now um that introduced my collaborators and some of the farming environments and associated traditional material culture so i will just so we interviewed farmers about crops they have grown today and in the past to compare and their uses and where they are grown we recorded cultivation and crop processing methods focusing on cereals and pulses as well as associated foods elderly farmers were also asked how practices have changed with the introduction of new crops and methods especially since the mid-20th century when traditional irrigation systems changed so several previously stapled crops are now minor food crops and there are many reasons for such changes including shifts in food preferences and processing methods and many of these crops are now just grown for home use in small patches especially along the river banks tutorial beans are a dominant commercial and food pulse crop but previously a wide diversity of pulses were eaten more frequently especially lablab and cowpea and baked wheat bread has also become an increasingly dominant food partly replacing flatbreads which also used to be made with a wider range of cereal and pulse so changes in crops and foods are also reflected by material shifts such as the disappearance of many traditional kitchens and storage rooms and the dominant hybrid crops in use today can only be grown in the winter and then dependent on intensive irrigation in contrast the local cultivators of african crops that were dominant in the past are low input and could be grown throughout the year and these previously important crop species have a long history of use in the archaeological record of the region helping highlight their long-term stories and environmental suitability the connecting botanical plant identifications and local names is always a key element of ethno-botanical research and recording the names of crops and types of foods in nubian as well as in arabic was also important some words were more specific in libyans and this knowledge is also endangered as it is mostly held within the memories of the older generations and nubian languages are themselves also endangered so to help preserve the local agricultural histories the findings were summarized in a booklet that was shared with local communities and its content and design involved the local community and teachers throughout i will now present a video from my colleague mohamed saad who discusses our research in sudan further mohammed works at the national museum in khartoum agriculture in the past depends on the symbol system of irrigation shadow as and sagia as well as traditional tools to cultivate and harvest the crops it is very important to talk to the old people and all farmers about their agriculture because some of them is still they grow the all all the crops for foods in a small area because they are important as easy to grow when it is hot and the main crops is wheat and beans and deaths also the all farmers they have good knowledge especially about growing ropes season snail float some change happened when the farmers use the modern system of irrigation and also they use a machine to cultivate their crops some farmers they change from food crops to cash crops as well as also the some change happen because people they grow like a big land instead of a small land brilliant thanks and now we're going to move on quickly to raj puri from the university of kent who's going to talk about using ethnobotany and participatory action research to document agrobiodiversity over to you okay uh hello everyone uh pleasure to be here um nice to see you all um okay i'm gonna try and link these three things um as best that i can i don't have any slides but i'm happy to answer questions afterwards okay ethnobotany then studies the relationship of people to plants and we think of that relationship as mutual an interdependency caused by co-evolutionary processes that results in what we like to call biocultural diversity i'm sure many of you are familiar with this so our food plants and other cultivated crops are some of the clearest examples of this ongoing co-evolutionary process wherein we have manipulated and domesticated these plants and produced this agrobiodiversity but they have also domesticated us and produced the knowledge that we need to grow protect harvest uh store and use those plants and those uses derive ultimately from the materials symbolic and spiritual needs beliefs practices and values that underpin the cultural lives of peoples around the world so when we speak of agrobiodiversity that's only half the story for what are plant varieties seeds and other plant parts without the cultural context and shared knowledges that enliven them and give them meaning so losing one aspect here necessarily leads to losses in the other maintaining crop diversity requires maintaining the recipes for dishes the celebratory feasts and rituals that require these special varieties conserving biocultural diversity therefore is a multi-disciplinary task requiring integrated research on this co-evolutionary relationship on this biocultural diversity on its resilience and threats to it from globalization and climate change to name just a couple and on its changing nature culture as it transforms in the face of both internal and external forces and trends of change so there are many manuals out there and many examples of research of this kind being conducted around the world i wanted today to focus on participatory action research or par using tested and tried ethnobotanical methods to solve problems and but being conducted by residents of communities who are trying to resolve these problems and develop new directions for their lives and livelihoods so our role in this is as consultants uh and trainers gathering together people to help them think through issues providing training and perhaps funds to collect and analyze data for themselves about themselves uh helping them to protect store and disseminate their knowledge as they see fit now one fact that we've learned is that no one knows everything about the plants people know and use and what people do know often differs there are knowledges of men of women of children of elders of farmers of gatherers of hunters of fishers so one important role of an ethnobotanist in par is to find ways to get people to share their own knowledge with each other you can think of great examples mark plotkins sorcerer's apprentice in the 1980s and 90s trying to get children to learn the traditional medicine of their elders in sabah we had a project studying rattan and basketry and the the elders of the community set up workshops to teach their children because they realized that they didn't know about basketry about rattan about the plants and dyes that went into it so we do this through interviewing for instance in focus groups of say only older women or only younger men so they can learn from each other in the process of doing this research and we do this through community mapping exercises through inventorying gardens or interviewing along plant trails all of these can be done by community members so they may collect specimens and seeds for a community herbarium a garden or a seed bank or sit down and write a plant manual in local language for their kids or they may choose to record it all on video using what we call participatory video or pv developed by our friends at insight share i've been associated with several of these projects over the years and our students at kent have been sort of leading the way with their project's engagements with communities to produce gardens manuals and videos around the world i'd also like to point up the work done by the global diversity foundation uh who emphasized long-term commitments to communities to foster [Music] foster capacity building so that communities can document their own knowledges in india where i've been working recently a tree researchers have helped communities deal with the impacts of invasive species on forest undergrowth by setting up nurseries to grow some of their important wild food and medicinal plants in their own home gardens in sabah gdf led a par project with dusun communities and ngos to use participatory resource inventory methods to document knowledge and use of plants for the purposes of designing community use zones in the crocker state park all that research uh and training and their gis maps that they made themselves became essential and vital when a proposal to dam and flood their valley was dramatically announced fortunately they were successful in killing off this this idea so there are other examples i can talk about and i'm interested to hear from the other panel members what they think but that's all i have to say and thanks very much for listening thank you very much it was brilliant um we're going to pass over quickly now to roger blench who's going to talk about using ethnobotanic ethnobotany botanical linguistics and anthropology to understand indigenous food systems okay i was ticked off for not having pictures in this slideshow so you'll just have to put up with text sorry about that okay um i'm not also going to talk about the advertised topic since but rather the whole issue of documentation which is a personal obsession as far as i'm concerned the documentation of basic ethnobiological systems remains in a very poor state and in my view has in fact deteriorated in the last 40 years i mean a lot of discussion at this workshop is about activism and of course that is absolutely crucial but to my way of thinking activism has to have an evidential base in other words you know it's easy to say we must protect xxxx but exactly what are we protecting that that's important to understand there's also a problem of the making useful older documentation there's a load of older documentation often in obscure sources or in problematic languages these are not easily available to present researchers present activists so turning older stuff into useful material also seems to me an important priority and making it accessible and and something i i mentioned the other day i've been working on which is turning uh ethno-botanical stuff into android applications that people can use on their phones i also mentioned an important uh thing which seems to me people put out ethnobotanical databases on the internet this is mainly because they get grants and they have data and they put it up and it's useful it's then of course unmaintained because the grant finishes and the creator of the project moves on um this goes back i think to what fao was talking about we have to to scrape if you like all this documentation which people have worked hard to prepare and put it in a form that's accessible and interlinked with other sources so so there's a lot of stuff to be done on making data available in common formats which can be consulted by ngos by activists by scientists so so it has a sort of multi-use format interdisciplinary research well we've heard a great deal about that and this what this section is about um my experience of certain organizations even those represented this workshop is that they speak in fork tongues in other words you can certainly have a unit that's interested in local information and local cultural practices and useful plants but at the same time there are other units in the same body which are interested in promoting hard science and publishing papers in nature and science and so on for whom all this cultural stuff is a load of hui frankly and of course that's unfortunately where the money is these days and and we see this in lots of lots of disciplines not only uh archaeology as well as ethnobotany there's a problem with funders funders like to support advances in individual disciplines and this makes plant scientists in particular turn away from economic botany um i've talked to many botanists for whom this is all just you know fluff if you like people publish enormous uh hardcore botanical surveys of individual countries we're not a single mention of even whether plants are domestic or non-domestic let alone anything to do with uses and local names similarly there's a major problem i think with the way information is reviewed in journals in other words you know if you do botanical documentation of a particular group of people actually publishing it in a in a journal is really quite hard i mean you can put it out there on the web and i think that's what a lot of people do but i think this there are great difficulties in even getting out basic documentation i'll give you an example here i work in nigeria and i work in northeast india in those two places 502 and to around 250 languages are spoken i should say in nigeria there may be satisfactory ethnobotanical and ethno zoological documentation for maybe four languages and none not one in northeast india and i don't mean you know a list of a couple of plants but i mean a proper solid documentation such as been undertaken in central america so there's a real uphill task a crucial thing in my view is a lack of field guides field guides are essential essential to doing serious ethnoscience ethnobiology if you can't even discuss you can't even discuss the identification of plants and animals with people because you don't have field guide so even if you are willing for example you you can't easily get uh you know a chance at identification uh so i just want to want to emphasize really this absence of field guides and maybe an absence of a data bank of non-copyright photographs which can be used to compile field guides so i think all these are issues we have to think about okay brilliant thank you very much so we're just going to start quickly for um some questions which just reset my clock um how are we doing 35 so yeah if we could just stop for around five minutes of questions that would be great um has anyone got any questions they can raise their hand um or or put a question into the chat box and then afterwards we'll move on to the next round of flash talks um sorry to have a question from me but just um as nobody raised their hand immediately um thank you very much all of you that was really interesting um i wanted to ask a question to roger um i've worked quite a bit on protecting traditional knowledge and the main route by which um biopiracy happens in unauthorized use and commercial use of traditional knowledge is through published databases of traditional knowledge so i was just wondering how you address that issue because obviously this documentation work is important and as you say it's really important to have the evidence base to support activism but um the concern is by making it available that anybody could get their hands on it and abuse you know use it inappropriately and without benefits for communities so i'm just wondering how you address that issue thanks well obviously the first important thing is that you must get consent for dissemination of knowledge from the people you're working with um i have to say i've never found this a problem in the two areas of the world i work people love the idea that you know their culture is being disseminated more widely in the world but these issues certainly have come up in the amazon although i do understand it's become less of a problem in more in more recent times because more companies are less interested in uh biodiversity chemicals and more interested in in sort of mechanical processes for developing things but it remains an issue and i think the only way around this is to ensure that you definitely have the consent of the community for the dissemination of knowledge and then what can you do if it's out there it's out there um nobody can predict what might might be found to be useful um so there's no two way there's no real way around this as far as i can see uh it's consent is crucial okay there's a question here um from george mcallister um about could the speakers share their thoughts on how to undertake participatory action research in a time of covet um perhaps in terms of ethics tools and practices for building trust and capacity for community-led processes raj i think this might be for you yeah thanks good question very difficult uh in fact we just submitted a grant to the esrc here in the uk to try and get funding to do just that when it was uh shot down as being uh one of the comments one of their viewers said that uh they wondered if it was unethical to interview the same family three times in a year so that just goes to show you perhaps who's reviewing these these proposals but our our goal there was to uh work in pre-existing with pre-existing relationships we have with a couple of communities in london and birmingham uh already so making use of pre-existing networks and getting members of the the communities that we were interested in afro-jamaican for caribbean communities and south asian communities to do research amongst their own people amongst their own neighbors and families to kind of get a sense of how they were reacting to coven 19 in terms of their use of traditional healing methods self-care etc and so you know the way to do it really is again through good uh and close rapport building and close relationships with pre-existing um uh networks in the case of covet 19. starting something brand new might be a bit difficult we note i was also part of an online survey and we noted that very few members of the south asian or the afro-caribbean community were answering online surveys about what they were doing during covet 19. and it was clear that that's why ethnographic research as much as you could do in terms of face-to-face interviewing whether it's by zoom or telephone or whatsapp or on the doorstep was really important you know people from minority groups often are just either don't have linguistic or or digital capabilities for talents for using those kinds of online surveys i don't know i hope i hope that answered some of your questions yeah thank you thank you thank you if i can contact you outside of this forum that would be wonderful thanks oh yeah pleasure pleasure there's a few comments here in the in the chat um i'm just reading harriet's okay so that that might be something that someone else could is anyone could answer answer that question but i think we also need to to move on um with the christine what's what's the best way to carry on answering some of the questions here if we need to get going with the the talks would it be good for people to just send a couple of replies into the chat yes i think that would be the best um while we move on if you if you could reply to the question in the chat i think cool well anyway we better move on um so then next um kind of talks still talking about more different sort of into multi-disciplinary methods um and so we're going to start now with paul wilkin from q um who's going to present on botanical science for conserving orphan crops and indigenous knowledge over to you paul well if that isn't a big enough task for three minutes i also thought i would say that the comments i'm about to make also cover niche crops and wild wild exploited plant resources really across the whole spectrum of domestication i think what we're talking about in terms of botanical science boils down to four key questions we've already started to touch on some of those the first one is what is it inventory is is a critical part so species uh land raises funds varieties but also looking at particular trait variation uh and in current uh research approaches we've also want to look at genetics and genomics as ways of describing and understanding the diversity that we're seeing in front of us and we want to see participatory shared and restored knowledge within that context the next key question is where is it we want to geolocate the material we're looking at and that brings into play a whole load of spatial research methods that i'm not going to talk about today time and then once we've done those preliminary steps and those are the two most critical first steps then we start to think about conservation uh conservation is vital we are all aware of that and the population of the globe is increasingly aware of that so first we would look at in situ methods of conservation we'd look at cultivation either in situ or close to in situ and then once those methods are exhorted we'd move to the ex-situ methods in particular around seed banking or cryo preservation and all of those are the suite of approaches that are open to us to make sure that we have access to the relevant germplasm uh and then the bit which is often forgotten the part on the end uh is what do we do with the conserved material how do we regenerate plants from that and how do we get them back where they're needed so we would be wanting to look at things like seed germination ecology uh and the extraction of preserved material and regeneration of it as the as critical approaches to delivering the plant resources that people need i think i will leave it at that thank you paul um i was wondering as well if you could just say something really briefly on um maybe how there's different approaches for different categories of crops so for example the the seed crops like cereals versus the vegetative vegetative crops um from the national perspective for many of the steps one to three really to be in situ for the in-situ work or or characterizing it evidently uh seed-bearing crops like cereals are relatively easy to bank crops which are based on underground organs which are vegetatively propagated are much harder to conserve they usually require geoplasm collections which are expensive to maintain and often uh find it very difficult to retain information associated with the accessions in those collections so they're often two or three years down the line are often quite worthless and then you end up resorting to cryo approaches which are extremely expensive uh and technical and difficult to approach but that may be the vital way of preserving so iota in nigeria uh concerns much of its yam diversity through cryo because it's the only approach that works okay thanks and now we're going to briefly explain what cryo is there's a lot of technical jargon coming through thank you yeah i forgot tissue culture which is another way to conserve material cryopreservation so freezing of of embryos down at very low temperatures and then they can then be re plants can be regrown from those preserved embryos thank you um and now we're going to move on to um where am i to typiana union from q who's going to talk about using plant diversity and ethnobotany to support community livelihoods thank you yes thank you philippe i'm going to share my screen i have a slide yeah okay well good morning everybody um so um i'm going here to talk about our research method through the project the youtube project that i've been coordinating for several years and this is a project um that was developed and carry out in africa and also latin america so um we the aim of this project was to um basically conserve xc2 indigenous useful plants those one that were important for local community by building actually the local capacity to successfully conserve and use them so the main components of the project can be summarized as you follow so we have one part of targeting and prioritizing the species so by using different methods so one hand we did of course literature review to see what was already available there on the other hand we are being really carrying out electron botanica surveys um by working directly with the local community uh but uh at the end we had really to come up with a short list of most important species where we can we could focus um and on and do really our conservation and sustainable use activity and we did this through a workshop participatory workshop and then another component as being on the seed conservation social conservation um was applied to the priority species and we did the same conservation together with local community and with our collaborators in country by collecting and storing the seeds then we have been propagating those seeds in order to have them available and not only for research but of course for the community in a way in this way we establish community garden but also forestry plots in the case of of kenya where we've been propagating this priority and cultivating the species and lastly um we have been developing methods um and in order to create some income in the community uh through the um selling of uh plants directly sealing but also a plant product in particularly food products food products so how did we do all of this well we apply a participatory approach as i said by working together with the community from the beginning to the end and and also reaching out to other stakeholders by involving um them in our activities and in our products our approach uh was also multi-disciplinary as we carry out different kind of research we carry out a thrombotomical research but also we carry out research on c biology and ecology to inform both the management of the seeds but also the conservation of the seeds and how to propagate those seeds and then we develop propagation protocol and we have also established some um agricultural plots in order to look at the growth rate and the survival of these species and so to conclude um what did we do with all this information well the one that also we generated we give we give it back to the local community through training but also we help enhancing the local facilities and and also we summarize all our um all our information in the in a book that you can see on here on um on the corner on the right and we produce this book so um which is a while plan for a sustainable future we compile all the information that we collected from the community our own information that we generated through the research and try to condense it in this in this book where we have uh in their eternal botanical information where other sort of botanical information species description so that people can identify the species and that's something that came out earlier in the talk but at the same time how to know how to deal with species from a conservation and sustainable um user point of view so this is a book that is aimed to practitioners and in country and um but also um that they work in development outside uh with aim really to help them use the species and conserve them and in a way that can help addressing uh community livelihoods and conservation at the same time thank you very much thank you so much um so we're gonna move on to um and julie and gary vasquez who's going to talk about identifying archaeo botanical evidence for plant processing techniques um yeah over to you so basically i am a phd student at university college london and i do arcu botanical analyses to understand human plant dynamics in of indigenous communities in the caribbean through archaeological methods and one of the things that i realized is that through our cubotany um you know we can identify many types of plants from the archaeological record however um at times we don't understand how to process them because as as has been said in the in the workshop that there's um indigenous knowledge that gets lost however i am here to kind of like control repose and the reality is that it's not lost our ancestors have this information um in the in the archaeological records you know they are the bearers the custodians of this information that got lost and we can work using our key botanical methods to bring it back to the present and this image is just um one of the activities that i do to understand the how the different methods of processing manioc which is here um and this also helps not just you know going through the motions of actually cooking the dish which is cassava bread um which you can see here but also it helps you understand how those things get to the archaeological record and the way that i do this type of revitalization of indigenous food practices is by using collection of carbonized plant remains and then from those there are fragments which look like food or are especially also tuber fragments and using scanning electro microscope you can potentially identify those foods but beyond the simple identification of species or what type of food it is you can actually try to assess um food taste preferences and actually if this type of research is done on a more larger scale you can try and start getting a sense of contextualizing the food habits of people um and that's something that i'm trying to work on throughout my work and not just as i said before revitalizing indigenous food practices which is this image which is from the taino new year celebration in my island of boriken thank you so much for that and really really great through love um seeing all those images as well we're all getting hungry already um and now we will talk about long-term um crop history of the archaeobotany of crop history so passing over to dorian fuller from ucl okay good so i'm i'm an archaeobotomist like uh julian who just heard from archaeobotany is the study of the preserved plants from ancient human sites so it's the archaeology of plants instead of the archaeology of pottery or some other kind of artifact and it can inform us about the history of crop repertoires within a region so which crops have come into use and out of use over the long term it can tell us about ancient changes and diversification and crops it often tells us about within a particular region how much of an impact the post-columbian exchange has been between crops from the new world and old world being shifted around and we heard you know you will find maize in parts of asia and africa being very important and that's of course a change that's happened within recent centuries uh it can also tell us about lost crops or what we might call orphaned crops or crops that are disappearing and that's kind of what i wanted to focus on today with a few examples and i've listed some there in red and i'm going to quickly walk you through walk you through kind of three uh stories about lost or disappearing crops that archaeology can tell us about that you might not otherwise expect to learn very much about so it's something that can in a sense complement the kind of ethno-botanical documentation that we've been talking about so the first of those that i'd like to talk about is brown top millet or brachiaria ramosa and this is really the lost staple grain of south india of the deccan region uh now it's not completely lost there is a region in northwestern tamil nadu and adjacent karnataka where it is grown on a very small scale or at least it was still grown in the 1990s on a very small scale the last documented reference to this i know of is from a paper published in economic botany in the year 2000 by a japanese scholar and some indian colleagues and they documented i think two villages that grew this crop that in the late 1990s and i have a picture there of a map that shows the region where that modern cultivation was and some of the dishes and breads that were made out of this millet most of which were kind of ritual food so it was maintained mainly for particular festivals but the area highlighted in blue broadly speaking is and all those dots are where we have archaeological evidence for this as a grain and often as the dominant grain the staple grain on many of those sites so for from around four and a half thousand years ago up until maybe 1500 years ago this was in many regions a staple food so it is very much declined as a millet and that's a story that we can only learn about through the archaeological evidence which then tells us that it was suitable in much more of much more widespread importance and what remains in recent times is just a you know a small sample of its past diversity and cultural use another example of crops that are completely lost to us in the ethnographic present are some of the examples of north american domesticates uh and there are very two very well documented examples are a lost can a podium so this is a pseudo cereal similar to modern quinoa but a separate north american species and ice also iva annual oil seed and i've got pictures there of iva annual seeds it's distantly related to sunflower archaeological evidence shows that it undergoes domestication so you get a larger seeded variety so-called macrocarpa variety now this variety does not exist today there's no living biological versions of it it only exists in the archaeological record but it's a fairly major crop and oil seeded crop that's cultivated in this mississippi basin from about from more than 4 000 years ago up until at least a thousand years ago probably later we don't really know when it goes extinct as a crop and i would guess that it's around the time of european contact when you have such a large a decimation of native populations due to european diseases so again it's something that has potential but it's lost to our kind of ethnographic documentation and then the third case i'd like to give is one that would seem like a crop we know a lot about wheat but in fact there's a lot of kinds of wheat that we don't really know very much about today one thing to note is that wheat comes in lots of different genetic types as several species of wheat really today most of the wheat we eat and most of what's cultivated is either bread wheat or durum wheat durum wheat is u is cultivated especially in the mediterranean to make pasta and couscous but these are really quite recent phenomena these two species of wheat that dominate so they start to really become important in the roman period about two thousand years ago and in places like britain maybe only a thousand years ago and prior to that there's a real diversity of wheat species and i've kind of circled them there with different colors durian i'll have to just wrap up quickly 30 seconds more and what the one point i would say is that there's two varieties here which i've highlighted in uh two grade nine corner there's a there's a green arrow pointing to it and there's triticum timofevy there's a purple arrow pointing to it which are really dominant species in the neolithic and bronze age and have basically gone extinct since then so we can see that um the wheat diversity around us today and used traditionally is not necessarily doesn't necessarily reflect the long term so archaeology can reveal these patterns of long-term change and that's what i want to say brilliant thank you um cool so now we've going to um present a video from matthew davis at ucl who will be talking about documenting traditional crops agri systems and temporal changes in kenya many apologies that i cannot be with you today as i'm teaching and thanks for indulging me in this opportunity to record a short film my name is dr matthew davis and i work at the institute for global prosperity at university college london and most of my research has focused on how people manage agricultural landscapes in eastern africa and i briefly like to introduce a long-standing multi-disciplinary research project that has examined food systems in mariquette in northwest kenya this is led by a number of co-investigators including the pi professor henrietta moore dr wilson kip corey from the university of aldrat professor jacqueline mcglade from strathmore university and from ucl and dr sam lun rockcliff from ucl who should be with you all today it also includes multiple east african partners including the east africa herbarium and the british institute in eastern africa now mariquette is a rural area that straddles the eastern side of the cario valley it's well known for its extensive pre-colonial irrigation systems and our research project has a deep history led by professor moore with some continuity go back going back into the 1970s and including work by kenyan scholars such as ben kip courier jason younger s matissio and wilson kip corey as well as researchers including bill adams liz watson and ton dietz throughout our research has intersected with food systems and has often taken these as the central focus but it's also important to note that the work has also focused on many other related issues particularly broader development interventions such as this red cross irrigation scheme and wider processes of ecological management a key tenant of our research over the last decade has been to develop community-led research through citizen scientists who are community members and who who helped determine the research questions methods and analyses this citizen science team is led by mr timothy kippkayokit ruto and miss helena cheptoe pictured here on the left with one of our key team members nelson valengo on the right research into food systems by this team has thus always been embedded in wider social economic and environmental agenda often defined by the priorities of the citizen scientists and the community itself rather than by strict singular research questions for example lines of research have examined failed histories of development interventions many of which have been agricultural in nature but many of which also have not a primary aim of this work has thus been to build a detailed history of the community the agricultural landscape the rural economy and its wider connections to food production which necessarily form a core aspect of this the methods employed have been diverse but often rooted in different ways of mapping and knowing the wider landscape and embedding analyses of things plants animals pathways networks buildings and interventions within this landscape so this work has included everything from traditional archaeological field survey to surveys of colonial and postcolonial structures and interventions combined with multiple forms of ethnographic observation and interview spanning both his ethno-historical and contemporary topics particular attention has been paid to physically but to physically mapping with gps and gis the landscape led by the citizen science team including mapping contemporary and historic features in relation to food production settlement patterns field boundaries irrigation terracing erosion buildings and other structures participant-led mapping has planned individual fields as you can see here including their boundaries routes pathways and allowing for detailed in-situ ethnographic interviews of what farmers produce where when how and in what combinations repeat mapping of nearly 100 film fields over the last eight years in particular has not only provided quantitative data on the types and combinations of crops both indigenous and hybrid but also for deeper conversations about decision making and innovative experimentation work on ethnobotany has thus been extensive including identifying the complex use of some different 10 varieties of sorghum and 12 land race varieties of finger millet but we've always situated these in wider systems of food production through time and always focused on the intersection of both indigenous land races and more hybrid crops most recently we've worked on geo-referenced smartphone data recording of interviews features and photographs and have developed with pharma's bespoke data collection applications using a software called sapele that allows farmers to record cropping practices and associated challenges although these data are still being collected and are still under analysis this has resulted in some 29 major cultivated crops being um identified both new and old with some 36 wild food plants and these are used in literally hundreds of unique combinations overall then although this work has documented indigenous food production the aim has not been to focus solely on the heritage of this but rather to try to place diverse food production systems within a complex narrative of change and continuity through time and space and to situate this within contemporary food debates such as those surrounding the notion of an african green revolution our aim i think has been particularly to help smallholders holder farmers show how diverse their practices and influences are and to situate their heritage alongside the dynamic use of modern materials ideas and experimentation so in short then i think this our work has been about rethinking the distinctions between traditional and modern practice between continuity and innovation and to recenter smallholder farmers as sources of rather than as the recipients of innovation so i hope that this quick talk has not been too brief and too confused but i thank you all very much for listening and hope to hear feedback and questions through the grapevine thank you very much brilliant thanks when we move on to um questions after i think you could all see the the comment from from sam here in the chat so sam's with us today so he can address um questions and he's also posted a longer version of that video um so now we're going to move on to to sandeep hazard singh from open university who's going to talk about oral history is a method for studying the meaning of food waste in india thank you thank you deliver so this this talk is based on recorded and filmed oral history interviews with women small holders in karnataka india in the context of a recent ahrc-funded collaborative project called changing farming lives in south india past and present from this experience and in the context of our discussion of food systems and heritage oral history might provide a particularly amenable entry point for research this is because oral history is about memory and remembering lived experience it can therefore document and communicate food traditions and heritage and the meanings and feelings involved in a particularly vivid manner secondly food tends to resonate particularly well with memory in terms of its sensorial ability to trigger rich memories and emotions of food pleasures within home family and community this process is known as edible memory thirdly this method offers the capability of generating insights into meanings of food cultures over a significant historical duration um and it is also finally conducive to reclaiming the voices and life experiences of indigenous and sub-altern groups such as women presents and farmers who tend to be marginalized in written documents oral history essentially involves a process of co-creation between interviewer and narrator in a way that both highlights narrator agency and invites listeners or viewers into her lived experience very often in development writings the voices of subaltern groups tend to be subsumed by the researchers interpretation which is what ultimately becomes authoritative in our project we began by asking questions that of course were primarily of interest to us as researchers but participants were encouraged to shape their narratives as much as they wished by talking about food crops food activities other subjects and life episodes that they themselves regarded as significant and meaningful in the process uh we discovered that it was foods and diets that the women's smallholders were particularly passionate about especially the beliefs rituals and knowledges associated with finger millet based food ways that they were seeking to revive rituals involved deities earth seeds animals birds and other more than human entities which have the power to affect food and farming outcomes in contrast they were much less interested in the economic specificities of crops and livelihoods so just to conclude i would say that oral history offers the capacities to understand and change the present in the light of the past to identify patterns of local social and climate change to give voice to hidden and alternative narratives and finally to recall cultural memories as a repository of knowledge and resilience for ongoing innovations thank you thanks sandy that's brilliant um and uh so we've just got one last uh video now um from harriet's cooling um who some of you might remember from monday um and she's talking about participatory methods for exploring indigenous food systems health and well-being thank you for including me in this segment of the of the program that you have developed there at q and i i ed i'm very happy to be with you to be talking about participatory methods to explore indigenous peoples food systems health and well-being so my experience is through the center for indigenous peoples nutrition and environment at mcgill university in montreal canada where i was founding director from 1985 until 2009 and i'm still active in promoting the center as which is really why i'm here today so i have to give credit to many many people who worked through the center over the years and our community collaborators not only for the data that we have provided in the many publications but also for building the strategies for community consultation when we started our work with the center we had the indigenous leaders in canada guiding us on how to have proper community consultation and in fact they even lobbied for funding with the canadian government to help establish the center so we're very grateful to them in particular to chief bill erasmus from the denny nation so our work in the canadian arctic during that period of time led to many publications but i want to call your attention to this publication that uh was requested from the w.h.o [Music] this was published in 2003 in english and spanish it's on the cine website as well as the whole website indigenous peoples and participatory health research planning management and preparing research agreements so we learned that there is no one single way to build collaboration every community is different but there are a few key principles uh but i'd like to call your attention to first of all you have to listen you have to learn know how to carefully listen to your collaborators in the communities for their concerns for their ideas on how to do things right from their perspective so that means you have to maintain a respect for the people and that helps them respect you you need respect for the food system the environment and work uh to continue to build mutual respect for mutual benefit so that leads to the important concept of trust you can't get anywhere in community work with research or development without having mutual trust with your community so one of those principles means you're working with them you're not working on them you're not working on nutrition on the people in x community you're working with them so i also call your attention to the 2016 publication from fao on free prior and informed consent and please always recognize that you need collective as well as individual consent in the research processes and along the line uh always keep in mind that when we as academics prepare our publications it is very important for the community partners to know about them to participate in them to be co-authors and to have these publications returned to them so that they can be translated if appropriate for the community members i think that's all i have time for thank you very much okay so um now we i think we're doing we're perfectly on time um so we can have some 10 minutes for questions um i'm just trying to get my speaker view back on great so has anyone got any questions for anyone you can raise your your hands or put questions in the chat excellent so i see quite a lot of comments in the the chat box but i think they're i haven't been able to follow those doing all of this i think they're from the previous discussions so does anyone have any questions for the recent speakers of the flash talks lucas hello everyone my name is lucas pavera and i'm researcher combining ethnobotanical and nutrition approaches and with the indigenous partnership and mr frank roy who is present we are working on indigenous food systems in indonesia northeast india and also a bit in ethiopia and mexico yucatan and uh i would like to mention the presentation of dr tiziano which was i think this livelihood aspect is becoming more and more important and as we can see many indigenous cultures and also the food systems are under pressure and changing from the intensification livelihood needs and also cash crops coming so i think the livelihood aspect is really that's something that should be strengthened but what we found is quite a challenge is how do we balance the trade-off between livelihood and commercialization and also own consumption for example in indonesia or northeast india our studies are showing that farmers are producing nutritious food groups such as eggs or fruits but then they rather you know sell them because of the income opportunities which a little bit compromised the diets and dietary diversity in the end so you know how do we balance this this trade-off between livelihood and owned consumption that would be my question and yeah thank you yeah thank you lucas for your very interesting question is actually a key question and i think um you know it is very important in terms of development and how to carry out the sustainable development as you are mentioning the problem is that you can support livelihood you can help commercializing one species but how can we stop by somehow how can bring the benefit into the community it's key and naturally it needs to be involved into the value chain of that product and of course uh again this need to be multi-disciplinary and also involve different stakeholders and it's important to have uh even um some um like a at the country level some legislation that uh uh in a way that is need it's incorporated into the legal framework of the country uh because otherwise you need to to protect this product and actually more in the value chain you have a middle dealer more likely um less likely you're going to benefit the local community and so it's really a big problem and i think it's something that we're always being aware through our work and through our research and uh for this we've been really working directly with the local community and and also with hgo because ngos somehow they are the voice in general of the local community and they really can help us in bringing the commercialization and from the community to the national regional level national level and potentially at the international level so this is definitely a key step in order to support livelihood they need to be addressed and this again you need to be in the interdisciplinary and design at the same time to have a multi um participatory approach not only at the research level but also by linking up with with the local government and national government at the same time thank you brilliant thank you um so i've got a couple of questions here paul's in the chat first and then on to roger so how widespread is the pattern of farmers selling production to the detriment of their nutrition sandy do you have any comments on that um i think the the women farmers we spoke to actually very keen on the nutritional aspects of uh the foods they were they were seeking to revive um they were kind of very aware that it was particularly important to know to to grow known foods and that there was no benefit in consuming foods from the outside as they put it which they did not know so this issue of knowledge um of foods was particularly important um and they were able to tell us in detail in in in in a considerable way the uh nutritional properties of uh foods like uh the various millets which uh they were growing um and and and and the worst properties of the seeds they they they were saving and exchanging as well um that's that's great thanks and i remember something from some of my interviews as well that just things like qualities of taste could change when certain crops growing for food were growing different qualities of soils and it's that very sort of precise local knowledge and so sometimes you could have the same crop being grown in some different soils for purposes of selling that crop or for using it for animal fodder then the same crop from the same like land race being grown in a different patch of better quality soils when it was being used to eat at home so and that sort of knowledge was being lost sort of locally as well um so roger you had a question as well um i've been a surprise this conference is sort of entitled indigenous food systems there's been extraordinary little discussion of cookery itself and then you know actual actual ways that people think about preparing different foods now in etanagar in the capital of arunachal pradesh one of the fascinating things are the tribal food restaurants that's what they call the many different ethnic groups in 52 in arunachal pradesh many have their own quite specific cuisines and they have a restaurant system which has grown up to serve people who want to eat those particular foods i there's you know this sort of thing also happens a bit in nigeria and quite a lot in indonesia where in indonesia any big city has restaurants which serve people from different islands in indonesia i feel these are grossly understudied in other words these are some of the institutions these commercial restaurants which are acting to propagate indigenous food systems in other words they're the people who who make money from actually selling people the food they really like to eat and uh to my knowledge i've seen very little or no study of any sort of these these restaurant systems and how they actually promote indigenous foods has anyone else got any um comments on that but raj yeah i was to say thank you roger that's a very good point i've i think recipes and dishes and cookery is extremely important we've had students looking at the reintroduction of wild plants into these kinds of restaurant cuisines in malaysia for instance in singapore and because of covet 19 here in london in malaysian restaurants and looking also that that these places are also venues to revitalize traditional crops and traditional plants um plants in cooking as a as also a way to kind of present that traditional food tradition yeah and philip i also wanted to add on that uh yeah i think it's extremely important to uh to record a recipe and it's somehow a way to conserve the way in in the same way you can solve the recipe or conserving the traditional you are conserving the species as well and i wanted to mention that we have recently started a project on the mediterranean diet in lebanon and jordan and we identify some species that actually you can't find in the um in the lebanese restaurant in orlando you know they really consider a delicacy at the country level and really really appreciate them so the world we are doing is really trying to bring these other species some are harvested from the wild some are cultivating and we're also looking into the nutritional content of the species looking at the micronutrients in order to to look at the health benefits and at the same time by looking at the health benefit you can this information can help to promote these species that are minor in the cuisine somehow or what we know outside but they're still very important at the local level that's brilliant julian did you have your hand up before one of the things is that um yes i agree with roger blench and raj and the thing is that another dimension i just forgot to mention is that you know we've been talking about plant and seed collections and all these types of things but also one of the things that i do in order to be able to inform and like identify foods from the archaeological record is that i have a food library not just of the recipes but actually pieces of the food because um you know you can have the recipes you can have all these things but if you don't know how does the product really look um and that also helps you inform and understanding how these types of like um the the way that the method conditions the type of behavior that the remain will have so that's another thing that you can actually be doing you have been you know i i know that every time you go to the field work you are like oh here eat this eat that and then you can just try and build up also a food reference collection which would be it's it's one of the important aspects i think is oh i've got one quick comment so like as archaeobotanists were always interested in those stages of processing and i think one thing we're looking at changes in the last 50 years that sort of research sandeep's been doing with looking at grinding stones and moving to modern methods in the same in sudan is that sometimes the changing cooking practices or use of crops is is linked to these changing material cultures and so when when interest in our our project is looking from farm through to plate to try and capture all those interconnected processes so alex you had you had a question um yeah so i hi i'm alex i'm at the ucl institute of archaeology and rachel botanist i also intern for q um i grew up on coastal miwok land in northern california i'm in communication a lot with a lot of native tribes in california through different dialogue groups what chumash serrano washu miwok and um something that we talk a lot about is reconnecting with traditional recipes and how do we support indigenous groups who have been forced out of practicing traditional food systems and the increased rise in this i don't i don't really hear a lot of discussions with traditional native americans in north america a lot of people have are in urban settings or on reservations but there is an increased interest with the rise of like indigenous people's day which was this past monday as a replacement for columbus day with a desire to reintegrate traditional food systems even though the the origins of a lot of american food systems are actually like in the narrative like thanksgiving how do we support communities of people who are have had broken indigenous condition traditions because a lot of my friends who are miwok or honey want to practice these recipes they want to reintegrate a corn flour into the dialogue they want to integrate traditional like you know um fishing practices but they don't have any resources to do that and so but there is an increased commercial interest in it like the sioux cookbook has picked up and has won a national award and so there is like an increasing fascination with native american cuisines but there's next to no support so i don't know i don't know i just wanted to bring this into the dialogue and i wanted to um kind of introduce a north american perspective just because they're often um not included in the dialogue does anyone have any comments on that um and there's actually some related comments now in the chat as well but and then we're going to have to move on to a break i think if you look at gary navain's work uh on food networks and food sovereignty in the southwest and uh west of the united states food heritage systems and trying to reclaim traditional food food waste can i also mention that way back in the end of the 19th century the good old smithsonian used to produce wonderful books about indigenous cookery systems in north america books which are long out of print but in my view you know people should have a look at these because they documented food and cookery systems at a time where they were pretty well intact i mean i collected a few of these in myself but but you know but how are these being distributed to communities because my my friends i talk to don't know these exist slash they're often really hesitant to engage with this literature because it was often written by colonists and so there's an apprehension to engage is there access to resources that have been written by indigenous scholars because that's the biggest comment i get from people i talk to is how do i access modern day resources written by indigenous ecologists or people who have a comprehensive understanding and it's not through a colonial narrative because i know people who know the smithsonian stuff but they don't want to read it because it's automatically comes from a perspective that doesn't have a full appreciation that's this is just i'm just regurgitating news i've i've been told to spread from my communities so yeah well i think that's really unfair i've read this stuff and and these were ex at least you could you need to look at them and read them and see are are they realistic and so on i mean you know of course maybe there is some colonial perspective but give them a chance don't just throw them out of the the pram all automatically it's it's something that we have to deal with with a lot of archival material from from these periods and the historical research methods take take those sorts of biases into consideration so you could try and abstract the information but in the context of those materials but sandy could be able to to better comment on whether i've got that sort of correctly phrased uh well yeah yes if uh if you're looking for kind of indigenous or supporting voices within within the within the archive especially the colonial archive uh you're likely to to look in vain but nonetheless within that they are um even the colonial archive required um reliance on native and indigenous informants so kind of a a way of reading the archives as has been called against the grain will kind of give you some perspectives from the people who provided the colonialists with the information so it's kind of a fine reading the archives and being alive to the kind of the silences the dissonances the information that is coming to the colonial author and which is sometimes actually acknowledged so yes you would not get kind of a clear a clear outline of views directly by indigenous or subaltern groups but there is a way of making sense of of the archives they're not completely i would say useless and maybe that's the role of modern day i'm afraid you're gonna have to stop now i'm really sorry but please do continue sorry i'm afraid we're gonna have to stop now because we've run out of time um we we scheduled a break from 12 30 to quarter to one which is only 15 minutes and i think people will need some lunch before the next session it's been really fascinating and i'm really glad roger brought up the issue of food because it's such a critical issue and i've really enjoyed all the presentations and all the discussion so thank you really very much philippa and everybody and uh please come back in in 15 minutes right welcome back everyone um i hope you managed to get some some lunch so um we're now gonna have a panel on decolonizing and indigenous research methods and i just um want to thank you all for your presentations earlier they were so interesting i think um just a brief comment while we wait for people to come back the issue of intellectual property rights that came up um i think what harriet kuhnlein said in her video about collective free prior informed consent is really really critical for ensuring that communities know fully the risks of commercialization um before they agree to publish or to disseminate their knowledge and there's also the option of them not publishing and then building a knowledge base within communities and that's something we'll hear about in this session um i also was really enjoyed listening about oral histories and i think they have huge potential at the moment because um you know the loss of um traditional knowledge that's going on is often just the elders who have the knowledge and so oral histories are really important to bring back and revitalize by a cultural heritage in in the areas we're working you know to try and establish biocultural heritage territories uh i think archaeobotany um you know might also help on that if it can help with the recent past um which is kind of more relevant and immediate to communities and might still have um remnants in the memories of the elders the session now is um is is a panel of indigenous people on a topic which i think is really important and as a researcher i think that the best way um to help indigenous peoples is to ensure research is led by them that it empowers indigenous peoples and that address addresses their needs and priorities um and this type of research can have a lot more impact in terms of development and environment impact than externally led research and also there are ethical issues i think with externally led research um you know you're asking indigenous peoples to contribute to a process which generally doesn't give them much benefit in return so in my view that's unethical um so i think this issue of decolonizing research methods is really really important and i would like to introduce um professor chi baguela chilisa i hope you're here with us so um she is a professor at the university of botswana and her work has focused on on culturally and contextually responsive research and evaluation and she's written a brilliant book on indigenous research methodologies so welcome and thank you so much baguela you have 10 minutes or ten okay thank you thank you so much thank you for having me um this has been a wonderful uh time for me i've had a lot of interesting things from all the presenters and now is in this 10 minutes i'm going to share with you uh uh what i have so my focus is going to be on uh indigenous research methodologies and what they are and their benefit to doing research on indigenous uh indigenous food so indigenous research methodologies is about the right of those whose voices have been silenced by western knowledge to know to talk and to be heard while for example in academics may use historical data as you have heard over over the last two days indigenous people can talk and be heard by using for example foreclose stories taboos about food oral traditions about food names of food songs about food that is a way to give the indigenous people voice of course the scientists can always do archival data i mean archaeological data and do all the sciences but indigenous people also have the right to know and they know and they know through those methods it is about indigenous people's right to know to produce knowledge and all knowledge in wasana when we fry potatoes we call them french fries and i think the world over they are called french fries even when they are fried in the u.s that talks about an indigenous french recipe indigenous research methodologies is about bringing indigenous knowledge to the global market bringing those indigenous recipes to the global market so that they can compete with other recipes it has it is about the right to place indigenous ways of knowing and values at equal footing with other knowledge systems when we talk indigenous research methodologies we are therefore talking about mixed methods where mixed methods is not only about combining quantitative and qualitative data but it is also about combining indigenous knowledge indigenous methods with a other conventional methods so that when we talk of indigenous research methodologies we're talking about collaborative research we are talking about multiple methods that recognize indigenous methods indigenous knowledge is a indigenous recessional methodologies is about the right of indigenous people to prioritize the research agenda and participate in what is recess and to be recognized as core knowledge producers when you talk about prioritizing we are talking we are talking about the relevant research of course western researchers have been luxury just to research for curiosity's sake we indigenous people don't have that we need a research that can benefit us and it is uh it is us who can prioritize what is relevant indigenous research is about the resistance to stereotypes and deficit theorizing perpetuated by western knowledge western research colonial research the archives archived knowledge that continue to perpetuate stereotypes i can understand when indigenous people say but who wrote those reports who wrote those recipes in those books that talk about indigenous people from what perspective did they write them did they write about those recipes as recipes and food that is not only for eating but it is also for for spirituality it's also for well-being it is also for connecting people with the environment when they refuse to say no not those you have to understand that they're probably taken from a point of the world views a point of their own world views so indigenous research methodologies is not about replacing conventional methods with indigenous research methodologies it is about a coalition of knowledge systems a coalition that recognizes other knowledge systems on equal footing it is about decolonizing the minds of them indigenous people you know indigenous people they have been brainwashed to think that their foods are inferior it is therefore about indigenous people appreciating their own heritage where for example they recognize indigenous recipes indigenous foods as food that can compete in the global market indigenous research methodologies is about carrying out research informed by indigenous world views ways of perceiving reality and value systems those marginalized by western knowledge for example can begin by valuing the indigenous field conducting community research to remind people about the nutritional value of their foods and that's the spiritual healing of the foods i i happen to listen to a presentation by one of the students who had who was talking about food security in part of the country and one of the things that came out was that there were some indigenous foods that could help that could stand the vagaries of the climate much much better than those uh of uh uh crops that have been borrowed from the west however the people were not willing to grow indigenous crops because they've been brainwashed to think that eating rice is better than eating local food in research on indigenous foods that in that use an indigenous perspective indigenous methodologies as i said before it appreciates the value of food not only for quenching hunger but also for spirituality purposes for connection with the land an indigenous research worldview recognizes spirituality that is not talked about in western research and for you therefore it will be appropriate to research on indigenous food using an indigenous world view that goes beyond western ways of perceiving reality to indigenous ways of seeing reality spirituality also is reality to say that research has to respect indigenous values is to talk about eight hours that is the art of relationality this is ethic ethics the ethics of research includes relationality which is doing research that is long-lasting you build relationships with the people not helicopter research where you where where you get in and get out as quickly as possible it's about respect that is respecting the values of the people respecting their voices giving them a chance to participate is about responsity what is it what is this research giving back this documentation and databases what are they giving back to the communities is it okay to archive those in the form of documents knowledge that that has that that the researcher got from the the communities while the communities are hungry researchers can build their names with the research this and that but what are you giving back to their communities it's about responsible research responsible research is to say whose research is it who am i for as a researcher you always come up with a point of view you come into the search with a world view whose world view are you using are you looking at the researcher as somebody who doesn't know who you are helping because you can get funding from some sponsor elsewhere or are you only are you are you getting funds so that you can work with the researchers not for curiosity not to do research for curiosity but to do research that is relevant for us there is an urgent need for research that addresses our problems not research for curiosity of the people to prioritize their research agenda when you now say you are coming up with this and that is that your priority as a researcher or is that the priority of the people reverence people are indigenous people are very spiritual do you respect their spirituality responsiveness as you do research are you able to to respond to the immediate needs to the changes as you go along and you do the research or do you use book research where you say according to uh this author this is how it has to be done therefore i can't change i can't do that i can't do that reflexivity as you do research do you reflect upon yourself and say what uh what what are the kind of stereotypes and prejudices that i bring into this community do you reflect and lastly decolonization the ethics is ethics when it also decolonizes research and to decolonize research is to allow other people to speak from their own point of view their own world views thank you very much oh thank you so much uh professor chilisa that was um brilliant um those eight r's i think are really useful principles for all research um does anybody have any questions because we have just a couple of minutes and then we'll move on to the next one i can't see any questions um i think we're all absorbing just a quick thing i think um you know she hit the nail on the there needs to be a reverence to the knowledge that it's being produced because at times um you know this is something that also i i kind of like talk about that there's food that it's of nutrition or value that is good for you but there's like good for your well-being and that's something important that at times get get doesn't come through the research um and especially with at least i work in the caribbean and the indigenous communities there are not recognized so and there's all these ideas of they were all exterminated during the colonial times so their practices and spiritualities that are still active and also by recognizing them from a research point of view we are also giving them the agency and the recognition that they deserve outside of their own circles um thank you so much i have one question i am missing one of the r's could we have a list is relationality respect responsibility responsibility rights reverence responsiveness reflexivity and decolonization thank you so much i think you know you remind us that we all have our own worldview researchers they see what what they see through their own lens they don't document the spirituality because it's not part of their own culture so we need to leave our culture behind and step into and see things and be guided by your worldview so that we can do the research properly but anyway thank you so much and um we'll have hopefully a bit more time for discussion later but that was wonderful i'd like now to pass on to um uh so florence um daggy tan she's from the philippines and um to briefly introduce she is a um [Music] is one of the seven ethnic linguistic groups known as the igarots in the cordillera of the northern philippines and she's going to talk about indigenous methods for research on agri-food systems in the philippines she's also working at teb tebber good evening everyone it's it's i think eight o'clock in our in our area so i say good evening or good noon good afternoon i'm happy to be here and i thank i thank also the opportunity for me to speak on our experience i'm speaking as an indigenous person who has also gone to the academic world but my res my involvement in the research in the search for appropriate research methodologies comes from a being part of uh of a people's movement first from the advocates of the organic agriculture sustainable farming ecological agriculture agroecology things like that and then second as an advocate for the promotion of indigenous people's rights for for its fulfillment and respect so from the very start of my work just upon my college days because that was so much activism in the philippines that was the time of march alone we were fortunate enough to be given uh the correct orientation of working for the people and with the people so uh so we were taught that our people indigenous peoples in the era or indigenous peoples of the world create and produce knowledge from their day-to-day life as they relate with their nature and the land the monitor changes events places they closely observe what is in their surroundings and discover new ways of doing things whatever they discover they share to whoever is interested in the community like a better way of restoring the seeds the part of the forest where such trees can be found and others this knowledge are shared in various ways in different venues and these are stored in stories epics songs chants in the memories of our people but they are shared very or orally and this we have this in in at present today so we see that people have been creating knowledge and producing knowledge yet when we go to the communities and invite some group to do a research or because we were also told that to to work in the community you have to start where the people are so we have to do the research but if we invite some groups to do that research with us then they will say oh if it's research it's not for us it's for the school people those who come from the academy or those who went to the universities so we see a manifestation of the colonized research in our lands also uh uh even at this time so the first challenge that we need to transcend is to reiterate that people themselves are doing their own research and creation of knowledge in their day-to-day life in this event i would like to share some of the effective indigenous research methods that we have that that we do to especially in doing research in agri-food systems and when i'm when i was writing this it seems they are very much uh i think all of you knows this it's just a matter of saying it so one is the mapping or walking through our territory which is the essay which is the sense of place and identity for us so in the mapping some of the many things that we can draw or generate from the mapping exercise or walking through our territories is are the diversity of the food crops the different kinds of food crops in the cultivated area we we can list as many as 40 kinds with each kinds of different varieties so you see hundreds of varieties of food crops in our cultivated crops but we can also see the location of the naturally occurring wild plants and animals that are part of of the people's diet how the whole territory contributes to the community's diet we can also locate the abode of the unseen because these are very important to us they have to have a share of the food but when you look deeper into it it has so much a lot to do with the conservation of the species or the regeneration of species like one one belief is that if there is one bamboo shoot you should not be taking it because it's for the spirits or it's for the unseen and if you if you look at that in the scientific language then you will say that's for the regeneration so that something will come out again and reproduce itself and in the sacred sites or are also the abode of our spirits uh you cannot go and hunt there so it's a sanctuary for the science also for us it's about of the unseen who are our companions in our territory but i think for scientists it's the sanctuary of fauna and flora so they appreciate it very much but they will say we are superstitious if we say we do not go there because it's the mode of the spirit and in the mapping we did some upgrading so we also build their capacity to use the gps and also to build the 3d map so that then they can always come back to their map and talk about the things that we'd like to talk the second methodology is the use of traditional calendar it shows the availability of the food at what time of the year the time to plan and the time to harvest the time not to disturb the wild animals in the forest the fishes in their iceland the fishes in the rivers because this is the time for them to mate and reproduce again and the indicators of changes in the weather the third methodology is storytelling it can show certain food how certain food are valued and why it can show changes in the consumption and production pattern of our people how the wilds are protected and how seeds are conserved and how seeds are exchanged it can it can show also why we do certain rituals especially in our rice land every step of our every stage of the production cycle of the rice land we do retails so then our elders will explain why we have to do those rituals and then the compare and contrast method how commu how community elders and leaders are more proactive in the past than in the present because of the assimilation that is ongoing to us and how they were able to cope with food scarcity and farming the other is uh but now we rely on the government sometimes we we forget that we have our own uh ways of or our own self-reliance the other is the other method is the learning by doing when we do innovations in in our farming system like production of organic farm inputs and if this is the these are the times that we call sometimes we call on scientists to help us here like uh soil testing of of soil tests if we do a production of we use our resources to produce fertilizers and we also use modern technology and to face and decomposition things like that so we call on the scientists to help us with the laboratory work of if our soils are improving if the insects are more diverse insect population and then we also test the traditional indicators like for alkaline soil they say that sour and for acidic they say it's they taste it as bitter so we can test that in the laboratory it's not validation but i think it's in also enriching and then that you one of the actual things too is the cooking of traditional crops results and outcomes comes even as early as uh it depends on what you are researching or studying but but the most the most essential part is the collective analysis it's one of the most essential process which may lead to fall policy formulation like comparing and contrasting the food of the past and the present and the health of the children and then they will say oh let's ban the junk food but it will also have to have a commitment from the women to retrieve the traditional food that they used to have as a snacks things like that uh yeah and then it can also lead to action like reviving the our backyard gardens things like that for those are the things that we do and then for recommendation yeah of course full and effect if if it's an outsider who is coming to our communities the full and effective participation of the community should be first insured and then yeah also indigenous peoples have also come to do their community research and they should be supported and to also build our capacities and more important is to aya i think more important is that research should be an educational process for the facilitator and the communities and that the output of research like the knowledge produced should be first should first benefit the community for me also i still find it uh an internal conflict on publishing yeah because sometimes uh funders would like publishing but for me it will not matter if you publish or not but it matters very much that what has the community learned and what actual what awareness has been created and what actions have been done because of that research process and of course uh i know also that we indigenous while we have this yeah profound wisdom things like that but we also have to work with other collaborators thank you very much oh thank you so much florence that was really great and um it was really interesting to learn about your methods um about the mapping and so on storytelling um we have a little bit of time if anybody would like to ask a question or make a comment um this is sanjukta gosh from the soy south asia institute i'm a historian and researcher on agricultural knowledge my question is really related to the methods in indigenous knowledge that we just heard and i was curious to know you know who guards these agricultural calendars that you were talking about is it still with the elders or is it also something that the young and the women are involved in um and and how is you know agricultural calendar is again very based on a very long-term understanding of how seasons work and how crops and animals behave so i'm just curious how you're building in this whole notion of climate change with a more traditional agricultural calendar that is in place so are these things taken into account when you're changing practices or whether you're creating new calendars uh that's just something i had in mind yeah yeah thanks very thank you for the question uh at present actually in in the areas that i have gone climate change is actually uh in it does not fit in their calendar so it's uh for them also for the for our elders there's also uh because when they follow the rice cycle they have indicators like the coming of certain birds the flowering of certain crops and they cannot uh many times they cannot see it anymore and so and then also the coming of varieties that those are all those are also taken into consideration but uh so so they say how how do we deal how do they deal with that but from from the stories that i heard it says they more and more they do not rely on the the indicators on the changing season but more and more they rely on dreams so uh but but then also if uh because that calendar also synchronizes the activities right and it has a lot of to do of labor allocation pest control management so our elders are actually grappling with this change erratic changes in weather and season yeah so that's that's one of the challenge that we need also to have collaborative work with scientists great thank you so much is there any other question for florence or comment or other sharing from others yeah i mean i have to say florence and both and baguel it so much of what you said resonated with what i know um from indigenous research methods in in the andes um in the potato park and maize park and there's there's a lot of similarity um because i didn't know about you know the the ones florence and the philippines and but the the mapping by walking through the landscape through the territory and um and storytelling um and and many of the principles that both of you talked about i seem to be quite universal in terms of you know being important for indigenous communities being useful something that's useful directly to you um was emphasized by both of you um right so um i don't know if anybody else wants to make any comment feel free to jump in and just share your thoughts or reactions but not also question when i was talking and now i think also the elders are triangulating like their dreams their the the changes the indicators of seasons and then where the sun strikes in the morning yeah because these are the the things that lead them to declare this is that we start the season of planting thank you so much florence it was really brilliant okay well in that case um we should probably jump to um alejandro's presentation alejandro are you with us i think i just saw you good morning good morning so to introduce alejandro um he is the person who did all the translation for the potato park session um from quechua to english he's um director of programs at the swift foundation and he's a board member of association andes and an indigenous quechua leader and advisor to the potato park and coordinator of inmit the international network of mountain indigenous peoples and he's going to talk about the decolonizing methodologies that the ngo andes has developed with the potato park and the maize park communities uh please go ahead alejandra thank you christina and good morning everyone from my side um it's um it's a pleasure and an honor to participate in this panel um with so distinguished practitioners and activists and intellectuals all individuals so my greetings um i wanted to share a few slides because for us visuals dreaming imagining envisioning captures this very intimate relationship that we have with time with a space and it encapsulates those dreams that we continue to have and the picture you see is well known as machu picchu but it epitomizes what in digital research can do this is the an expression of a holistic approach to how ontologies and epistemologies can produce uh what we call sumacaosa or wendy beer holistic living machu picchu is a very um intricate all shows a very intricate relationship between you know water management so high knowledge of hydraulics engineering architecture mechanics physics but above all it shows this relationship with deep respect with the environment and i think in a current crisis and all these pressing socioeconomical political and ecological challenges that we are facing this type of knowledge it has become very important in terms of how we can weep new tomorrows so in our part of the world we are a product of like you see much much richer as a product of indigenous scholars looking for uh reaching this goal of wendy beer so this embodies uh spirituality a relationship with the natural world which is the cornerstone of this conception of knowledge and therefore the purpose of research is established there and expressing principles and values um we see in our past how this ontological and epistemic principles are embedded on how our ancestors have passed all knowledge to us and our responsibility to keep evolving to keep using this knowledge and evolving to respond to challenges of via the future key principles here are relationality initial result research methodologies is about accountability with the rest of our relations so it's not just about humans it is reciprocity that reflects with the relationship that we have among all the living elements that um or living beings including rocks or air or water and that live within this universe of us and also reciprocity we call it ime it's important in terms of research because it questions this positivistic colonial worldview that research is neutral but we have to only provide very informed consent as a manner of establishing consensual relationship when the relationship it's not between humans only and finally balance which is key to sustainability and how we seek to create um a balanced world within the natural and the human world within this um as i said um we have a a taxonomy that characterized this where we have three communities three ideas and our goal is when vivier in terms of research methods and learning approaches i just want to highlight three of them which are key to all the research activities we do yachai which means learning with a mind yankai which means doing and learning with your hands and munai which means learning and doing with the heart any type of action has to be carried out or developed within those three tools of learning and action now in terms of decolonizing methods that we apply participation based in this reciprocal relationship between people and the environment is key to it with the leadership of elders where the knowledge transmission and the participation of youth is key to it within this we continue to [Music] create tools that go beyond or challenges this colonial view that boxes individual research methods and tools within the hermetic borders of convention conventional qualitative research we are supposed according to that view only able to use storytelling community mapping legends oral tools that are key to one part of the research but in our case in our case we also use tools that provide the metrics to create data which after can be used to measure and provide numerical results that creates a better approaches to solving local problems uh here you have an old drawing of an in command using the kipu which in this side of the picture we have translated into a molecular key which is the same approach the same format but it reflects what is um what is within each one of the i2 potatoes like in in this case all this type of uh ranking different types of values which we call hupana continues to be used by women to rank and create give numerical value to different uses of medicinal plants or other crops this also supply in uh assessing climate change for for instance here where we create um hubs every 100 meters up in the mountain to assess population dynamics how pests or crops are moving up because of climate change this provides again using the same type of metals and tools numerical results that then we can use to create solutions this has allowed us to to harbor in the potato past in the case of the potato park a large number one of the largest in the world of uh potato collection keep those potatoes continue to do research in terms of participatory plant breeding or the collection of these varieties that are in dangers of disappearing and each multiplication and transfer to other communities so the focus of this as was the focus in the inca time continue to be how do we create solutions through food also we apply to policy no matter how supposedly complicated um this is an example of how we um [Music] come into conclusions on an evaluation on crispr this new technology that's flooring many research institutions of the world and being again the you know the silver bullet that's gonna create all these changes when we believe that um what we have within us uh can be the doors to the future so to finish um i know i have like i'm passing my time um this type of research can be perhaps better beyond itself is the colonizing focus also it can be conceptualized as some type of indigenous mixed method strategy that combines qualitative and quantitative research practices and responds to this main objective of summa causa which is the aspiration of our communities and this um as we see in the case of the kippu or a hupana we use the approp the appropriate theoretical frameworks to transform those old tools into new ways of keep learning and keep creating new knowledge so while our research strategy and methods are framed within a colonial biocultural history i think that the principles and values that are inherent to this practice creates also the possibility of new tomorrows and a decolonized research practice thank you thank you so much alejandro that was fascinating it's um it's wonderful to hear about the how your research combines the qualitative and quantitative but all within the use of indigenous principles and world views and for the goal of sumat kausai which is holistic well-being or buenbeved i don't know if anybody would like to ask a question i realize we have one for the previous for florence as well we can go back to in a minute but for alejandro does anyone have any questions or comments um i i will then ask one if that's okay um the the diagram you showed at the beginning alejandro with the um the principles that you were talking about maybe you could explain a little bit where that diagram what it is and where it's from because i think that's fascinating to learn about it for others who don't know which one christina santa cruz pachakuti oh this is the diagram um that um um was that capture what was expressed as an art and a holistic art expression in the most sacred temple of cusco the quarry country of the golden temple and this conceptual graphic um this drawing came from an indian chronicler who was able to translate it into this conceptual graphic uh in the mid 1500s after um you know um eur i mean the europeans arrive in cusco and um it basically captures our you know space our ontology our universe where we conceptualize three communities that interact reciprocate and try to work together towards achieving smart cause and those communities are the human community or the runa which includes everything that is not just human and humans nurture and reciprocity so domesticated crops animals water anything that lives around humans is considered runa the other realm is the salja or the wild so anything that has its own world like a wild biodiversity wild water while when whatever humans don't have control it has its own community and the third one which is the critical one is the aoki which reflects our [Music] connection with the sacred that's where our ancestors and the sacred principles that define the epistemological architecture of knowledge are embedded so these three communities have to work together and the way of communicating and seeking balances through the sacred uh principle of reciprocity or i need and once that balance is achieved we have reached suma causa so could you show it to us briefly so people know which one you're talking about please i was referring to this to this where um you had this old drawing of santa cruz pachacuti and uh you know if you see uh the middle star that's the southern cross which in most indigenous uh traditions is a sacred symbol because it connects the sacred with the human world it connects the um you know we call it chicana it's like a bridge we breach all types of epistemologies and you know um generations and and you know different types of conceiving the world so is the key of diversity and with that we have the aoki iu this which is the sacred the iu ayu which is the wild and the runai you the human realm and what is reciprocity as i said um we achieved sumac outside so you know this paradigm this concept of sumatra of course go beyond this idea of sustainability where um you know the economical uh interests or it's viewed upon an architecture that's that keeps um pushing this capitalist uh uh world view of western the western world to the infinite how we keep destroying nature without destroying that's what sustainability means in terms of i think western mind so we kind of challenge that with this paradigm uh and where the ethical aspects of research which are embedded in the spiritual values of nature's peoples are strongly reflected in the aokia thank you oh thanks a lot for explaining that so the the old diagram from this incur chronicler in in the 1500s now guides their their research which is led by community researchers from each community in the potato park and um it's very much um about traditional knowledge indigenous knowledge transmission transmitting the values and transmitting the knowledge between elders and youth through the research process as alejandro mentioned at the beginning so it's a way of you know really revitalizing these cultural values and biocultural heritage using these ancient principles uh from the incas which i think it is a really nice um example which i haven't seen others do but um i would love to find similar um you know graphics and principles and concepts for other indigenous peoples i think it would really help in revitalizing biocultural heritage does anybody uh would anybody like to share any reflections with alejandro if not we can go back to florence's question okay so um okay i mean if if people want to continue um you know want to comment on your presentation anybody want to don't be shy okay we can always come back to alejandro and to begin in the conversation but for now i'm gonna um look at this question for florence um uh panilla would you like to say your question are you still with us okay i'll read it out uh thank you florence for the rich presentation when you refer to the elders triangulation i also see we can add the very long timeline they have to build their experiences on they have observed and interacting with their landscape for so long and with so many perspectives so it can never be com compensated with other methods from science which is in the best case study one one fact facto in long time series but many times represents a snapshot in one dimension okay so it's a comment and panilla would you please um explain that if you're still with us because i didn't fully understand it but i think pernilla is trying to say that uh because i mentioned that uh in the age of uh yeah on the triangulation i will start first with that because in the in in our when we do our research we found out that the when they declare the season to one season to start they make use of uh when does some would there are places where at the at the first break of the of the sunrise the sun strikes somewhere and another is the the the indicators in the change in weather around the surroundings and another is their dream so that now we only hear that they more rely on dreams because uh changes are happening and some of the indicators have disappeared and and also that of course yeah something like that but what i what i understood from bernie is that because i mentioned that with the age of this change in climate and erratic weather condition we may need also support to hasten the knowledge development on how we are going to appropriate our our calendar in the changing times and so i think bernie is saying that we may not be needing other knowledge system because our elders are there that's what i got from her comment right okay thank you very much um i wonder if um something i i thought might be really relevant to others is to understand a bit better um more specifically your methods of research alejandro so the capacity building workshop workshops for the indigenous research experts and then the the app that you use for them to collect the data and that goes straight to a database and you can explain all this much better but we've been talking a little bit about documenting knowledge and databases and how to build a knowledge base in communities and maybe you could explain your methodology on that aspect please me how to integrate metrics and make measurements that reflect better or more accurate how and you know we conceptualize the our own universe in terms of its relationality uh everything is connected to everything so you cannot do research um which is um you know books and some type of speciality um and how the results of um you know this type of um holistic approach or integrative approach where you have mixed methods working all the time can be captured and stored so um we had and develop a process by which we tried in the first instance to combine the collection methods in terms of the qualitative and quantitative approaches without making these type of distinctions but rather looking the needs of particular phenomena that we may be interested in learning or solving once we have the tools that are uh decided to gather information then um we have created ways visual ways of um and capturing that type of information which includes the use now of an application that we have developed in-house that takes advantage of the visuals that um a um you know a phone or a tablet these days may offer like video uh photograph uh gps for mapping uh so a and uh voice recording so those are also um you know tools that um you would use in traditional knowledge uh transmission within within this context so when we use those but frame within an app for a tablet by which we start gathering information and then selecting them in what we call a bioculture database once database it's when this is stored in the database then as you've seen in the pictures the um the our elders get together in knowledge circles and they start analyzing the data by use of graphics um this is them tabulated into into boxes as you see in the u panna which is kind of a a chinese abacus the way we use these boxes you know a matrix and the ranking numerical ranking is done by using grains of mice it provides you know the numerical data that we are looking and which is them translate it into into um you know back into the database and then we mix it uh with the help of uh you know already existing programs for uh research um like i survey or orders from which we have borrowed the methodology and we can do uh the analytical measurements uh and arrive to some conclusions those conclusions go into another meeting of elders and youth who them analyze the the resulting information to take the best decisions in terms of which of those um or how to apply that information solving problems it could be a pest or disease in a crop it could be soil fertility it could be water management it could be policy so um the matrix idea that our ancestors are incas use automatic stool that our ancestor incas used to use you know they um of course they um allow us to um to um create this this type of um of approach of uh i mean a process um and then once it's um the decision is made then the community assembly sanctions and becomes part of a life plan so it's included in in a long-term plan which the local authorities have the obligation to implement so that's more or less the how we combine you know our old tools um more often from modern tools uh the mechanics of doing that and produce results that can be useful to particular um situations or problem solving that are more localized i don't know if that responds to question christina yes thank you very much i mean maybe i'll just add to clarify um because i i know about the transect use and in the in the maze park they've been doing transects walking through the landscape using um you know smartphones with this app and the elder um or community researcher and the youth and maybe a staff from the local ngo are scientists they walk together and there's probably more people from the communities and in that way they can do a transect looking at the plants with the elders talking about their uses and the knowledge being transferred to the youth and the the the plant being having a botanical name and that goes in as they walk to see each plant they have a discussion sharing knowledge and they take a picture and they put the information in and they collect information about um medicinal and nutritious wild plants and that's all gone straight into their community database um so anyway i just thought um trying to give it uh some practical um example of how it's used right well we're coming close to the end um we we still have a few minutes of discussion um i put a question in the agenda um how can interdisciplinary methods be used in a decolonizing participatory action research framework i don't know if anybody um wants to comment on that i guess we've heard about lots of um interdisciplinary methods ethnobotany we've heard about um archaea botany um and we've heard about oral histories and i i don't know if anyone wants to reflect or comment on their usefulness for um indigenous lead research could you see that if i may do you allow me yes go ahead please um i think that what you have said is um very important but it's part of the whole picture you know um we are reducing this discussion to uh the practice of research in the field where you have to be respectful you have to follow private informed consent and try to support the local movement in terms of decolonizing processes but that decolonizing must also happen in research institutions if you see many of the institutions out there that do this type of research you know they don't have any indigenous academic or researchers in their staff all you know research is done in a way that is cheap to hire in digital researchers in the country of origin you know and do this and present it as a participatory i hope the participatory also can include the salaries so that this is the same type of recognition goes to researchers in digital researchers as um at the same you know balancing with uh those of academics also the lack of individual researchers to actually guide you know this transformative approach decolonizing approach in this institutions everywhere in the world it needs to be complemented you know with the devolution of genetic material cultural material that was misappropriated that was pillaged you know from indigenous lands in colonial times and there's you know long overdue that seeds medicinal plants ornamentals trees go back to the communities of origin uh and stop being you know misused and utilized through patents and all types of commodifying methods and you know western institutions or what we feel it's sacred uh and it's exhibit as a trophies of war in museums and other institutions must be the ball doing indigenous you know quarters so i think that this discussion decolonizing research also takes into account this other side of the coin where colonial attitudes racist white supremacy and research continues to be very strong and it's not changing so it's just like a a reflection uh on on your previous comment thank you uh thank you very much alejandro that's i fully agree with what you're saying um i have two questions uh i think julian would you like to say something yeah um so actually was a question on this aspect of decolonizing for alejandro because i see that the um there's the use of historical text and um of european colonial text and in of the colonization and i i wonder because we have also a lot for the caribbean um but the question is how do you make the decision of actually what you know decolonizing that narrative from those texts how can how does how what is the process that the community makes to actually like oh this is what we're gonna take from this i think that's uh you know defined by the specificity of what the community considers to be a priority in terms of solving problems you know it could be you know as in our case um climate change and particularly in mountain ecosystems in the andes is one of the you know existential pets that we have all the crops are moving very fast up in the mountain most of our crops are just uh you know at the top and uh we're very sure that we're going to lose not just the crop but also you know complete seed seed and food systems so in that case like uh everybody agrees that whatever effort we make into learning creating knowledge uh organizing information to solve those problems must be focused on that type of um on that type of problem-solving um and then once we have uh you know the the objective of what we want to do then we go into what we have you know and i think in our case because you know we have a long history in terms of having created a relationship with the environment and thrive on it in a very organic manner that means that we have applied science and technology in the past you know for the benefit of all relations the benefit no chance of humans but by the benefit of all so what type of tools do we use to keep uh you know focusing on that focusing on that uh you know holism focusing on on that type of balance and interaction uh that would create you know um a a new tomorrow so then we p we we choose the different tools be it from the past or or combined and that's why we we resolve the question so i guess in each context it's going to be different thank you alejandra i'm afraid we've got well we're meant to be finishing in two minutes but if it's okay we could stay for another five minutes as people want to ask questions uh you ching song wants to say something go ahead you hi uh yes uh thank you for all the contributors uh i handle the presentation about the biocultural uh biocultural uh heritage framework really remind me of our spiritual leader leader g shienhu he attended uh uh the day before yesterday that he presented about the uh the community's bicultural part like a form into four-part culture physical which is the eco eco-biodiversity part and the community part and he described that exactly like alexander described it is a culture spirit as a base as a core and it is a live and organic process interacted within the community and among the commun other communities end with outside world and it's a live process evolution process so i think that if we're talking about the decolonizing research the first thing we need to do is that they really need to understand them learning from them in in order to realize that they really need to be follow the community-based action research and attach to the ground working together with them and rather otherwise we cannot we cannot understand the whole it's a whole world it's a whole complex complexity a live organical world it's not like a science it's just a part and a piece one special actually in one part we really need to understand the linkage in the whole systems if we not with them we we have no idea so that's what i want to add up thank you great thank you very much joshie you wanted to make a comment please go ahead yes there is a thread in the discussion about what can be recovered for example from colonial archives or history and material written by the outsider right now in the cordillera we had to write our own history because uh the books that are located that are used in the schools were all colonial history right however we had a very strong supporter who was a historian and he's uh he's an american scholar actually and he wrote cracks through the parchment curtain right and what he did was to actually use all of the historical uh archives but using historical research to understand and interpret what was actually happening in the on the land at that time right and that material that he has written including his other historical writing became the uh supplemented a lot of material that the students and the researchers the indigenous researchers used to write our own history of the cordillera so there really is a lot of material that can be interpreted in our own way that is uh in the colonial archives for example when even in this is not just in the philippines for example in moluccas when they needed their maps to uh record their customary systems they had to go back to the dutch libraries to get that right so um there is a way of there is another aspect of the colonization of those colonial institutions and i think they are starting to take the steps wherein that history is understood and owned and appropriated for us to make our own uh story and i think uh this is one of the strands that has gone through the the discussion thank you great thank you shoji i'm afraid we're out of time now it's been great discussion thank you so much everybody i'm not going to summarize everything but just to say um yeah i i think this issue that alejandro raised about the repatriation is um you know really important one and we've seen how in the potato park repatriation of of native potatoes has brought back revived indigenous knowledge and culture and um you know created a genetic reserve that's important for that for the whole world and there's a lot of um seeds uh that that indigenous communities have lost and that are sitting in in gene banks um you know and they could be being used and used for for climate adaptation and being protected in nature um so that's a really important issue um i wanted to say thank you so much to alejandro and to baguel chilisa and to florence dagutan for your great presentations i've learned so much from you thank you very much and uh thank you to the presenters this morning and just to close really a few a few things that we've learned um in the last four webinars we've learned that indigenous food systems play a critical role in achieving sdg2 um and in feeding humanity in a sustainable way in future in the longer term and are resilient in a resilient way not only to climate change but to covert 19 and also in a compassionate way because of the solidarity values and whereas under the current food system we're seeing growing food insecurity and hunger and so indigenous food systems provide critical lessons for transitions to more sustainable and equitable food systems um we've heard very strongly today that research must address indigenous people's priorities and the many challenges facing indigenous food systems and this is urgent because we are losing traditional knowledge we're losing crops we're losing culture very fast and research must also address the unequal power relations between researchers and indigenous peoples and be empowering towards indigenous peoples and give them a voice and recognize them as experts who have ancestral wisdom that offers valuable pathways towards sustainable and equitable development so finally on terms of the next steps we're going to circulate the workshop report and use the outputs to inform various policy meetings um i know this hasn't been a perfect forum for networking but i hope it's you will follow up on contacts that you've made um i'm really grateful for all of your inputs all of the indigenous peoples all of the universities the fao and iid partners we need to continue working together and finally a huge thanks to all the indigenous experts and speakers from universities um and a huge thanks to philip orion from queue who we've doing this workshop with and and the ahrc project and a huge thanks to the iid support team to matt wright and alastair who have provided great technical support and to beth down at iid i've really enjoyed it i've learned so much from you i hope we can continue the conversation and we'll probably send a short survey if you if you wouldn't mind anyway i'm sorry about the distance and the um that we can't actually see each other but um thanks a lot for all the learning goodbye",
