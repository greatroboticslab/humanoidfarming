1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,120
what is the fastest way to level up your

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,919
hourglass for Guardians of Fortune to be

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,620
honest this has been a mystery to me

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,960
since hourglass pvp's launch back in

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,020
season 8. but thanks to fellow content

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,940
creator toxy Sinclair's latest video we

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,440
have a new strategy in town that is

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,900
exactly what we're going to be doing in

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,080
this video copying um I mean taking

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,400
inspiration from an amazing video which

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,920
you should all check out in the

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,980
description of this video and practicing

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,660
it on my own terms I mean that wasn't

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,360
the intention of one of my streams

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,640
twitch.tv Mystic but when things got

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,879
interesting I decided it was worth a

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,700
shot in today's adventure

18
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,920
so what is the strategy we aren't going

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,739
to go the conventional route here and

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,000
dive below the waves to match make

21
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:53,280
instead we're gonna let the people

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,440
invade our servers

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,660
why would anyone do this if you may ask

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,879
well it's so that we can take advantage

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,699
of one of the most forgotten features

26
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,539
that season 8 brought us the treasure

27
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,119
grade

28
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,580
you see toxy discovered that regular old

29
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,799
Merchant Commodities boost faction grade

30
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,260
and as you can imagine farming

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,060
Commodities from Outpost Outpost is not

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,400
too difficult of a task

33
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,320
there is only one problem though in

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,960
order to purchase Commodities you need

35
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,060
to be a representative of the merchant

36
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,280
Alliance and with the fast queue times

37
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,320
on EU servers this could become a

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,500
problem as we would want to end up with

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,200
grade 5 faction stash but also grade 5

40
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,140
Athena Emissary which requires at least

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,780
two fights to achieve

42
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,060
again I didn't originally plan on doing

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,659
this method but after my second fight

44
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,659
well

45
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,360
thank you

46
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:30,080
[ __ ] you're a streamer

47
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,080
huh

48
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,360
mistakes

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:39,540
your butt blank's friend Birch plank oh

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,940
right you actually do holy shh

51
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,940
[Music]

52
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,280
oh I'm gonna get stolen Commodities

53
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,140
let's go wait I actually kind of want

54
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,879
this

55
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,760
things changed

56
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,860
so there I was faced with a decision do

57
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,040
I risk my streak and go for toxic

58
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,840
strategy or call it quits and sell

59
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,180
as you can imagine from the title of

60
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,640
this video there was no quitting we was

61
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,920
going for the faction champion after

62
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,200
purchasing Commodities I re-raised

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,959
Athena Emissary in the case of evasion

64
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,260
however I happen to notice a grade 5

65
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,940
merch in Emissary and for sure knew this

66
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,500
was going to be the key to getting grade

67
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,500
5 faction stash

68
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,980
am I supposed to feel bad I

69
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,459
he left okay

70
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:57,440
the thing is people I I need I need his

71
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,440
supplies I need his loot

72
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,440
you know pirating is just

73
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,540
you know it is where you make it right

74
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,180
after sinking the ship and starting to

75
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,879
board on the treasure we had done it we

76
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,760
had successfully reached grade five but

77
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,380
just as that happened well we were

78
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,459
invaded

79
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,459
I knew this would happen

80
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,919
right we're grade five Let's uh let's

81
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,919
vacate

82
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,100
foreign

83
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,699
how does this dude have legendary Sea

84
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,699
Dog chat

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,220
I think he's an average tdmr

86
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,680
we sank our third ship of the day and

87
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,979
decided to travel over to plunder

88
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,020
Outpost as this is the closest Outpost

89
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,539
nearby where we could sell all of our

90
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,520
loot without complications here would be

91
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,919
where we would wait in preparation for

92
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,800
our fourth and Final Fight for faction

93
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,199
Champion we waited for a lot longer than

94
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,080
expected as the server seemed to be full

95
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,900
so after removing one AFK Sloop later

96
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,180
and waiting for our next battle well

97
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,960
let's just say it's not how I was

98
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:41,120
expecting to reach faction champion

99
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,120
break has gone so

100
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:48,020
okay and now

101
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,020
I'm able to vote so

102
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:53,779
is there someone on the island

103
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,779
[Music]

104
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,359
[Music]

105
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,319
yes

106
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,460
okay right trap here we go

107
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:22,680
okay they didn't bother turning so

108
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,660
there's now a thought of the Damned on

109
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,199
the server

110
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,199
okay

111
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,099
where did they go

112
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,039
I think

113
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,000
is he trying to sell to the force adapt

114
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,840
no I don't

115
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:59,060
Fort Rudder maybe maybe it was meant to

116
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,060
be what what the hell is that

117
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,460
oh man

118
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,139
oh man I don't like this

119
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,560
all right let's see how much rep we got

120
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,560
come on let's see the wrap

121
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,879
bro I got a whole lot a whole level for

122
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,879
that

123
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,819
whole level

124
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,740
try I got a whole level

125
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,899
this isn't exactly how I pictured my

126
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,419
last battle going and was contemplating

127
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,640
continuing this streak however I decided

128
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,680
against this as I fought a fortune

129
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,380
spawned on the server meaning that the

130
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,320
likelihood of invasion was very slim due

131
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,720
to the players not leaving our Waters

132
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,580
however after all of the fighting the

133
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,640
reputation gained by reaching faction

134
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:56,100
Champion while at grade 5 seemed to be

135
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:00,200
worth it that is if you're lucky enough

136
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,200
to consistently be invaded

137
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,779
been feeling

138
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:10,260
see what rewards we get I don't think

139
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:13,700
you get anything extra for having ending

140
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,700
with a grade five

141
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,560
okay so let's see let's see the wrap

142
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,380
the whole level basically

143
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,779
in conclusion do I recommend giving this

144
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,300
a try sure but it's a very

145
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:41,700
circumstantial and requires a lot of

146
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,200
luck once again thank you toxy for

147
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,120
making your video on this strategy

148
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,920

149
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,899
