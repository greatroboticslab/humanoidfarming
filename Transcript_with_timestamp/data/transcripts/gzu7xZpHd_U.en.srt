[Music]

2
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,840
one of the most difficult things that we

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,199
struggle with is regular maintenance on

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,439
equipment and as we're kind of winding

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,039
down getting to the end of the season

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,480
and have more free time the equipment

7
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:29,560
comes home from jobs and we've got

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,279
opportunities to do regular maintenance

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,239
well it's not regular this would be

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,280
seasonal maintenance so some of those

11
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,079
things

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,920
include changing oil transmission

13
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:45,280
hydraulic fluids tightening tracks some

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,039
of those things that that throughout the

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,000
work season that maybe we didn't get to

16
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,840
or that we didn't give enough

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,039
attention some of the other things that

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,000
we've done this year is is new teeth on

19
00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:00,519
the buckets new cutting edges on the

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,160
excavator buckets um we've got that 6t

21
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:05,920
grading bucket and we've got a rock

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,600
bucket here that we put new teeth on

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,119
and it's it's you can get a lot of wear

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,360
out of those teeth you can run them

25
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,680
right down to to to the nub right down

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,920
to nothing but we found that they cut a

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,600
lot better they work a lot better when

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,960
they're sharp and so it's worth that

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,200
additional money of changing the teeth

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,240
regularly to to have that machine

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,040
working as efficiently as

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,520
possible so again that's just some of

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,799
the the annual maintenance that we do

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,320
that's in addition to regular

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,240
maintenance like greasing and oiling and

36
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,200
oil oil changes and those types of

37
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,799
things that may be more regular on the

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,079
schedule but it's it's a full-time job

39
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,200
trying to to keep up on the

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:59,850
maintenance in addition to get the work

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:17,200
done and keep projects moving forward

42
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:18,640
[Music]

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,720
throughout the

44
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,920
year there are certain projects like if

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,319
we've got a big road building project

46
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,640
then we'll we'll make upgrades to

47
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,239
equipment that maybe hasn't gotten

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,120
upgrades in a few years this year here

49
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,280
we put new tires on the road grader

50
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,360
because we had we had a couple of miles

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,879
of road to build and we were going to be

52
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,599
working the heck out of that road grader

53
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,599
and it needed some new tires I couldn't

54
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,840
afford to have a breakdown on the job

55
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:51,920
and not be able to finish the job so got

56
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,319
new tires they got new cutting edges

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,959
they got a full service and then as we

58
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,440
started that job I knew that we were

59
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,640
going to be able to well

60
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,640
have a better shot at getting the job

61
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,360
completed with that maintenance done and

62
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,000
so it's it's kind of an interesting

63
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,239
thing on the equipment that's older and

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,519
that it's paid for it's almost like

65
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,440
there's still payments on that equipment

66
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,519
you want to be putting money

67
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,239
away so

68
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,280
that when the time comes and you need

69
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,360
that new tires or new cutting edges or

70
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,000
whatever it might be that you've got the

71
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,480
money in the bank to service set

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
equipment and keep it running so it can

73
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,120
keep making you money we put new tires

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,080
on the grater and a lot of people said

75
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,599
that they're they're not aggressive

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,680
tires or they're not they're not knobby

77
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,560
enough part of the reason that I made

78
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,840
the decision on this tire and this tire

79
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,840
tread is that The Grater does a lot of

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,040
compaction on the road as it's traveling

81
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,879
back and forth compacting material and

82
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,920
these tires do a better job of

83
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,959
compacting and making it flat so I can

84
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,280
run this greater down on the road I can

85
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,799
crab walk and and offset the back from

86
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,319
the front just slightly and roll that

87
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:11,120
road with these tires and a great big

88
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:15,480
heavy duty tractor tire doesn't lay it

89
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,680
in as smooth as these do and they're

90
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,280
these are some really good tires they

91
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,320
came highly recommended so far uh I've

92
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:47,610
been impressed

93
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:47,610
[Music]

94
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,880
one of the things we're working on this

95
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,560
winter is clearing out this 5 acre piece

96
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,039
we've recently purchased this 5 1/2 acre

97
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:04,720
piece and our plan is to put up a barn

98
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:07,400
where we can put tools store equipment

99
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,880
and have a place to do some of that

100
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,240
maintenance whether it's regular

101
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,720
maintenance or annual maintenance

102
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,560
whatever it might be so we're clearing a

103
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,840
lot there's some some saw piles there's

104
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,440
some rock and gravel we've got a lot a

105
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,880
lot of cleanup to do typically we

106
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,720
wouldn't start a project like that like

107
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,000
like this right now but it's the weather

108
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,319
is warm there's no snow on the ground

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,520
and we can deal with a little bit of mud

110
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,280
the barn will let us take care and do

111
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,160
maintenance through the winter when we

112
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,800
have these slower times when we can't be

113
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,319
out building roads or working on other

114
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,680
projects so this is the start of

115
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:49,360
building a barn some of you might

116
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,160
recognize this property we we this this

117
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,560
5 and 1/2 acre piece is adjacent to the

118
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,800
40 acre piece where we've been

119
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,520
developing houses over the last couple

120
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,759
of

121
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,919
years really enjoy this area area we

122
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,800
like being close to town we like being

123
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:09,520
close to the highway it's I can get to

124
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,080
Starbucks in 3 minutes or Home Depot in

125
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,639
four um and so this area is really close

126
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,120
and and we've spent a lot of time out

127
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,560
here and really like this area so when

128
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,240
this

129
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,360
opportunity came to pick up an adjacent

130
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,880
parcel I I knew that I I wanted to jump

131
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,199
on it I had to have it I wanted to be

132
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,759
out here I really have had a great time

133
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,000
working on this development project the

134
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:37,759
last couple years um all of the parcels

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,280
have sold and there's houses

136
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,919
on I think I think there's foundations

137
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,000
on seven out of the eight

138
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,479
parcels and finished houses on half of

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,360
that and another by the end of next year

140
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,260
I my guess is that there'll be houses

141
00:06:52,360 --> 00:08:24,970
built on every single parcel

142
00:06:55,260 --> 00:08:24,970
