  "text": "[Music] swam prha digital India educated India [Music] [Music] let us start uh this lecture with a thought process that all of we are here to learn right learning is a process and uh we should have love for learning so I always feel that love for learning lessons the labor pains of learning today learning is a very difficult process for all of you right because you people are occupied with several other things and therefore it is very important you should develop a love for it and and learning is a part and parcel of human life uh let us recall what we learned in the last lecture we basically looked at that why we need to go for uh agriculture as a basis for our growth right and why because uh you know like we are having a naturally Endor with the resources which are very conducive and uh you know for the agriculture or the farming and later on we looked at like uh what are the processes involved in agriculture and how this modern agriculture being implemented as of now right and today we'll be looking at what are the problems we are facing with the modern farming and you know like uh in 19 uh 50s or the 60s you know like we are having Green Revolution people are very much where Gaga about it and today also some of the you know intellectuals are very saying that we need to go for second Green Revolution is it really Revolution or not that we'll see and I will I will put forward or I'll show you uh some data to it but let us before that let us look at what the problem in the modern agriculture we use more fertilizers and more pesticide for what because more fertilizers we give the growth will be better and then you know production of the crop will be higher and more pesticide we have to give because the pest are the are more increasing at a number because uh as a result that we are more profit Maniac you know we are want to have more greedy greed greediness has come to our mind too much right and there's a whole world not only in India across because of this is what you call materialism like as I told earlier Market materialism makes a man Maniac so we became Maniac you know like for profit man for grabbing all those things are going on in our mind that is a what we call uh Det of mind power to think which is right which is wrong getting s away so therefore that is the problem and then it is thrust upon us and we are just not thinking about what and paste and diseases are part and parcel of nature keep in mind that because one person will be relying on other right and they balance and so also disease is the thing to Decay and then you will be going so this is the part of nature in ide system Natural Balance between predators and past are to be maintained so that you know each are connected with each other these are all philosophy what are embedded in our uh you know uh traditional knowledge system in our ancient wisdom and which we need to understand basic things what we are talking about here you need to understand the basic laws of nature and then work accordingly not going against and you know uh imbalancing or doing something that balance will be broken balance is important because we cannot really look at only small micromanagement the whole big picture we need to look at it and big picture are very order and then it may be looking like a disorder but actually as I told that our civilization order in disorder and that is natural so that has to be looked at so chemical control that's why we want to have a control over this uh diseases and also the past so that last 40 years you know insecti use have increased 10-fold while the crop losses from the past damage have double losses are increasing and you are increasing that also right insect so one has to look at that why it is so and as a result the safety of the people 1 million cases of poisoning by pesticide each year around the world and up to uh 20,000 of these results in debt this poisoning because of and this number may be more I mean like you know and dates occur in tropical countries where chemical piz which are banned in Europe and other Western countries like USA are still being used in India right I mean there are several examples I am not going to look at it and you can see your for example DDD and then some other thing even Ura people are not but we are using it here in this country so uh and cost of farming increasing at alarming rate and as a result food prices are also being increased very much around 300% in last 10 years and if look at we are having a people who are hands to mouth living like hands to mouth laborers and where they will get the food because the food price are now is comparable to the global global market and earlier days food was very cheaper in this country whenever I visit other country I feel oh we are safe we are having at least food a common person can get today it is not because of globalization and you know right and problem with the industrial agricultural practice I have already discussed me just uh highlight some of the points I'll be highlighting more again because I want that some of the things will be repeative in nature but keep in mind these are important we need to understand that then only we can take characteristic as I told that monocultures basically the single kind of crop they use and that erods the biodiversity among both plants and animals it is not only with the plants only because all are connected so therefore that is creating and uh if you look at the nature is always multi layer or you know various things it's not heterogeneous it's not homogeneous we trying to make it homogeneous because in engineering we do that you know but that is not that is a wrong it is not easier to handle the heten thing you make it homogeneous therefore you say that no it nature is other way around it is your limitation that you are trying to push forward or the you know thrust upon the people but you must understand that nature is not like that and there is a strength in that synthetic chemical fertilizers are being used blatently which pollute the soil not only the soil water and air all whatever the environment we are getting spoiled because of this blatent use of chemical fertiles I'll be showing how it is so and both environment and although not only the human health but also the animal health plant Health all are being connected so soil which is the soul of infinite lives right and that is getting uh spoiled you know much faster than it can be replen and taking with its land's fertility the whatever the fertility nutrients the land land the soil is having it is going away and which are very important this fertility and nutrients are very important for the growth of the plants and those things we eat as a food but those are been getting away you know I'll be showing you later on like what are the things and I'll also give you data how this most of the civilization got extinguished got spoiled because of soil quality is going down at that time we need to keep that and maybe in the next class I'll will show you some data and water is consumed at unsustainable rates in many agricultural areas because water being used too much and it is also uh helping to take away or leeching out the what do you call this fertility and nutrients which you are adding to the soil artificially and also the natural one all are going away so you know you are using because of too much use of water so effect of pesticides on environment if you look at chemical P can kill useful insects there's a lot of you know microorganism insects are very useful pollination for pollination we need but they are not you know and if pollination won't be there then you can't have a food production you may have very big plants but you don't have now in Western country people are using artificial pollination you know like why you will do that and cost is in will be increasing which at the past leading to the imbalance in nature whole mother nature is in imbalance you are cutting the limbs of and you know fingers or you know if look at a body my fingers are being cut my you know hand being removed from the mother nature you know Mother Nature if you considered as a body that is not the way so therefore you need to look at it and uh as I told earlier artificial chemical can stay in environment in the bodies for a number of years right even if you won't use it will stay for in your thing for Generation to generation and you cannot really afford to do that and causing problem for many years it is not for your generation it is for the next maybe 5 10 generation will have to suffer because of you have used the chemical fertilizers and which are not good for the health so therefore we need to understand insect past are very quickly or over a fear of breeding Cycles they become resistant to artificial products they also try to resist the thing and develop a hormones and other things so that they can because that is the nature nature is intelligent you know they are working to go suppose somebody will try to hit you you will have to protect yourself right find out ways and means use your mind use your body use your resources use your power to do that they are also doing that way okay and are no longer controlled by the label of chemicals what we we were using earlier days I'll be showing you some data as well so if you look at fertilizer consumptions you look at this in 1960s we are having fertilizer consumption is very very low if you look at this is the color orange color that bound is very very low million tons maybe you know like one or two million tons and it is goes on increasing and so also China and then we are because we want to grow at a faster rate than the other people and that is the bigger problem but if you look at America which is a very intelligent people you know like they have grown this a higher increase from 1960 to maybe 80s they realize these are not good and they are almost remaining constant and sometimes going negative and I do not know the data last maybe 6 seven years but I'm sure that they might have decreased it so if you look at we need to do that we'll have to cut off and then the whole business you know they are sending their multi company to here to Swindle us and users and then spoiled we will be intelligent and we should understand this and then do that so uh and if you look at we are as we are using more fertilizers and more pesticides and other things we are spoiling also the groundw I was told of course this may not be the correct but you please check don't go by any data I'm giving please correct it check it and then accept it uh in some newspaper this thing I learned that 60% of groundw in China are not drinkable in India you think about it my guess is around maybe 20 to 25% of the at least in kpur I know there is some area where the water has gone ground water has gone bad deadly bad so therefore we need to and uh worry about that because that sustains the life and if we spoil the ground letter and which are interconnected how we are going to uh what you call correct it or how we are going to um huh replenish how you do that can you take it out by the pump and again put it is it possible all are connected you know like interconnected right so how will uh you know uh take care of that polluted water so therefore we'll have to worry about and if you look at the fertilizer conception I know nitrogen is there is a phosphatic type and potass potassic type it is all are increasing know in 1991 where something 80 in lxs tons you know this is in lcks of tons 80 LHS tons now one in 2007 166 and today maybe it will be something 175 or maybe 80 I do not know okay okay you please look at it all are increasing we should decrease it we should at least stabilize it you know because we know it is they are harmful but still because our people are illiterate and then so also the thing and the people are using advertisement and other thing to uh what you call Le them for this for the more production and more profit as a tool to em them you know right lure them but all our we are spoiling the health let us look at how is the food production related to F fertilizer consumptions right so uh if you look at that this is I've taken the data from 70 to 2002 it's a little old data but let us look at the trend this blue color is fertilizer consumption rate it is going up sometimes in 75 it is gone up above the red line that is corresponding to the million terms of food production and then if you look at it is uh food production is lower down at least 95 onwards and the fertilizer consumption is increasing and let me tell you last year I had gone to some nearby Village in uh kpur where people are you know and then I inquired with the farmers I told what are the consumption they're saying that we are using almost double the fertilizers what we are using 10 years back for get getting the same you know tonage for acre kind of air crop see look at what we are doing that means the soil fertility has gone down and you are adding more and more and then it will be spoiling right so therefore the farmer committing suicide because the cost of farming is increasing at an alarming rate than the what price they can get in in the you know uh what you call Market as a result you know they are in debt therefore government of India is you know uh what you call uh um taking away their dat in the sense giving the what you call subsidies no not subsidy it is M like loans waving waving of the loans they waving of the loans but that is not the solution solution has to be found out looking at what are the causes of it and then look at fundamentally and solve the problem and there all of you uh who are listening to these lectures and then you'll have to come into picture and educate them and also educate the government about these wrong policies of using these Concepts because you know we are democracy we should do that and uh the growth is I mean we are all talking about Green revolutions and other thing we want to have another Green Revolution people are talking about genetically modified crops and I'm afraid one should not venture to that of course there are several reason I'll be not talking about why you need to but you'll have to if you are interested get into that and find it out yourself so the growth rate of the crop production let us look at what happened in our uh the green reol let us look at that uh this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 in this diagram for the wi we are talking about preg Green Revolution something 1951 to 1968 we are having something 7 you know is the tons of this so uh this I have taken the data from the draft of 12 plan document Delhi Planning Commission and 2013 right so let's say this is the percentage you know what you were having then it has been decreased in the Green Revolution period 69 to 81 okay and then it is again little bit increase up and then going down and then down again this thing then again people are increasing because of in the seventh plan and that is true with if you look at this point you know for the rice for the wheat and then pulses for oil seeds of course oil seed has a little bit gone up I mean corresponding to this 1951 and uh the in the today kind today means 11 and 12 but uh wheat and rice and pulses you know it is lower than that what it was there in Pre this thing so therefore you can judge from yourself and this data I have taken from this thing that look this is is a myth that we are having a Green Revolution okay because the crop we are putting lot of pesticide lot of fertilizer and this thing but we are not growing I of course there is a various fluctuation depending upon your what we call your uh climates and there depending upon other parameters you know that is there so one has to look at data and analyze it and then only we can say that look there is a green and beside this we are paying price for the what for this use of this chemicals fertilizer pesticide spoiling soil air and everything we'll be talking about what are the problems of chemical fertilizer let us understand that and there is a micronutrient imbalance because of utilizing the chemical fertilizers because we know that chemical fertilizers contain nitrogen phosphorus potassium which are micronutrients these are the micronutrients you know you can think of and excess use of fertilizers during the farming causes micronutrient imbalance because the soil you are giving artificial if we giving artificial you know soil will be imbalanced maybe you are adding more than what is required so excess of anything is bad right you need to know that what are the things and there will be also imbalance because of root will be taking and then it will be not taking all the thing it will be remaining I'll be talking about later on about you know like uh root how they take and what will be the size of roots if we use chemical fertilizer if you use natural farming all those things I'll be talking about a little bit later on particularly when I'll go to the Natural farming excess isop part affect the soil fertility adversely and also the productivity as I told just now that which my own experience talking with the farmers nearby the Cano area they're saying they're using large number of you know large amount of fertilizer for the same amount of crop production in the same land right over the years and that is true that you can see I mean you can ask anybody and you are having also data nowadays internet you can get the data and uh maybe from reliable source because internet one has to be careful about data right you can go to the government sources some other things then you can find it out what are the conceptions you know I have shown you already that so there is a nitrate pollution like excess nitrogen nitrogenous fertilizers Lee deep into the soil because you are using a lot of water also irrigation you know like and there is a groundwater you are using using the pump you know power right electricity and then Diesel and the lift irrigation system has now come up right and you just press a button and then water will be spread over this thing so and it is sometimes I have seen at least in the nearby kpur area that is they use a lot of water unne and that can contaminate the ground water also and that is happening in lot of areas and other water bodies nearby is being spoiled by the in know nitris fertilizer and if the concentration of nitrate in the drinking water exceed 25 mgam per lit it affects mortality rate and the low weight of the newborn babies which is basically these uh you know low weight and thing known as a blue baby syndromes right and which is showing I'll show you a diagram maybe uh next slides that um and blue baby syndrome refers to at least two situation one is Coptic heart means you know there will be heart arteries which will be you know big thicker and then will be thinner that problem will be there and this memo glob Mia that means like an you know like blood will be less and then now it will be little bit different than that so this causes a problem in the blood itself so you can look at this term I'm not uh you know sure about that but you look at that so what is that I mean this is causing problem which will be with the baby itself you know then where you'll go right so these are very serious problem of the blue baby syndromes and there is another problem which come eutrophication utopic app basically when you use excess fertilizer that can pass to the nearby water bod bodies okay and as a result this there will be over nourishments in this uh pond water bodies and which is known as UT tropication because the over Nish if overnourishment will be there then what will happen that the algae you know there will be lot of growth in algae at the faster rate and then they will grow very rapidly right and then again they will die and then as a result because their life is sought and they die and pollute the water affecting the Aquatic Life adversely that you might have seen that in your you know observation if you are having good observation see the cause is this one so therefore these causes and that is the problem if you look at this pesticide there are two kinds of pesticide people use First genertion pesticide use sulfur arsenic lead and mercury to kill pest look at these are all you know dangerous you elements on should have it but we are using the second generation of course the DDT what is dor dile Tri chloro ethen used to kill pasts and these P organic nature of course but uh P protect our C from severe losses due to pest but they have several side effects you know you can think of there several side effect it should not be used as such and side effects of pite as I told that basically that of non-target organisms suppose you want to kill X but now you'll be killing y j and you know other things and which are beneficial so several insect kill not only the target space but also the several beneficial and organism which are not of Target and as I told that after you know use this P past several time the people the those are also living organism they try to resist and certain Pest of course certain things may not resist properly but certain pests that could manage to survive became highly resistant to all kinds of pesticides you know and though these past are called as super pest like super man you know they become super past so and biomagnifications is another thing most P nonbiodegradable right it's not it cannot be deg ated by the soil or other things so get into food chain which is known as bio accumulation it will getting accumulated and these pesticides in BIO accumulation form are harmful to the human beings and as I told it will remain for your body chain you know chain chain food chain for several time also in your own body right and it will be transmitted you know various forms and surface and groundwater pollution uh you know like toxicity to Aquatic wildlife and human through drinking Waters right all those things risk of cancers like uh pesticide enhances the risk of getting cancer in two way it acts as a carcinogen also and it indirectly spoil the immune system you might be aware that is a train known as cancer train which is originated from Punjab you are aware all of you there's a train all cancer patient will be coming you know that's why people call it cancer because in Punjab Arana region they're using this pesticide and fertilizer to larger extent they can say the rice what we call wheat bow or the food bowel of India but they are really spoiling their own health and giving us food and that is also not of good quality so I'll will stop over here and we'll be looking at the uh what you call disadvantages or the of the using this modern uh farming in the next lecture and later on I will tell about like what is the quality of food we are using and then we'll be looking at basically why we need to go for the ancient technology for the agriculture thank you very much [Music] [Music] [Music]",
