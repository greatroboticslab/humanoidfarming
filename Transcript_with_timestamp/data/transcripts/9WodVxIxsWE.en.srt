1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,140
oh yeah

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:05,339
today is the big day for these two

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,740
fellas

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,219
Harvest Time

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,280
they've reached their potential or what

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,680
I'd like them how large I'd like them to

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,199
be I'm guessing they're

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,199
right around 300 maybe just over

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,859
so

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,900
getting ready to go over and

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,760
Harvest them both

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:34,079
we'll head over to my friends with them

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,980
here and we have our own processing

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,800
facility that we have built and so go

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,899
ahead and get them taken care of

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,079
well it turns out both of these Hogs

17
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,239
weighed exactly 300 pounds that's pretty

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,160
amazing that they came out exactly the

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,579
same

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,739
as you can see here we don't scald and

21
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,199
scrape our Hogs we just go ahead and

22
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,219
skin them it's a much simpler process

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,219
for us this way

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,880
two pigs hanging in the cooler

25
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:11,220
they both weighed exactly 300 pounds

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,360
pretty amazing anyway in exactly the

27
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,220
same

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,220
you're wondering why that one's hanging

29
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,200
a little different than the others

30
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,840
because somebody made a mistake cutting

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,520
off that hind leg and cut that

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,020
Achilles tendon or whatever you want to

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,640
call it where you normally hang them

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,619
like

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,280
this right here

36
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:35,460
I won't mention any names but it was me

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,860
anyhow so we've got two pigs hanging in

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,360
the cooler and we'll go ahead and get

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,360
them processed and packaged tomorrow

40
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,670

41
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,780
guys

42
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:20,300
time to make some sausage

43
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:28,440
we grind our sausage twice and this is

44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,620
the second time through this helps get

45
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:35,360
it into a finer consistency as well as

46
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,360
mix all the seasoning in

47
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,900
two pigs fill up a freezer not quite all

48
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,060
the meat

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,620
it's most of it well

50
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,000
it's a good portion of the meat but I

51
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,920
still have a whole

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,500
pile of the sausage to put in here

53
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,959
actually none of the sausage is in here

54
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,120
at the moment so there's another

55
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,860
80 pounds of sausage to go in here so

56
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,120
that will fill this freezer

57
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:16,379
completely full and this is a 7.1 cubic

58
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,280
foot freezer so two 300 pound Hogs will

59
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,159
fill

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,200
a 7.1 cubic foot freezer

61
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,220
pretty much right to the

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,500
brim and that doesn't include the lard

63
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,780
or the bones that I'm going to use for

64
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,019
bone broth

65
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,180
so including that two whole 300 pound

66
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:39,360
pigs would not fit in this freezer they

67
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,980
would definitely overfill it this is

68
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,519
what

69
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,910
two processed pigs look like in the

70
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:55,449
freezer

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:55,449
