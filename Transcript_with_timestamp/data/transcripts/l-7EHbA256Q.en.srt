[Music]

2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:09,929
I've been farming full-time for about

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,040
ten years

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:17,160
I rent 650 acres approximately half of

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,920
that is in pasture and hay meadow and

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,160
alfalfa and then the remaining half is

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,590
in cropland and it's corn soybeans oats

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:30,510
and wheat are typically part of the

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:33,210
cropland portion of the acreage in

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,800
addition to farming I also work at bon

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,770
home high school I am their AG

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,020
instructor and their FFA advisor it's a

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,790
really neat opportunity to have that

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,100
kind of a job because it really

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,079
coincides with what I do on the farm and

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,629
it really gives me an opportunity to

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,320
teach students about things that I'm

18
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:54,180
passionate about in my life

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,460
typically when we start our soils units

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,870
depending on the class we always start

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,160
with like an overview of soil

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,710
characteristics soil texture organic

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,150
matter and how all of those different

24
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,060
factors and components are going to

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,250
affect the productivity of the soil and

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,549
then after we cover that broad overview

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,580
of those soil topics we move into a soil

28
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:21,090
erosion and how we can degrade the soil

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,759
with mono cropping continuous residue

30
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,659
room removal you know not having

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,420
livestock on the landscape and we tie

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,210
all those topics in together and then

33
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,009
they can see how some of the the

34
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,530
management practices that we have in our

35
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,420
operations can really impact long-term

36
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,370
productivity of the soil

37
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,360
some of the things that we'll do as a

38
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:48,790
slate test the slate test gives a very

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,180
simple measure of the biological health

40
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:54,210
of that soil and then we also do

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:59,530
infiltration tests and then the tabletop

42
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:04,540
infiltration and runoff test as well on

43
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:06,550
a typical year given the prices of corn

44
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,209
and soybeans I've been converting some

45
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:12,670
of those acres usually 25 to 30 acres

46
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:15,160
into a full season cover crop mix and

47
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:19,239
that would be planted sometime in May

48
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:22,570
and with that full season mix it allows

49
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,400
me to graze it midsummer and I can take

50
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,100
the cows off of the pasture they're

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,470
allowed to graze that midsummer they go

52
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,540
back to the pasture while the full

53
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,190
season regrows and then they can come

54
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,489
and read graze that in the fall so it

55
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:41,140
really just gives me more acres to graze

56
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:46,780
and puts less stress on the pastures

57
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:49,299
which which is important as well with

58
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:53,370
cover crops going on the crop ground my

59
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:56,560
main goals are to build organic matter

60
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,200
have something on the soil surface so

61
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,209
that ground is not bare and then also

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,239
help build structure and reduce

63
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:05,950
compaction those would be my main goals

64
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,959
in addition to that I also want to fix

65
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,930
some nitrogen I want to provide some

66
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,549
livestock feed as well but those would

67
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,010
be my main ones is really just to

68
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:18,160
protect the land build that organic

69
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:22,480
matter and improve the soil structure as

70
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:25,299
well we really do need to start focusing

71
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,750
on soil health because if we look at the

72
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:31,269
long term productivity of the soil if we

73
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,590
start looking at the some of the weather

74
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:36,430
patterns that we're starting to deal

75
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,810
with if our soil gets too degraded the

76
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,310
farmer is not going to be making any

77
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,930
money

78
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:46,280
the main thing that I want my students

79
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:48,350
to realize is that you don't have to do

80
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,180
it the way that dad and grandpa did it

81
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,670
things have changed there's better

82
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,460
equipment out there to no-till and a lot

83
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,560
more crops he can rotate in hopefully if

84
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,570
they can see some of what I'm doing and

85
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,670
if they can see that some of what I'm

86
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,400
doing is working they don't have to make

87
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:07,310
changes this year next year but maybe

88
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,720
they start farming in five years or so

89
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,420
down the road they realize you know what

90
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,920
this just isn't quite working maybe we

91
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,830
should try some of what mr. Meese our

92
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:20,260
talked about keeping your soil covered

93
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:22,610
soil armor crop rotation diversity

94
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,220
incorporating livestock back into

95
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,770
landscape no-till is obviously the big

96
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,540
one that not tilling it allows all the

97
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,550
worms and microorganisms to work

98
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,440
together and improve your soil health

99
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,930
maybe we should give some of those

100
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,120
practices a try and and see if that

101
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,750
would help what we're dealing with here

102
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,750
on the farm
