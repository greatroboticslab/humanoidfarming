1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,320
My name is Patrick Zimmerer from Table Mountain Vineyards and Winery near Huntley, Wyoming and

2
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:31,920
our part of our operation is a vineyard and winery obviously, but we also are a diversified farm and ranch as well.

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,619
We kind of run two different enterprises on the same land

4
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,730
but our entire

5
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,179
acreage consists of a farm and ranch as well as vineyards of cattle, beef cattle,

6
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:47,279
corn, alfalfa, and grass hay, wheat, and silage corn as well.

7
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:50,728
We're a pretty diversified operation, so

8
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:55,408
throughout the different years we've done anything from custom cattle feeding,

9
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,249
running other cattle on our pastures

10
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:06,899
dry edible beans, it just depends on kind of our crop rotation and where we're at in our enterprise, so. We host weddings,

11
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:09,280
private events,

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,509
meals,

13
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:13,559
we've done everything from birthday parties to anniversaries to

14
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:19,109
even a memorial service, so we're very diversified in that aspect and it helps us

15
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,140
generate interest in the winery,

16
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:29,339
obviously, create demand in our products as well as just kind of be a community center for the locals to gather because unfortunately as

17
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:35,009
towns get smaller and smaller theres less places that you can do things so that's where we're at with that.

18
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,929
Well that the vineyard and winery aspect of our operation is probably

19
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,229
I think we run on just a little over 10 acres

20
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:52,799
compared to the over thousand acres that we manage and, and having commercial agricultural production,

21
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,780
but within that 10 acres is probably ninety percent of our labor force it seems.

22
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,619
Vineyard, growing vineyards in Wyoming or anywhere across the U.S. is a very labor-intensive...

23
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:11,068
A lot of work goes into it, a lot of hand pruning. There's not a lot of mechanical equipment that you can purchase it and so

24
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,360
there's a lot of hand pruning, hand picking pretty much everything we do

25
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,420
we have about 10,000 vines every time we do something to one vine, we have to 10,000 times.

26
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:28,420
So very labor-intensive. And then our focus is to make solely and purely 100% Wyoming grown wines and products.

27
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,980
So we make grape wine, honey wine, raspberry wine but everything

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,040
we do is 100% Wyoming grown.

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,240
In terms of where we planted grapes, it kind of goes along with how we built the winery. We planted in areas we couldn't productively farm.

30
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,840
We have vineyards in the corners of pivots.

31
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,140
When the pivot swing, there's always that, that triangle that you can't really irrigate efficiently and get to.

32
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,320
At least we couldn't because of the way our irrigation systems work.

33
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,699
So a lot of our grapes are in kind of minimalized places that were just basically

34
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,560
either weed patches or corners that we couldn't irrigate.

35
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:14,269
Most of the factors, at least for the crop land, I guess our factor is just obviously diversification,

36
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,610
crop rotation,

37
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,399
yields, especially for varieties of corn which, which grow in a very short season

38
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:29,239
We're making leaps and bounds with new varieties of corn and so every year we're trying to I guess focus on the new better

39
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,850
variety or varieties that are more suited to our

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,600
soil conditions, and so I would say probably crop yield,

41
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,780
the feasibility of it, how much inputs were putting to get x amount of outputs out.

42
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,660
I mean we do have areas across our farm that we have found that just weren't meant for,

43
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,529
for growing crops and they have a little higher pH or a little less drainage

44
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:58,820
and so we've just really changed our thinking I guess over the years and so much of pushing to get every single acre into

45
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,480
cropland, but really focusing on the acres at work well.

46
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:12,200
So non-crop habitats on our property would include I guess grassland.

47
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,760
Just areas that we've turned into grass either for pasture or

48
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,299
it's not a true crop. We've actually taken some cropland and

49
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,359
turned it back into wetland and a lot of those places were places again that we found that we couldn't farm

50
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,040
productively, or we were putting more inputs than we were getting out of it. So we have turned a lot of wetlands areas over

51
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:40,269
just kind of in that natural habitat. We have three duck ponds here nearby the winery, and then we have one large

52
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:48,400
pond on our farm as well where we've basically turned that back into kind of what it used to be. I think the non cropland

53
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,400
is very important to part of our operation because

54
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,929
there are areas that just need to kind of stay in that natural habitat.

55
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:03,040
We will turn some of those non-croplands maybe eventually into cropland, depends on the year and the moisture, but just as part of

56
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,069
I guess keeping the soils

57
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:14,480
keeping the nutrients and kind of being able to rotate and transfer through that. And the non-cropland areas also are great.

58
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,300
I guess habitat for wildlife.

59
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,890
Wild turkey we have been able to get on the property. A few years ago

60
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:26,439
we had one and now I think we have about 30 so all of those areas have helped kind of expand that

61
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,749
wildlife aspect of it. The deer are doing very well here which were

62
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,279
unfortunately they like to attack our corn and our grapes

63
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,169
but we do get a lot of different wildlife here. And since we've expanded the

64
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,830
wetlands we also get a pretty stable and pretty

65
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,689
hardy amount of Sandhills cranes that come through at the end of March and April and

66
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,330
so it's kind of a fun thing to kind of watch

67
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:57,099
them as they migrate through but we'll get thousands of them at any given time just

68
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,279
kind of hanging out in the cornfield and near the waterways.

69
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:08,289
The public perception of the habitats, whenever you try and enhance a landscape

70
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:13,299
I think that's, that's a win both for a producer and for public perception

71
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
one of our, I guess,

72
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,419
desires when we built a few of our wetlands

73
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:25,329
over here by the the winery in kind of the event center was to take an area that was probably not as

74
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,520
slightly as it could be and to at least enhance that a little bit. It just kind of helps with the overall

75
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,160
perception, not only from the agricultural

76
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:40,839
perspective, but where we are in kind of an agro-tourism industry through the winery. It also helps tell that story a little bit and

77
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,090
get people to realize that agriculture is a lot more about,

78
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,429
you know, just farming as much as you can but also being a steward to the land.

79
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,300
I would say probably in the next few years we will obviously look at

80
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,500
more

81
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
water saving features.

82
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,400
Probably adding some different irrigation systems, pivots.

83
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,620
We're actually looking at subsurface irrigation.

84
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,860
Some just kind of new techniques, especially in areas that are prone to being waterlogged or don't drain as well

85
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,890
and again

86
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,809
just kind of focusing on, on the area that we have and and just trying to

87
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:26,140
improve the area as a whole as well as, I guess continue in the agricultural industry like we have for generations.
