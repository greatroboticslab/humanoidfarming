2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,160
going to try to do this tip where you

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,880
can kind of see what I'm doing here a

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,920
lot of people when they are weeding a

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,039
garden they let it get out of

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,199
control and then they go in and they

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,679
have to spend hours weeding it and kind

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:32,599
of a trick that I've been doing for

9
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:35,040
years I only take 10 minutes every day I

10
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:37,960
come out into the garden I look at an

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,239
area that's got some weeds and I spend

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,559
10 minutes just cleaning up those little

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,800
bit of

14
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:50,480
weeds and because I do that every

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,039
day the weeds don't get out of control

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,039
and it's pretty easy to keep up

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,879
with so I'm kind of hoping that you

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:08,200
can learn something from this

19
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:08,200
tip that really it's better

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,520
off if you get the weeds before they get

21
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,520
out of

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,840
control now there's other ways you can

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,640
do this it's a little bit

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,040
faster sometimes I use the other methods

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,840
sometimes I come out here with a hoe and

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,759
I basically just smack the ground where

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,640
there's a weed at to uproot it what

28
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,280
you'll find sometimes though is you'll

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,920
pull these weeds and if you pull them

30
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,360
out roots and

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,439
all they'll actually if like it's

32
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,320
supposed to rain later

33
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:43,880
today

34
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,040
so if I pull it out roots and all and

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,640
toss it on the ground you can see some

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,200
old weeds right there but if I toss them

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,320
on the ground what'll happen is it'll

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,759
rain tonight and

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,759
they'll root

40
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,960
again you see that happen quite a bit

41
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,880
you can see like a weed that's knocked

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,000
over

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,520
and I've already done a lot of this up

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
here but literally I can do this whole

45
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,000
garden almost in 10 minutes because

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,360
there's just not a

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,040
lot and uh that just makes it very quick

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,879
to walk through here and just pull

49
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,879
whatever weeds I

50
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,519
see and to be honest with you I haven't

51
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,840
actually done this in about 3 or 4 days

52
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,680
cuz you don't don't have to do it every

53
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,080
day you might initially like if you're

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,120
already behind on

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,200
weeding spend about 10 minutes every day

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,080
just knock a section out and then by the

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,440
time that you get the whole garden

58
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,560
done there shouldn't be near as many

59
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,599
weeds the second time and if you just

60
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,000
keep doing that it gets to be really

61
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:56,560
easy to take care

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,760
of you don't have to deal with going out

63
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,720
there and spending all day Saturday and

64
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,879
Sunday and

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,440
you're also by doing this every day a

66
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,599
little bit of time every day in the

67
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,519
garden you're also better able to keep

68
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:14,120
track of any type of bug or pest issues

69
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:15,280
that you might have coming up you'll

70
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,879
have to deal

71
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:23,360
with cuz you can you can see it way

72
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,760
easier when there's less weeds for

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,200
one and also you're spending more time

74
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,560
out in the garden which is good

75
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:36,120
for the so I guess I mean it's good for

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,120
your mental health and soul

77
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,680
and but you can see it's just this goes

78
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,680
really

79
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,840
fast because there's just not a lot to

80
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,840
mess

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,560
with now I'm actually getting ready to

82
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,280
Tew up this place right here where I'm

83
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,480
pulling these weeds I technically don't

84
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,000
even have to pull these weeds I'm

85
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,000
getting ready to till it I've got some

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,760
uh sweet potato it needs

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,879
planted and I need to heal my potatoes

88
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,640
the second time I put a video up a few

89
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,920
days ago about healing potatoes and I

90
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,599
need to come out here and do it the

91
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,360
second time to get them under control

92
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,359
cuz we've had so much rain again it's

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,919
supposed to rain again today

94
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,400
so now this is one area over here that I

95
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:26,320
did kind of let go on the

96
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,800
weeds that's uh carrots and peas and

97
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,759
I'll just be honest with you it rained

98
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,160
so much I couldn't get in in here so by

99
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,160
the time I could get in here they're

100
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,280
just about pretty bad shape but anyways

101
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,160
I thought I'd give you this tip how to

102
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,479
keep weeds under control in the garden

103
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,320
just do a little bit each day if you do

104
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,720
a little bit each day I mean I've

105
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,199
probably only been out here for however

106
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,560
long this video is already weeded this

107
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:56,400
area already weeded this already weeded

108
00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:00,560
all that already weeded all

109
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,400
this and uh it'll be good now for 3 or 4

110
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,759
days and then I can focus on getting

111
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,520
these rows the next time and uh maybe

112
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,800
over here to the tomatoes and peppers

113
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,000
which they're not in that bad of shape

114
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,280
right

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,319
now if you saw the onions last week

116
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,240
before I weeded it they were in just as

117
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,440
bad as those carrots but they're looking

118
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,039
pretty good

119
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,479
again so they actually need some of

120
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,560
those need harvested I need to plant

121
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,400
some more but uh yeah so you can kind of

122
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,360
see I haven't done this in probably a

123
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,400
week and there's just hardly no weeds in

124
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,240
here even though we've had so much rain

125
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,639
I mean there's one every now and

126
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,720
then but it's not like they're not

127
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,080
taking over the garden right that's kind

128
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,080
of the point I'm trying to make if you

129
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,600
spend just a little bit of time each day

130
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,520
they won't take over your

131
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
garden

132
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,120
versus if you don't spend a little bit

133
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,800
of time each day and you just let it

134
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,400
take over your garden by the time you

135
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,280
realize that the garden needs weeded

136
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,000
it's a whole lot of work that you're

137
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,840
probably going to get frustrated with

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,360
and not complete in one

139
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,000
day so then it's never going to get done

140
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,960
it's never going to stay caught up it's

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,960
always just going to be a

142
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,319
mess so uh anyways I'm not going to keep

143
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,039
you any longer thanks for watching as

144
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,479
always God bless you God bless your

145
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,479
families God bless your

146
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
homesteads for
