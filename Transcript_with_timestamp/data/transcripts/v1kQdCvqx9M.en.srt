27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,159
field

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,680

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,920

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,880
and this way you know feel free to join

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,159
in any time that you think

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,280
okay all right that's fine all right

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,640
what is this

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,759
um it's

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,840
um

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,360
a pivot from where the pipe comes out of

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,479
the ground okay so this is like our

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,920
water source yeah so the well over there

40
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,880
is sucking out of the ground and there's

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,799
a pipe that brings it up here and

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,479
okay and this is the poly yeah that

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,799
we're laying all right so what are we

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,920
going to do we're going to follow

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,640
this tractor cisco uh-huh and he's going

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,560
to be making a ditch underneath there

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,840
and it's going to stretch it out across

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,000
the field and then about

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,439
this row and that row will get water but

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,320
this row won't

51
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,920
okay

52
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,560
okay all right and what are we going to

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,560
do behind it um i got to put dirt on it

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,479
so it doesn't blow off all right well

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,160
why don't i follow you you can show me

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,920
how to do that and maybe i can give it a

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,840
go maybe yeah would you be cool with

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,599
that yeah all right cool

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,360
all right

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,800
so we're trying to water from this side

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,520
of the field because there's a hill

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,040
slanting that way and the water will

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,239
fall down there okay

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,000
but we're going to lay it across this

65
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,520
way for it to go that way

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,160
all right all right let's see this let's

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,160
take some dirt

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,599
all right so this takes a

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,840
this takes a lot of concentration

70
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,599
no that i mean

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,599
what did you say no

72
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,120
you're walking on a poly pipe

73
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,440
yeah but there's like

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,319
dirt everywhere

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,519
i mean i guess

76
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,519
i feel like this is

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,000
i'm just waiting to eat it you know

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,599
well if you eat it you'd probably have

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,319
stitches in your chin

80
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,560
okay that's good

81
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,040
chill chill

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,920
do you have you ever fallen doing this

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,060
yes okay that makes me feel better

84
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,060
[Music]

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,120
five steps

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,480
put a shovel of dirt on the pipe all

87
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,480
right let's do it you switch

88
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,920
like right here yeah

89
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,040
is that enough

90
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,040
probably just a shovel

91
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,680
you're making this look a lot

92
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
smoother

93
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,560
we sure did pick a hot day didn't we

94
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,560
yeah

95
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,640
it's good in hot day too

96
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,640
that's half of the work

97
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:15,840
[Music]

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,840

what we got here today it's a well

105
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,479
it pulls water out of the ground to

106
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,919
put it in our poly pipe so we can pop

107
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,199
them all right so what we just laid down

108
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,960

109
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,720

no idea we got adult kid farmer john

127
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,560
over here

128
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,240
do you know that was gonna happen yes on

129
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,720
that weld down there that's what it's

130
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,320
called right yeah we laid the poly pipe

131
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,160
and that water is

132
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,039
pushing through here

133
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,039
okay

134
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,680
and then what we take that poker that

135
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,240
you had yeah we gotta find that thing

136
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,320
and we basically poke holes in here and

137
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,000
that's so the water

138
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,759
shoots down that way

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,600
anything else we need to know about this

140
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,680
like what what's happening down there

141
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,479
what's cisco doing down at the uh he's

142
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,120
holding water pressure down there so the

143
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,560
water can't go past him okay okay

144
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,080
anything else about this are there

145
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,960
certain hole are there certain size

146
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,199
holes yeah there's a bunch you can have

147
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,759
an inch half inch

148
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,440
all the variations and it depends on how

149
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,600
long your field is so

150
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,360
if you have like a really short and

151
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,319
skinny field you could do like an inch

152
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,560
hole

153
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,039
but if you had a long field like we have

154
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,639
here we're doing half inch today so when

155
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,919
we're done when you're done with this

156
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,759
