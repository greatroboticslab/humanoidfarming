  "text": "Hello everybody welcome back to the farming simar 25 tips and tricks video today we're continuing our Series where we talk about all the crops and farming sim25 by focusing on wheat barley and oats now we're combining all three of these grain crops into a single video because they all share something in common that is that we can put down a straw windro after harvest and then collect that straw windro in one of couple various ways and use that straw in again multiple ways now we've learned through our animal videos that many of the various animals will accept straw as beding and as result will produce manure we also know by our TMR video that we'll be able to use straw to make total mixed rations for our cows and water buffalo or you can just choose to collect the straw and sell it whichever thing fits your fancy now this video is also going to focus on well what can you do with your grain after you harvest it because we have a couple different Productions that we can run our grain through we can run our wheat barley or oats through the Grain Mill and produce flour and once we produce that flour we can take it to a secondary production in the bakery and produce bread or cakes with that flour our oats can go over here to the cereal factory in combination with a few other products in order to make cereal as a finished good in addition we really haven't talked about storing crops in any of our videos up to this point and for the most part that is because up till this point we haven't been able to technically store any of those crops that we have done videos on that is about to change because we can store Wheat barley and oats in any ingame Silo so I've got placed here a few different samples of the silos that are available in game we have kind of an old school Brick and concrete variety we have more of an Americanized concrete Silo here a more modern steel Silo and then we have a singular grain bin and we're going to be doing a separate video talking about silos specifically and demonstrating how we can make use of these grain bin silos with the use of augers now once you have harvested your crop you're going to be able to collect the straw and in order to collect the straw you can either use a Bor which we have already demonstrated in our hay and grass video or you can make use of a forge wagon which is how we're going to be collecting the straw today in addition to harvesting our wheat barley and oats a single time we're going to be coming through a second time and harvesting the same field but this time we're going to use the macdon swather from the macdon pack because I can tell you in in my testing already we see a 24.9% basically 25% bonus to our output by swapping our crop with the Macon and then picking that swath up with our pickup header Again part of the macdon pack with our Harvester and then we're also seeing a bonus with respect to our straw that we collected off those fields as well now we caveat this that the macdown pack is an upgrade it is an add-on bonus at this point a paid DLC I received the macdown pack as a pre-order bonus as did many that pre-ordered the game but at this point now that the game is out there is going to be a paid DLC that is the macdown pack if you are interested that I do have a link to that down in the description below it is using my affiliate code so it wouldn't be much obliged if you would make use of that code if you go ahead and pick up that macdown pack now that code is going to be able to be used for PC players only if you are a console player then by all means pick up the macdown pack via your store of your console of choice now let's take a look at some infog graphics now these infog Graphics come from the Farming Simulator Academy which is the tutorial site over at the Giants website and got information here about oats and I've run various tests already on oat and barley it says seeds per hectar 500 now on field 41 which we are using because it is very near one hectar in size I only use 329 L worth the seed here in Farm Sim 25 so it does appear that our seed usage is down from what is listed here on this infographic from FS2 to what is accurate is the planting season of March and April the growing duration of 4 months and the Harvest duration of July and August those things are accurately reflected the yield per hectar 5700 l i saw a yield that was 93% bonus to this my field was prepared at plus 95% I saw a 93% in increase I actually was able to harvest 11,043 L worth of Oats using the traditional cloth grain Harvester and the macdon header more on that here in a moment as far as straw I was able to collect 71,2 L worth of straw after I harvested with the traditional cloth Harvester by using the swapping method using the macdon and then following it up with the pickup header using the cloth I was able to harvest 13,798 L worth of Oats that would be a 24.9% increase over the CL Harvester the traditional way of harvesting or a 242 increase over the yield per hectar listed here in this infographic in addition I was able to harvest our straw after using the back dawn after using the pickup header with the Closs 87,3 191 l so an increase of approximately 1,600 L of straw now with respect to our barley barley again lists needing 500 L of seed per hectar I used 257 basically half of that seed usage so again this infographic seems to be a little bit off for Farm Sim 25 what is accurate is the planting season of September in October and the Harvest duration of June through July so it has a growing duration of 9 months basically over winter and spring yield per hectar was 9600 L well when I ran my Closs Harvester with the macdon header I saw 18,000 595 L of harvest that was again a 93% increase over what is listed here on this infographic and my field was listed as having a plus 95% bonus after collecting the grain I went around and collected the straw and I basically saw the same output that I got with oats at 71,0 8 L then comes swafing with the macdon after I SWA with the macdon I used a pickup header from the macdon pack with the CL Harvester and I received 23,2 128 L worth of barley that again was a 29 or 24.9% increase from what we had with the traditional Harvester or a 242 increase from what is listed here on this infographic I then collected a straw and I didn't see quite the increase of straw that I had with oats I only saw 85587 l so a little bit of a reduction there I'm going to call that margin of error because well maybe there was a couple things that I did wrong on that field and that might be a result why the straw was a little bit lower now with respect to our wheat and I haven't done this test so we're going to be doing this test together says our seeds per hectar will be 500 later so be interesting to see do I do about 250 or do I do a little bit more than that we are planning our wheat in September and October and then we're going to be able to harvest the following year in July or August so a 10mon growing duration and we're going to have an average yield of 8,900 L per hectar so keep remembering that number because we will be coming back to that in a little bit now let's run through the vehicle shop and where we're going to get all this stuff I apologize I shouldn't have been standing by the Grain Mill that was a little annoying for me I'm sure that was annoying for everyone else let's take a look at our vehicle shop so with respect to our Harvesters we're going to come to combine harvesting and we're going to be able to basically use any of these Harvesters to harvest our grain now I have the Gold Edition because I also happen to have pre-ordered from the Giants eShop and also have a collector's edition so that is why this appears if anyone has any questions for this video we're using the lexion 6900 standard base configuration in combination with your combine harvester you're going to need a grain header you can use any of these grain headers for this particular video I'm going to be making use of the macdon flex Draper from the macdon pack just to see if there would be any sort of differences between the flex Draper and any of these other headers now of course you can use literally any header with any Harvester but you should note that these bigger headers well your pipe may not clear the header and if that's the case you're going to run into a little bit of difficulty in offloading your Harvester so what I would suggest is coming here to a harvester figuring out which Harvester you want to use coming down here to combinations and it will tell you the appropriate combinations of headers that will work best with the particular Harvester that you have selected so we can see here the listing of headers for this particular size Closs Harvester and if I come up here and I select a smaller gloss Harvester but you're going to see it is going to suggest a different set of headers same can be said for the larger CLA Harvester we're going to again we're going to get a different set of header choices with respect to collecting our straw well you're going to be able to use a 4ed wagon and in this particular video we're going to be using the fent tigro 75 vrd or you can come through with a square Bor or r B to bail that straw as far as seeding goes we're going to seed our wheat barley and oats with a traditional Cedar and for this video I'm going to be using lykin sultar 12 so back here in our shop if we scroll up to seeding we're going to find a category of Cedars and we can use any of these seeders to put our wheat barley or oats in the ground for this video we're using the sultar 12 and we can use our seed in the form of a ballet pallet big bag a big bag or a pallet of little bags the two big bags are going to cost $1,260 and provide you with 1,000 lers worth of seed whereas the Pioneer pallet of bags is going to give you 50 extra lers worth of seed for the same cost as the rest you can also find your seed down here under objects in big bag categories big bag pallet category and pallets with respect to our field prep I have already gone ahead and prepared this field it is been plowed or does it need plowing it has had lime applied to it it has actually already been fertilized to 100% and it has already been cul ated so it is right and ready for our seating and that is exactly what we are about to do I'm going to load this Cedar up with 1,000 L worth the seed just to make it a bit easier on the math and a lot of seater we're just going to pull up here alongside our big bag pallet and we're going to hit R to load our seed it looks like it has decided to load our pallet bags as opposed to whatever doesn't matter so we'll start with 1,50 L now the game defaults us to wheat which is exactly what we want to put in the ground but if we did want to change it just to Barley or oats we would hit Y until the respective crop does come up just going to toggle back over to wheat we're going to address the field as we have seen in other videos if you have seen those we going to lower our Cedar [Music] down turn it on with B and Off to the Races we go so I'm going to keep track of how much seed we've put to the ground and I will report back once we have finished so we've down to 752 L wor of seed and that means that basically we have used 298 L of seed because so again we started at 1,50 because we grabbed the wrong pallet or the seed so any rate we're kind of we're kind of in the middle there right where barley used less seed at 257 L oat used more seed at 329 L and wheat is kind of there in the middle at 298 but still it is lower than the infographics 500 L per hectar as reported from the academy me which was built around fs22 now I am going to go ahead and weed this field with herbicide because if we come over here and check the field stats out it says we are at plus 92% and it we have weeds growing so like I said I'm going to go ahead and spray this and and uh see if we can get her up to 95% it's just like magic we've moved into October we have our first growth of our wheat on the field and I think let's go ahead and talk about our crop calendar for these various crops again wheat as we mentioned with the infographic you're going to be able to plant it in September and October you're going to have to wait 10 months the entire of Winter the entirety of spring all the way up to July before you can start to harvest that wheat and you have until the end of August to get all the wheat off the ground otherwise it's going to wilt with respect to Barley well again we can plant that in September and October although Barley's going to be available one month sooner and the fact we only have to wait nine months until June and July in order to get our barley off the field now the the Speedy Gonzales of all of these crops is oat oat you have to plant in March or April and then well just a few short months afterwards in July or August of the same year you're going to be able to get those oats off the ground so if you don't like waiting well then oats might be the crop for you let's go ahead and move forward into September and we'll check on our crop soly me I was already in September so how can I fast forward to September it's now November and you can see we still have our first grow State basically of our wheat let's go ahead and move on into spring so I'll see you all back around the March time frame winter is over spring is here and as such are we wheat has now moved into the second growth state so don't be surprised if your wheat doesn't grow at all from November or September up till March that's pretty normal it's going to be in winter it's going to be dormant and now that this weather is starting to warm up sun's out a little bit more longer while your wheat is going to start to grow like weeds thankfully there aren't any weeds in this field May is here and our crop is coming along quite nicely with respect to our wheat so just another two months and we'll be ready to harvest okay so July is here our wheat is ready to harvest and it is at this stage where I am going to save the game because I want to be able to after we Harvest our wheat I'm going to bring you back we're going to tabulate our our results of our wheat Harvest and our straw collection after that wheat Harvest then I'm going to load this save game back up exactly to this point and then we are going to run the same Harvest this time using the macdon and then we will tabulate our results and close everything out now as I've said I've already run the results for barley and I've already run the results for oats we've already kind of gone over those results but we will go over those results again after we tabulate our wheat results and I've done this exact method with the other two crops so we're just going to repeat this exact method we need to switch over to straw actually let's not switch over to straw I want to I want to demonstrate something so this is a little bit of a variance from what I did with our barley and our oats but I do want to demonstrate something so our straw will be slightly reduced with respect to our wheat Harvest because we are changing up our methodology just a little bit and that is that I wanted to demonstrate that if we come here and we check our soil composition we can see that this area here which we have just scattered straw to the wind is listed as mulched this area over here which we did not get any straw on is not mulched as we now lay down a straw SWA okay we are now going to be able to collect our straw we're going to see that we are not leaving this field in a mulched state you see that we are basically removing the mulch State because this field had a mulched state from theoretically the previous year's Harvest so with your wheat barley and oats you have a choice do you get straw in a wi row such that you can collect it and use it for bedding use it for TMR or or just sell it for additional money or do you scatter that straw to the wind as we demonstrated by turning off the straw SWA and if you do that then you will not be able to collect the straw instead you will basically be given a mulch State on your field so a 22% bonus to the next crop that you put into this field what you should so do is up to you I personally think that I would rather collect the straw because I have other uses for the straw and a 2 and half% yield bonus really isn't that attractive to me versus collecting the money from selling the straw and as I'm sure we will find out when it comes to using the macdon if I can get 25% more crop 2 and 1 12% better yield maybe it offsets by a lot maybe it doesn't matter because I also get a whole lot more strong and therefore I can collect more money or make more TMR or get and use more manure depending on if we are needing to use it or not so let me go ahead and finish this and I'll report back so our Harvest is over and we have collected 17,23 L for the wheat if you remember from our infographic it said that we would have 8900 lers worth of wheat so that means that we we have a yield of 93% over what the infographic said which is pretty darn close to our 95% yield bonus of 17,23 L now let's run through our Harvest totals for our barley our barley we had 18, 595 lers worth of barley after Harvest so a little bit more barley than we had wheat and we had 11, 43 L worth of Oats a decent amount less than our wheat and barley but if we look at our prices screen here I think we're going to see that our barley well it's going to have an average high of $1,137 on easy at an average low of 763 with respect to our oats though an average high of 1883 with an average low of 1314 so our oats are more valuable than our barley and then our wheat is going to be 1,90 when average low of 832 so a little bit more than our barley but a fair bit less than our oats kind of holds to the overall yields doesn't it now let's go and collect our straw now remember we scatter to the wind the straw on the other end of the field when it comes time to doing our swathing testing with the macdon swather we will also not collect the straw that is on the North part of the field uh simply to be the same as this run and that should basically then normalize our straw totals between the two tests but again we're going to expect less straw than we had with our are barley and oat numbers because I didn't scatter this end of the field in those tests but more or less we're comparing our standard Harvest and our macdown swapping for the same crop as opposed to our straw output between the different crops so with respect to our straw and remember our numbers are going to be lower because we didn't SWA or leave a wind row to the other side of the field we collected 65,7 25 L with the straw with our traditional Harvest now we're going to load up the save game and we're going to make use of the macdon in order to swath the crop we're going to make use of the pickup header to then pick up that swath and separate the grain from the straw and then we will go back and use the forage wagon to collect the straw and then we'll compare the numbers we just got with those numbers okay so here we are loaded up with the macdon with the save game right where we were before and let's go ah and talk about the macdown pack before we get too far into it so under mods and DLCs we have the macdown Pack we the m1240 this is going to be the swather this is going to be the vehicle that drives everything and we have the choice of different engines here we have 173 horsepower or 262 horsepower we can change the tire types and that is pretty much it then we have the macdon swathing header so we can get this with transport wheels or not and the way this can work is we can transport this like we would transport a rain header and we'd actually put the macdon in Reverse drive to do that it's a pretty neat setup we then have the mowing head so this is what we're going to use to mow our grass then we have the pickup head which is going to be used on our standard Harvester to pick up the swap that we're putting down and then we have the fd1 40 Flex straper this is actually the header that we're using on our class Harvester so this is going to be a traditional grain header 12.5 m versus the swather which is 12.2 M so they're very similar in working with the swather will be able to swath wheat barley oat canola and soybeans so those are the crops that we are going to do this test with with respect to comparing standard Harvest to swapping Harvest and the way this works we're just going to turn our header on we're going to drop it down and we are going to basically dive into the field we're going to use one Headland we're going to go ahead and set that up so we can keep our nice line straight and the way this works is it cuts the crop and gently lays it on the header or belts that move it toward the middle and then the swather just runs over top of that and straddles it for the most part and we're going to go ahead and make a cut on either either side of the field and then I just want to demonstrate using the CL Harvester and the pickup header this is exactly how I did it with the other two props is I did a cut off across the top of the field I did two cuts along the long sides and then I harvested the swath with the standard Harvester such that I wasn't driving over the crop too much when I was harvesting the rest of the field then I also went ahead and canted that straw so again I wasn't driving over any of that as I was harvesting the field so let me finish this cut and I'll come back with our CLA Harvester and demonstrate the pickup header so if we take a quick look at our wheat swath we can see that we can actually see the wheat heads in this texture so the grain is still here all we've done is cut it and lay it down nice and gently on the field now we can come through with our standard rain Harvester with this custom pickup header and you'll see what this header does is it gently picks the crop up off the field and and then runs it through the Harvester and since it is being gentle with the crop then we are in essence getting more yield because we are losing less of the crop just like we did with our weed Harvest we scattered the Top Cut Across the field and we're going to get that as a mulching bonus and now we are leaving straw behind and let's compare the straw windro the heads are gone now we don't actually see the Grain on there anymore so that is our straw windro versus our wheat swath all right let me go ahead and finish this out and I'll be back and we'll close this video out all right so let's crunch some numbers here we finished our weed Harvest I have 21, 533 l in this trailer and again this wheat was harvested with the macdon then we used the pickup header with our traditional Harvester to extract the grain from the straw then we used our Forge wagon to pick the straw up so 21532 that is a 24.9% Bas 25% increase for all intense purposes above and beyond the traditional Harvest with the traditional Macon grain header and the CL Harvester which again netted us 17,23 2 L off of a field that had a plus 95% bonus We have basically a plus 93% bonus off of the Baseline Harvest crop value of 8900 L per the Giants Academy infographic now as far as our straw goes I collected two full loads from our fent our fent holds 40,500 l so that would be 81,000 L with the straw from the field that again used the macdon the pickup header with the Harvester and then our Forge wagon that is a 24% increase from the straw that we had just off the clth Harvester itself at 65325 L if we go back now to to our barley remember I said our barley with the traditional Harvester we had 18595 lers with our swather using the macdon sorry and then the pickup header we increased by 25% to 23,2 28 L our straw with the coloss Harvester 71,0 in8 L our straw after swapping with the macdon 85 587 L oats our standard Harvest with our CLA Harvester 11,043 L we had 13,798 L with the macdon then the pickup header and the Closs Harvester a 24.9% bonus with respect to our straw we had 21,26 L wor the straw sorry 71,2 L worth the straw with the CL Harvester and 87,3 191 L worth of straw after using the macdon a 23% bonus so the straw bonus is is around the same bonus as our Harvest although it wasn't as consistent and I would attribute it not being as consistent to that the header we used on both the macdon and the traditional CLA Harvester was just a little bit too narrow to get all of the field without having a little bit left over so there was this little REM Remer left over here in this general area and what I have found is the macdon pickup header that picks up straw swath does not necessarily like to pick up small wind RS of swath so we will leave a little bit here that couldn't be picked up if I bring that header back over over here it likely isn't going to be able to pick up these little bits here and there of straw swath and as a result of not being a pick up the straw swath it couldn't pick up the straw in addition there was a couple areas where well we had straw that came out late and it's over here on the other side of the field we couldn't pick it up yada yada yada so that's why I'm attributing a little bit more variance with our straw collection over our grain collection but it's pretty clear that the macdon while in a previous video we saw gave no bonus to grass is giving us a bonus for wheat barley and oats we're going to continue to do this test when we get to our canola video and our soybean video see if we continue to see that 25% bonus now what are we going to do with this graen we talked about storing it and we talked about being able to use it in production I wanted to demonstrate storing it now we know we can store the straw from our hay and grass video we can store that in the hay loft which is going to be found here under silos Hay Loft right this we can store our straw in if we wanted to store it loose or of course we could bail it and if we bailed it then we could put it in our bail storage building if we restore our grain well we could just come up here to any one of these silos and dump our grain and then we'll be able to also bring our grain out of it if we have one of these single bins I can't the camera won't let me get to that if we have one of the singular Bend silos well we're going to have to use an augur in order to pull grain out of that I'm going to have a separate video on how to do all of that basically we're going to come down here and we're going to find our augers under miscellaneous belt systems the Meridian will be used to take grain out of The Silo meanwhile the convey all will use to put grain Into The Silo but again we're going to have a completely separate video on that a little bit later if we look here at our production our Grain Mill well we can bring barley oat and wheat to our Grain Mill five units of wheat is going to make four units of flour 30 units of barley is going to make 22 units of flour and 15 units of oat is going to make 15 units of flour so this is a one: one meanwhile with with our wheat and our barley we're putting in more grain then we're getting flour out with respect to our Cereal Factory well we're going to be able to bring oats to our Cereal Factory and we can make chocolate cereal 36 units of corn 36 units of oat 10 units of chocolate 10 units of Honey to 20 units of cereal or we can make raisin cereal 40 units of corn 40 units with the oats 10 units of raisins 10 units of Honey 20 units of cereal the other two cereals are going to be exclusively for rice and therefore are not going to be able to make use of our oats our Bakery is going to be a down process with respect to our flour that we make and we can make bread with our flour 90 units of bread for 45 unit 9 units of flour 45 units of bread basically two to one two units of flour is going to make one unit of bread or we could use cakes and that is going to require a lot more ingredients but 8 units of flour 8 units of sugar 8 units of milk eight units of eggs butter and strawberries are all going to make 21 units worth of cake what you should decide to do with respect to your grain is basically up to you now we can also use our wheat and barley with respect to our pigs so right there it's also going to be eligible for pig food so guys I hope that has giving you a good idea as to what your wheat barley and oat is good for also how to harvest how to seed and how to care for your wheat barley and oats or overall let me know down in the comments below what do you think of our tips and tricks series are you looking forward to the next video I've got one hopefully scheduled every day for the remainder of this month if you're watching it fairly soon after the video is dropped otherwise this is basically a historical reference for anyone coming into the game that is not quite sure how to do any one of these specific crops until next time happy farming for",
