shay donald and marisol camacho first

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,399
about shea

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,640
shea is a field technician for the

50
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,799
professional technical services

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,479
horticulture department at hawthorne

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,079
gardening company

53
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,399
shea has a background in greenhorse

54
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,720
horticulture technology

55
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,200
he manages the design and construction

56
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,560
of vegetable production facilities

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,479
across across british columbia

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,600
and he's joining us today from vancouver

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,720
marisol has been with hgc for about

60
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,280
six months and previously had a year of

61
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,360
experience in kitchen ventilation

62
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,599
she graduated from oregon state

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,160
university cascades with a degree in

64
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,840
energy

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,000
systems engineering which is the

66
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,720
multi-disciplinary

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
degree it combines uh aspects of

68
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,319
mechanical

69
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,200
electrical and industrial engineering

70
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,120
courses

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,840
and then with a focus on energy and

72
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,080
developing a systems approach to solving

73
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,480
problems

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,879
role in background has allowed marisol

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,519
to sharpen this holistic mindset

76
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,560
because while her focus is primarily on

77
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,400
irrigation

78
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,239
she also does benching and lighting

79
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,879
design for greenhouse facilities

80
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,920
and really all indoor ag facilities as

81
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,160
well

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,720
marisol recognizes the importance of

83
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,800
understanding the impacts that changes

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,080
no matter how big or small in your

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,319
growing environment

86
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,599
can have on your irrigation system and

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,319
more importantly

88
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,640
on your plants so that's just a little

89
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,640
bit

90
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,159
about our two panelists today that

91
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,840
you'll be hearing from

92
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,760
now we're going to get into the meat and

93
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,840
potatoes of the presentation

94
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,959
so i throw it over to shea and we'll get

95
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,159
started

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,640
okay so question number one

97
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,680
what is drought stress and how does it

98
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,120
affect

99
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,000
crop development awesome thanks matthew

100
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,120
thanks for the

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,760
introduction so i guess starting out

102
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
um yeah we want to talk about drought

103
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,280
stress

104
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,920
and what that means to growers big and

105
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,159
small

106
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,720
so it drought stress is a general term

107
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,480
that can mean quite a few things but

108
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,959
overall it's just when

109
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,760
a plant doesn't have enough water to

110
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,080
maintain its physiological processes

111
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,159
and so it might start shutting things

112
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,200
down in order to prevent

113
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,319
an excess loss of moisture

114
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,280
so kind of the symptoms that you might

115
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,599
see

116
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,640
in a plant or in a crop are fairly

117
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,080
familiar to

118
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,760
even non-growers because as a plant

119
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,799
has water loss that's excessive

120
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,759
as that's occurring it's losing water in

121
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,800
its vacuoles

122
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,520
when it within its cells and

123
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,800
that starts to drop what's called the

124
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,759
turgor pressure

125
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,759
that keeps plants upright so it's a

126
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,880
fairly familiar

127
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,880
thing to see is a plant that's drooping

128
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,160
its leaves are facing downwards as it

129
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,000
loses that

130
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,440
force that's keeping the leaves upright

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,520
so there's a number of things that are

132
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,120
happening on

133
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,080
the cell level as this is going on

134
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,720
on plants leaves they have stomatal

135
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,160
openings

136
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:00,400
that open and close to allow

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,440
water vapor to escape as well as oxygen

138
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,080
but it also brings carbon dioxide into

139
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,680
the leaf

140
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,960
which is essential for photosynthesis so

141
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,479
as the plant realizes oh i don't have

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,960
enough water to

143
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,400
keep things going i have it shuts down

144
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,560
those stomatal openings

145
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,199
shuts them to try and prevent that water

146
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,160
loss it can't completely prevent it

147
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,800
but it will slow it down which also puts

148
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,600
a stop

149
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,639
on photosynthesis so bringing this back

150
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,840
around to

151
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,919
growers we obviously want to

152
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,520
keep the plants photosynthesizing as

153
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,800
much as possible

154
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,160
so for growers professional and amateur

155
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,479
alike

156
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,080
you don't want your plant to experience

157
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,360
this drought stress

158
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,039
because that's going to reduce the

159
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
photosynthesis which is going to reduce

160
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,880
your yield potential

161
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,400
and for greenhouse growers that means

162
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,560
lost dollars

163
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,000
you don't want to be keeping your lights

164
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,520
and fans and everything running

165
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,280
while your plants are just sitting there

166
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,960
trying desperately not to

167
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,000
lose water so that's kind of an acute

168
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,120
drought stress

169
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,840
situation that's where the plant hasn't

170
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,639
adapted

171
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,400
to what's going on in the root zone it's

172
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,440
just been exposed to extremely dry

173
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,919
conditions

174
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,400
and it's trying really hard not to to

175
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,680
die basically

176
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,800
but over time because plants

177
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,960
are are smart uh you know they

178
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,400
they are able to adapt to their

179
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,080
conditions because they don't have the

180
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,319
luxury of

181
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,880
picking up their roots and moving 20

182
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,960
feet closer to a stream

183
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,520
so in a natural environment they have to

184
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,800
change the way that they use water in

185
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,759
order to

186
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,280
adapt to those drier conditions and so

187
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,080
this is something that is a bit more

188
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,000
nefarious

189
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,160
and something that we really want to

190
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,919
push and and talk about today

191
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,160
is um just because your crop

192
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,759
looks okay and it looks like

193
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,520
everything's growing well

194
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,520
that your plants could still be

195
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,440
experiencing drought stress

196
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,599
it's just that they have adapted to it

197
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,280
now and they do things like

198
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,880
they reduce the number of stomatal

199
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,680
openings on their leaves

200
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,479
they produce smaller leaves and

201
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,000
ultimately

202
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,199
it again reduces your yield potential

203
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,960
and it reduces the amount of

204
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,840
photosynthesis that's going on day to

205
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,120
day

206
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,280
so if you have a crop that is

207
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,000
consistently exposed to just

208
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,440
minor drought stress conditions you end

209
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,880
up with a crop that might

210
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,000
look subjectively fine

211
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,599
but it's actually growing smaller and

212
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,680
producing less yield overall and that's

213
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,840
that's kind of what we're all about and

214
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,080
what we're all about

215
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,560
preventing is we want our plants just

216
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,680
drinking like crazy and therefore

217
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,960
growing like crazy

218
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,199
that's ideal

219
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,319
interesting shy as you noted we want to

220
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,680
avoid this

221
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,039
end of end of the year yield hit so yeah

222
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,639
limiting drought stress

223
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,440
is super important um so so guys what

224
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,199
factors into irrigation system planning

225
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,280
i i feel like this question will be a

226
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,599
perfect fit for marisol

227
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,360
in her uh systems approach and kind of

228
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,120
having an all-encompassing

229
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,120
approach to to a project

230
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,120
yeah so this question really it touches

231
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,639
on a lot of different things so really

232
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
you know whether you're greenhouse or

233
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,199
you're you know completely indoors

234
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,199
hydroponics hydroponic growing really

235
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,880
does require a holistic approach

236
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,719
um so the various inputs in the growing

237
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,719
environment will have an impact on the

238
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,399
irrigation system and its needs

239
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,599
but ultimately you know everything is

240
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,080
intertwined so they're all going to

241
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,560
affect

242
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,360
each other in different ways so one of

243
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,120
the biggest things

244
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,480
is going to be lights in the your

245
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,320
growing environment

246
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,920
switching the type of light or switching

247
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,440
the type of photo period of light

248
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,360
or the length of photo period of light

249
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,600
in a greenhouse or indoor facility will

250
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,720
ultimately impact the environment for

251
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,560
example

252
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,760
a big thing is switching from high

253
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,720
pressure sodium lights

254
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,839
uh to leds so switching to led lights

255
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,760
actually reduces the

256
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,000
amount of radiant heat available to the

257
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,040
plant and it will ultimately infect

258
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,240
evap evapotranspiration rates another

259
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,480
thing that can affect

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,959
your plant is the amount of plant

261
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,839
biomass or the pruning techniques used

262
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,959
across different high value crops

263
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,800
vegetables hemp etc

264
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,720
this decreases the thermal mass that's

265
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,399
ultimately available

266
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,839
and will impact the airflow that's

267
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,560
moving through both the beneath the

268
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,959
canonical

269
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,360
and above it's also decreasing the

270
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,680
surface area available for transpiration

271
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,440
as i mentioned up before

272
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,040
and also different types of plants are

273
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,720
all going to have different

274
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,160
ideal irrigation parameters so you're

275
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,360
going to need to adjust depending on the

276
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,040
type of crop that you're growing but

277
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,959
ultimately the type of species you are

278
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,120
as well and you know this is a big part

279
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,320
of i think hydroponic growing is that we

280
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,839
don't know everything about different

281
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,640
types of plants and how they truly

282
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,000
behave

283
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,279
and what are the different buttons that

284
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,360
can kind of push them into the next

285
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,800
stage of growth

286
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,160
and then another big thing is going to

287
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
be the impact on your heating and

288
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,680
cooling

289
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,079
so when you are irrigating and you are

290
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,360
doing

291
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,880
small and frequent irrigation events

292
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,560
you're going to put a lot less stress on

293
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,360
your hvac equipment versus if you're

294
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,320
doing

295
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,920
very infrequent larger volume irrigation

296
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,200
events so instead of putting a bunch of

297
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,800
water into the room

298
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,320
at one time you're putting a little bit

299
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,680
incrementally over time

300
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,519
and putting less stress on your system

301
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,000
and then another huge part as we can all

302
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,680
imagine is what's going on at the plant

303
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,920
there is the media type that you decide

304
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,519
to pick and then also the pot size

305
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,200
um as we have seen in hydroponic growing

306
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,959
three of the most popular growing medias

307
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,079
are going to be coco choir

308
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,959
rock wool and peat and so these all have

309
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,560
different benefits

310
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,839
but they also all require different

311
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,040
irrigation strategies and that's

312
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,959
important to consider

313
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,120
you shouldn't be watering six-inch

314
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,240
rockwell cubes the same as like

315
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,200
five gallons of coco coir so a really

316
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,200
important part of it

317
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
and i'm gonna hit a little bit on kind

318
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,440
of the

319
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,399
the benefits of each of these um growing

320
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,920
medias and then

321
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,560
also this irrigation strategies you

322
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,399
could use so first we have coco coir

323
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,680
as many people know it holds moisture

324
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,079
really well it allow

325
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,920
it allows for a lot of oxygenation and

326
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,120
it's really easy to use it's very user

327
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,440
friendly

328
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,519
and if it's properly treated prior to

329
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,839
use within the manufacturing

330
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,640
process it's going to be great for your

331
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,240
plants

332
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,760
it retains water for a long period of

333
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,680
time and can handle fewer

334
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,839
fewer irrigation events and it can

335
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,440
handle you know potentially mission

336
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,680
an irrigation event or any mistakes that

337
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,519
a new grower may make um and this also

338
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,800
has um the second most aeration

339
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,839
available to the plant

340
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,360
next to rockwool so going into rockwool

341
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,040
as mentioned it has the most aeration

342
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,440
available um

343
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,440
it also it does require a high level of

344
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,360
skill to efficiently irrigate

345
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,200
um and that's where people can kind of

346
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,839
get messed up using rockwool especially

347
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,160
if they're new to growing on a larger

348
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,240
scale

349
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,079
and lastly it's also not the most

350
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,920
sustainable growing media so that's a

351
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,160
kind of potential downside of choosing

352
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,880
rockwell

353
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,800
and then we have we have pete last pete

354
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,320
is very very easy to use as we've seen

355
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,560
it's available in a lot of consumer

356
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,279
grade soils that are out there

357
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,600
however with all the positives it does

358
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,959
have

359
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,040
it is a little bit more application

360
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,959
specific it cannot be

361
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,480
as well suited for higher intensity

362
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,959
crops

363
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,839
because of the potential for um over

364
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,720
saturation of water

365
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,399
and then lastly we have pot size bigger

366
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,839
pots are going to require less frequent

367
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,600
irrigation events

368
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,839
and but it is going to be harder to

369
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,560
control the moisture content available

370
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,560
and also

371
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,560
there's the potential for there is

372
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,360
potential for a greater margin of error

373
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,360
in terms of

374
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,720
if you water a little bit too much it's

375
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,040
probably going to be okay

376
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,720
versus if you have a smaller pot over

377
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,600
watering can have a much more severe

378
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,720
impact on

379
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,160
plant health throughout the growth cycle

380
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,000
and then small pots obviously yield

381
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,279
themselves really well to the strategy

382
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,360
of pulse irrigation

383
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,279
and it's really good it's really easy to

384
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,720
maintain moisture and aeration in the

385
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,000
root zone when you're putting in a lot

386
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,519
of smaller

387
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,399
irrigation events as a team at hawthorne

388
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,079
we always strive to design our systems

389
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,079
with consideration to all these factors

390
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,040
and to allow for flexibility within your

391
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,880
system

392
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,160
we want to make sure that you know if

393
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,320
you decide to expand

394
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,760
by you know adding a couple more plants

395
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,279
to each of your rooms

396
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,639
we're going to be able to handle that

397
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,279
and that's a really important part of

398
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,720
planning

399
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,320
your irrigation system and we'll get a

400
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,680
little bit more into this as we

401
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,959
get further into the webinar great stuff

402
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,959
there marisol

403
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,000
um you kind of touched on it a little

404
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,399
bit there at the end

405
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,120
but are there some preventative measures

406
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,680
that that

407
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,680
growers and their teams should be

408
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,360
keeping in mind during the design

409
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
process when they're designing the

410
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,320
irrigation system that they want to use

411
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,160
in the greenhouse to account for

412
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,279
potential changes down the road

413
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,480
such as maybe going from hps to led

414
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,399
or maybe adding some additional acreage

415
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,600
that you hadn't planned on originally

416
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,600
but you want to scale up and expand any

417
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,440
any high level thoughts there that you

418
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,279
guys can share with us

419
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,720
i guess real there's a wealth of

420
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,600
problems unfortunately that you could

421
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,360
have in a

422
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,360
in a growing facility so i mean i'll

423
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,440
just touch on some of the you know

424
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,560
i guess the most common ones we see one

425
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,639
of the first things is the

426
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,680
improperly sized equipment or placed

427
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,720
equipment

428
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,920
um and within that also designing for

429
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,680
redundancy

430
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,959
if you have a pump for each different

431
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,360
room per say

432
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,440
in some indoor facility uh you'll be

433
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,519
able to accommodate any potential

434
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,760
addition of more plants versus if you

435
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,360
have you know only two pumps handling

436
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,519
like six rooms

437
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,600
there are as many pumps or as many

438
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,880
pieces of equipment

439
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,480
here i'm actually going to pause there

440
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,480
sorry that didn't flow out very well

441
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,839
another potential issue of poorly

442
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,000
designed irrigation systems is going to

443
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,399
be improperly sized or placed equipment

444
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,839
whether that be pumps pipes filters or

445
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,000
valves

446
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,920
and it's also going to be designing for

447
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,440
redundancy it's really important to

448
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,279
account for oh my gosh

449
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,160
sorry i have to start over that just not

450
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,160
flowing out very well

451
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,680
okay there are a lot of common issues

452
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,160
that can potentially show up

453
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,600
in a drip irrigation system one of them

454
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,440
many of them can be due to

455
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,480
improperly sized or placed equipment

456
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,959
such as pumps pipes filters and valves

457
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,040
we could also see signs in terms of

458
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,000
fungus gnats or different types of pests

459
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,920
that are

460
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,920
present because of an excess amount of

461
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,120
water and then we could also see

462
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,440
unwanted

463
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,800
plant stress and stress plants are more

464
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,320
susceptible to pests and they're more

465
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,120
susceptible

466
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,759
to just all the environmental factors as

467
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,240
they become more stressed out

468
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,000
specifically some of the things that we

469
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,639
definitely do as designers is we

470
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,240
always aim to design redundant systems

471
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,040
we want to make sure that we have enough

472
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,959
pumps to cover any potential expansion

473
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,199
we have large enough pumps that can

474
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,279
cover any potential addition of plants

475
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,560
and any increases in flow rates it's

476
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,399
also important to introduce

477
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,639
automation and monitoring into your

478
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,920
system this can help you keep track

479
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,279
and have real-time data showing that you

480
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,720
are delivering the proper amount of

481
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,600
water and types of nutrients to your

482
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,199
plants

483
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,639
and i can i'm going to leave this open

484
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,079
for shay to answer some

485
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,040
add some quick tidbits too

486
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:32,079
um yeah so some preventative items that

487
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,079
madisol touched on

488
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,800
we tend to want to allow growers the

489
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,079
flexibility to

490
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,839
you know if they want to change their

491
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,800
planting density down the road

492
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,519
or modify their irrigation scheduling or

493
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,160
strategies that they have the

494
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,279
the control aspect and and the ability

495
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,199
to do so

496
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,600
um and so like madison mentioned um

497
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,199
we would try and include some kind of

498
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,320
baked in

499
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,639
um wiggle room so to speak in

500
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,400
in the design uh whether it's slightly

501
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,160
over-sizing pipes i think is fairly

502
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,559
common so that it can handle a higher

503
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,439
flow rate down the road

504
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,919
or having a larger pump or something

505
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,600
that has

506
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,839
a variable frequency drive that allows

507
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,520
it to maintain the pressure that's

508
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,360
needed because

509
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,799
one of the biggest issues that we see

510
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:28,000
are commonly improperly sized

511
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,720
items like that and what happens is

512
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
it might work today but as soon as you

513
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,000
change a factor or

514
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
change something in your growing style

515
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,280
down the road

516
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,200
then you're going to have problems so

517
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,760
just trying to account for that on the

518
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,440
front end and also understand that

519
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,200
growers do like to change these things

520
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,240
and and kind of play around with stuff

521
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,000
is is what we try to incorporate into

522
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,240
any of our recommendations or any of our

523
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,240
work

524
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,640
i would say also another big thing too

525
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,360
is

526
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,559
getting a grasp of the facility as well

527
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,080
understanding where the water is

528
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,520
actually coming into your building and

529
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,200
making sure that when you're sizing

530
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,760
those pumps that you're accounting for

531
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,440
any potential pressure loss over those

532
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,960
lengths

533
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,960
and there's a lot of different things

534
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,480
absolutely yes

535
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,240
oh and just adding to that too just how

536
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,240
much water do they have access to

537
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,679
you know we've had situations where

538
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,600
people have to drill

539
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,960
extra wells for example or go to the

540
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,360
city and get a

541
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,160
increase which is probably fairly common

542
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,720
among

543
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,000
some of the viewers today so and water

544
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,000
quality as well

545
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,679
that's another part as well and

546
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,520
especially as

547
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,360
people are growing in different parts of

548
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,120
the country it's important to understand

549
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,160
what types of minerals and things are in

550
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,840
your water so that you can properly

551
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,840
clean it before it goes to your plants

552
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,919
so guys it sounds like there's there's a

553
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,360
lot of variables there a lot of moving

554
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,400
parts where

555
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,559
it it behooves you as a grower to have

556
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,480
some a team of experts kind of on your

557
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,320
side helping you through this process

558
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,320
and making sure you're planning for what

559
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,880
you need down the road

560
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,559
um you know we we've touched on a few

561
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,640
different production systems a few

562
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,080
different growing styles

563
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,480
for greenhouse growing specifically

564
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,160
how is irrigation different when you're

565
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,520
when you're deploying it within a

566
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,320
greenhouse versus

567
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,919
another type of indoor facility and what

568
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,960
are some of the common issues or

569
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,320
problems that you

570
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:38,320
see typically in a greenhouse operation

571
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,200
that's adding irrigation yeah so

572
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,559
greenhouse is

573
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,919
pretty interesting because um you know i

574
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,760
had someone

575
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,120
tell me that you know greenhouse growing

576
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,960
is kind of like

577
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,640
regular agriculture but for control

578
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,160
freaks and

579
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,080
i think that's that's kind of true

580
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,280
because you you take all these things

581
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,280
that

582
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,320
in an agricultural setting you have no

583
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,039
control over

584
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,520
um you know your soil type to some

585
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,320
degree

586
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,760
the temperature the humidity the wind

587
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,159
those are all things you have to contend

588
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,960
with

589
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,440
um whereas in a greenhouse or an indoor

590
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,720
setting

591
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,520
which takes it kind of to the next

592
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,559
extreme um you get to control all those

593
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,520
items

594
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,159
you know to some degree so when you have

595
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,400
to

596
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,400
deal with irrigation in a greenhouse

597
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,919
setting

598
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,320
it's going to be different than in a

599
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,159
field as well as indoor

600
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,960
and compared to in a field you know

601
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,640
your crops have essentially an unlimited

602
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,760
amount of room for their roots to grow

603
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,159
into

604
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,840
and so you can get away with not

605
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,720
irrigating for

606
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,720
sometimes multiple days and the crops

607
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,720
are going to do just fine

608
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,000
and in fact a lot of what irrigation

609
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,360
management is in

610
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,080
a field versus in a greenhouse or indoor

611
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,840
is just accounting for you know what you

612
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,480
get from the rain

613
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,200
your soil type the environmental

614
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,000
conditions

615
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,080
and things like that and there's there's

616
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,720
a lot more buffer there and a lot more

617
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,080
room for you to take time and make those

618
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,919
decisions

619
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,400
uh in a greenhouse setting when you're

620
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,280
growing in soilless media especially

621
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,320
um now you don't have the luxury of that

622
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,320
time

623
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,440
and what you need to do with this

624
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,679
reduced

625
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,320
root ball without with this lower amount

626
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,159
of volume for the roots to grow into

627
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,880
you need to increase the frequency of

628
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,120
your irrigations significantly

629
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,880
now in a greenhouse compared to an

630
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,600
indoor setting indoor setting it's kind

631
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,520
of

632
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,880
you know you have great big hvac systems

633
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,400
and and the goal is

634
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,039
to keep your environment bang on

635
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,679
exactly the same throughout the entire

636
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,360
day

637
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,799
that kind of makes things a bit easier

638
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,280
because now you just

639
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,840
you can say i want to irrigate every 30

640
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,799
minutes

641
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,600
and give it 200 mils and just do that

642
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,120
all day

643
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,720
starting two hours after your lights

644
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,000
turn on for example

645
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,000
in a greenhouse there's going to be some

646
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,039
compounding factors such as

647
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,080
you know light levels

648
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,919
and the humidity and temperature which

649
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,840
you have some control over but it's not

650
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,919
going to be that perfect perfect control

651
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,360
that you see in an idealized indoor

652
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,679
setting so what a lot of modern

653
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,120
controllers do environmental controllers

654
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,559
for greenhouses

655
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,039
they kind of factor a lot of those

656
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,039
things in automatically

657
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,080
obviously the grower still has to make a

658
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,440
lot of decisions

659
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,840
on the front end about what those

660
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,080
parameters are going to be

661
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,280
but a lot of it is just through these

662
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,039
very complex

663
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,159
systems that exist that assist growers

664
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,799
with

665
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,000
making those decisions and and i think

666
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,360
one of the most

667
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,960
um recent additions to this

668
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,679
is kind of the uh there's been a lot of

669
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,880
sensing soil moisture sensing technology

670
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,600
that's kind of taking off

671
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,760
in stairless media these days which is

672
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,280
very exciting because now

673
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,600
you know that's the most direct way to

674
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,919
tell how much water is my plant getting

675
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,760
is

676
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,600
well how much water is there you can

677
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,240
indirectly monitor it by looking at

678
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,600
things like

679
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,360
like i was saying light humidity etc

680
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,799
but this allows you to really get the

681
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,799
plant eye view so to speak

682
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,360
and just just to add to that really

683
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,280
quickly

684
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,200
doing your irrigation scheduling using

685
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,039
sensors the sensor-based setpoint

686
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,039
irrigation really has the potential to

687
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,640
reduce your water volume significantly

688
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,520
in your operation

689
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,039
and despite also the low cost of water

690
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,720
there are a lot of potential economic

691
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,280
benefits that may result

692
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,440
from this in terms of reduced labor

693
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,840
fertilizer requirements and then disease

694
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,840
control

695
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,120
interesting guys it sounds like uh using

696
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,159
some of these advanced high-tech ec

697
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,159
and soil mon soil moisture sensors

698
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,520
are is something more advanced

699
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,640
greenhouse growers are

700
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,120
are doing today um are there any other

701
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,480
advanced irrigation techniques that

702
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,080
you're seeing

703
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,840
from a lot of greenhouse operations that

704
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,080
are working well yeah absolutely so it's

705
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,679
it's very interesting because i think a

706
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,000
lot of

707
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,440
the studies going on nowadays it's it's

708
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
really you want to be able to give your

709
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,799
crop

710
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,240
the least amount of water possible while

711
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,960
still maintaining that yield

712
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,840
that's that's desired because

713
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,080
sustainability

714
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,760
is going to be the number one issue you

715
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,000
know moving forward for a lot of folks

716
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,120
and i think water use is going to be

717
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,159
front of mind for

718
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,799
for that as well um

719
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,559
and so you know actually utilizing

720
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,840
drought stress itself

721
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,960
is something that is also already being

722
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,480
done

723
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,679
in a lot of vegetable crops for example

724
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,000
crop steering if anyone

725
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,400
is familiar with like tomato cucumber

726
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,919
pepper production that's sort of

727
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,760
growing you're you've got an

728
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,240
indeterminate plant that wants to both

729
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,600
be producing vegetative leaves as well

730
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,440
as productive

731
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:09,120
generative fruits and so

732
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,440
how growers kind of tell the plant

733
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,840
hey you should be producing more leaves

734
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,919
or more

735
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,080
fruits uh one of the one of the largest

736
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,520
tools or most immediate tools that

737
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,720
growers have in their belt

738
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,400
is uh through irrigation scheduling

739
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,919
and so this is called crop steering i'm

740
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,720
not sure if i mentioned it before

741
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,679
but um and what you can do is

742
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,919
essentially

743
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,679
by delaying your irrigation a little bit

744
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,400
in the morning adjusting a few key

745
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:40,000
environmental factors

746
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,559
you can sort of signal the plant that

747
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,480
it might be receiving less water moving

748
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,520
forward and so it kind of activates some

749
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,360
of those

750
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,200
processes we were talking about earlier

751
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,080
but without really reducing

752
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,559
the photosynthesis photosynthetic

753
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,760
ability of the plant that's the ideal

754
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,240
so by kind of running things drier so to

755
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,240
speak

756
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,880
you signaled the plant to produce more

757
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,679
fruit whereas if you have

758
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,159
more of a well-saturated consistently

759
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,320
moist

760
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,360
media then the plant kind of thinks hey

761
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,080
i can relax a bit

762
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,760
and start producing more leaves so

763
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,360
that's one of the key tools but

764
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,159
but there are i think going to be many

765
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,960
more moving forward and this application

766
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,159
i believe will extend to other crops

767
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,919
there are a lot of

768
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,919
studies that have been done on crops

769
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,799
that produce

770
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,279
essential oils and especially terpene

771
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,320
type

772
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,640
volatile chemicals that

773
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,799
humans might find desirable because we

774
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,640
can extract that and it smells nice

775
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,799
and you know there's a lot of crops out

776
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,640
there even medicinal ones that

777
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,400
that that is beneficial and there have

778
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,120
been studies that show

779
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,720
that if you kind of drought stress the

780
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,159
plants towards the end of their

781
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,760
production cycle

782
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,320
that they might produce more of these

783
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,480
chemicals sometimes they can be

784
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,600
protective chemicals and a lot of the

785
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,600
reason that they're

786
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,799
even being produced might not entirely

787
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,279
be known yet

788
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,159
but again i think that focusing on

789
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,000
irrigation

790
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,200
as a tool is um extremely exciting it's

791
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,080
something i'm

792
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,080
quite passionate about

793
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,159
excellent marisol anything to add to

794
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,919
that or anything you wanted to say there

795
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,840
well all great points that shea brought

796
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,159
up and um

797
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,760
also as a somebody with background in

798
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,120
energy and sustainability

799
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,640
i really look forward to seeing the

800
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,240
different advances and research that

801
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,320
will continue going into

802
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,080
understanding how irrigation can really

803
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,039
affect plant physiology

804
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,039
and plant outputs

805
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,679
excellent guys we're coming up to the

806
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,200
end of this presentation this is i feel

807
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,559
like this has been a great use of

808
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,600
everyone's time

809
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,080
talking about something that maybe not

810
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,279
as much

811
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,880
emphasis is put on as light selection or

812
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,880
genetic selection or some of these

813
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,080
things growers are very focused on when

814
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,200
they're planting a crop

815
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,440
but just as important obviously putting

816
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,159
a bow on this whole presentation

817
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,039
how can you any how can you avoid

818
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,159
drought stress

819
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,760
in the greenhouse yeah so avoiding

820
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,799
drought stress in the greenhouse

821
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,000
it starts from the pre-planning right it

822
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,320
starts from when you're

823
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,399
getting ready to construct your building

824
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,320
and what you have to do at that point

825
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,399
is you got to choose the right partners

826
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,960
um because

827
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,399
uh you want someone that's not only

828
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,200
going to understand

829
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,600
irrigation and drought stress but you

830
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,200
want

831
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,279
a partner who can kind of give you the

832
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,679
whole holistic picture

833
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,600
connect the dots connect things to your

834
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,399
growing media your growing style your

835
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,559
crop et cetera et cetera et cetera

836
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,760
and ideally someone who is going to be

837
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,919
there when

838
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,360
they hand you the keys um and this is

839
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,640
you know selfishly the plug for

840
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,520
hawthorne because

841
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,320
that's exactly what we do um we have a

842
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,640
team

843
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,760
that myself and matthew solar a part of

844
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,120
that's made up of

845
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,360
horticulturists mechanical engineers

846
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,320
lighting and electrical engineers as

847
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,360
well as design

848
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,760
and technical support that really

849
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,799
brings all those dots together whether

850
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,720
it's a greenhouse

851
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,720
indoor outdoor application

852
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:21,520
we're here to assist growers

853
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:25,039
to get the maximum yield and

854
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,039
the best possible crop that they can

855
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,080
really well sums it up shay and i just

856
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,600
like to add to that

857
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,679
is that you know throughout the whole

858
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,480
design process and project process we're

859
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,200
here

860
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,960
um before and we're here after and even

861
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,720
if we don't have a solution

862
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,720
for everything we're here to make sure

863
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,919
that it will integrate with anything

864
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,760
else that you choose

865
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,480
and that everything will work in unison

866
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,960
okay that does it for the presentation

867
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,520
uh

868
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,200
segment of our of our talk here now

869
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,880
we're going to open it up to audience

870
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,840
question and answer

871
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,720
so if you had any questions for shea or

872
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,320
marisol

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,200
that you wanted to get an answer for

874
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,399
today go ahead and type those into the q

875
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,880
