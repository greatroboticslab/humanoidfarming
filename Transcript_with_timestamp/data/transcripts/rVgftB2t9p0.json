  "text": "so right here I have the garden tower and I'm going to assemble it and what it is is a tower compact tower that you can grow up to 50 little plants and I plan on putting some strawberries the other nice feature about this is that you can put food scraps in the middle of it and the plants will eat it and so I put it here on my deck where it's close to the kitchen so we can just easily put food scraps in it so let's get started [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so I don't quite have enough dirt to fill this up but I'm eager to get some plants in there so I'm going to go ahead and plant the strawberries that I have so the instructions say that fill it up about a third of the way the soil and then add approximately three gallons of water to the soil that's there and I'll just circle this so I've given the water a chance to percolate down now I'm going to get these strawberries out these are pine Barry White Carolina strawberries and then there's some red ones in here as well to help with the pollination end up with purposing feedbags in order to fill up with some topsoil from the high tunnel project [Music] and the idea is that over time this water and stuff will come down here would be the nutria team so then you can take this bring it back up here [Music] poor back in there [Music] so I'll go ahead and let it go let it get situated before I plant anything else in the top but I'm really thrilled to try this out now I these are available on farmer Broadcom and I've purchased this one with my own money because I wanted to be able to try it out firsthand and so these two rows are going to be strawberries and what I like about this is that you can rotate it around and so if you have like a small amount of space you got 50 opportunities to grow something which i think is incredible now they do offer an upgrade kit where you can get coaster or wheels for the three legs that way it can be moved around a little bit but I have it on my deck so that's close to the kitchen so it can put food scraps in there and this way is south facing so it should get plenty of Sun throughout the day no matter which side the plants are on so thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and make sure to get your the garden tower project to farmer Brad calm",
