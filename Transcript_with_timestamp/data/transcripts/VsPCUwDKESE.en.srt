1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,879
all right so I'm going to show you my

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,400
work area here you'll see here that we

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,319
have the buckets of the things that we

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,280
just sorted from the car these are our

5
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,840
different colored cloths that we brought

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,160
in and as soon as I sort them from today

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,960
then I just throw them inside these

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,480
buckets and then at the end of the week

9
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,160
I put some cleaning solution in there

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,240
and I soak all of the junk off of the

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,359
cloths and then I run an individual load

12
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,480
of each of those up here I do have my

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,920
oxyclean which is what I soak the aprons

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,760
and the uniforms in as we go up here I

15
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,199
have some special kits and then over

16
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,320
here we have our personal prote

17
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,680
equipment and that is every kit gets

18
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,200
some personal protective equipment but

19
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,000
we let the individual um house cleaners

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,800
check those out we have our shoe covers

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,760
we have our garbage bags and this is the

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,559
stuff that we need to pack our kits and

23
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,719
then over here we have our empty bottles

24
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,079
and these will be the bottles that we

25
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,920
restock tonight's supplies with and so

26
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,360
that is the setup that we have here and

27
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,359
like I said this is an operation that

28
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,079
will run probably 1 to three one to four

29
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:01,039
people and this is before you need to

30
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,039
scale and consider a bigger place
