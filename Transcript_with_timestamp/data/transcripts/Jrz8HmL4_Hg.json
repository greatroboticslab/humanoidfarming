  "text": "so hello everyone today we're going to be presenting poultry farmers guide to FSA loans we hope that in this guide you'll learn the basics that you need to know in order to navigate your way through the FSA loan process so some of the things we'd like you to take away today are a better understanding of the FSA financing options available to you a better understanding of how that financing works and what elements make the determination that FSA some of the factors you should consider before borrowing for poultry farm a better understanding of the risks in financing a poultry farm a better understand of the FSA eligibility process a better relationship with your local FSA office and overall more confidence in your ability to successfully manage your farm so this workshop is broken up into three sections section one will be a personal evaluation things that you need to ask yourself personally before borrowing for a poultry farm section two will cover an introduction to FSA loan programs so we'll just talk about eligibility in general types of loans types of FSA lenders things like that and then section 3 will be the application process where we go through applying for a loan approval and denial of a loan repealing alone and then restructuring alone so the first thing you need to do before borrowing to financial culture operations are to set your goals and to ask your big questions so as a family sit down and write out your goals discuss them make sure that everyone is voicing their opinions prioritize your goals remember that overall this is a family farm or family operation so you're the well-being of your family is the most important thing think about is this business a good time good use of your time and resources do you have the money time knowledge to make this business work and does this specific financing package work for you the price of the mortgage note your payment that you're going to have to make the terms the interest rate everything like so just remember that you're responsible for considering all these questions before you apply for any type of financing so as an introduction to farm loans we have two basic types of loans we have an operating loan and an ownership loan now there are other types of loans but we're just going to kind of talk about these because these are the primary types of loans that most farmers need an operating loan is a short-term loan to persist inputs necessary to operate your farm while an ownership loan is a longer-term loan make for the purchase of major farming assets like farmland poultry houses or equipment within FSA you have two types of loans you have a direct loan that's a loan made by FSA to farmers where FSA is the lender and also services the loan and then you have a guaranteed loan now that's a loan made by a financial institution like a bank or something of that nature which is backed by FSA so in that scenario your lending institution is the one servicing the loan typically that'll be someone like the Farm Credit for example whereas FSA will financially guarantee the loan up to ninety percent so just to understand the risk that's very important to do so before you apply for a loan and understanding the steps of evaluation are good because the process by which your loan will be evaluated is different from what you need to do personally so in a loan evaluation they'll look at eligibility do you qualify for the loan they'll look at feasibility does your loan repayment plan makes sense will that farm loan cash flow and then they look at your collateral how much collateral you have how much you are offering your collateral can be real estate farms equipment things of that nature you know but they'll look at the total package that you're bringing in but things that you need to ask yourself are how well do you really know the poultry business have you talked to any current or former poultry farmers what will happen if you can't make that loan payment how consistent is your pay as a grower and then does your contract the contract with your into traitor have any type of language that you really need to be aware of because your mortgage is a binding contract so you want to ensure to look at the contract from your integrator as well so we'll talk about collateral first and what happens is if you default collateral we define as an asset offered as security for the repayment of a loan to be forfeited in the event of a default so typically collateral use for farm loans include farms farming equipment vehicles land or your personal home so in this scenario a default is a failure to fulfill a loan obligation especially to repay a loan that's something known as a monetary obligation and therefore if you do not repay your loan you're in monetary default now you can be in non-monetary default and that is where you fail to comply with a provision of the loan that is not relate to repayment such as paying your taxes on the loan keeping up with farm insurance on the property things of that nature so when you borrow money to fund your poultry farm you're tying the collateral that you offer up to the financial health of your poultry farm and your collateral is at risk to the financial problems of your poultry farm so for example we talked about personal homes may be used as collateral so you would be tying your personal home to your poaching farm and if you default on your poultry loan you may be required to forfeit your personal home so that's something very important to consider before offering them your personal homeless collateral okay so it's important that you know your contract before you borrow for it now this is your contract with your integrator your poultry contract and here are some questions that you should ask about your contract before borrowing money against it what is the length of your contract is it flock to flock so for example do you have a three-year flock to flock contract what does that mean does that mean that you're only going to receive you're only guaranteed to receive birds on a flock to flock basis meaning that they can terminate your contract anytime within three years or you guaranteed to receive X number of flocks for a year within that three years that's all going to be contained in your contract also what are the rights with your company if your determine if your contract is terminated what are the reasons that your contract could be terminated often there will be language in there contracted outlines how and why your contract may be terminated how does your company handle housing upgrades our disputes handled by your company those should all be included in there typically speaking contracts may include language that says upgrades can be required kind of at will by the company so they make the determination when an upgrade is required it's important that you understand how you're paid do you does your contract including guaranteed pay are you ranked in a tournament and then is your density your flock numbers your target weight everything related to your flock of birds guaranteed in your contract does the company have the ability to change your density or change your target weight without notifying you or do they have to notify you how much time do they are they required to notify you by questions like this and many more gonna be found in our copy of the FSA guide and that's gonna be in Appendix C all right so tournament pay in your mortgage payment so just so that everyone understands tournament pay is an incentive that's used by integrators to encourage peak performance amongst their contract farmers and how it works is that under this model farms would flock being processed during the same week of ranks amongst each other according to integrator cost per pound and that becomes your tournament once your tournament is established farmers performance are rated above or below the average and that determines their in pay so farmers that are underperforming the average will have their pay reduced mean farmers who have a higher cost to the company will be lower ranked ranked below the average and will have their pay reduced while farmers that produce cheaper than the company average will be ranked higher and will have a bonus added to their pay this means that your pay can fluctuate greatly from one flock to the next where is your cost specifically your mortgage payment your loan payment will remain the same regardless of what you're being paid so it's essential to consider that the average pay estimate may not be representative of what your actual pay will be you could earn higher but you could also earn lower so it's always good to estimate your cash flow and be very realistic on how you estimate your cash flow here in this slide you'll see that we have some company estimates listed on the right and some farmer estimates listed on the left so you'll notice that the estimated cost of building four houses is the same 966 thousand dollars the estimated gross income is the same roughly a hundred sixty four thousand dollars the estimated loan payment is the same about ninety four thousand dollars in change whereas the estimated farmer costs are much different the company estimates thirty six thousand dollars whereas farmers that we consulted with and our current poultry farmers estimate closer to eighty thousand dollars so how is this different and why is it different well the expenses that the company lists are listed on the left in the expenses that our farmers have included are listed on the right now just so that everyone understands every cost that the company estimates here farmers also do include but there are additional cost that the farmers have include that they know they have to pay based on their own experience and all of these figures can be found in our guide as well you can refer to section C for many more cash flow estimates just to give you a better eye but you'll notice that we've included the electric bill the insurance bill the bill for cleaning out the bill for pressed out through property taxes and that totals down to thirty six thousand four hundred dollars but in that there's additional costs for example heating fuel the cost to fill your house with shavings especially if this is a new poultry operation or you've had to do a clean-out down to the bare ground you also have equipment fuel for fueling your generators or maybe your digesters or something like that that you have around the property equipment repairs this could be to any of your equipment necessary to run the operation like a cake out machine or something like that and then you also have hired labor in there most farmers that we talk to do have at least one hired person on hand to help them with their operation and that's where the difference is and so you can you know compare and contrast these two different cost analysis okay so now we're going to discuss basic FSA loan eligibility so these are the steps to do before you've applied so before applying you need to seek financing with traditional lenders the FSA eligibility process starts with exploring financing option with traditional lenders like Farm Credit Bank are crazy if you are unable to secure financing at reasonable rates and terms then you may be eligible for an FSA loan so of course you have to start by first applying to Farm Credit before applying directly to FSA now to get started with an FSA application you need to first have your farm number so to be considered for a loan you must demonstrate you are authorized to operate your farm where it is located so you would visit your local FSA office with a copy of your lease your rental agreement or proof of ownership and then they would assist you in registering and receiving your FSA farm number there are a couple of conditions with this for certain FSA loans your loan officer may require that you complete a borrower training course within two years of closing the loan your loan funds must be used within the United States and then certain loan requirements may exceed the lending limits of FSA in that case you the borrower must be able to secure the remaining financing from another source so for example if the FSA loan limit on a particular program is 300,000 and you need $400,000 you would need to secure the additional $100,000 from a separate lender not FSA okay so here are some different notes on FSA loans one is the hundred and fifty percent rule so on all direct FSA loans have a security requirement of at least one hundred percent of the loan amount however FSA will require applicants to provide collateral up to 150% of the loan amount if it is available in this loan this rule specifically applies to FSA Direct Loans only so for example if you're borrowing $300,000 to upgrade your poultry farm you may be required to offer an additional hundred and fifty thousand dollars in collateral meaning your poultry farm and other collateral like equipment of personal home could be required as collateral there are some exceptions to the hundred and fifty percent rule for example if the asset necessary like your tractor other equipment shadow-like other type of breeding stock or cattle something like that if those are necessary to secure credit elsewhere for farming operations they may be accepted also your personal home your household contents your personal vehicles they can also be exempt from the hundred fifty percent rule however your home must be on a separate parcel land so if your home is on the exact same parcel as your farm then it may not be exempt also working capital accounts like your bank account and retirement accounts like your 401k pensions those mounts will be exempt for guaranteed loans the FSA reviews the collateral proposed and available and requires the lenders to secure the lawn to the satisfaction of both FSA and the lender Benni would you like to speak on that a little bit more does that mean that they have a little more flexibility with how much collateral is required for a guaranteed loan the lender is the lender is advised and able to use what they would do to another applicant that is not here to mean so that sometimes goes beyond what FSA's requirements are excellent so in that particular case as Benny said your individual lender may have additional flexibility so that's just something to keep in mind as well okay so here are some basic types of farm loans that are available from FSA there are other type of loans but we're only going to discuss these three because these are the three primary ones that most people use again you have a farm ownership loan like we discussed those may only be used to buy or enlarge a farm make a down payment on a farm make structure improvements on a farm like building a building or structure something of that nature or other brick-and-mortar projects now you have an operating loan and that's a loan to cover necessary expenses associated with improving the profitability of your farm according to the FSA description an operating loan will help you purchase livestock and equipment and pay for minor real estate repairs and annual operating expenses you also have an emergency loan and that according to the FSA description is a loan that will help you if you suffered a qualifying loss caused by a natural disaster that damaged your farming or ranching operation you can find more details on these three most common types of loan in included in the FSA guide or you're welcome to contact your local FSA office also there's also conservation loans micro loans and other types of loans but again it's best to contact your local FSA office if you have additional questions about those types of loans all right so we're going to discuss eligibility for Direct Loans so under direct loan you have a farm ownership loan you have an operating loan you have a emergency one all three of the types of loans we discussed previously but your loan limit is $300,000 and if we remember from earlier this is the type of loan where FSA is the one directly loaning you $300,000 and they're also the one that will be servicing that $3,000 so your general general eligibility requirements are have the training education or experience to effectively manage a farm or ranch you must be a US citizen a nonsense and national or qualified alien you must possess the legal capacity to obtain a loan you must not have a conviction related to a controlled substance you must be unable to obtain credit elsewhere at reasonable rates and Terms if you remember a few slides back we mentioned that you first need to start by applying for financing with a non FSA lender and then if you're unable to find those reasonable rates and terms that's when you would turn the FSA so that's what that eligibility requirement means also you must be able to demonstrate good credit history or if you're unable to demonstrate good credit history you need to show that that that the incidences were beyond were due to circumstances beyond your control they were infrequent or they were not recent you must not have had a recent foreclosure or business failure you must be able to show that your farm is a family farm or ranch and the majority of the physical labor and management is provided by you a family member or another entity member you must not have received debt forgiveness on another FSA direct or guaranteed loan and you must not be behind on any debt to the government when the long closes with certain exceptions if you have questions about those exceptions please contact your local FSA agent okay so now we're going to discuss eligibility for guaranteed loans so under a guaranteed loan we have farm ownership loans we have operating loans we have conservation loans and the loan limit for that is generally 1 million three hundred 9,000 that's adjusted annually so for example it went up from 2016 but it may be adjusted you know down in 2018 so that's always something to check out with your local FSA age so the eligibility requirements for a guaranteed loan are that you're a US citizen a non sis and national or qualify datum you must possess the legal capacity to obtain a loan you are unable to find a lender willing to approve your loan with reasonable terms and rates without a guarantee you must not have received debt forgiveness on another FSA direct or guaranteed loan you must be able to show that your farm is a family farm or ranch and the majority of the physical labor and management is provided by you a family member or another entity member and you must not be behind on any debt owed to the US government after the loan closes there's also some additional security requirements on FSA guaranteed loans so in some cases if you use chattel as the security on more than one loan for a guaranteed loan you may be able to do so for a guaranteed loan but you would need to consult your individual lender if that's an option for you so for example you may be able to use breeding stock or equipment across as collateral across two different loans Benny can you think of a situation where that may apply sir that would apply if your agree this you can use your channels can be if you are getting two loans you needed a operating loan and you needed another loan your channel actually can be used as collateral in both instances okay excellent let's see so we want you to understand your loan terms in order to do that you need to understand the terminology used in loans so for example when we say loan terms we mean the number of payments the interest rate and obligations stipulated by your loan agreement your interest rate is the proportion of a loan charge as interest to you the borrower the interest is the money paid regularly at a particular rate for money lent or for delaying the repayment of debt and this may be fixed or floating a fixed interest rate is an interest rate that remains the same throughout the life of the loan whereas a floating interest rate is an interest rate that is subject to change over the life of the loan and that's also known as a variable interest rate so most of you have probably heard of fixed interest rates and variable interest rates now a floating interest rate may be initially lower than a fixed rate but could increase over time and that could have significant consequences for you repaying your loan ie a much higher loan payment in the future a longer term will lower your monthly payment amount but they will result in more interest being paid over the life of the law so while having longer terms will increase your ability to pay on a monthly basis by having a lower term lower payment amount you will overall end up repaying more for that loan because you've stretched your terms out over a longer time it's critically important that you discuss these loan terms and rates with your FSA or your loan officer to select the option that works best for you and you should consider how your loan terms will affect your ability to repay your loan as well as affect what's your monthly loan payment will be so loan terms and lenders which are best for you so we I want to discuss balloon loans and payments because a lot of times those come into play with poultry loans so in a balloon loan your initial terms for the loan typically the first four years have a relatively manageable payment in fixed interest rate however after the initial three period the loan will become due in one very large balloon payment hence the name for you know this type of loan if you're unable to make the balloon payment then your lender may renew your loan for another balloon mode which would reset your loan terms with a new interest rate and will include some fees however there is no guarantee that your lender will renew your loan after the balloon payment is due balloon loans are riskier or a riskier repayment option so just because you know they have renewed your loan once or twice before does not mean that they will renew it a third time and there's no obligation for them to renew that loan there's no obligation for them to give you the same terms as in your previous balloon note so just keep that in mind when you're considering whether or not you want to take a balloon loan out on your poultry farm now for FSA for guaranteed loans the lenders FSA ranking will influence their application process so under the FSA Lindner rankings you have three different rankings a preferred lender is the highest FSA ranked lender and therefore has the most flexibility in their application process this means they may not require you to go through some of the initial application stages that other lenders would have you be required to do so so a certified lender is the second highest FSA ranked lender and has more flexibility in their application process than a standard lender but less than a preferred them and then standard is the basic FSA ranking and has the least Lex ability in their application process again your local FSA office can come provide a complete list of lenders as well as their FSA lender ranking so the FSA loan application process the application process we've broken down into ten general steps the first one would be to obtain a contract or letter of intent from your integrator if you're not going to you're not going to get a contract from your company there's no reason to apply for financing you then need to consult your company for the proposed housing layout generally your company knows where they want houses to be laid out on your land and they have a very specific idea of it and they'll tell you right away that's important for your environmental pre-screen or assessment so depending on where your houses are going that's going to affect if you need to do a pre-screen or an assessment it's also going to affect whether you need to do in a historic preservation pre-screen or assessment and then whether or not you need to do fish and wildlife review or not now all poultry farmers will be required to submit a concert comprehensive nutrient management plan otherwise known as a waste management plan you're also going to need to submit a plan for your repayment ability and your farm operating plan that's essentially your farm business plan demonstrating how you're going to repay the proposed amounts that you are refunding you also need to submit your security requirement so that's going to be what your collateral be worth and what collateral you are submitting so generally speaking that would be a property assessment something like that and then you'll go through the approval process that's once all your applications have been submitted all documentation now FSA has your complete application and they'll review it and we're going to go on next to what you do if your application is denied or change okay so first we'll cover what to do if your loan is denied or chained because if your loan is approved you move forward with construction and getting into poultry that is pretty straightforward now if your loan is denied you may appeal the decision it's important to note that decisions may be appealed but not regulations Benny do you want to talk and talk speak on that sir and distinguish what does it mean when we say that your decision may not be appealed or your decision may be appealed but not the regulations what the what the rules say is that any adverse decision is appealed and even the FSA said may send you a little bit since it's not a people that is an adverse decision and he self is appeal but in the appeals process you have to argue from what the rules say you can't argue that it rules along and when we say the rules we're specifically saying rule from the Federal Register order statute there are interpretations from their own the agency of interpretation of what the rule says what we have not so let's discuss just an eligibility requirement that was pretty straightforward that may kind of sum this up for example if you put in an in FSA application and you were denied because you are not a US citizen and you are not a legal resident you're here on a visa something of that nature therefore you are ineligible to receive this financing now you would not be able to appeal that decision because the regular the regulation states that you are ineligible is that that that is correct and what you run into that is most of the time that to me is that you would argue were trying to argue that you didn't every decision will have a time specification or that's going to reply in fits just 30 days that's from a regulation hmm and missing that terminates your eligibility and that's into the rules so you that's a regulation you can't they can't change that I'm glad you brought that up Betty because that segues to what we were going to talk about next is what are the steps if you want to appeal your decision and as Benny Ari mentioned those will be time bound so the first one is you may request a reconsideration meeting however you have to make that request within 30 days of receiving your decision letter now at a reconsideration meeting they will look at the decision again and possibly reconsider it in sits a reconsideration meeting here you would present information to explain why you believe the decision was made in error to our earlier example if for example you know you were denied because you're not a US citizen but you are a legal u.s. alien well you can appeal that you can say well I thought that I should be eligible because I am a legal u.s. alien and it says that I am eligible for the loan and then the denying loan officer would you know argue their case on why they denied the file so you can present information as to while something was made in error correct and that goes back to the 30 days also the point the appeals man was the natural fear of division is the agency that handles our Appeals if they will consider the letter will say when you receive they will they will all allow up to seven days normally for May and so you know but you have to when you appeal you have to put the date that you received it they calculate the days from that you know for that 30 days and that's where it becomes regulatory so it's very important that you ensure that you're moving on a any type of denial appeal in a very timely manner and that you also keep track of when mailings were received and when mailing or sent off or when you applied for things so if your decision at your reconsideration mean does not then you have an additional 30 days to request either mediation or to appeal the FSA decision you may only request mediation or appeal the decision not both and you only have 30 days so if you request mediation a neutral mediator will help the two parties review the options and agree on a solution now if you appeal your decision that is where you will appeal to nan the national appeal Division as Benny mentioned and your appeal must be postmarked no later than 30 days following your decision letter so that is your decision letter from your reconsideration meeting not your original decision letter that appeal would be mailed off to national appeal division at the address provided here in cordova tennessee now more options sorry more detailed information will be available in the guide as well as from your local FSA office and important to remember here is that your clocks fuck-you 30-day clock stops when you apply for the mediation but it immediately kicks in when that mediation concludes so you don't have an additional 30 days after mediation it's just the time remaining in the 30 days from when you originally applied for mediation next time thank you also if you find yourself in this situation please feel free to reach out to a farmer aid organization or farmer advocacy organization you can contact us directly at Rafi our contact information will be listed into the presentation but there also may be other organizations in your local region which may be better equipped to assist you okay so an important part of your loan is fulfilling your loan obligations this entire time we've been talking about doing personal assessment before applying and what the application process is like but for most of you you're going to be spending most of your loan life in refilling sorry fulfilling your loan obligations this means that you have been approved for financing you receive the loan now it's time to repay it so depending on the type of loan you're gonna have different responsibilities during the life of that loan of course you have to make sure that you're still making your payments on time and that you're making them in the specified amount but failing to fulfill a loan obligation could lead to a defaulter either monetary or non-monetary and that could result in foreclosure or FSA repossessing the loan collateral so some of the core common borrower obligations are paying any fees required by FSA for a lien search executing loan documents filing or recording financial statements credit checks any other kind of fees maintaining and protecting your collateral this is an important one for poultry farmers because your poultry houses are your collateral a lot of times farmers may think while for poultry houses I'd like to close down to three where it's more manageable and then I will sell off the fourth one for scrap metal if you do that if you change or alter your collateral without prior authorization from FSA or your lender you could be found in non-monetary default that also includes if your your farm is used as collateral and there is timber on your farm cutting the timber without receiving prioritization could lead to a month non-monetary default so make sure that you review your loan documents review your collateral agreement and consult your loan officer before you do anything like that another issue that we see lots of farmers running into paying any and all taxes on your property or so sometimes some guys will let the taxes slide for a little bit and come back and try and pay em but if you don't pay your taxes you may be in non-monetary default and they may be able to foreclose on your farm as a result on another issue is maintaining insurance company on as specified in your FSA loan agreement so you may be required to maintain insurance on your farm your poultry houses farming equipment that may be a certain type of insurance which means their specifications or any of their requirements yeah that's good because they it says you would you would insure it at the collateral they put your particular dangers protecting the collateral so the requirement is that you made any insurers that would place the value of that crap and so a good example of that is a maintaining insurance on your poultry houses we have seen poultry houses burned down before due to electrical fires or lightning any number of reasons and so if you don't have insurance that will ensure that poultry house to the collateral value then you may be nom nom monetary default because you're going to be under collateralized on that long going forward so just keep in mind it is your responsibility to fulfill the loan obligations it's also your responsibility to you know maintain all the other obligations within the loan such as any chickens site inspection or providing any required documentation if your loan for example states that you are required to provide documentation proving your insurance but you haven't done so you could be a non-monetary default even if you have insurance and that's because you did not follow through and provide the insurance as you were required to do so again your loan officer or your FSA age and can answer additional questions about this if you have any and please feel free to ask them also okay so trouble repaying your loan restructuring none of us ever want to get to this point but we know what happens no one happens in farming especially in poultry farm sometimes you're not able to meet your financial obligations so what do you do if you know that you can't make your mortgage payment first if you're having trouble meeting all of your financial obligations that includes everything not just your poultry loan but your poultry loan your personal loans your home mortgage your vehicle loans that kind of thing cons consult your FSA office as soon as possible to seek counseling it's best to do it before you have missed any payments because you will have many more options available to you then after you have missed a payment and if you cannot fulfill all of your debt obligations then you want to go ahead and start contacting those creditors but for farm and personal debts so to check your eligibility for loan restructuring or more restructuring details you would contact your lender if you have a direct loan then FSA's your lender if you have a guaranteed loan then contact the commercial lender your farm credit your local bank whomever is servicing your loan you may need to request a meeting between FSA your lender and yourself and just keep in mind that not all of these restructuring programs will be available to your particular situation but types of restructuring include consolidation rescheduling deferment and interest rate reduction a write down or conservation contract also you may come contact a farmer advocate for financial counseling like someone here at rafi either myself or Benny or another organization who may be working in your state so if you are unable to repay your loan on time you may default if your loan is fully collateralized then the bank or FSA will initiate foreclosure or liquidation proceedings from the time you receive the first default notice you will have a specified amount of time before foreclosure or liquidation will start that default notice will explicitly state how much time you have or it will give you a date in the future to resolve the issues before that date if you receive a default notice please contact an attorney as soon as possible to understand your rights if you're available securities have been liquidated and there is still debt remaining you may be able to seek a debt settlement agreement a debt settlement is a negotiating an agreement between you and your lindo to reduce the overall debt in exchange for a lump sum payment so some important persons to contact as you're working through farming as you're looking for FSA loans or as you may find that you are in financial distress anything of that nature you know contact your local FSA office for lending policy or you know for general questions you can find your state offices listed at the website here fsa.usda.gov slash state offices north carolina specific offices may be found at the link below if you're a farmer in need of financial counseling please feel free to contact Rafi our web site for contract agriculture can be pinned here we work most of the contract poultry farmers or you can contact myself or mr. Benny bunting directly Benny is our lead farmer advocate his telephone number as well as email account here I myself Tyler Whitley and the contract agriculture case manager and my contact information and email can be found here as well we want to take this time to thank you for viewing our presentation and feel free to contact us or your local FSA office if you should have any questions",
