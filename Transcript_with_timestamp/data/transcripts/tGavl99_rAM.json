  "text": "hey folks this josh tarney rich farmer welcome to the farm blog today today we're going to be working with the tractor and the seed drill this is a no-till seed drill made by hey buster and we're going to be busting some hay so we're gonna go out and all these bare spots throughout the field and all the land down here that we just had cleared and you can see it's a whole lot of land where we've got it cleared all down through there we're gonna seed this land okay so we've got fescue rye grass and rye grain and that's what we're going to be putting in here and also medium Ladino clover so come along on the farm vlog today we're gonna have a little bit of fun loading up the hopper will show you how it all works and we'll get out of here and we'll drill some grain we'll drill some grass seed and get this thing started alright let's have some fun [Music] [Applause] guys I put this part in the vlog I was going to cut it out but I just wanted you to see what a struggle it is sometimes just to hook up a piece of equipment and I sped it up right here but it took me nearly ten minutes just to put this pin in you can see what a struggle if you're not strong you really can't do this kind of stuff so I get a lot of flack for having a belly but man you got to be a strong guy to handle this kind of stuff it's it's big equipment really hard alright guys this is called the hey buster okay there are three hoppers on this hey buster won't take you up top and show you that here in just a second but we're gonna walk around first and we'll get it hooked to the tractor okay I'll show you what we have to do here we are at the back of the seed drill here okay these tubes that you're seeing down here is what the seed drops down into okay and we'll show you how all the adjustments work this is the hydraulic setup and these two hydraulic lines right here go straight over here I have some zip ties all set these zip ties down they go right over here into our rear secondary hydraulics okay so we'll give them a little wipe down it's good to have gloves for this and we'll pop our secondary hydraulics loose right there okay now here our hydraulics we don't want our secondaries this is for the front the grapple on the front of the tractor we don't want them flopping around here so that's why we have zip ties so we'll zip tie these guys up to where they'll be in a good safe place out of the way and they won't get pinched ask me how I learned this okay alright guys so here are hydraulic lines and we'll hook those into our rear secondary remotes and all you do is just push them into place and they lock right in just like this okay and they're locked into place now we need to take a look at our Dalek lines now our hydraulic line cannot just be flopping around all over everywhere but we see they've already put some rope on here and the rope is kind of loose so we got to know this is what happens when they flop around everywhere they'll get pinched right inside there so we've got to find a way to support these and once again that's why we need our zip ties so what I learned last time is you got to take care of your hydraulic line so we'll go down here with our zip tie and we'll just zip tie this guy right up here to our three-point hitch thing I forgot what that's called guys tell me what that thing's called I forgot what it was what it's called I know everybody knows what it is so now you can see our hydraulic lines are free-floating but they're not gonna get into anything down here okay next thing we'll show you how to adjust the hoppers okay so there's a step here a step here then you get up on this rail right here okay I'm tall enough that I can reach up here put the lid up when you flip the lid you've got a guide right here that tells you what you're running and tells you what settings to put it on so we put it on setting number eight for fescue and that puts 23 you see the 23 that's 23 pounds per acre and then we have some settings for the spring in the rear and a few more settings to set our depth for the drill and this is the drill part the little blades that you see down there so we'll go right over here and there's a little hand crank there's a little crank and there's a little dial right here and we want to set it on eight by cranking our little crank just like that so here we go cranking it cranking it right there to the eight that's a little above the eight yeah there we go looks good now we'll be putting down some rye grain right there's a rye grain and we want to put the raw grain down we're gonna put it on the number five at 15 okay and that puts 15 pounds to the acre we want to put the Rye grain and the rye grass seed down because it's an annual and it's going to come up really really fast now we're on a hillside right here and this hillside will wash so we want something that's going to hit quick okay hitting quick means it's going to grow it's going to grow quick so it's going to sprout a root within a day a day day and a half that rye grain will and then the ryegrass will follow about four days later and then the fescue will follow about seven to nine to twelve days later so we'll get on our crank right here and we'll start cranking until this guy gets on the five okay it's set wide open 14 right now so actually something's crunching in there Oh looks like we've still got some wheat down in here so that being said we'll find the setting for wheat and we'll set it on what we want the wheat to be ed now I was told when I got this thing that it had some wheat in it did I want the wheat taken out and I said no no we'll just drill it down in two so we'll take the wheat and we'll run around and we'll drill with the wheat just a little bit on some top edges and some really like steep spots now the setting for wheat and we want to dump it out as fast as we can we'll probably put the wheat at and let's just dump it we'll put it up twelve okay we're gonna get rid of that week now the rear hopper is a little bit different it's four clover seed if you look up in there that's for a smaller seed and I'll show you so the seeds are caught by this little gear right here and here's the adjuster you slide that left to right and the gear slides left to right so that's how much it's open however much gear is exposed inside of this tells you how much seed you're gonna have down and we're gonna set it we're gonna take it all the way to zero and we're just gonna barely open it to one right there is the one and it's a dial right there okay we tighten up the little wing nut okay now there's another one we repeat this process right there there's another one on the other side so this is two separate compartments I don't know how that rat got there but that's gross let's talk about the undercarriage let's talk about what we have here okay so this wheel helps to guide this wheel right here rolls along the ground and turns a shaft and that shaft goes up through here and turns everything that's moving in this machine and it also turns an hour meter so right there is well it's not an hour meter it's an acre meter right there it'll tell you ninety-eight revs per acre pretty cool and all these little chains and doodads I'm not going to go into total detail but when it's moving it's moving everything on here is moving these tubes are what the seeds fall through and they fall down through these tubes and they fall down through these tubes it's pretty cool this whole thing has a suspension setup so it goes up and down and follows the con tour of the land so you take these blades right here and they're rubbing each other they're spinning freely they're rubbing each other and on the backside they're open we'll take you around and show you that but they open up the land they drop the seed in and then this little wheel right here comes in and mashes it down so that's a no-till drill and there's the backside okay that's what you see on the backside so it opens the soil drops the seed and then this little wheel presses it down okay so the next step here is we're gonna hop up and we're gonna start dumping grass seed in first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna load up this platform right here with grass seed so let's get busy doing that all right this is our Kentucky 32 fescue it's an end of fight free fescue for cattle pretty cool now we're gonna go up here on the platform and dump in our seed all right up on the platform get our fiscal you up there and basically we're gonna cut our bags open okay so guys this is Kentucky 32 fescue worried about $85 a bag on this there's how many bags four bags in there right now that'll get us a good start and we have one two three four seven more bags that we're going to put out okay this will all even out as we hit bumps and smooth out okay pretty cool now the next hopper we're going to use is going to be our wheat hopper okay so we're going to go ahead and burn through that wheat we're going to take a little bit ride a little bit around here and get these spots that are in the middle of the field first and get that wheat out of there we're also going to load the clover hopper and I'll show you the clover hopper right here will close the week and here's the clover hopper that's what it looks like inside pretty simple will load the clover hopper up and get going with that now the clover cost one hundred and twenty dollars for a 50-pound bag we're doing about twenty-five to thirty acres here that'll totally cover that you might be asking hey why is he putting clover in with his fescue I'm putting clover in with my fescue for the first few years to get it established well clover fixes nitrogen to the soil fescue loves nitrogen we're going to feed that grass seed and then we'll probably go over it with a herbicide to kill the broadleaf at some point maybe we may go organic and we may not use herbicides at all now the reason that I'm putting the clover seed down is because of a man named Joel Salatin he wrote a book called salad bar beef I'll post a link down below if you want to raise your cows on a salad bar it's pretty cool it's interesting book to read and I went up to Polyface farm where Joel's farm is if you've never heard of him then I'm surprised you're on this channel really really cool guy nice place and what I noticed on his farm was lots of clover in the fields the fields were beautiful in green and I think the element that was making them beautiful in green was that clover fixing that nitrogen that's a little bit more difficult to get up here and put your seed in here for your clover okay and I'll show you the clover seed here in a minute the rye grass seed looks a whole lot like just grass the Rye grain is just a little bit smaller than wheat like I everybody knows what wheat looks like but the clover is totally totally different this is what the clover looks like it's little beads so it's a little bit more cumbersome to do the clover get to be real careful these are separate hoppers let's and make sure you get a even amount in each hopper which we do not have but at least we try so it's a good idea to have a like a measuring cup or a glass or a you know a cup or something so you can even it out a little bit and that's what we're gonna do so we're gonna get to drilling okay see you on the tractor guys be sure your butt is always in the seat when you're starting a tractor okay contact okay guys what you're going to see here is this hydraulic cylinder going up taking a little bit of tension off okay now the tension is off and we're going to pull these pins right here well I thought the tension was off we've got a lever on the back of the tractor that raises and lowers by controlling the cylinder right here we're gonna raise it up a little bit okay so we're going to pull this pin right here out comes the pin this little red guy kind of sits out of the way and put our pin back in here make sure it doesn't get gone and then this whole cylinder will lower down to the ground all right I'm gonna lower the cylinder down now what we just did was set these down on the ground and set that wheel in motion that ATV looking tire as that tire rolls it'll start putting seed in the ground pretty cool [Applause] [Music] [Music] just a few more things that you need to know when you're going around a sharp turn with this thing you have to raise it up and then when you start going straight again you lower it back down so you're constantly raising and lowering and checking your hoppers I just check to see if that wheat was gone it's not quite gone yet but probably another 15 minutes of drilling and it'll all be gone I'm gonna go breathe a little bit of dust have some fun so folks we got a lot of work ahead of us and we're gonna say bye from here I appreciate you please come on back and see us on the Stoney Ridge farm click that like button subscribe to the channel please subscribe subscribe if I didn't say it already subscribe we need you here on the star neeraj farm come on back and see us sometime click the like button we'll see you next time here on the stern orig farmer thanks guys see you next time [Music]",
