00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:06,270
hello friends welcome to our

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,400
youtube-channel simpler IV sciences we

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,290
are here with the mission to spread Agri

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,230
Sciences in a simplified manner among

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,109
farmers students and those personals who

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,869
are interested in farming and we will

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,029
begin our ride from the berries focusing

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,029
on how agricultural cultivation

9
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,340
practices changed so far in our country

10
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,619
India with the hope that it will benefit

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,929
you in many ways so let's start this

12
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,910
video and watch it till the end to learn

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:37,190
the impact of Agriculture and spread the

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,190
knowledge as much as possible among us

15
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:42,870
in the agricultural cultivation history

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,960
traces back to Indus Valley Civilisation

17
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:49,079
and it was also evidence to be found in

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,600
some places of southern India cereals

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,750
shrubs fibers were domesticated crop and

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,789
dog goat shape when domesticated animals

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,820
to begin with conventional point

22
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,100
technique mostly used in farming for

23
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:04,140
cultivation practices in Vedic

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,010
literature attic Veda describing about

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,189
plumbing

26
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,439
following irrigation in the field for

27
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,540
cultivation of fruits and vegetables are

28
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:18,360
some proven facts in form of written

29
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:21,150
records of agriculture in India evidence

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,240
suggests that rice and cotton were

31
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,100
cultivated since Indus Valley day it was

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,520
also reported that some archaeologists

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,840
believed that rice was cultivated as

34
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,049
domesticated crop near the ganges river

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,880
banks since 6th millennium before Christ

36
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:42,329
and other crops such as barley oats

37
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,700
wheat lentil chickpea pulses millets

38
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,920
cotton and cocoa butter sheis fruits

39
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,479
were also grown in different parts of

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,670
India plying patterns were taken from

41
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,579
the Bronze Age and this technique was

42
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,280
involved being drawn by two oxen fastin

43
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,549
to the wooden cross base attached to the

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,159
plough to pull together traditional

45
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,590
agricultural implements used mostly at

46
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,500
the time made of bronze namely

47
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,020
sickle 101 which are still used by many

48
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:17,400
farmers now

49
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:20,040
bamboo sieves Witter and X more than

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,370
2,000 years ago Indian farmers begin

51
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,680
growing many spices and sugarcane crop

52
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,960
and spreading of sugarcane cultivation

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,340
took place when Macedonian soldiers

54
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,650
carried Reed's

55
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,700
or tall grasses which were honey bearing

56
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,040
on their return journey and process to

57
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,050
produce these sugar crystals were

58
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,700
invented by the period 500 this now as

59
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,800
clear as it is that agriculture is the

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,870
backbone of our country's economy and

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,209
depending on the three factors such as

62
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,580
climate technological development and

63
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:56,100
social culture practices cultivation

64
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,500
methods also changed quite significantly

65
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:02,459
now farming at present can be of

66
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,740
subsistence and commercial depth under

67
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,080
subsistence type shifting cultivation

68
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,480
which is also known as slash-and-burn is

69
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,120
still practiced by many farmers to grow

70
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,640
cereals and other food crops it is a

71
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,040
system which involves shifting from one

72
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,130
plot to another by abandoning the former

73
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,280
after exhausting it and let it revert

74
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,080
its natural vegetation the purpose of

75
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,870
such kind is to allow natural

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,239
replenishment of soil fertility

77
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,010
following natural processes

78
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,320
now this farming practice is known with

79
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,840
different names in various regions of

80
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,140
the country and in other countries as

81
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,470
well

82
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:43,170
for example zooming in northeastern

83
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,480
states deeper inside this grid district

84
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:48,780
and under Magna cover Island they were

85
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,150
in multiple dish odo in anther British

86
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,080
and in other countries like Mexico and

87
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:59,330
Central America it is known as milpa

88
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,330
Roca in Brazil and another in Indonesia

89
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:06,950
even today some primitive tools like how

90
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:09,650
thou sticks community Labor's on wage

91
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:12,650
basis are used in agricultural practices

92
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:14,569
on small batch of plants although such

93
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,310
farming is entirely dependent on monsoon

94
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:18,859
season soil fertility and other

95
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,980
environmental conditions that favor crop

96
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,810
growth

97
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,389
India has three cropping seasons namely

98
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,340
the behave and Zayn and crops are sown

99
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,850
accordingly in different time of the

100
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,110
year

101
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:34,479
now Rabi crops such as wheat barley

102
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,460
chickpea peas mustard

103
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,590
they are sown in winter from October to

104
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,080
November and harvested in summer from

105
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,150
March to eppley and they are predominant

106
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,790
in Indian states like Punjab Haryana

107
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,520
Himachal Pradesh with the Pradesh Jammu

108
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:52,760
and Kashmir no.3 Condor on the other

109
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,710
hand Karif crops like rice millet maize

110
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,350
green drum like them and so on

111
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:00,560
are sown with onset of monsoon and

112
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,419
harvested in September to October they

113
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,360
are predominantly cultivated in states

114
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:08,360
like Odisha Rajasthan Andhra Pradesh

115
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,240
Telangana Maharashtra Tamina with

116
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,880
spangled and Kerala the third seasons a

117
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,220
crops like cucumber watermelon musk

118
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,630
melon pumpkin and bitter gourd are sown

119
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,300
in between Ravi and curry

120
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:24,380
during summer for instance in February

121
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,180
to march or March to July now Indian

122
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,000
villages witnessed tremendous

123
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,890
transformation of Agriculture from

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,630
self-sufficient production to commercial

125
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,300
production with extensive services

126
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,190
through commercial farming commercial

127
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,380
output provided by agricultural

128
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,990
practices involved mostly about raising

129
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,820
crops in large scales or estates and

130
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,210
shipping of the produce to other

131
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:49,310
countries for monetization thinly

132
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,479
populated states like Tamil Nadu Punjab

133
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,640
Haryana Gujarat

134
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,310
have adapted the commercial farming

135
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,110
system for plantation already and main

136
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:01,460
crops grown for the purpose are with

137
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:03,260
maize cotton and sugar cane so

138
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,539
commercial farming is of two types

139
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,700
namely intensive commercial farming

140
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:10,580
which requires large amounts of capital

141
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,720
or labor with relatively smaller areas

142
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,310
of land and another is a

143
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,410
tensive commercial farming which

144
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,840
requires investment of small amounts of

145
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:23,820
capital and labor with relatively large

146
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:26,760
areas of land farmers of India still

147
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:29,070
have skeptical views when it comes to

148
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,930
adapting new scientific technologies to

149
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:34,110
grow their crop in present situation

150
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,810
they have grown a mixed attitude towards

151
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,610
farming technologies which is evidenced

152
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,460
by growing of new plant varieties

153
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,730
alongside 30 to 50 year old varieties

154
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,560
adjacent to the field area while owning

155
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:50,130
mobile phones to check regularly about

156
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,690
crop prices but fail to pay attention to

157
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,820
the necessary information about best

158
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:57,390
methods to grow their crop for higher

159
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:00,000
yield here we can possibly interpret the

160
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:02,250
reluctance of adopting new technology

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,290
pointing at first that less emphasis

162
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,960
have been given to the communication of

163
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,790
science to the farmers second deformed

164
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,430
ways to promote the adoption of new

165
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,280
technology another barrier is dead

166
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:17,010
sometimes farmers interest does not meet

167
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,770
i - i with scientists or technical

168
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:22,500
person soil test results for which we

169
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:27,600
see varied range of prices in case of

170
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:29,550
macro and micro nutrients unfortunately

171
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,860
in most parts of the country covering

172
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,890
mostly the rural areas the poor still

173
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,800
indicate that approximately 45% and 26%

174
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:40,010
women and men respectively are

175
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,620
illiterate and unaware of even the basic

176
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:47,060
economics all the government took step

177
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,530
to form fine policy tool in terms of

178
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,990
incentives or subsidies to promote new

179
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:54,380
agricultural technologies in India for

180
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,840
example higher yield seed varieties

181
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:00,330
advanced instruments and developed

182
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,720
machineries irrespective of the attempt

183
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,500
it is associated with pros and cons as

184
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,540
companies draw some unnecessary

185
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,440
additional features to the product for

186
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:12,440
profit maximization here in view of this

187
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,850
all effective and more simplified

188
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,950
scientific communication to the farmers

189
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,560
and tweaking policies at certain level

190
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,840
good perhaps reflects some different

191
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,700
picture on the overall obstacles the

192
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,409
strategies however to increase the crop

193
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,749
yield and spread of Agriculture

194
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:29,399
education could boost of the economic

195
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:32,459
growth of the country in an exponential

196
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:35,129
manner the new strategies if adopted may

197
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:37,919
change the scenario for example use of

198
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:41,219
improved seed varieties stronghold on

199
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,060
land ownership crop rotation irrigation

200
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:47,189
methods such as drip irrigation and

201
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,860
sprinkler irrigation and appropriate use

202
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:51,810
of farm machinery x' improve package and

203
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,139
practices protective measures for

204
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:57,449
pathogen and insect attacks to make

205
00:08:55,139 --> 00:09:00,839
farming profitable increase in minimum

206
00:08:57,449 --> 00:09:02,850
support prices may 8 to 9 to 5 percent

207
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:05,430
cost Rotem now this perhaps will trigger

208
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:08,279
the indian farmers to invest more in

209
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,829
agriculture small holder farmers with

210
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:12,720
their entrepreneurial strategies could

211
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:15,420
be encouraged to invest in their farms

212
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,370
and turn their image around for

213
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,519
agricultural growth status of the

214
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:23,069
country as they own more than 80 percent

215
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:26,939
of the total farming land and 50% of

216
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:29,009
livestock in India but due to low

217
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:32,100
produce low productivity and market

218
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:34,529
pricing status they do not receive what

219
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:38,220
is expected and thus discouraging fact

220
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:41,339
to invest in Fernie however a market

221
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,680
with price transparency new land leasing

222
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,019
laws and investments in life stocks

223
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,069
could encourage the smallholder farmers

224
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:52,019
to invest with enthusiasm so presently

225
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:53,610
we see there is a wave of organic food

226
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:57,060
consumption to build a better health

227
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,889
thus sustainable farming movement can

228
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,800
set the opportunity for a bright future

229
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,600
of agricultural cultivation all the

230
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,199
organic movement started long back in

231
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,779
1921 and the pioneering work promulgated

232
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:11,939
by Albert Howard who is known as a

233
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,779
father of organic farming and his wife

234
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:16,050
Gabrielle

235
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,970
Howard when in early 1900 scientists who

236
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,730
are seeking for solution for the side

237
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,730
effects of the toxic chemicals entering

238
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:28,620
the food supply and certainly declining

239
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:30,959
the overall natural soil fertility but

240
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,870
current era people have already realized

241
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,759
another aware about how consumption of

242
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,949
junk foods causing greater ill effects

243
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,940
on their health and thus causing

244
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:41,070
lifestyle diseases

245
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,860
especially who are residing in the urban

246
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:46,080
cities general awareness from national

247
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,880
and international exposure helping

248
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,650
people to take steps avoid such

249
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,950
lifestyle diseases by switching into

250
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:55,260
organ in deaths so certified organic

251
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,770
foods ensuring growth of organic market

252
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:01,710
under the influence of scrutiny and

253
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:03,570
regulations since past few years organic

254
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,580
farming has witnessed a tremendous

255
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,890
development almost in every crop type

256
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:11,130
due to the general awareness of the

257
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:14,130
end-users for healthy foods and also

258
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,710
environmental safety it is reported

259
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,770
according to w-h-o the organic food

260
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:22,800
market is around 37 billion dollars at

261
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,780
present already so it is to be believed

262
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,070
that health-conscious end-users will

263
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:29,460
promote the growth of organic

264
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:31,950
agriculture sector in future India so

265
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,500
