  "text": "[Music] stockpiling tall fescue for winter grazing is definitely the most economical feeding strategy for cow calf operations in kentucky but we're always going to need a little bit of hay in our feeding operation and it's important to understand the quality of the hay that you're feeding when you understand the quality of the hay you're feeding you can supplement that hay so that you don't lose condition on your cows now when we sample hay we need to sample it by a lot and a lot is one field and one harvest of hay so say for example field a cutting first cutting would be one lot of hay that needs to be sampled separately from say the second cutting from that field or the third cutting from that field or the first cutting from another field so we sample by the lot that's really important and the second thing that's really important is that we get a good sample and we do that by using a coring tool so we don't want to just take a piece of hand pull it out of the sample and send it in for pull it out of the bale and send it in for analysis we want to actually take a bale core and when we sample a lot we'd like to get somewhere between 15 and 20 cores per halot and then we composite those samples together mix them up and send the whole sample in for analysis and i'll show you why we want to send the whole sample in in a minute after we core a few bales so it's important when we're sampling hay that we use a probe to sample the hay with for round bales we want to sample hay from the side and for rectangular bales large square barrels or small square bells we want to sample the bales from the end and again we want to get 20 cores per lot and then submit all those cores to the lab and do not separate them into a smaller size sample one of the important things to remember when we take a heat sample is that we want to submit the whole sample so never subdivide it you want the lab to grind the whole sample and the reason why is if you look at the bottom there's lots of little fine material at the bottom when we separate it we often grab just this coarse material and that really changes the quality analysis of this forage so it's important to submit the whole sample and let them grind it into a homogenous size and then they can subdivide it at the lab all right so once we get the sample taken out in the field it will come into the lab and then we will dry the sample overnight so the procedure for doing that is that we take the sample from our our bag from the field and we transfer preferred into a paper sack and we want to make sure we get the whole sample in there and that we don't miss any of the fine material in the bottom of the bag okay once we get the sample in here we'll weigh it on the scale and we'll record what we call the fresh weight on the bag so this sample weighs 49.9 grams [Applause] we'll just write that right on our bag okay once we get the sample weighed we'll place that sample in the dryer overnight the dryer is set to around 55 degrees celsius which would be the equivalent of about 130 degrees and we'll dry it overnight now drive any remaining moisture in that sample off and we'll be able to determine the driveway of the sample the reason that we need the dry matter on the sample is that all the rations are balanced on the dry matter basis all right it's been overnight and we're getting the sample out again and we're going to re-weigh it to determine the dry matter all right so once we get the dry weight on this we'll copy the dryer weight down and record it on our data sheet all right now we're going to head up to the grinding uh facility and we're going to grind this sample to get it ready for forage quality analysis all right so we've got our sample that we've dried overnight in the lab and we're ready to grind it at this point in time so we use a two stage grinding process we grind through a wiley mill through a two millimeter screen first and then we'll grind through a second grinder called a ud cyclone sample mill for our second stage of grinding i'm going to open this up any things that are left we'll put in this okay and then we'll undo this sample collection bottle and just dump that in there and now we have a pretty homogeneous sample so instead of having a lot of large particles and small particles it's pretty much all two millimeters or less okay so we're now going to grind through a ud cyclum sample mill and this is the second grinder this has a one millimeter screen in it so we're going to go ahead and turn this on [Music] so we've ground it through the ud cyclum sample mill now we're going to transfer that ground sample which is very fine almost like a powder now into our sample bag okay the goal of the grinding process is to go from a heterogeneous sample so a sample with large and small pieces in it to a very homogeneous sample and that's what we've done here you can see that all the particles are now about the same size and here less than one millimeter all right so we started with a hay bale and we used a hayprobe to get a cord sample we took that cord sample into the lab we weighed it dried it and re-weighed it and then we went up to our grinding facility and we ground that sample through a two-stage grinding process and we ended up with this which is essentially the hay but in a powder form now we're ready to analyze this hay for forage quality and we're going to use a technique called near-infrared spectroscopy and what we do is we take a cell we call these ring cups it has a quartz glass in the bottom and we dump that sample into this cell then we put a foam back in there just to hold that forged tight against the glass and we just brush the excess forged dust off of there and we're ready to take this to the near furred spectrophotometer and analyze it all right about 80 percent of the samples that are analyzed for forage quality in the united states are analyzed using a technology called near infrared spectroscopy and essentially what the near infrared spectrophotometer does is it takes light and it shines light in the near infrared spectrum onto the sample and then it measures what gets reflected back and then we can correlate what gets reflected back to different forage quality parameters very precisely for example crude protein acid detergent fiber neutral detergent fiber digestibility and so forth so right now we're ready to analyze this sample so we're going to go ahead and put the sample into the machine and then we'll come up here and hit scan so now we have the sample scanned we need to go in and predict that sample using a an equation that's maintained by the near infrared spectroscopy consortium so it's an equation that's based on wet chemistry and then reference back to the near infrared spectrum so these are the results so in this file we have 12 samples the the 13 samples the 13 sample is a sample that we just scanned and each one of these windows is different this is dry matter we've got 91 almost 92 percent dry matter in this particular sample we can go down to crude protein we've got about 11 and a half percent crude protein in this sample and we have a whole bunch of different constituents on this list that we can look at and find out their digestibility or um or fiber content now we've got our sample taken and we send it into the lab and we got our results back now the hay sampling is really worthless unless we actually do something with those results so what we want to do is we want to use those results to help us manage our hay feeding program and so what we get back we'll get an estimate of energy and an estimate of crude protein and then a dry matter value for each one of those samples and we can take that information and put it into what we call the uk cow forage supplement tool and what this is is is a way that we can figure out how much of a supplement we may or may not need to feed with that particular lot of hay so what to use this we need the dry matter of the hay we need the crude protein value the neutral detergent fiber that's an estimate of how much of that hay the animal can actually eat and then we need an estimate of the energy and that's total digestible nutrients and those will all be on your your hay results when you get it back from the forged testing lab and then the last thing we need to know is a stage of production of the of the cow is she lactating with a calf or is she dry if we have that information we can put that into the supplement tool which is available online or you can go to your extension office and your extension agent can help you with it and i've got a couple examples here so in this particular example we've got a hay lot that has 8.6 crude protein that's a pretty pretty low crude protein and it's got an energy value or a tdn value of 53 so that's pretty low also so this is definitely going to need some supplement when we put this information in our hay supplementation tool it spits out a a number of different supplements and how much of each one of those supplements we would need to feed to meet the requirements of a lactating brood cow so for example uh if we were going to feed soybean hulls we'd have to feed the hay as much as it could eat plus 10.6 pounds of soybean holes per day for this particular hay lot now keep in mind this hay was a pretty low low quality hay the second halo i just wanted to mention to you was was a much higher quality hay lot we had a crude protein concentration of over 12 percent which should meet the crude protein requirements of a lactating brew cow and then we had an energy or a tdn value of around 58.7 per percent uh the requirement would be around 60 percent for a lactating brood capsule just a little bit low in energy and as a result of the higher hay quality instead of having to feed 10.6 pounds of soybean holes we would only need to feed around two pounds of soybean holes for this particular lot of hay to keep to supply the nutrients that a lactating brew cow needs",
