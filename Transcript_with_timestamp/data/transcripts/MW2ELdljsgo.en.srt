00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:10,539
[Music]

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:19,109
good morning we're actually going to

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,880
hear Ali bellow I guess as you know

4
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,070
here's this tension we used you see this

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,510
is just always old fits board it always

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,550
did everything it needed for Elsa kept

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,439
her in a barrier kept me away now Ali

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,810
will go in and but Ali gets a little

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,110
crazy so we're gonna beat this up that

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,190
way it is ready for her to go buckle out

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,440
in here because most time we're not

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,290
we're not putting her in and locking her

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,370
down we're fixing to start because her

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,450
stands and training spend to get a

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,980
little bit longer a little bit more

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,289
intense because she's getting closer to

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,910
having a calf so we need to make sure

18
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,520
she is ready so we're going to go ahead

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,960
and put the crossbar in to pull her

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,180
close to us like we had in the other

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,949
stanchion also we're going to beat these

22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,960
up a little bit to where once we wrap up

23
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,940
and put a chain around them she can't

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,710
get out of them and then this backboard

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,860
right here which is just old fence post

26
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,369
or a fencing she said oh really one by

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,810
six

28
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,729
we're gonna go ahead and beef up put a

29
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:14,189
2x4 here and get it real tight on her

30
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:16,530
that way she will be she'll be tough but

31
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,509
she can't jump out and break it down

32
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,210
like like she could with this little

33
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,369
board so I don't think she knows what's

34
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,369
in store for me okay so you see I put a

35
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,009
bolt in my bolt it on this side just got

36
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,950
a simple hook another bolt to this 2x4

37
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,920
now what I'm gonna do is take this 2x4

38
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,479
and use it like it's supposed to be used

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,780
and basically I'll pull it in with a

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,369
chain against her rear end I there and

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,579
that way it keeps her very close to me

42
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,380
where she can't move also when dealing

43
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,720
with that I'm gonna take this take that

44
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,340
to before and brace it right here to

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,590
where it keeps her tight against me too

46
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,350
so that way she's encapsulated with

47
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,960
really 2x4 is more than just the look of

48
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,549
a stanchion this tension is beefed up up

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,369
top but I never really beefed it up cuz

50
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,600
I never had to but now was like I said

51
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,560
with Ali and kind of training her a

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,689
little bit more and she's a little bit

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,700
more stubborn and bullheaded I'm gonna

54
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,830
just kind of beef it up but so I've got

55
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,590
this start as you see got that the end

56
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,110
we're gonna go ahead

57
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,290
to the other side put the bolt on it

58
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,400
over here and then finish up right here

59
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,220
and then that way I'm gonna get her in

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,470
let her let you see me go ahead and do

61
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:26,739
extension training on her and then that

62
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:30,610
way we'll kind of get her prepared okay

63
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:33,630
so I got it done this bar up I did

64
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:37,150
secure it in we put this extra

65
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,160
heavier-duty clamp here what we'll do is

66
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:42,160
have this swing this is just hang like

67
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,860
this until she gets in once she gets in

68
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,799
I just unlatch this you'll drop this

69
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:52,030
chain and then I'll just put this here

70
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:52,959
and let it on right there so it's not

71
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,190
gonna be hard

72
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,230
we're just gonna see if this will work

73
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,670
I'm gonna put her in it and I'm so not

74
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,620
stress her out but just kind of leave

75
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,319
her in here especially for foods done

76
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,880
and see if she can still get out we're

77
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,410
trying to get to where she really can't

78
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,790
get out well you got that you know the

79
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,090
feets tension I've never really had to

80
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,590
close it for Elsa I am gonna close it on

81
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,840
Ali's head just because the horns I

82
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,340
don't want to try to warn me so I've got

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,410
a chain to go around that too so let's

84
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,120
let's see if we can get her in I'll let

85
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,560
her do some training let her just eat

86
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,570
and kind of calm down and I'm trying to

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,140
lock her in and see if it makes a

88
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,250
difference

89
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:29,880
Hickory I see if we can get her over

90
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,880
getting ready to go

91
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:47,709
I'll be a lot more alright so there we

92
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,709
go a little bit

93
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,920
okay hey there we go alright so you see

94
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:06,120
how we got our tighter they say see how

95
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,709
we got her tighter she can't really move

96
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,109
so that's how we got the stitching going

97
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,370
now we're gonna work on a little stanton

98
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:15,010
training this is how we've been doing

99
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:17,739
Ally and this is how we kind of keep her

100
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,859
from from actually I'm trying to keep me

101
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:23,169
so Athens won't go get a towel and also

102
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:24,550
get some apple cider vinegar spray and

103
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,380
we'll go ahead and least get a little

104
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,449
training done and try to rub on her a

105
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,550
little bit you know the main thing is

106
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:31,990
letting her feel like she's comfortable

107
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,970
so when the kids are here petting her

108
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,000
and we're just talking around her we've

109
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,349
ran the pump around her I felt all over

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,360
but every time she kicks I'll give her a

111
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:42,400
good pop on my hind leg and that

112
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,419
teachers are know so she's done really

113
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,500
good I mean she really has but you know

114
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,449
standing here for five minutes eating

115
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,849
that's not locked in so now I'm gonna

116
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:54,220
stand here maybe 30 or 40 minutes locked

117
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:56,830
in with that our calf being the one in

118
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,539
milker we'll see how that goes but again

119
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,310
training is all part of getting hurt

120
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:02,169
broken in so Amy's gonna get that stuff

121
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,150
and we'll go and see if we can spray a

122
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:06,070
little bit show you how we have been

123
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,990
breaking her and Sam just gonna work

124
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,310
hopefully when she has this Dam all

125
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,470
right so this is typically how we mail

126
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,090
again she's she's a lot smaller than

127
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,620
Elsa now you see she's got her leg

128
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,690
behind her I don't know why she's stand

129
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,760
like that we have been working with her

130
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,560
so I'll grab her like I do Elsa and

131
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,690
she'll move her leg back now never seen

132
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,550
her like go behind her so that's a new

133
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,080
trick so we'll see how she does when I

134
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,060
try to feel owner you see that she's not

135
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,430
kicking me yet she used to keep me but

136
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,650
you are close she does have good feed I

137
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,300
don't feed her unless I'm stationed

138
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,550
training her so she sees this a treat

139
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,880
again apple cider vendor here's what we

140
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:47,070
used to make sure the cow gets covered

141
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:49,320
and cleaned off we want to train her

142
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,220
like we were just now moving her so

143
00:05:49,320 --> 00:06:03,000
she's kind of see she trying to just

144
00:05:52,220 --> 00:06:04,500
come on say Scrabble right there and

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,240
show using a judge she may do it again

146
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,460
cuz she's still trying to work on

147
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,500
training you say yeah I'm just trying to

148
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,500
just get her used to me to fill in older

149
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,680
she's doing goodness she do you never

150
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,470
never get comfortable even with the

151
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,910
calots you've been training for a while

152
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,340
unless you are you're comfortable with

153
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,860
her milking for even a year or two as uh

154
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,690
Elsa I'm comfortable with but just

155
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,640
because she's been milking almost a year

156
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,620
I don't want to ever think that that

157
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,380
eight eight nine hundred thousand pound

158
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,240
cow can I you know hurt me well this

159
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,520
one's smaller but she's even more feisty

160
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,830
and she's not used to milk and I want to

161
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,090
make sure she's comfortable and the last

162
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,940
thing I'll do is just trust her I put my

163
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:47,130
head down here and try to get her I try

164
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,210
to just trust her that way so we're just

165
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,400
gonna do a little bit more training

166
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:55,110
stand here eat let me just kind of mess

167
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,890
with her as if I was fish no milker none

168
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,110
any bond

169
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,610
it's just loosely around her neck so it

170
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,350
makes her feel like she's she's there

171
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,640
but it's not where she is choking or

172
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,940
anything like that you've got plenty of

173
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,110
room ally getting petted by Ellie Ellie

174
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,330
be careful baby

175
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:12,000
so she's fighting her again she's been

176
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:15,120
training good there's always remember if

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,620
she decides to try to keep pop it right

178
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,820
here now she hadn't done it so it won't

179
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,770
pop I won't hurt just know that she's

180
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,630
doing a really good job but I'll give

181
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,150
her if she does good on my kid girl good

182
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:26,550
job and I just love owner rubber belly

183
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,710
and just kind of let her know that I she

184
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,270
has done a great job but there's a

185
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,590
different command than where she starts

186
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,340
to try to kick me or tries to put her

187
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,320
leg in front

188
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,990
I'll give her a gentle pop here if she

189
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,030
doesn't do it then I'll grab back here

190
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,920
and then that way she knows I'm trying

191
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,020
to teach her that's two commands I do

192
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,000
with her now your kill may be different

193
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,410
and you may have different ways to train

194
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,080
your cow but the main thing is you want

195
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,070
to be able to say a command and she

196
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,130
knows what you're talking about like I

197
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:55,260
can say two or three commands with with

198
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,790
Elsa and she knows I don't like her

199
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,890
using the restroom intention and she's

200
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,200
learned that I can say and she will not

201
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,010
do it until she's done but it's because

202
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,050
I've just steady trained her

203
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,700
same way if else is not close enough I

204
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,620
can grab her just like I'm trying to

205
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,480
teach Ali back here just kind of barely

206
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,780
touch her and she'll notice step over

207
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,950
now with Ali I've got her tight to me so

208
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,200
she don't have to worry about trying to

209
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,640
step over however what we're trying to

210
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,290
do with her is just make sure she can

211
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,240
move her leg back so you see how she's

212
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,800
standing it's perfect for me that's

213
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,740
exactly how I want her to stand with

214
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,330
that left leg back just a little bit so

215
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,190
that way I can get either at a hand milk

216
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,660
or put a pump owner and that way she

217
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,770
mean she's doing really good

218
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:40,120
how much do you sense and train you need

219
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:42,460
to have your cow way before she has her

220
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,690
baby if she's not used to you she's not

221
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,880
gonna be used to estancia she's not

222
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,450
gonna be used to you hand milking even

223
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,220
even Elsa who was a a milk cow and

224
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,770
milked for a long time at a milk barn

225
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,600
local milk Marne she still took hurt a

226
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,210
long time just to get used to us now

227
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,770
she's used to us but still you want to

228
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,850
make sure that you have your cow you

229
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,070
love with your cap she gets to know

230
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,440
y'all just to know you she knows your

231
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,820
commands and then that way you know when

232
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,890
she's ready to start extension training

233
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,220
now say she's getting ready to have a

234
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:14,590
cat well I started extensive training in

235
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,030
alle pride about three four months ago

236
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,100
halfway through a pregnancy because I

237
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:19,900
want her to get used to it the only time

238
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,450
she gets feed and all this good sweet

239
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,300
food and all this very pellets is only

240
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,910
when she comes in the stanchion there's

241
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:31,720
times you can ask a a you can vouch for

242
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:33,010
me hey that's we would not feed her and

243
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,720
all sudden she's walking the stanchion

244
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,820
walk right back out well she didn't get

245
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,880
any feed that day so we're teaching her

246
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,950
this is a treat only when you come in to

247
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,140
get milked and when you're good if she

248
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,810
starts kicking and she wouldn't abide to

249
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,950
the stanchion room we would not keep her

250
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,660
in here and she would do we take her

251
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,070
feet away and that way she new for the

252
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,230
day she messed up and she don't want to

253
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:56,790
do that look at this her real right here

254
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:59,680
she's so big with this calf that she is

255
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,600
like poking out on the ribs so I think

256
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,660
she's doing good what what do you think

257
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,460
I think she's gonna do she might

258
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,710
surprise this and they better than I

259
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:13,030
think as long as she's eaten she'll let

260
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:13,600
you do anything you want to so um so

261
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,630
it's like

262
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,610
she's done great I mean we won't know

263
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,740
until all the time gets here but I think

264
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,120
the more that we keep working with her

265
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,100
the better she's gonna do of course

266
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,019
right four months ago I couldn't even

267
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,870
touch her here she'd run out of things

268
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:32,410
she has those horns which is one of her

269
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,899
big things where she's just she's not

270
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:38,110
natured as much like Elsa which was one

271
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:40,240
of our concerns they also just she don't

272
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,360
care what you did to her Ali's a little

273
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,480
bit different so training Ali it was

274
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,050
very important and see we've already

275
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,449
bought a calf halter and we're gonna

276
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:56,050
wrap it around here before she is an eye

277
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:58,180
view of her cow her cab that will also

278
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,100
let help her milk come out okay bro

279
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,959
we're dealing with her jerseys are

280
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,089
notorious for holding back their milk

281
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:06,850
for their calf which is where their

282
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:08,920
cream is so the more they hold back the

283
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,750
more cream we won't get so we're gonna

284
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,759
put that cap right there in front of her

285
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,160
where she knows how important it is to

286
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,509
let her let her fool milk down we're not

287
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,779
gonna be over fully out like we would

288
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:23,769
Elsa because we won't hurt get good and

289
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:25,480
fed good she is put on some weight for

290
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:27,639
this cash she's not normally this big at

291
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,130
all so but she's doing really good I'm

292
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:31,959
very pleased with her um again part of

293
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,339
statue training is making making sure

294
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:36,220
you're getting comfortable with a cow

295
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:38,259
but more than that the cow getting

296
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,990
comfortable with you she needs to know

297
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:42,939
your commands if a pop right here is

298
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,310
what teaches our cows that that's wrong

299
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:47,560
that's what she needs to know if a

300
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,120
grabbing her here teaches her that's

301
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,459
what we need when we want her leg moved

302
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,380
that's what she needs to know if we know

303
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:54,459
aunt is a bad command when she's trying

304
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,230
to do things she shouldn't be doing like

305
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:58,779
pulling away from the top here the V

306
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,069
then she needs to know but she won't

307
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:01,870
know that if you had trained her over

308
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:04,540
the last few weeks or months cows are

309
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,970
not don't know they can be stubborn but

310
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,470
they're not dumb so learn to give them

311
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,329
treats just like you would a dog or any

312
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,310
other animals at the same time make sure

313
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,170
you're rewarding them taking care of

314
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,269
them and they'll take care of you

315
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,020
hope this video is a good old video

316
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,300

317
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,690

318
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,830
