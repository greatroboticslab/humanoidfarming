  "text": "so here I am with my wisteria vine I love this fine because wisterias will bloom if they get very little water very little fertilizer but they do need sun now the fragrance is intoxicating and a lot of people ask about when to prune wisteria pruning after blooming but I want to introduce you to another vine that will flower in part shade or even a mostly shaded situation and it is called a cobija so come with me we're going to meet a key be divine okay so this is a key via this one is called the chocolate a cobija because it smells as sweet as chocolate I love this vine it has very intricate blooms and has a very very long bloom time this fine starts blooming Oh probably around April and will bloom up until probably close to June so here is a nice advantage of a cobija vine you can take your pruning clippers and when it's in most beautiful bloom it smells the sweetest that's when you go out and you remove some of the dead foliage because a cobija vine in the northwest is semi evergreen so you can see the new foal just nice and green and healthy but right up here these are the leaves that are larger because they've been on the plant all year and they've got you a little bit of winter damage and so it's nice just to be able to come in break those off and because this vine is already covering the structure when I see these these tendrils that are you know big and long and shooting up straight up they're easy to just break off as well and that's form of pruning as well so this is a vine that you can clean up and proved right when it's in flour and then that way it controls the size of the vine so a key be mine a great flowering vine for a semi shaded location",
