  "text": "florida is a state where most people go to the supermarket to buy their food but they don't realize that they can grow most of their food right at home today i'm really excited to have pete canaris on the channel and he's going to introduce you to 10 different plants that you can grow that are super abundant and resilient for the florida climate to help you grow a large amount of your food at home and be able to skip those trips to the grocery store this doesn't just apply to florida though semi-tropical climates exist around the world the caribbean central and south america southeast asia parts of africa and parts of australia just to name some places are all places where this can be a super helpful video to you all right what's up guys what's going on so pete canaris here with green dreams and i'm coming at you from tampa florida i'm about 20 miles north of tampa and we're growing into some tropical environment here in 9b and i'm taking over rob greenfield's channel today so i'm putting together a video together for you all on our top 10 food crops to grow into some tropical environment for self-sufficiency and these are the top 10 go-to food crops that are super easy to grow and something i'll tell you guys is well you know we focused on plants that thrive on neglect that grow with ease most of these crops are perennial crops and by perennial i mean something that doesn't need to be replanted every year like you would an annual this is a plant at one time and typically forget it you know so perennial crops are crops that live two or more years so the first one i want to talk to you guys about is actually right here behind me this is just over my left shoulder this is chaya or tree spinach and you can see the big giant leaves off of this tree and this is a really easy one to get going or established in your garden this is one that i tell people about all the time and the first thing that kind of scares them about this one is it has to be cooked so chaya does need to be cooked for about 10 minutes there's an off gas of cyanide that comes off of there you definitely don't want to use an aluminum pot but this is a staple crop this is a real big time staple crop in like central america this is a really easy one to propagate and start so you know if you wanted to share this one with your friends you would simply take a cutting like this stick it in the ground take off the leaves and it'll start growing it's really that easy the leaves from this are actually quite delicious i find this tree to be really really the flavor of the leaves to kind of be like a hearty you know they're really filling they go really well in a soup really well in a dish also known as tree spinach this is four times as nutritious than typical spinach and it wants to grow here it wants to grow here through our hot summer our humidity and our full sun the number two plant i want to talk to you guys about that is a must-have for your garden is sitting here behind me and this is moringa olafera this one really likes full sun if you noticed i had that chaya kind of in a dappled light understory situation this one wants to be out in full sun and i look at this tree as like having a health food store in your backyard this one is like 22 protein by weight 68 different antioxidants four times the calcium of milk i could go off about all the different minerals and nutrients that are inside of this plant this one is literally um one of the fastest growing trees we also have on the farm so commercially they grow these trees about a foot apart and they prune off the new growth every week most commonly you would dry those leaves and powder them but you can put this fresh into a salad you could put this fresh into a smoothie you can eat this fresh like this the tree is also known as the horseradish tree and that's because the leaves can be a little bit on the spicy side i prefer this as a supplement i prefer this in a smoothie i find it to be a little bit on the strong side but it grows so well it is so nutritious like the powder from this tree goes for 30 40. i remember when it was 60 dollars a pound so super nutritious my number three muscro cop for florida um would be what rob would like to call yucca or cassava or maniac we got a lot of comments on that one from the videos we did together this is a must-grow crop super easy to grow crop down here in florida and this is um you know what they would make tapioca pudding from so cassava is a root crop and it's really easy to get started in the garden it's one that you literally just like i showed you on the chaya you take a cutting of so probably something a little bit older than this you want like three notes above three nodes below the soil you just stick this guy in the ground it'll grow usually cassava's about an eight to nine month crop you'll get a root crop off of that and i just did a specific video on cassava on cooking it on harvesting it on growing select varieties with my good friend josh from heart so if you want more detail on that head over to my channel and you'll see a little bit more specific stuff with josh how they cook it how they prepare it i had cassava bread while i was there i mean there's many different ways to eat this cassava must grow it the third crop i want to talk to you about today are sweet potatoes and you know many people when you think sweet potato you think that typical just orange sweet potato but there's hundreds of heirloom varieties of sweet potato there are white sweet potatoes purple sweet potatoes regular typical orange sweet potatoes but what a lot of people don't know is you can eat the leaves and the roots of a sweet potato so sweet potatoes just happen to be one of the most nutritious crops in the world for that reason so what i really like to do is to pull all of these young leaves off of here and you can see i mean this isn't a very good example of a sweet potato patch i just have a couple of slips that we planted here maybe a month ago that are starting to take over but i could tell you is if i came back in this area in just a few weeks this would be a solid sea of green so the leaves are just kind of starting to fill in and you would start sweet potatoes by buying just organic sweet potatoes at the grocery store sticking them in some soil letting the sprouts come off and you break those off and that's what would be called a slip so if you don't start it from a potato you actually order slips in spring from one of these sweet potato type companies and like i said there's many different varieties and types and not only do you get this awesome potato at the end of season which is really fun to dig up to pull out of the ground you know you don't have to eat them right away they can last six to nine months inside of your house but during that entire time you can eat the leaves off of the sweet potatoes so sweet potatoes are super exciting for me because i i personally really love the flavor of the greens they're great sauteed with just a little salt and pepper on them make a great dish side and then you get potatoes at the end of the season so digging up sweet potatoes is probably one of my favorite events out here on the farm my number five favorite perennial vegetable to grow down here in the food forest is siso spinach or miami spinach and this one makes a really nice ground cover can take full sun or dappled light you can see i accidentally ripped a little bit of that root out i could stick it back in the ground it'll easily grow this is one that doesn't need to be cooked it can be eaten raw it really has a nice texture to it it's not too slimy goes really great in a salad goes really great just eating it fresh or any type of dish this is a great perennial vegetable that i planted one time that's been here for multiple years that's here all summer long if i want to come outside and have something to add as a green on a salad or to a plate so siso spinach is definitely worth growing if you're in a subtropical environment we've got like one or two varieties of this one it is just great you know like i said that has a nice crunch to the leaf it's not too slimy makes a great perennial vegetable to add to your landscape so number five my number six must-have for sustainable garden in florida is definitely going to be katuk katuk is an awesome perennial vegetable super high in protein very similar to like moringa where it's like 20 protein um and it tastes delicious it literally tastes like raw peas so it's one that really has a nice flavor raw kids like everybody i've given this one to they're like wow that tasted pretty good i have a variegated variety and a green variety they both thrive on neglect these plants never get watered these plants never get fertilized there is no irrigation here and they live and they thrive on neglect all year long so with a lot of these perennial vegetables the sisu spinach the moringa the katuk that young growth that new growth that's coming off the top is going to be the most tender the softest so as i work my way down the plant like these bottom leaves these are going to be a little tougher they're still great to eat they can still go in a dish probably better in a cooked dish because they'll break them down a little bit but for eating fresh i find the raw tips are always best so katuk grow it my number six fruit crop to grow here in florida which probably would not be typically looked at as like a vegetable um is papaya so papaya was something that i really enjoyed with spending time with rob it's something he commonly made in his dishes i think my favorite was his uh thai coconut curry with the papaya in it but i personally love green papaya i think it's great as a vegetable i love papaya salad at a thai restaurant and i love the flavor of a good ripe papaya as a fruit so you know papayas don't have to be eaten ripe they can be eaten green like a vegetable you know we're starting to get some little papayas here and you can get these while they get larger and they're green or you can wait until they get ripe and actually eat it as a vegetable this one doesn't have a lot of fruit on it right now the other ones i have are tall and i need to cut them back you can cut your papayas back every couple of years one of my mentors the guy i feature a lot on my channel is jim kovaleski he's got a papaya tree in his front yard that's like five or six years old so these trees can last a while they can be perennial they could die back if you're further north but you could start them in your greenhouse and get them outside you know right after that last frost and potentially get a green fruit in like six months so papayas are definitely worth growing you know find a good one grow the seed out really easy to get started highly suggest growing it number seven i've been really busy the last couple of weeks with the nursery business and all of my plants out in the ground for these last three have been cut down for cuttings and propagation so i'm over here in the nursery where i have some better examples and the one i want to talk to you about now is edible leaf hibiscus and that's this big leaf plant right here behind me and this can be used as a wrap you can eat in raw chopped up in a salad be used as a green and this is one that might be a little bit more on the muse analogous side tight you know maybe slightly slimy some would say that's really good that's good for lining our insides this variety is actually less slimy than the variety i have over here on this side this one definitely has a little bit more of the muce analogous to it i have a couple different varieties i have a skinny leaf variety i have this fat leaf variety and there's a couple of different common names for this one i really like to just call it lettuce leaf hibiscus i really like this one as a wrap so you know you wanted a green wrap something that's gluten free you can grow this for your wrap the number nine must-have for the sustainable garden in florida this is one that the kids really like cranberry hibiscus the leaves are beautiful nice deep red some people call that like a mahogany and these are sweet they're sour they're delicious just raw they go nice in a salad you can chop them up my favorite thing to do is like if i'm making a sandwich or i'm packing something for the day i'm gonna be on the road i come out and i get a handful of fresh leaves and just like i talked about with the katuk you know the younger leaves the fresh growth like so this is a really fresh red one and you can see this is an older leaf you can see a color difference you see how that one's pale that one's dark red so the younger growth is always going to be the most tender and the sweetest nothing wrong with gold growth it's just not going to be the best flavor-wise so cranberry hibiscus is not only just a stunner in the landscape it's a pretty looking plant has a really nice edible factor and i guarantee if you give it to one of the kids they're going to enjoy it too so this one's definitely been perennial here it will set flowers all hibiscuses have edible flowers so you can eat the flour on this but after it's done setting the flour it's going to set seed that you could save to replant if you're in a more northern type climate so cranberry hibiscus is definitely another must-have i think if you're in gardening down here in florida and you don't have it this is one to add to your system last but not least must-have perennial for sustainable garden down here in florida um or in any type of sub-tropical climate would be okinawan spinach and this is one that we've been propagating really hard the last few weeks this is also one that the squirrels like here that i have a hard time keeping going in the beds but i really like the flavor of it um it's really nice to eat raw it's nice to eat cooked it's nice to put in a dish and it's very similar to the longevity spinach which is right here behind me but i think the longevity spinach is um a little bit stronger a little bit more of like a medicine um the squirrels don't like it as much so it definitely grows here a lot better i've noticed that you know we plant these two for clients all the time longevity spinach okinawan spinach and the okinawan's a little prettier it's got some purplish red to the underside of the leaves um it's hit or miss sometimes the okanagan does better on your site sometimes the longevity does better on your site so i would say both of these are kind of like a tie for number 10 but this one tastes a little better so i hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you rob for the opportunity it's been a blast i cannot wait to work with you again i cannot wait for your next challenge i can't wait to get back to florida so we can do some fun stuff thank you guys so much for following and what we like to do around here pound dirt i hope that you
