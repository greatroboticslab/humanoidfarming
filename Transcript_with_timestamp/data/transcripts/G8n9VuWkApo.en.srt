hello again and welcome back to horse

4
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,360
life

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,280
directly from the horse headquarters in

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,640
germany visits nov

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,879
for those of you who haven't joined us

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,399
earlier today i'm johannes and i will i

9
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,520
will be your host for the english

10
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,520
language sessions today

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,600
well a quick reminder on what is horse

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,039
life obviously we would have loved to

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,320
have you here in person

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,760
but because of covet 19 this apparently

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,440
isn't possible unfortunately so

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,360
we thought about a creative solution to

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,400
interact with you anyways

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,080
and this is harsh life

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,680
fortunately this new format actually

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,240
gives us a chance

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,360
to present you an even larger and more

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,400
international

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,439
quickly on what this is about

32
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,960
this is horse life and so we hope not

33
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,520
only you will hear from us

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,720

either

40
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,960
after the sessions from the presenter or

41
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,399
via

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,000
the chat function directly to our next

43
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,320
speaker

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,320
actually the two upcoming presentations

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,360
will cover a topic that horse has been

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,320
dealing

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,119
intensively with for about two years now

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,239
and that's called

49
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,480
biocontrol or biological plant

50
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,560
protection

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,959
what is it about is actually the

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,200
biological control of pests and diseases

53
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,280
through the targeted application of an

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,480
active biological agent

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,879
something that here in the eu is somehow

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,400
still a niche sector but in other parts

57
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,160
of the world like brazil

58
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,879
this is already widely accepted and

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,879
commonly used

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,959
our next two guests will share insights

61
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,200
on this innovative and

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,040
interesting technology with us from two

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,800
different perspectives

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,879
gregory sanders will make a start and

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,000
talk to us about the practical use of

68
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,879
biological agents

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,640
in large-scale farming operations

70
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,239

poe state we

114
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,680

mainly in poe and

126
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,840
use of new technologies to make possible

127
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,000
to produce

128
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:24,240
soya bean seeds here in poe in a place

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,199
there is a very hot and offer a big

130
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,120
challenge

production process we

134
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:44,320
always to be pioneered in

135

the region we are operating we have

136
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,800
some discovery about ourselves

137
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,560
the way adjusting our process

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,520
by our own to make possible to

139
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,319
to explore the crops we are in this

140
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,840
region

141
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,479
we have a characteristic of

142
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,199
share a lot of their knowledge we we

143
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,759
learn

144
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,400
everything we learn here in the region

145
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,840
we used to share with other growers

146
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,960
and we for us is a way

147
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,560
to to make this

148
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,600
these mistakes we we made another people

149
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,560
want to do this and we can

150
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,120
at the same time when we share learn a

151
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
lot

152
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,240
things that we it would cost a lot in

153
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,639
our mistakes so this is a characters we

154
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
have

155
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,520
is to share everything

156
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,400
that we learned along all over the years

157
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,120
operating here in the region and we are

158
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,880
avid

159
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,039
to new technologies i must say

160
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,919
we are the second harsh customer here in

161
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,560
brazil

162
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,520
and we are very proud of this talking

163
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,800
about our

164
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,759
farms we have a aurobranco farm

165
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,080
located in paracatu miniaturized state

166
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,880
is the only farm we have in the

167
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,280
miniaturized state is the first one the

168
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,560
group

169
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,599
established in the year to 1997

170
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,800
before becoming really a group these

171
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,599
farms nowadays two thousand and six

172
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,120
two thousand six hundred hectares

173
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,599
normally we

174
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,599
have all the area planted with soybean

175
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,280
in the first harvest

176
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:32,639
and almost 70 percent of the area

177
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,919
planted with corn in the second harvest

178
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,720
we have another farm the peninsula

179
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,039
is the little one we have located in

180
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,080
guadalupe poe

181
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,360
with 682 hectares

182
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,479
irrigated area is very strategic for us

183
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,680
to

184
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,960
soybean multiply and

185
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,080
give a speed in new

186
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,280
varieties of soybean that is is being

187
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,039
developed we have an imperial farm

188
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,680
located in sebastian leo the area tutor

189
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,400
is

190
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:13,680
10 780 hectares planted area

191
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,720
normally this farm we make

192
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,759
one harvest and they are the the

193
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,039
the second harvest only crops to cover

194
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,160
the soil and make

195
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,520
uh straw in the area we have a hyena de

196
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,680
seja

197
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:33,599
a farm located in euro suite yoe with a

198
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,560
14 thousand and 300 hectares planted

199
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,479
area

200
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,039
normally this area we can

201
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,080
plant total air in the first harvest

202
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,360
with soybean

203
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,560
and something like 10

204
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,279
and 20 percent of this area along the

205
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,640
years

206
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,680
we can cover if a second harvest of

207
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,040
corn and the rest of the area the same

208
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,600
of imperial covering with uh crop to

209
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,600
make

210
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,360
straw that is very very important in our

211
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,720
region

212
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,560
we have the youngest one a tropical farm

213
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,920
located at bacia grande dohibero

214
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:20,160
nowadays 17

215
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:23,440
400 hectares planted area

216
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,000
we can make our something like 15

217
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,959
percent

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
of second harvest with corn and this

219
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,320
area is

220
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,040
is to be consolidated uh this next

221
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,040
season

222
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,839
it will reach the mark of 20 21

223
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,120
four hundred hectares and we have the

224
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,480
progreso farm that

225
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,760
first farm here in poe state the most

226
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,880
important area

227
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,360
the biggest planted area we have in one

228
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,880
farm

229
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,680
and it's 36 000 hectares is where we

230
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,720
concentrate

231
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,000
our industrial uh

232
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,000
structures we have a cotton gin

233
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,440
we have the our

234
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,560
unit of seeds located in poe

235
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,760
installed in this farm main activities

236
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,519
of the group

237
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,560
as i said soybean corn cotton grow

238
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,800
and soybeans the

239
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,160
the last season 2020 2001 the current

240
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,720
season

241
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,560
we will have in our farms in poe and

242
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,680
minas gerais state

243
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:34,800
a total of 68 300 hectares soybean

244
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,279
thousand of corn first harvest and three

245
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,399
thousand

246
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,160
nine hundred of cotton and as a second

247
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,279
harvest we will have

248
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,399
sixteen thousand four hundred hectares

249
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,760
of corn

250
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,880
a thousand and one hundred hectares of

251
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,920
serbian

252
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,680
and this soybean irrigated eighty

253
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,560
hundred and fifty hectares will be at

254
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,760
peninsula

255
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,959
in the central pivots

256
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,399
to multiply new varieties that are

257
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:07,839
in the pipeline to be registered and

258
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,480
for the next harvest the soybean seed

259
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,839
business

260
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,480
we have a unit in orobrenko farm with a

261
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,600
structure

262
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:19,200
to 120 000 sacks of

263
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,480
2 100 200 and

264
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,600
200 000 seeds like

265
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,480
one sec like this normally

266
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,120
for you to have an idea you can plant

267
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,079
one hectare of soybean with this

268
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,959
number of seeds in one sac so this

269
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,279
structure

270
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:43,120
can cover 120

271
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:47,279
000 hectares of soybean

272
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,320
uh all with all this capacity

273
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,440
in in a structure and where we can

274
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,360
keep all the seed storage

275
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,639
in a cold chamber and our main

276
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,440
unit is located at progreso farm and a

277
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,920
structure

278
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:09,200
to 1.2 million sacks of seeds

279
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:13,279
really impressive we have

280
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,480
concept this structure since 2004

281
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,519
and nowadays we are

282
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,120
unpleating this structure building a new

283
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,920
big chamber cold chamber to store

284
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,880
ready seeds to to go to the our

285
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,720
customers

286
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,040
i would like to talk about a little bit

287
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,480
about the history of biologic control

288
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:38,240
in big crops in brazil in the years

289
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,399
80 we had introduction of use

290
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,600
of baccalaureates to control soybean

291
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,639
caterpillar

292
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:49,680
the anti-carcinogen metals and that time

293
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,560
the growers used to pick up the the

294
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,920
anti-carcinogen metals that seems to be

295
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,040
affected by

296
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,160
baccolo virus and

297
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,839
freeze all these caterpillars and then

298
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:07,200
in a certain moment put all in a mixer

299
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,320
and then put this solution of

300
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,920
of caterpillar mix it in a big mixer

301
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,440
inside a plane or

302
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:19,040
a terrain spray or a plane

303
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,720
and spray all this solution in the

304
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:26,240
in the soybean crop and this time

305
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,360
it used to have a very

306
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,560
it was very heavy the work

307
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,680
to pick up this and

308
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,880
to make all this process and we have

309
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:43,760
suffered a lot with the effects of

310
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:46,480
whether the the response of this kind of

311
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,959
treatment by using baccalaureates should

312
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,240
be

313
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:53,839
very preventive not so you couldn't

314
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,199
use this as in the point where the

315
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:00,399
caterpillars was giving you uh

316
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,600
damage to your to your soybean

317
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,199
where you would lose money it takes a

318
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,720
long time to control the

319
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:11,920
the caterpillar so this

320
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,480
failed along the years and the growers

321
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,600
stopped using this kind of technology

322
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,120
then in the years 19 for

323
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,399
big crops we know it's a very popular

324
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,160
and deep basilis du regensis and a

325
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,360
commercial solution

326
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,399
ready for use but it was

327
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,519
efficient not so much

328
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:39,519
if compared with the chemical control

329
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:42,639
but it was a way to reduce the impact

330
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,760
to the interesting

331
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,959
bugs present in the crop

332
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,000
but the cost of using the pill

333
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:55,600
was so close to the

334
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,120
the chemical control that doesn't make

335
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,399
sense at that moment

336
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,360
if you compare the efficiency and you

337
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,440
compare the q

338
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:09,199
the cost it represented that time

339
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:13,199
and it didn't didn't work the there was

340
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,160
no not so many growers using this

341
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,199
technology

342
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,639
at that time then you in the year to the

343
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,320
years 2000

344
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,920
the beans soy beans and cotton growers

345
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,199
in some regions some

346
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,160
more cold weather

347
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,440
regions where we have a high altitudes

348
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,000
when you have a

349
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:38,639
temperature below 15 degrees at night

350
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,079
this this main tree crops start

351
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,279
suffering a lot of if

352
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:48,480
sclerotine escalo chiaro

353
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,480
this disease caused by this fungus

354
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:57,519
had a have a very difficult

355
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,880
and very expensive cause to control

356
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:04,160
by managing fungicides and that's

357
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,839
that was an opportunity for

358
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,320
the biologic control with by using

359
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,519
trichoderma

360
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,959
asean to get succeed

361
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:18,320
and since that year that year until now

362
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:21,519
we have a lot of growers in

363
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:25,199
these main tree crops using constantly

364
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:28,320
year by year this kind of fungus

365
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,399
or making buying this from

366
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,680
companies specialized companies to

367
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,199
produce or

368
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,959
some producing these by their own in

369
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,160
their own farms

370
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:44,720
and we had a a big change

371
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,600
in the biologic control in brazil

372
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,360
by the year 2012 when we had the

373
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,480
introduction of

374
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,079
elite corvair parmigia in brazil at that

375
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,330
time

376
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,160
nobody was ready to deal with this new

377
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:04,720
[Music]

378
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:08,559
caterpillar very resident for the normal

379
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,079
insecticides we were being using and

380
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:15,360
to control this this new

381
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,679
caterpillar we should use some

382
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,400
insecticides that was very expensive at

383
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,720
that time

384
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,640
and the helicopter after its

385
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,799
introduction in brazil

386
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:30,320
live as a legacy many growers

387
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,360
after that started using biological

388
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,840
control

389
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,720
as a way to control the caterpillars and

390
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,160
even

391
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,200
other uses other purpose

392
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,320
and this created a constant demand for

393
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,039
all the biological and this environment

394
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,559
this new environment created after this

395
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,840
event

396
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,520
was a perfect for established companies

397
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,880
that work at this

398
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,080
segment of of business and even for new

399
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,120
startups

400
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,640
to have an opportunity to grow and the

401
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:08,240
recent most recent uh

402
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:12,400
changing in this segment of business

403
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,600
was some companies developed some

404
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:19,039
solutions for the growers to produce

405
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,000
their bio control agents inside the farm

406
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,640
on farm

407
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,280
in the year 2019 progress made a

408
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,400
contract

409
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,640
with agrobiological

410
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,520
companies situated at lemmy some

411
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,799
polystate

412
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:37,039
southeast region of brazil that is

413
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:40,240
specialized in producing solutions for

414
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:44,240
production of biological control in

415
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:47,280
on farm this contract

416
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,320
we made an agreement to

417
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,600
buy only their kit they have a

418
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:57,840
feed kit for bacteria multiplication

419
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:01,440
called multibacter and

420
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:06,240
they've accommodated us

421
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:09,440
20 bioreactors capable of 2 000 liters

422
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,960
each so we have a capacity

423
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:17,600
to produce at the same time 40 000

424
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:21,440
liters of bio agents at same time

425
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,440
and this contract this agreement

426
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,720
leave us free to buy any source of any

427
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,840
bacteria to

428
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,480
any other company to be multiplied

429
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,960
inside

430
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,840
the b reactors that are accommodated

431
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,840
with them

432
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:41,039
the year 2019 we use by using an

433
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,039
existing building we installed the 20b

434
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,480
reactors of 2000 liters

435
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:50,000
at fazenda progreso centred

436
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,280
between other tree farms to produce

437
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,840
and deliver all the bio agents

438
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,559
to other farms and then november 2019 we

439
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,320
started

440
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:05,679
up this structure very simple use

441
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:09,039
by mixing the multibacker kit

442
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:12,480
and the desired bacteria you need

443
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,039
we could produce at each reactor 2000

444
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,320
liters

445
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:20,400
of the desired bioagent after

446
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:24,000
producing we put all the this solution

447
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,760
in of each bioreactor into

448
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,840
ibc's of 1000 liters and

449
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:34,880
after that analyze storage in a

450
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,880
cold chamber or direct use

451
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:43,120
by spraying with our planes the main use

452
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:46,720
of each produce are for

453
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,919
caterpillar controls nematodes

454
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:53,600
and live disease

455
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:56,720
and we've felt a lot the

456
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,640
effects of reducing the impact so this

457
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:04,159
structure is very simple and we are

458
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,440
using this spraying that our planes

459
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:10,240
as the same as other chemical

460
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,679
insect size and fungicides to control

461
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,120
the main

462
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,679
bugs and diseases we

463
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,240
we have in the our crops with less

464
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,320
impact

465
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:26,720
environment we are controlling now

466
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:30,320
white flies the complex of caterpillars

467
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,280
stink bugs spider mites and

468
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,039
diseases by using these biological

469
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,159
products at the same way of

470
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:42,240
chemical we use to do

471
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:45,360
before the multibacter technology

472
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,480
create a very simple table for

473
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,760
any agent you want to

474
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,039
multiply in the columns

475
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,520
you have all the agent a commercial

476
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,960
prude

477
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,840
product that you you can buy to use as a

478
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,080
source of

479
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,120
of this bacteria the time of

480
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,919
multiplication

481
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,919
the amount of commercial product to per

482
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,039
each 2000 liters

483
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,760
of the desired product you

484
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,280
you may multiply and also you have the

485
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,320
shelf life of the

486
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,600
product at the ambient temperature

487
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,960
the shelf life extended that's

488
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,320
more or less 50 percent when

489
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,280
cap when you storage this this product

490
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,159
at 12 degrees celsius and you have the

491
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,039
target

492
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,400
for each agent you have a target a

493
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,600
specific target

494
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:43,120
on the crops and also the dosage

495
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,679
of each each product to to control the

496
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,720
target

497
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:50,720
for instance this table help you

498
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,440
to plan everything you need to produce

499
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,200
how long will it take and how long will

500
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,559
it be

501
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,200
have available for you to use like the

502
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,880
first

503
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,600
column basilist origins uh variety as a

504
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,520
why

505
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:11,360
the commercial centauri it takes

506
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:14,720
48 hours to to be ready

507
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,080
the most you will use is 4 kilograms of

508
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,200
commercial product to

509
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,559
produce 2 000 liters of the

510
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,679
the product and if you keep this at

511
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,960
ambient temperature

512
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:30,880
eight days duration if you put in the

513
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:34,000
cold chamber 12 days of duration

514
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,360
and the purpose of this product is for

515
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,799
spodoptera species and pseudo pluses

516
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,799
pieces

517
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,799
and you take between three or four

518
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,320
liters per hectare spraying

519
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:50,240
to control these caterpillars

520
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:53,919
in any crop it could be soybean beans

521
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:57,039
cotton and here we have the nine

522
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:01,919
main agents we work with

523
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:05,360
in the last season 2019 2020

524
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:09,200
with any purpose you have

525
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,240
here in in this table to have an idea

526
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,679
what we did

527
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:17,279
last season 2019 2020

528
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:21,120
here you are some volume of each

529
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:24,400
agent we multiply it the total

530
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:27,520
amount of bu agent we produce it

531
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,520
on our b reactors was a total of one

532
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,159
million two hundred and ten thousand

533
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,000
liters

534
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:37,039
of bu agents most of them with a purpose

535
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,240
to control the caterpillars

536
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:43,919
talking about advantages so many

537
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:47,520
you can save interests bug

538
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:50,880
that help you in the

539
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,799
pests control and biological you feel

540
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,559
this a lot

541
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:58,880
we can feel the the increase of spiders

542
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,600
in the in our crops even then so i've

543
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,039
been

544
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,960
even in cotton by using this kind of

545
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,640
products and reducing the chemical

546
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,960
control

547
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:15,440
and talking about money saving

548
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:18,080
with i find a very simple way to compare

549
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,720
what what's being saved in about in

550
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,799
terms of

551
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,799
money not to mention and other

552
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,279
advantages and other benefits

553
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,080
of the use of the biological control

554
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,640
that are

555
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,600
difficult to measure we didn't measure

556
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,480
that

557
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,159
but talking about money like soya bean

558
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,000
last year

559
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:41,120
we sprayed a biological

560
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,799
it was an average in soybeans of 2.5

561
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,600
springs only using the biological

562
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,200
control

563
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,760
with with no chemical there so 2.5

564
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,960
sprains are i changed the chemical by

565
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,559
biological

566
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:00,159
with the same result of the chemical but

567
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:04,559
with economy of 4.1

568
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:08,880
dollar per hectare if you multiply

569
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:12,559
by 2.5 and the area a total economy

570
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:16,400
of 488 thousand

571
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:18,799
dollars almost 489 thousand dollars in

572
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,159
soybean only considering

573
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,559
the caterpillar control with biological

574
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,880
in cotton we had a little bit more

575
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:30,480
sprayers

576
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:33,039
we used the four sprays removing

577
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,840
the chemical control only biological

578
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,440
control

579
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,559
so the the chemicals in this kind of of

580
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:44,000
purples are a little bit more expensive

581
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,600
so the reduction was eight five point

582
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,320
eighty five dollars

583
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,960
per spray multiplying that by four

584
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,200
sprays

585
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,080
and the area four thousand five hundred

586
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,000
hectares

587
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,799
we have an economy of 105 000

588
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,840
so the total considering just this crop

589
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,400
these two crops

590
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,120
and this control of caterpillars we have

591
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,159
something

592
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,760
like 594 thousand dollars

593
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,880
the pandemic of coronavirus uh we suffer

594
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,840
with that because

595
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,200
we couldn't get any more sources to

596
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,919
multiply we had the

597
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,159
multibacter kit but we didn't we

598
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,039
couldn't buy

599
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,440
the source of bacteria mainly the

600
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,880
bacillus turijins and

601
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,399
saccharopolis prospinosa for use

602
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,360
in the coverage crops that we plant in

603
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,240
the areas that

604
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,679
we don't make this second harvest we

605
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,960
plant

606
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:44,640
millet we plant bracciaria and

607
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:48,159
we we could have a

608
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,760
higher economy a higher saving of money

609
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,640
if we could use that that point that we

610
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,840
main

611
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,360
we intend to use in this next harvest so

612
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,799
we are in the

613
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,919
rain season 2020 2021 as

614
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,440
we are about in the middle of this rain

615
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,360
season

616
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,520
so we are estimating um economy

617
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,240
much higher than the last year so in

618
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,720
soybean this year we have a little we

619
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,640
felt

620
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:22,000
a little a little lower pressure of

621
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,200
caterpillars in soybean and also cotton

622
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,159
i don't know but

623
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,600
i i estimate to be the same so talking

624
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,919
about soybean

625
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:35,520
we believe we will use 1.5

626
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,600
spraying in the total area removing the

627
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,360
chemical control and using the

628
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,919
biological control

629
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,520
so the economy of a little bit higher

630
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,799
this year because the dollar

631
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:50,799
is increased its value

632
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,159
against the real and the cost of all the

633
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,960
biological was

634
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,600
in real so this year the economy is a

635
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,039
little bit

636
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,200
higher than last year in terms of prices

637
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,960
of product

638
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:08,080
so multiplying 5.0 to 1.1

639
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:13,440
1.5 spraying to in the total area of

640
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:15,919
49 and 900 hectares of soybean

641
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,720
treated with biological we will have a

642
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,760
economy of

643
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:23,360
uh 375 000

644
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,399
this year we remove it the first

645
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,279
chemical fungicide spraying we changed

646
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,159
this by

647
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,840
using the bacillus soup chilis so we

648
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,559
removed one chemical

649
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,159
spraying in the first in the vegetative

650
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:40,080
phase of the soybean

651
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:43,440
and introduced only the basil subtil so

652
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,640
considerable reduction of costs

653
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,000
6.4 44 will reduce the cost

654
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,039
in this spraying one one spray in total

655
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,600
area we have

656
00:29:51,039 --> 00:30:00,399
a savings of 321 000

657
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,039
about cotton this year the area is 3900

658
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,279
hectares

659
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:10,399
four springs because uh the difference

660
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:13,840
of course become higher 7.04 dollars per

661
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,360
per sprain by changing chemical to

662
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,159
biological

663
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,840
so if you multiply these four by four

664
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,679
and by the area we had

665
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,720
109 000 of

666
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:31,120
economy in this year different

667
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:34,159
uh to the year 2019 and 2020

668
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,960
we have we will do the the control of

669
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,399
caterpillars in other crops like sorghum

670
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,520
millet and brachiari

671
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,720
the total will be 50

672
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:47,919
400 hectares we estimate

673
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,559
at least two sprains for economy because

674
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,039
the

675
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,960
products the chemical inset size we use

676
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,919
in this in these situations are

677
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,919
a little bit cheaper than the other than

678
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,840
the cotton and the soybean

679
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:06,000
will be a reduction of cost of 2.06

680
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,720
dollars per sprain multiply it by two

681
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,840
and multiply it by the area will will

682
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,039
expect

683
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,159
uh 207 000 dollars of

684
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,919
economy so estimating

685
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,240
all the all the use only based on

686
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,360
what i changed by chemical to the

687
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,440
biological

688
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:31,039
this year we expect saving 1 million

689
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,080
14 000 dollars

690
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,679
of savings by change the chemical to

691
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,120
biological with

692
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:42,320
with no with no uh

693
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,480
loss of of performance

694
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,760
we had some chance comparing the season

695
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,760
2019 to 2020

696
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,880
to the season 2200 2020 in 2021 that is

697
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,279
in course

698
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,399
we removed the chrome bacterium subsur

699
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,440
guy

700
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:02,720
to our from our program because

701
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,760
the efficiency of this kind of agent

702
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,000
you should at least spray this weekly

703
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,120
and this is this impacting in our

704
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,399
operation

705
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:16,240
mainly in the planes areas to be sprayed

706
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:20,559
is very very high and doesn't make sense

707
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:24,080
to us to continuous with this agent

708
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,600
that requests so many so many sprains

709
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,559
because

710
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,960
normally the use of biologicals goes

711
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,080
with

712
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,120
other products goes with fertilizer and

713
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:40,240
there is no significant change in our

714
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,240
in our process of of production

715
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,440
the first as i said the first chemical

716
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,000
fungicide

717
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,880
sprayed in soybean which was changed by

718
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,360
chemical

719
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,440
to the biological in most of the

720
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,039
varieties of soybean

721
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,559
so this gave us a significant

722
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,679
reduction of costs but we didn't see any

723
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,799
change in the

724
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,840
performance of the control of the fungus

725
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,240
disease leave diseases in soybean and we

726
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,840
are

727
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,960
concluding our microbiology

728
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,159
laboratory to have a sample of of

729
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,440
each production bioreactor and

730
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,080
analyze this sample to ensure we are

731
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,360
having a good quality product to be

732
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,480
sprayed in the hour

733
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,960
in our areas we plan some chains for the

734
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,960
next season 2021 2022

735
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,640
agro-biological company that we make

736
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,399
that agreement

737
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:44,240
we have a contract is developing a

738
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:47,279
feeding kit to produce fungi

739
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,159
agents in the same bu reactor at the

740
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,360
same system

741
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:55,440
we are multiplying the bacterias so

742
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:57,200
by these we will have some new agents

743
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,039
that are very important in our

744
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,440
production like we

745
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,640
will be able with this work we will be

746
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,600
able to

747
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,480
produce balvari basiana to control

748
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,079
whitefly

749
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:13,280
on soybean and cotton we will be able to

750
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:16,000
produce izaria from formosa rosia

751
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,599
to control daobulus mites that's a very

752
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,399
important bug nowadays in the corn

753
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,440
that request a lot of sprains to control

754
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,079
this pest

755
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,320
and you have to take too much care of

756
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,919
the corn you have to protect against

757
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,800
this bug because is it transmits some

758
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,359
virus that can make a disaster in your

759
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,480
corn

760
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:41,599
so we expect a very

761
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,800
significant reduce of course in the

762
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,560
control of this

763
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,440
main main two pests the whitefly

764
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,119
and bulus might said corn though blues

765
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,480
minds that corn and white fly and

766
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,320
soybean and cotton

767
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,240
and uh we plan to start producing

768
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,760
trichoderma

769
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,119
arzianum and the purpose of this is to

770
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,280
use

771
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,760
in the full in the planning forum during

772
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,200
soybean planning operation

773
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,920
to reduce the nematodes to reduce

774
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,320
the soil disease that attack the roofs

775
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,320
of

776
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:21,760
all the crops here in our explored crops

777
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,079
so this uh these changes for

778
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,200
the next season will increase a lot this

779
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,440
money savings

780
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,359
we are expecting a lot of money savings

781
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,920
by this main two

782
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,560
new agents these fungi new agents that

783
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,119
we will

784
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,839
be able to introduce in our control

785
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,040
system

786
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,680
and that's it well i would like to thank

787
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,920
you all

788
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,520
for the attention i hope you enjoyed my

789
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,440
presentation

790
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:50,640
and this can contribute to your business

791
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,880
and i can you can contact me

792

via email that i show in the beginning

793
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,079
of presentation

794
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:13,040
gregory at fazendaprogresso.com.bro

795
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:16,320
even accessing our social media

796
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,160
live with us from brazil gregory welcome

797
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,920
and thank you very much for this very

798
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,640
insightful and interesting

799
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,640
presentation and that you shared with us

800
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:29,920
um how's it going in brazil

801
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,400
we are starting to harvest

802
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,920
very good that sounds good so already

803
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,000
good luck for that

804
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,240
gregory thanks for being available for

805
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,800
answering some questions and the first

806
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,400
question

807
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,040
isn't directly related to the topic

808
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,240
you were talking about it's rather with

809
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,960
regard to the

810
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,599
opportunity to do two harvests in one

811
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,839
rain season

812
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,520
one of our viewers noticed that in the

813
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,079
first half for the first harvest you

814
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,640
plant

815
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,079
around 81 000 hectares while for the

816
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,680
second harvest it's

817
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,000
only and that's still an impressive

818
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,160
number but roughly 20 000

819
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,040
hectares so what's going on with the

820
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,200
rest

821
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,800
with the rest of the 60 000 hectares

822
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,560
what what's being done with them

823
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,280
at the time of the second harvest we

824
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,680
used to plant some crops to cover the

825
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,920
soil we need a lot of straw

826
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:26,320
to to protect from losing the moisture

827
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,599
here in brazil is very important to to

828
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,359
keep this

829
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,920
and we don't have a window a correct

830
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,560
window to produce corn for in the whole

831
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,119
area that

832
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:42,320
was the best the best world for us

833
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,040
and we use in other crops that request a

834
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,640
little bit

835
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,680
less water to to produce a a month

836
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,079
a considerable amount of uh straw okay

837
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,119
that's

838
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,560
very important for us okay well thanks

839
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,400
on that

840
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:01,920
coming uh to your presentation and

841
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,240
to questions on that so you made it

842
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,400
certainly clear that you're using an

843
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:10,000
integrated system for plant protection

844
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,560
so you're not replacing 100 of chemicals

845
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,160
with

846
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,800
biological control so question on that

847
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,920
is

848
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,359
what's the ratio of biological control

849
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,680
and chemical control

850
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,920
and what efficiency level do you see on

851
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,359
biological control compared to

852
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:31,040
chemical control okay the

853
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:33,680
the situations we remove it uh as i was

854
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,640
talking about in my presentation for

855
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,760
caterpillars in soybean

856
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,800
we removed all the chemical control

857
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,359
but you have a stink bugs white fly

858
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,400
and other kind of pests you can't

859
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,839
control that

860
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,000
efficiently in the system we have

861
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,040
by using biological but caterpillars

862
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,079
that is the

863
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,119
the we what the tasks we most

864
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,000
spend money in the control the

865
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,040
biological

866
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,000
biological substitute changed every

867
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,000
chemical to biological okay and

868
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:14,640
that other pests we continue to use the

869
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:18,560
chemical but the fungicides control

870
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:22,320
we remove it we change it 25

871
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,960
between 25 and 30 in 30 percent

872
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,599
by using substituting the bio the

873
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,640
chemical to biological

874
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:34,560
so specific targets

875
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:38,160
talking about pests we are we changed it

876
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,359
25 percent and the of course to

877
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,839
biological and the

878
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:46,000
fungicides control 25 to 30 percent

879
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,920
do you do you see an increase in that

880
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,040
possibly in the future or

881
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:54,240
um will that stay at the same level

882
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,400
for the time being so we force

883
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,760
these specific targets like stink bugs

884
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,480
and white flies

885
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,520
we have we expect a better control if

886
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,040
you by using

887
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,200
fungus where the bacterias that the main

888
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,640
bacteria that we are producing on farm

889
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,520
are not

890
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,480
efficiency in the system we have but

891
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,200
with fungus

892
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,280
that we expect the next season be

893
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,640
producing on farm we expect

894
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,760
to control these other uh these other

895
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,800
bugs

896
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,839
by by using this this new

897
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,040
kind of engine agents

898
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:33,440
um on one of your last slides you uh

899
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,640
mentioned that one of the agents you

900
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,040
used in the first season in 2019 2020

901
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,319
you

902
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,160
removed that um can you tell us a little

903
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,960
bit more about the reasons for removing

904
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,520
that what was

905
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,720
um what what made you take that decision

906
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,520
was it

907
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,200
efficiency that made you decide to

908
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,760
switch over again to chemical

909
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,319
that specific agent chromobacterium

910
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,680
sugar

911
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:02,800
was being used to control

912
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,400
the stink bugs and white fly

913
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,440
but to be efficient we should spray at

914
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,880
least

915
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,040
weekly so at each seven days we would

916
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,000
have to spray again the chrome bacteria

917
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,200
subsur guy to have

918
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,240
efficient control and our

919
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,440
operational capacity of spraying with

920
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,880
planes and

921
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,200
other sprayers we we are not uh we don't

922
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,319
have this capacity to do

923
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,319
weekly spraying all over our areas

924
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,000
so there that doesn't make sense to

925
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:37,200
continue with that agent

926
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,160
that's why we stop it using and

927
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,079
um so do i understand right that there

928
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,640
is an effect on workload

929
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,400
for biological control of biological

930
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,880
agents so that you

931
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,400
in general would say there is a higher

932
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,560
workload when applying

933
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,079
biological agents because you need to

934
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,760
spray more

935
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,760
possibly as well as more often

936
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,599
in this case as i said before i

937
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,040
remove it because it it would increase

938
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,079
the number of spraying

939
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,319
but the system we are now the changes we

940
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,200
made from the last season to this actual

941
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,240
season

942
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,480
we are not spraying more we substitute

943
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,319
the chemical by biological in the same

944
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,160
spray okay

945
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:25,520
and the the main the main point is

946
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,240
when you use a chemical you have a need

947
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,640
to spray

948
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,359
you go to your storage you got a product

949
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,720
and you spray and with bio-biological

950
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,760
produced on farm

951
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,000
is very different you have to to see

952
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,480
the need you have to produce the

953
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,760
biological agent you need

954
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,720
and you have to spray that and you have

955
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,119
a very

956
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,000
lower shelf life of each product you

957
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,960
produce

958
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,839
if compared with to chemical so

959
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,480
everything

960
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:58,560
must be very synchronized to be

961
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,560
successful in this kind of control

962
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,400
did you change anything within your farm

963
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,920
system to be able to do so

964
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,359
to anticipate when a biological agent is

965
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,520
needed

966
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,119
did you i don't know hire weather

967
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,520
specialists

968
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,040
or run your own weather forecast system

969
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,800
or things like that to

970
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,800
to be able to to adopt to that

971
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:26,400
yes we have to like

972
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:29,440
to like how do we say in portuguese

973
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,640
to have all the area in your hands

974
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:36,560
to see to know everything is happening

975
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,960
to control in this in the right point

976
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,560
you can't lose the control you have to

977
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,800
get the control in your hands

978
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,760
of the whole area that's the main

979
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,000
difference

980
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,000
and you have to synchronize how long you

981
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,200
take to produce the product

982
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,520
and you have the capacity of planes and

983
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,960
so

984
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:58,160
everything must be you have to to be

985
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,520
at least two steps ahead if compared to

986
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,599
other system

987
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:06,640
by using only chemicals a question

988
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,040
in this context is do you spray the

989
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,640
whole farm at once or do you check

990
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,160
within the fields which area has

991
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,760
caterpillars and really needs to be

992
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,880
sprayed

993
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,000
yes that's real what we do

994
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,119
we we spray when needed normally when

995
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,520
needed

996
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,599
the first the first spray between the

997
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,200
first 40 days of this

998
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:33,119
mainly soy bean you

999
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:36,640
as on demand but we have to enter

1000
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,240
spraying for the fungicides mainly to

1001
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,200
protect from

1002
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,680
ferrous in asia i don't know how to say

1003
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,520
that in

1004
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:48,960
english it's a very important

1005
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,920
disease we have in soybean and

1006
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,680
yeah do you they have so i've been roast

1007
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,079
like let's say like that i don't know in

1008
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,400
the

1009
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,440
in the united states they they don't

1010
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,319
have this

1011
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,760
we have uh this roast and we have to

1012
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:05,760
protect from that

1013
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,720
and at least 14 days each 14 days you

1014
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,200
are spraying

1015
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,440
and if you need to put something to

1016
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,400
control caterpillars you put if not you

1017
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,480
don't do it

1018
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,400
okay that's that's the main point as

1019
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,079
needed okay

1020
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,079
all right thank you for that um

1021
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,640
coming back to your integrated system

1022
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,800
since when

1023
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,720
exactly so you you mentioned in your

1024
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,480
presentation that you started to produce

1025
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,000
your own biological agents

1026
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:37,040
um in 2019 for the first time

1027
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,880
um and was 2019 actually

1028
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,880
also the first time that you actually

1029
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,760
used biological agents or did you start

1030
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,359
the usage

1031
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:48,240
already before some agents

1032
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,040
we were using before basil study genesis

1033
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:53,599
we use it

1034
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:56,880
a long time ago some some situations

1035
00:45:53,599 --> 00:46:00,319
but it was our our only usage

1036
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,200
so we buy like a d-pal i

1037
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,240
mentioned that my presentation i for a

1038
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,240
long time used

1039
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,359
the d-pal but the cost of the pail and

1040
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,480
the efficiency

1041
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:16,720
if compared to the the other

1042
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,720
doesn't make sense at that time and then

1043
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:24,960
we we were present to agro-biologica

1044
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,760
the company that gave us

1045
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,880
all the support to to produce on farm

1046
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,400
and we start from

1047
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:35,280
zero producing to using a whole area

1048
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,760
at the same year so we start because the

1049
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,599
cost

1050
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,599
allows us to do this

1051
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:46,079
okay um

1052
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,960
coming back just quickly once again to

1053
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,480
the um

1054
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,720
question of of the actual application um

1055
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,920
um one of the audience asks how many

1056
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,599
liters of water per hectare do you spray

1057
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,920
with the three to four liters of

1058
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,839
bacteria so

1059
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,280
in in your in your table that you showed

1060
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,000
in your presentation there was i think

1061
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,760
like

1062
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,359
you need three to four liters of product

1063
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,640
with how many liters of water would that

1064
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:13,599
be sprayed per hectare

1065
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,599
normally we we

1066
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,319
well yeah oh here you are again well we

1067
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,800
lost you for a second but you're back

1068
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,839
again

1069
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,400
thinking perfect okay normally each

1070
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:29,440
agent

1071
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,480
between three or four liters per hectare

1072
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,599
like if i you will use three agents

1073
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:39,040
normally between nine and twelve liters

1074
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,800
but they spray

1075
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,319
now we we can hear you we can hear you

1076
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,280
uh gregory you

1077
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,920
can continue talking we hear you so yeah

1078
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,480
by

1079
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:53,359
by the biological we use only by planes

1080
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:56,160
depending on the the amount of chemical

1081
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:59,359
and biological we are going to spray

1082
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:03,040
normally it goes from nine to fif

1083
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:06,880
to 18 liters of total

1084
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:09,440
of total uh

1085
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,040
total leaders per hectare total amounts

1086
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,319
yeah okay

1087
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,440
great so i think it's time for um one

1088
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:18,319
last question

1089
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,839
um that would be regarding um the

1090
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,359
economic effects

1091
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:23,520
so thank you very much first of all for

1092
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,240
sharing this profound insights on

1093
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,760
numbers

1094
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,920
with us and with the audience

1095
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,079
i mean when one looks at those savings

1096
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,559
that you mentioned

1097
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,680
one has to ask oneself why is not

1098
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,000
everybody doing it

1099
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,839
this way because the savings that you

1100
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,280
that you mentioned that you show are so

1101
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,079
obvious that that normally everybody

1102
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,960
would have to

1103
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,480
do it immediately the same way um so the

1104
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,599
question is

1105
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,440
is there any any negative effect that

1106
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:55,119
that comes along without saving so

1107
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:57,440
do you have a less turnover less revenue

1108
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,559
that you have to compare those savings

1109
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,559
with um

1110
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,079
or is it actually the true savings and

1111
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:06,160
and and it's it's just

1112
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:09,280
a positive effect very generally

1113
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:12,800
yes that is the only the savings i can

1114
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:16,559
measure by changing the chemical

1115
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:19,200
by changing the chemical by biological

1116
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,839
and the cost of this change because the

1117
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,240
rest is the equal and the efficiency

1118
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,960
we are having in the in the products we

1119
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,720
kept

1120
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:32,000
use are the same we are not

1121
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,480
there are a lot of effects of

1122
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,599
not don't when you use this you don't

1123
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,359
kill

1124
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:40,480
benefit uh benefit bugs you have in the

1125
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,200
crop

1126
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,000
and there are a lot of things i i the

1127
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,160
nematodes

1128
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,760
control that we are we are not

1129
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,880
mentioning this

1130
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,720
and so the difficult to to

1131
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,280
is not really the efficiency the

1132
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:58,640
efficiency when you have a

1133
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:01,280
synchronized production system

1134
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,720
are the same of chemical by with a lot

1135
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,920
of savings of money

1136
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,559
but the difficulties people to manage to

1137
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,599
have the

1138
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,440
the the control to produce the the

1139
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,640
agents on farm

1140
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,680
to build this so it's a it's it increase

1141
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,960
you

1142

1143
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,160
to deal with the problems you have to

1144
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,599
and

1145
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:28,319
another another another thing that is a

1146
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,920
manufacturer to do the biological

1147
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:33,359
products on farm

1148
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:35,119

1149
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:38,800

00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,200
um i think that was very very impressive

1153
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,280
to learn

1154
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,280
and get these insights from you um for

1155
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,720
me personally i learned that that that i

1156
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,760
think there's not that much

1157
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,520
um against um integrating biological

1158
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,520
control in your system and i think it's

1159
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:59,359
definitely worth looking closer to it

1160
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:01,760
here in the european union as well

1173
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,920
perspective

1174
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:35,440
