00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
so we're here in buber today delving

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,800
into the depths of the online soybean

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,279
manual we're here with agronomist and

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,960
Growers really looking at the whole

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,760
soybean production cycle so the online

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,599
soybean production manual is a really

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,679
effective tool for both agronomist and

9
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,519
Growers just looking at all areas of the

10
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:31,960
soybean production system it does

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,480
include lot of updated information to do

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,719
with both diseases storage every

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,320
different section of the soybean

14
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,320
production

00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:46,520
[Music]

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,120
process the consumption of soybean and

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,559
the processing of the soybeans in

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,039
Australia has changed back in the um 80s

19
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,840
whilst we had a crushing plant that was

20
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:59,079
a main focus but from the demise of that

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,559
sort of plant there was a more focus on

22
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:05,720
the edible type Market the edible Market

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,640
being the Asian influence of tofu and

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,880
also the introduction of soy milk as a

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,479
dairy alternative those two sort of

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,880
products have sort of paved the way for

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,560
additional high-end edible sort of

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,240
qualities uh the baking industry is is a

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,159
major sort of consumer of soybeans as

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,479
flour as an additive in the baking

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,920
process through improvers soybeans in

32
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:30,479
Australia grow from the the tropics all

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,880
the way down through into Victoria

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,000
uh your main production areas are

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,720
concentrated in the Southeast corner of

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Queensland where the major manufacturers

37
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,920
uh and processors are situated there is

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,439
still plenty of demand in the

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,439
marketplace in Australia we're still not

40
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,680
producing enough soybeans that's going

41
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:53,459
to meet all the market demand that we

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,459
[Music]

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,920
have so soybeans are a rotation option

44
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,920
in our Shan farming system so are really

45
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,200
a key pillar in in maintaining soil

46
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,560
Health in our Coastal farming systems

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,640
initially in the early days it was we

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,840
wen't promoting it initially as a grain

49
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,280
crop it was just to get Growers familiar

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,640
with it as a rotation crop in in the in

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,319
the sugar system so a lot of guys were

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,760
just green manuring it but then it

53
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,640
became very obvious that we could grow

54
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,280
it for

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,080
grining I was humbled at one event where

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,480
one grower stood up and mentioned that

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,480
you know unless he had grown soybeans

58
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,160
for grain as part of his his farming

59
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,560
system he still wouldn't be a cane

60
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,510
farmer today because it got him through

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,680
tough

62
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,680
[Music]

63
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,640
times in my role we're really looking at

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,400
how to store the soybeans most

65
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,519
effectively and trying to incorporate

66
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,120
that extra Avenue into farming

67
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,159
businesses in the

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,879
region storage in these sorts of regions

69
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,680
can be a bit tricky we often see them in

70
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,599
coastal or Northern regions and that's

71
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,720
where the relative humidity really comes

72
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,159
into play we often see that the

73
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,360
conditions can be a bit challenging for

74
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,400
storing soy beans so we really look to

75
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,239
go to a bit more uh technology in these

76
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,239
sorts of regions looking at automated

77
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,840
aeration controllers to really try and

78
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,840
overcome some of the issues with manual

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,959
aerations the manual itself came

80
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,599
together in about 2012 so I was due for

81
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,799
a refresh and now uh so it's been

82
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,400
reviewed refreshed brought up to date

83
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,120
and having it online it's an easy

84
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,040
mechanism for Growers advisors or

85
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,480
anybody Al like just be able to access

86
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,480
that most current up-to-date information

87
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,959
it's great that there's been a renewed

88
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,159
push from grdc and the Queensland

89
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,959
government to promote soybeans and I

90
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,159
think there's a real opportunity there

91
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,439
for other farming systems to consider

92
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,200
soybeans not just cane and it's the kind

93
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,200
of crop that people should be thinking

94
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,400
about using when they're changing

95
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,720
farming systems as a bit of a cleaning

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
up the padic so to speak but the benefit

97
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,239
is that you can also earn an income from

98
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,200
it I think it's just a win-win all

99
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,079
around I think it's a great crop I did

100
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,120
access the online manual before I came

101
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,159
to the workshop it sort of helped me

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,079
decide whether I needed to come or not

103
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,239
and I saw that there was plenty of extra

104
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,040
information and more detail that perhaps

105
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,319
hadn't been in older Publications so I

106
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,160
was really pleased with that and I

107
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,730
thought the online manual was quite easy

108
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,680
to

109
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:23,280
[Music]

110
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,520
use I found the workshop today and

111
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,680
yesterday absolutely brilliant I mean

112
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,520
some of it I sort of knew before I've

113
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,720
heard before of course but a lot of it

114
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,720
was is a great refresher some of those

115
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,199
little gems of wisdom that you sometimes

116
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,080
forget uh but also because the speakers

117
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,800
have been given plenty of time to talk

118
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,639
they've gone into quite a lot of detail

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,000
of their various subjects which has been

120
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,800
brilliant because often when you talk to

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,080
them it's on the fly or they do a quick

122
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,160
presentation at a field day whereas this

123
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,919
has been a lot more in depth and then

124
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,800
we've of course got their great notes to

125
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,800
refer back

126
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
to glob

127
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,680
soybeans are a new crop for me so it's

128
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,600
been awesome to see like the whole

129
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,960
picture of soybeans right from planting

130
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,440
all the way to marketing at the end of

131
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,440
the season yeah it's been

132
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,280
fantastic the online manual is really

133
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,440
good it's so easy to get through and you

134
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,639
can see all the modules really easy just

135
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,560
there click on them and go through all

136
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,560
the information it's great
