1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,160
well i think today i'm uh trying to get some\h
work done on this farm gate i uh kind of started\h\h

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:16,000
looking at it the other day as to what needs to\h
get salvaged and you know what's gonna work going\h\h

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
forward with it do i even have enough pieces\h
to salvage and i think at this point there's\h\h

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,680
probably enough pieces left over where i can\h
fasten it together get it built the proper way

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:43,840
so i think we're gonna start working on that

6
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,880
well after going through all the material i\h
have more than enough for what i want to do\h\h

7
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,240
which worked out pretty nice i was a little bit\h
worried the truck hit the fence pretty hard so it\h\h

8
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:33,120
actually uh it split the original two gates into\h
four gates and uh so once i got a look at that\h\h

9
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,960
and got it all cut up um i i think i have enough\h
here to do the two small gates that i want to do\h\h

10
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,520
heck i might even be able to save some of this\h
stuff and uh maybe for some future projects or\h\h

11
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,680
something but we'll just have to wait and\h
see how that goes so for now i'm going to\h\h

12
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,800
focus on just making these two small gates um\h
the original gates i think were either eight\h\h

13
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,440
foot or ten foot i can't remember exactly but\h
uh these are going to be a little bit smaller\h\h

14
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,800
i think the overall dimension of each gate is\h
going to be about 45 inches or so so we'll get\h\h

15
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:21,840
cutting up and measuring on this stuff and start\h
figuring out where all the welds are going to be

16
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,040
well we made it to the halfway point uh\h
one's done so got one more to go but so\h\h

17
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,600
far it's going pretty good uh we'll get after\h
it and uh hopefully wrap this thing up soon

18
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,960
well i just spent 10 minutes looking for\h
my earplugs and uh they're around my neck\h\h

19
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,840
so that's good time well spent

20
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,160
let's talk about these welds i'm not a\h
professional welder i i don't have any formal\h\h

21
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,440
training and being a welder i had a few repairs\h
i wanted to do around here so i went on amazon\h\h

22
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,800
about 100 welder and uh watched a few\h
youtube videos these welds aren't going\h\h

23
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,720
in any museum anytime soon they don't\h
need to be perfect it's for a fence\h\h

24
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,080
as long as they hold together i'll\h
be happy so i encourage you if\h\h

25
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,520
you have something you want to fix around the\h
house or you want learn how to weld you know 100\h\h

26
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,640
isn't that much to spend to get started uh watch\h
some youtube videos there's a lot of guys on\h\h

27
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:41,840
here that know what they're talking about and uh\h
you too can do pretty crappy welds just like me

28
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,840
so
