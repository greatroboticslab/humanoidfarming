00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:10,359
Hey. Hey. Look at here. Look at here. Oh

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,359
my gosh. Heck yeah. Heck yeah.

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,880
So, typical Oklahoma. We recently had

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,880
some thunderstorms, some rain, and uh we

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,679
was in Oklahoma City for a wedding and

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,480
it was snowing up there. Just don't

7
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,559
count out April. Well, me and the girls

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,640
pull up to the ranch. I noticed a turkey

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,640
pin has moved a little bit and I saw

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,960
something standing outside the front of

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
it and I was like, we've got a turkey

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:52,039
out. There's a hen on the outside of the

13
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,559
[Music]

14
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,480
pit. Think that water gap is okay,

15
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,160
Jessie? Yeah, we'll go check that water

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,160
gap. This is

17
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,920
Interesting. Bison already been

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,520
here. Well, look at

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,400
that. I think the water got up just a

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,400
tad. This is our normal

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,400
crossing. There's some of them cedars I

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,320
cut down or somebody cut down.

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,600
It's something that you cut down. I

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,360
don't know. It depends on where it came

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,920
from. I don't think it could be

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,920
anything.

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Maybe

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah. Always a good time to look for

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,520
arrowheads. All right.

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,520
Well, guess we'll go around

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,880
it. We go around it. Oh, yeah. They

32
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,200
come. Well, they're not out. That's

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,280
good. Oh, there they are. Yeah. That's

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,360
They heard us. Positive is that they're

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,500
in here. Oh, they're excited to see us.

36
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,200

going to come jumping in here and then

that's what they probably do to wolves

108
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,919
our sponsor today, AG1. So, I do a lot

109
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,319
of my video editing and taking care of

110
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,919
everything early in the morning, social

111
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,240
media wise. It's one of the first things

112
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,720
that I do and something I do before I

113
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,199
drink my cup of coffee as I start with

114
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,280
AG1. Don't get me wrong, I love coffee.

115
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,919
Coffee can sometimes lead to crashes in

116
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,319
the afternoon. AG1 is going to fill in

117
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,319
the gaps with whole food nutrients that

118
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,160
your body needs on a daily basis to keep

119
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,639
me energized and going through the rest

120
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,240
of the day. Or maybe I'm don't get so

121
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,919
hungry in the afternoons or in the

122
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,479
evenings. If so, if you start your day

123
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,720
off with water or any type of juice,

124
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,199
little secret, you can add orange juice

125
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,440
or pineapple juice with your AG1. It's

126
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,360
pretty good. Get a scoop of AG1, throw

127
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,919
it in there with your water or your

128
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,479
juice before your coffee, which I highly

129
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,360
suggest. Shake it up and you're set.

130
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,760
Over 75 vitamins and minerals just in

131
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,880

132
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,720
healthy bacteria in our gut.

133
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,839
So, what comes in your starter packet is

134
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,839
the AG1 can, the powder, also comes with

135
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,760
this really neat bottle. It also comes

136
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,839
with a solid scoop to get all that

137
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,440
goodness. Comes with the liquid vitamin

138
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,680
supplement. And don't forget about your

139
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
to-go packets. When you put the powder

140
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,040
in your can, and make sure you keep it

141
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,200

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,399
is out in the burn unit and this cover

160
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,839
crop is growing so good and so crazy

161
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,959
right now because the moisture we've

162
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,440
had, uh we decided to let our breeding

163
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,320
bulls and uh some other bulls that we

164
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,880
raised and we are selling uh for breed

165
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,959
bulls. So, these are incoming 2-year-old

166
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,120
bulls, including our knucklehead

167
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,680
blackjack. He'll join the Big Joe herd

168
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,839
eventually again. But this cover crop is

169
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,640
doing so well, we just let them in here

170
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,079
and let them graze some of

171
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,290
it. Meanwhile, the chickens are hanging

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,320

00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,680
it. Got two turkey eggs, guys.

186
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,160
I must had a wild party. What What are

187
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,120
you doing in What are you doing in

188
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,800
here? Oh

189
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,760
gosh. You do not belong in here. Okay,

190
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,760
there's the hen. Maybe

191
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,200
she'll come

192
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,240
around. You guys are going underneath

193
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,760
it. Not Not right

194
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,920
now. Jeez. Let's see if I can get this

195
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,320
hen to come around these chickens.

196
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,200
Get

197
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,839
back. Don't want the whole group

198
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,839
out. This is going to be

199
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,639
challenging.

200
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,639
Get back.

201
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,720
Keep coming,

202
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,720
Hen. Keep

203
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:02,480
coming. Oh, keep

204
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,480
coming. Oh, just a little bit. Dang

205
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,639
it. Take a lot of risk right here. The

206
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,639
gobbler, he can see it.

207
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,519
Oh, come on in.

208
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,480
is about to escape.

209
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:18,480
[Music]

210
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,480
Come on, Hen. Make your way

211
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,120
around. This is quite the

212
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,320
challenge. All right, so I'm going to

213
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,320
set these eggs down right

214
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,620
here. That gate just

215
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,600
shut. Let's move this pin a

216
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,800
[Music]

217
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,519
little. Have to move this. I got the

218
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,150
wheels up.

219
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,169
So nice this thing rolls like it

220
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,169
[Music]

221
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,839
does chatter

222
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,720
bugs. All

223
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,920
right, we got to get you back in here,

224
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,920
girl. It's your

225
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,880
family. There we go.

226
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,959
Oh, there's another

227
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,959
one. Oh, we got to be easy.

228
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,530
[Music]

229
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,800
Look at there. So, I made a box for him

230
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,800
a couple days

231
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:01,680
ago. Let's see

232
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,480
if this open for her.

233
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,480
She's hanging out with the

234
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,199
chickens. Keep going around,

235
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:16,720
hun. She's taking a

236
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,720
ris. She wants to come back over

237
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,360
here. Let me put these eggs back in

238
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,360
here.

239
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,800
Oh, lookucky there. Lucky

240
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,880
there. Oh, don't escape. Please get get

241
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,880
out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Not for

242
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,880
y'all.

243
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,480
Oh dear.

244
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,520
Put that

245
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,679
there. Shoo. Shoo. Shoo. Shoot.

246
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,520
Okay,

247
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:59,120
Hen. Oh,

248
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:59,120
yes. Hen is back in. Now, what I want to

249
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:06,919
do is I got to This needs to really be

250
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,799
in that corner over

251
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,160
there since they're laying eggs

252
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,080
now. At least she's back in here. That's

253
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,520
good.

254
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,320
go ahead and get feed for him. So, I'm

255
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,559
assuming when I came up here first, one

256
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,320
of the wheels was lifted up on this.

257
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,520
Must have got enough wind from the

258
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,240
storms here recently to lift it up and

259
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,240
she was able to get underneath it and

260
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,000
kind of escape like these chickens were

261
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,480
coming in a while ago. It's get

262
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,480
underneath it. So, when you lower these

263
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:43,120
wheels, see, now it's completely flat.

264
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,720
The wind must have picked it up enough

265
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,360
Now I've got it pushed up against this

266
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,360
trailer right

267
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:57,039
now. Now it's completely level to the

268
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,600
ground. Must have happened. But she's

269
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,320
back in. And this is so exciting. So,

270
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,799
the question is, guys, do we let the

271
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,039
hens, they just keep laying them? I put

272
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:20,160
a box in here and they keep laying the

273
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:23,039
eggs um just out in the middle. And so,

274
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,200
I don't know what to do. Um I need some

275
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,320
help here. Do we go ahead and collect

276
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,520
all these eggs and start the incubator?

277
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,400
Do we do that? Or my intention was to

278
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,160
let them naturally sit on these eggs

279
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,400
once they had their clutches and would

280
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,360
have them naturally and set on them. And

281
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:47,200
turkeys take 28 days uh to hatch

282
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,960
compared to a chick uh which is 21. So,

283
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,200
need your help, need your guidance. We

284
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,919
do have some incubators or do we let

285
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,600
them have them naturally? It's a chance.

286
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,120
It's a risk. Whatever you do, it doesn't

287
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,760
matter. You're dealing with a wild

288
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,080
turkey egg. I do know that it is hard to

289
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,520
incubate. I've heard that. So, anyways,

290
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,440
you guys let us know what you think. So,

291
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,400
why we kept these guys was for this

292
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,919
right

293
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,919
here. We wanted to keep these three

294
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,000
hands and four toms so that we could get

295
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,320
lots of these right here. We could hatch

296
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,960
them out, raise them up till about 3 or

297
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,120
4 months old and then let them all go at

298
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,000
the ponderosa. We wanted a larger flock.

299
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,640
So, that was the whole point of it is

300
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,320
right here. And it's so satisfying to

301
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:34,000
see this and so exciting to see it as

302
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,080
well. Next stage is probably incubation

303
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,840
more than likely because the hens aren't

304
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,760
setting. I want to give a big thanks to

305
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,280
