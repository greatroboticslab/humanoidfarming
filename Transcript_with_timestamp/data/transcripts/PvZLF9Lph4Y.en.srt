1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:07,639
I'm Mike MC from coltech energy uh our

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:11,320
company has been involved in developing

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:15,279
gasification projects since uh

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:19,600
2000 uh in 2003 we installed our first

5
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:25,760
system um and since then have gone

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:30,080
through a almost a continual upgrade of

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,680
Technologies uh probably the most in

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,640
most widely known system that we've

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:41,280
installed was in 2007 at fry poultry uh

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,719
if anyone has seen Dr Layman's video

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,079
aise of biochar or read his book that

12
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,960
unit is is shown in in both of those uh

13
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:55,000
both of those articles um what you see

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,600
on the screen is the latest of our of

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,640
our systems U this is kind of a

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,439
generation four the first three units or

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,080
the first three systems were were wood

18
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,920
based biochars I mean they were

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,880
developed gas fires they were developed

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:16,560
to process wood and we modified them to

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,080
to handle manur or more difficult fuels

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,799
um

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,320
after coming to the conclusion that that

24
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,439
biochar was a was an important piece of

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,960
the economics of of any project going

26
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:32,960
forward uh we set out and and designed a

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,159
system that was specifically designed to

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,040
handle manures and some of the more

29
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,600
difficult fuels and also produce a

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,119
consistent quality

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,640
biochar uh this unit pictured was

32
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:49,320
installed in late

33
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,159
2012 in Ohio it's on a farm that houses

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,600
approximately 4,500

35
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:57,240
cows and this unit can process

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,399
approximately 50 tons a day of

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,600
calor um at that facility they are

38
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,920
they're bringing manure and a

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,360
combination of manure and bedding uh

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,720
into a dedicated manure Barn between 35

41
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,480
and 50,000 tons a year uh we are taking

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,599
that material and drying it in a rotary

43
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,640
dryer to produce both animal bedding and

44
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:28,959
produce fuel for the gasifier and then

45
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:31,800
we are putting Cal or dried to 20 to 25%

46
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,920
moisture into the system producing the

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,560
energy to to operate the dryer and

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,560
producing a consistent quality

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,920
biochar now gasification is a thermal

50
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,800
process reacting carbon based fuels in

51
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,959
an oxygen starved

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,959
environment typically the sh gas

53
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,720
produced in the gasifier is then

54
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,120
combusted in a thermal

55
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,840
oxidizer um you know there are there are

56
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,120
systems out there that are taking S gas

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,319
and firing it directly in a

58
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,480
reciprocating engine but they're

59
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:08,760
operating with um processed wood they're

60
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,239
operating with a more consistent

61
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,040
fuel manure manure is not a consistent

62
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,680
fuel the composition varies and so the S

63
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,440
gas varies so it becomes very

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:26,080
problematic to try to to utilize the S

65
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,239
gas directly um we just add add enough

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,319
air and combust it in a thermal oxidizer

67
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,760
and then utilize the Heat

68
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,920
the product of gasification is is heat

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,360
and

70
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,799
biochar unlike paralysis paralysis they

71
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,159
also produce an oil and and we do not we

72
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:48,000
just we just produce a hot air product

73
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:51,200
and and a solid solid product form of

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,200
biochar our unit is a fixed bed

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,920
gasifier we do not have a fluidized bed

76
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,000
the material sits flat on the on the

77
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,720
floor of the

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,159
unit we inter ruce a controlled amount

79
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,680
of air in a

80
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,079
controlled Zone inside the gasifier to

81
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,400
provide the oxygen star

82
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,640
environment typically we are producing

83
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,560
mostly carbon monoxide inside the gas

84
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,919
fire and it's when we add air in the in

85
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,000
the thermal oxidizer then we're

86
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:24,759
converting carbon monoxide to carbon

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,919
dioxide and inside the gas viral our

88
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,440
temperatures in in the air inside the

89
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:32,919
gasar typically range between a th000

90
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,919
and 1500 degrees

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,240
F the the feed rates and the biochar

92
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,440
removal rates inside the gas fire are

93
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,360
controlled through variable frequency

94
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,600
drives so that allows us to control not

95
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,160
only the the input and so control the

96
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,720
throughput of the material but because

97
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,759
the the feed of the of the the feed rate

98
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,680
of the raw material is independent from

99
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,360
the feed of the bio Char coming out of

100
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,919
the machine so it gives us the ability

101
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,560
to control the retention time of the

102
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,919
biochar so we can impact the biochar

103
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,000
quality as well as in as control the

104
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:17,199
throughput and the energy

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
output we also have the our air fans are

106
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,880
on fre variable frequency drives so they

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,759
also can be modulated

108
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,080
to VAR the frut and energy

109
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,880
output and you know the one of the the

110
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,319
keys to being able to control the amount

111
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,560
of air in addition to uh starving it for

112
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,840
oxygen the minimal amount of air inside

113
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,520
the gas fire also allows us to control

114
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,240
particulate carryover so it it gives us

115
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,240
a cleaner emission

116
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,280
stream biochar is the carbon Rich

117
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,000
product obtained when biomass is heated

118
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,080
in in a closed container either oxygen

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,720
starred or oxygen free either

120
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,960
gasification or

121
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,840
paralysis gasification produces a

122
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,479
mineral that a material that contains

123
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,520
mineral ash from the feed stock as well

124
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,680
as the the fixed carbon and which will

125
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,120
be in the form of a carbon

126
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,800
Char and then this this carbon is

127
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,960
transformed into a very absorbent

128
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,520
material that has charged particles

129
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,039
which attracts nutrients and moisture

130
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:31,919
and the the ability of this

131
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:34,000
carbon changes dramatically with the

132
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,599
different minerals that are that are as

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,759
they part of the the biochar

134
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:42,319
itself um biomass materials contain

135
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,360
carbon two forms it's either in in the

136
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,360
form of fixed carbon or B of

137
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,120
matter and what we do is we react the

138
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,280
carbon in the volatile matter which

139
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,000
creates the energy and then try to leave

140
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,680
as much of the fixed carbon behind in a

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,919
biochar um typically volatiles start

142
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,360
acting at around 400° and fixed carbon

143
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,800
is usually closer to to 1,400 so it's a

144
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,000
i it's a very temperature driven

145
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,960
process due to the high temperatures and

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,039
retention

147
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,360
time biochar from Maneuvers are free

148
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:22,080
from pathogen ecoli growth hormones and

149
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,960
residues for medication so it it

150
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,479
provides an outlet for for a processed

151
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,160
product coming out of manur that that

152
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,479
otherwise Farmers don't have have the

153
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,479
outlet

154
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:41,560
for typically wood has between 2 to 5%

155
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:45,080
mineral asash and 20 to 25% fixed

156
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,639
carbon so when you're producing biochar

157
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,879
from wood uh you're going to have a very

158
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,360
high carbon

159
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,360
content if if you retain all the fixed

160
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,599
carbon you're going to be as high as 80

161
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,120
90% of carbon in the

162
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,440
biochar but wood has relatively few

163
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,319
Nutri

164
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,639
so you you have little nutrients in the

165
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:09,240
biochar it is predominantly just

166
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,639
Carbon on the other hand when we gasify

167
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,639
manures typically the manures will be

168
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:19,240
anywhere between 15 to 30% mineral Ash

169
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:24,159
and between six to 18% fixed

170
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:27,120
carbon so our biochar will be about a 20

171
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:29,840
to 25% carbon

172
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,479
product but the rest of that the the the

173
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,880
mineral Ash that's contained in that

174
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:36,039
biochar contains an array of of

175
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,159
beneficial nutrients it's nitrogen

176
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:41,240
phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium

177
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:45,039
and and a lot of trace minerals that are

178
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,039
that are beneficial both in soils and in

179
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,160
feeds the composition of of manure

180
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:53,279
biochar varies with the animal type and

181
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,680
diet and the levels of the various

182
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:59,760
nutrients change but their benefits do

183
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,839
not um for example poultry biochar will

184
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,200
have a high percentage of calcium

185
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:09,760
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium egg

186
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,800
layer biochar will be extremely high in

187
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,160
calcium due to the amount of calcium

188
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,519
they feed the birds to produce strong

189
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,800
eggshells calet or biochar will have a

190
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,839
higher level of of

191
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:26,399
magnesium and we're doing a lot of work

192
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:30,000
with um solid separation systems with

193
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,240
both swine and calor uh to try to retain

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,399
more of those nutrients in the solid

195
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,519
fraction so we're even increasing the

196
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,399
level of those nutrients when we're

197
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,880
producing biochar from those

198
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,399
products but but these nutrients all

199
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,079
provide different benefits uh whether

200
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:50,880
it's in the soil whether it's uh heavy

201
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:52,560
metal capture um the

202
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,720
different

203
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,800
nutrients all have different reactions

204
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,079
so there's they provide different

205
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,560
benefits so they provide different

206
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:03,000
applications for the biochar

207
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,560
and for biochars made from specific SE

208
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,360
seed stocks based on those nutrients um

209
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,079
was one of the slides that that Kurt had

210
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,120
earlier there was mentioned designer

211
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,240
biochar if you are

212
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,680
producing biocharge from different manur

213
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,920
or even manur and wood or agricultural

214
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,959
debris uh you will have different

215
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,959
qualities of biocharge just because of

216
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,480
the feed stocks and it allows you to be

217
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:36,240
able to to blend those biochars and and

218
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,240
create designer biochars for specific

219
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,760
needs the vast majority of biochars if

220
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,519
you read through Publications and

221
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,880
research are have been produced from

222
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:52,720
wood um quite frankly because Wood's a

223
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:57,800
very simple material to to gasify or

224
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,639
pize mans can can present problems so

225
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,680
most Technologies are designed for

226
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:06,480
wood um biochar made mother fuels such

227
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,560
as manur not only have a value as a

228
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,399
biochar but also provide an

229
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,200
environmental value as they provide a

230
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,560
method of disposing materials that are

231
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,120
creating issues um you know last year

232
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,880
city of Toledo had green water for four

233
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,560
days um you know the ches Bay has dead

234
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,279
zones the Gulf of Mexico has dead zones

235
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,720
and agriculture is not the only Factor

236
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:34,680
but it it's a contrib ruting factor

237
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:39,320
to to the algae blooms in all those

238
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:42,000
areas and finding a an outlet for those

239
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,040
manur other than land

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,600
application gives us an opportunity to

241
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,440
not only produce biochars which are

242
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,959
beneficial environmentally but but

243
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,639
eliminate some of the disposal issues

244
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,639
that are creating environmental

245
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:57,760
problems um you biochar has has

246
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,240
applications in a wide array of uses

247
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,000
whether it's so Amendment speed s

248
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,880
complements water

249
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,399
filtration soil

250
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,279
remediation odor moisture control I mean

251
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,800
it's it's amazing the the different

252
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,760
characteristics it has and the different

253
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,880
benefits it has in in in a variety of

254
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,800
uses and then when you on top of that if

255
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,399
you produce biochar from different feed

256
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,639
stocks and end up with a different array

257
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,040
of nutrients and different results then

258
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:31,160
you even increase the range of

259
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,160
opportunities and and effectiveness

260
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,160
in my opinion in order to make a

261
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,360
significant impact in the world biot

262
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:43,480
must be produced in large

263
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,959
volumes and and our relief

264
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,959
is producing it with feed stock such as

265
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:52,560
manur is a has a higher likelihood of

266
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:56,600
success um because those feed stocks

267
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:01,199
exist in large volumes and typically

268
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:03,839
they're concentrated in in in specific

269
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:05,560
regions um egg layers are in a certain

270
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,480
area

271
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,040
and daes are in certain areas and so

272
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,000
they they have a a very high

273
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,760
concentration of manures in those areas

274
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,600
and so disposal is is a bigger and

275
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,600
bigger issue every day

276
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,240
um but from a project developers point

277
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,279
of

278
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,120
view biochar provides an even different

279
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,480
value and that's

280
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,279
economics waste energy projects have

281
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,000
been developed for years and most of

282
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,680
them are in the field somewhere rusting

283
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,600
down uh they fail miserably or they have

284
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,560
subsidies to to allow them to

285
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:49,519
survive um because they are developed

286
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,199
for the energy component alone the key

287
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,399
to making these projects successful is

288
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,920
multiple revenue

289
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,959
streams just a very few and and we've

290
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,759
seen a few but a very few can survive on

291
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,040
single

292
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,480
stream um biochar can provide a

293
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,759
significant Revenue

294
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,240
stream um not always can it carry a

295
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,399
project by

296
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:15,079
itself but as a as one of a one of a

297
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,000
multiple of revenue streams it can make

298
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,600
the economic strong enough to make a

299
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,279
project

300
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,199
profitable from a technical

301
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:27,040
standpoint we don't believe developing

302
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:29,680
these projects is is extremely

303
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,839
difficult but raising the

304
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:37,320
is uh and education and biochar is

305
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,240
extremely critical because having a

306
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,160
having the established value for biochar

307
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,639
opens up a lot of funding

308
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:48,680
opportunities and and getting

309
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,240
sales getting sale prices uh is a is a

310
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,639
key component to to making these

311
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,639
projects

312
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,279
successful um typical

313
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,240
projects the unit that was pictured in

314
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:03,440
the first slide that is our standard

315
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,880
operating unit operating 247 it'll

316
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,399
process between 15 and 20,000 tons of

317
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:12,320
manure a year at an input moisture

318
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,320
somewhere between 20 and

319
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,079
30% poultry uh groer manure bro litter

320
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,639
turkey

321
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,880
litter coming out of the barns they are

322
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,800
in that moisture range so they can be

323
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:31,000
directly input into the gas

324
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:34,680
fire cow manure and Swine or require

325
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,519
some drying um either as we're doing in

326
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,160
Ohio just through a rotary dryer or the

327
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,759
the very high moisture contents require

328
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,759
some solid separation prior to

329
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:50,480
drying systems handling w calure we can

330
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,440
process 60 to 70,000 tons per year with

331
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,399
a single

332
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,759
gasifier so it gives you an idea of the

333
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,000
the size of of those systems and and

334
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:05,079
just rough numbers

335
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,360
that equates to about a 5,000 Cal

336
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:11,319
Dairy um biochar production with these

337
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,920
systems will be between three and 5,000

338
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:15,519
tons a year um and that depends on the

339
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,480
composition of the manure how how much

340
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,160
Ash is in it and and how fresh it is and

341
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,480
there's several variables but it will be

342
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,000
in that

343
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:28,639
range um and the use for the

344
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,079
energy can vary anywhere from using the

345
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,880
Heat to dry to heating buildings to

346
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,480
producing steam producing power

347
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,759
absorption chillers uh I mean we are

348
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,440
producing hot air and virtually every

349
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,240
energy

350
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,959
application that's

351
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,759
used starts off with a full of hot air

352
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:54,040
so I mean there are readily

353
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,319
available equipment that can be bed on

354
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,560
the back end for for the energy

355
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,360
application um you know in our

356
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,920
experience almost every project is

357
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,880
unique each customer has unique needs

358
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,520
and

359
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,760
conditions and but this system is very

360
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,720
flexible and and when we develop

361
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,760
projects they are tailored to the

362
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,120
individual needs of the customer whether

363
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,919
that's on the front end on their needs

364
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,079
of getting rid of material or or

365
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,520
processing material or on the back end

366
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,439
for what they can use the energy for or

367
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,319
or the biochar or additional byproducts

368
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,840
such as such as animal

369
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:33,640
betting um you know being able to

370
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,160
produce a solid product like a biochar

371
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,240
versus having a raw manure to handle or

372
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,440
or even a

373
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,919
digestate has huge environmental and

374
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,919
economic benefits
