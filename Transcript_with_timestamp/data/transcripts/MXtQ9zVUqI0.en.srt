1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,960
pest risk analysis is the process of

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,800
evaluating biological or other

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,200
scientific and economic evidence to

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,799
determine whether an organism is a pest

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,720
if it should be regulated and the

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,340
strength of any phytosanitary measures

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,080
to be taken against it

[Music]

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,840
it is a science-based process that

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,160
provides the rationale for determining

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,760
appropriate phytosanitary measures to

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,359
protect the plant resources of a

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,120
specified area

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,760
pest risk analysis is one of the

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,079
available tools for agriculture trade

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,680
food security and the environment as it

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,520
helps countries to protect their plant

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,079
resources from pests and fulfill their

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,079
international obligations

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,160
pest risk analysis is conducted to

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,920
evaluate and manage risks from specific

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,239
pests and internationally traded

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,399
commodities it identifies and assesses

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,800
risks to agricultural and horticultural

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,120
plant pests

[Music]

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,040
it impacts all aspects of a country's

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,720
plant protection or plant quarantine

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,240
program because it provides the

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,080
information needed to determine an

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,960
appropriate course of action in a given

33

situation

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,880
it can be regarded as a process to

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,200
answer these questions

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,720
is the organism a pest

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,759

how much economic damage including

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,560
environmental and social will it cause

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,799
what can be done to mitigate

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,280
unacceptable impacts

43
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,960
pest risk analysis supports various

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,360
types of national or sub-national

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,520
programs including surveillance programs

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,680
eradication programs establishing

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,520
pest-free areas and supporting exports

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,560
of agricultural commodities to other

49
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,640
countries

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,720
however the most common application of

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,399
pest risk analysis is to establish

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,920
appropriate import requirements to

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,560
prevent the introduction and spread of

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,960
regulated pests

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,040
pest risk analysis is a useful means of

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,759
evaluating and informing various types

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,079
of policy to predict likely outcomes

58
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,080
evaluate efficacy or provide other

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,759
insights into policies and programs

protection organizations

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,640
these should adopt international

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,040
standards for phytosanitary measures and

64
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,040
pest risk analysis as a key part of the

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,120
decision-making process when it comes to

66
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,879
establishing phytosanitary measures and

67
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,280
regulations for plants and plant

national plant protection organizations

70
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,640
use pest risk analysis for a variety of

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,519
reasons

72
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,720

protection organization must carry out

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,959
can be supported by pest risk analysis

82
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,519
from making decisions on how to spend
