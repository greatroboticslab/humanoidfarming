would like to turn our attention to Mr.
Bowers Mr. Bowers also participated on

32
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,020
the seminar he's been an acquaintance of
mine now for the past two years and he

33
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,100
brought out something at our conference
that I think should be brought to the

34
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,989
attention of almost every American and
Mr. Bowers I wonder if you'd tell the

35
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,950
folks at this time about their red
school houses and the little white

36
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:09,810
churches well at this conference someone
brought up the point that no one had

37
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:16,980
ever made a study any research study of
the importance of the single family unit

38
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:25,260
on a small farm to the economy of
America talking about dropping the small

39
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,209
family unit off of farms going to big
farms now what was the value of this

40
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:38,790
small family unit well I say that there
has been a research project in progress

41
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:45,930
in this particular agricultural area for
the last 100 years we had a group of

42
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,450
people start moving into this rich
Mississippi Valley a hundred years ago

43
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,440
and all it distinguished these people
from any other people on earth was the

44
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,640
fact that they were bringing with them
little white churches and little red

45
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:06,180
school houses a million of them settled
in Nebraska before 1900 two million are

46
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,090
settled in Kansas and half a million in
North Dakota and half a million

47
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:17,169
in South Dakota and Iowa and Missouri
and Minnesota and the other states of

48
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:21,669
this rich Mississippi Valley and they
all had distinguished them from people

49
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:27,460
of other parts of the earth was that
they had a certain devotion symbolized

50
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,960
by little white churches and little red
school houses to the principles of the

51
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,970
freedom that we have in our private
enterprise system in the United States

52
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:42,940
that has not followed anywhere else on
earth and what happened we had an

53
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,860
explosion in this Mississippi Valley
that are just as astounding as an

54
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:54,130
explosion of an atom bomb in a hundred
years in this Mississippi Valley we have

55
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,500
built the greatest breadbasket of all
history the greatest corn belt the

56
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,120
greatest wheat belt the greatest cattle
belt the greatest cotton belt of the

57
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:11,199
entire earth right here in this
Mississippi Valley and not only on top of

58
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,610
that we have produced some of the most
brilliant scientists of the entire earth

59
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,520
there are more Nobel Prize winners great
scientists have compliments agricultural

60
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,740
States any other single spot on earth
from the little red school houses 

61
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,010
little red school houses and little
white churches they started from that

62
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:35,080
background in other words that's been in
your estimation the key to the fantastic

63
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,700
growth of the American society in our
economy it is demonstrated to the world

64
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:45,910
what individual human personalities can
do with a proper individual education

65
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,710
and with the proper spiritual values in
their hearts and minds well thank you

66
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,099
I'm sure we'll be back to you before the
program is over at this time I'd like to

67
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:58,870
turn to the other end of the table an
interview Mr. Harry Rash who has been

68
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:04,539
very much concerned for a number of
years in agriculture and also the

69
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:08,050
economy of estate in Kansas and the
nation as well

70
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,030
Mr. Rash you've spent considerable time
and research you've also worked with the

71
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,510
agricultural committee for the
independent bankers I'd like to have you

72
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:23,120
briefly tell about your research and
make whatever statement or  

73
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,889
observations on our conference at this time

74
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:35,180
well first I'd like to make a statement
regarding the economy of Kansas in 1965

75
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,280
the farm production in Kansas had a
value of a billion and a half dollars

76
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:49,639
which was the third greatest on record
still they realize cash net income was a

77
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:57,680
decrease from the previous year the
realized net cash income the proposition

78
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,330
of trying to make people realize the
dependence of the welfare of the entire

79
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:10,789
economy of the state and the nation on
the price and production of agricultural

80
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:15,830
products seems to be one of the hardest
tasks that I ever ever saw kind

81
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:21,940
accomplished at this conference it was
brought out the relationship of the

82
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:29,120
agricultural production and price to the
national economy in Kansas for jobs out

83
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,030
of ten are dependent upon agriculture

84
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:43,389
I come from southeast Kansas a little
town of fair where I've lived all my

85
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:51,639
life Neosho County I'm at present a
member of the southeast Kansas Regional

86
00:07:51,639 --> 00:08:00,090
Planning Commission appointed by
governor of Kansas to make forecast for

87
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:06,400
the future of our area I happen to be on
the Agricultural Commission because of

88
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:18,340
my interest the forecasts of population
trends the records on the population in

89
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:24,419
Kansas show that we've had a greater as
great an out migration as we have of the

90
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:35,500
new births in Kansas the a the age of
the farm population has- is over the 50

91
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,930
mark the rest of the nation I believe they
say the average age is 25 Harry can ask

92
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:46,540
one question most industries the
strength from the growth of most

93
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,820
industries is based on the number of
young people that enter this specific

94
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,130
business or industry and as a banker now
what's the future of young people

95
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,260
entering agriculture with the present
price structure from your observation

96
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,060
they required investment is such that
the young person cannot enter

97
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,430
agriculture that is a sad part
the farmers are actually telling their

98
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:18,010
own sons that you shouldn't be entering
agriculture that you have no future that

99
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:26,260
you will be underpaid and overworked do
you think that the trends that were

100
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,830
drifting towards is going to be the
answer the solution to agriculture in

101
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:37,380
America a large type farm of the
corporate type form the

102
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:44,949
the large type farm the corporate farm
cannot answer the problem we have a need

103
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:48,970
for more agricultural production in this
country than we actually are producing

104
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:57,040
the day of the so called surplus that's
a myth and a fantasy we are dependent

105
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:04,949
upon meat imports now to sustain our
need for meat

106
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:10,509
well Harry I'll get back to you again in
a minute at this time I'd like to call

107
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:17,079
on a good friend from South Dakota Ray
Dykeman you've attended our conference

108
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:21,970
here as an observer and you've also had
an opportunity to participate I'd like

109
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,970
to have you make whatever general
statements you have on mind and

110
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:31,989
relationship to agriculture in South
Dakota and where South Dakota is headed

111
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:38,819
unless we restore farm prices to balance
with wages and interest well I became

112
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:46,089
interested in the agricultural program
and the decline of rural America while I

113
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:52,209
was attending the University of South
Dakota in college in 1958 and since that

114
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:58,379
time I have been trying to discover what
are some of the answers to the farm

115
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:07,629
problem why did we not have enough farm
income to support the level of farming

116
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:12,549
that they had when I was a boy because
in the area that I grew up in south

117
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:19,419
central South Dakota near Gregory South
Dakota there were a lot more farms when

118
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:24,489
I was a boy than there are today so I
was trying to discover what the answers

119
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:30,339
to this problem are and by attending
this conference I got a lot of the

120
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:37,749
answers to why we've had this decline in
rural America and what it will really

121
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:46,329
mean if it continues take the period of
1946 to 1950 70% of South Dakota's earned

122
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:52,700
income- income came from agriculture
so to the fact that underpayment of

123
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:59,900
agriculture between 1951 the difference
between 1951 and 1965 South Dakota lost

124
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:06,050
one-nearly 1 billion dollars of earned
income and this is what I'm concerned

125
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,010
about the amount of earned income South
Dakota is losing because agriculture is

126
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,330
being underpaid today well now you had
an opportunity to associate yourself

127
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:21,230
with many of the other people who
attended this conference from your

128
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,670
observation what was their reaction to
the discussion that took place and

129
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:30,110
tracing out of the balance sheet and the
loss of income for the various states

130
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,030
and also the condition of our national
economy what what did the other people

131
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,230
think what was their observations in
your estimation the people that were

132
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,630
in attendance at that seminar yes I think
we can just about say that there was

133
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:50,570
100% agreement that they all agreed that
agriculture was being grossly underpaid

134
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:56,150
and due to this underpayment we were not
only undermining agriculture but we are

135
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,660
undermining the whole economic system in
the United States

136
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,350
did it shock many of them to learn the
condition of our not only the state

137
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,450
economy of their own state economy but
the national economy yes it did there

138
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:14,060
was a much concern written on many of
the faces of the people there they knew

139
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,590
there was a problem but they didn't know
it was as bad as it is today well now

140
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,010
one of the things that we did during
this seminar is we had the

141
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,990
representatives of each state figure out
the actual loss of total- total personal

142
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:33,650
income in 1965 and you mentioned that
South Dakota lost approximately 1

143
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:40,910
billion dollars some of the other states
Minnesota for instance lost two billion

144
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,290
two hundred and seventy five million
Kansas I believe Harry was short

145
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,650
approximately three billion was that
right a little over three billion it was

146
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:54,770
under that it was not a million three
yeah about a billion three hundred and

147
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,580
seventy five million

148
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,779
Iowa's lost was roughly four billion
dollars and the reason that the people

149
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,580
in all these states were unaware of this
loss of personal income is because

150
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,170
they've never prepared a balance sheet
on their own state economy so they don't

151
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,860
know where they've been
where they're headed or whether at and

152
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,230
at this time I'd like to turn our
attention to Mr. Carl Wilken research

153
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:28,110
analysts from Washington DC we call the
father of the balance sheet because he's

154
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,440
been keeping these records on the
national economy for for many years and

155
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,970
Mr. Wilken when did you first meet just
one minute be sure to make this point

156
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:45,750
that this loss that we're talking about
was just for the year 1966 one year the

157
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:51,709
loss in South Dakota was one nearly 1
billion dollars for the year 1965 the

158
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:57,089
1965 I think we better drive that one
home thank you for reminding me Carl

159
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:00,600
when did you first when did you prepare
your first balance sheet and what

160
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:07,860
induced you to make such a study and
what's going to happen if the American

161
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,890
people don't wake up and analyze the
records of our economy well briefly in

162
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:19,770
1929 I was operating a farm about 80
miles southeast of Sioux City and The

163
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:25,470
Economist said we were never going to
have a another depression 1932 I was

164
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,120
selling corn for 10 cents a bushel
well they triple-a program didn't

165
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,640
correct it so I was one of three men who
signed the Articles of Incorporation

166
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:41,250
setting up the raw materials National
Council and the that originated here in

167
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,910
Sioux City correct and it's still
incorporated right in Sioux City and

168
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:52,890
when Barry County in 1941 I prepared my
first balance sheet and as a result the

169
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:58,010
city is the birthplace as we push the
balance sheet this is ever prepared and

170
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,630
I've kept a balance sheet ever since
that time and

171
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:08,730
as you know what the seminar I presented
that balance sheet 48-50 as a base and

172
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,380
the 15 years which followed funded out
the audience how they could compute it

173
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:28,960
and haven't checked well now I know that
when the group worked out the lots of

174
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:35,500
income for private enterprise for
agriculture for the corporations and so

175
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,980
forth yesterday they were stunned from
memory could you could you call it the

176
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,490
the loss of national income and the loss
to corporations and private enterprise

177
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:51,580
during the past which ever period you'd
care to select well briefly in the 15

178
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,040
years following 48-50 we underpaid
agriculture in terms of gross realized

179
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,850
farm income three hundred and seventy
and a half billion dollars now we have a

180
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:09,250
trade turn of seven times the initial
dollar farm income so what happened we

181
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,620
lost seven times this ended payment or
newly earn dollars to operate our

182
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:20,530
economy rough set be lost
we added eight hundred and eighty four

183
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:26,470
billion dollars to the gross debt from
state local and private but in spite of

184
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:32,110
this injection of 884 billion dollars in
the fifteen year period we were still

185
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,250
short six hundred and twenty seven
billion dollars of national income over

186
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:45,240
forty billion a year the balance with
wages interest now then the question is

187
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,930
who lost it well they down the chief
proves it a private enterprise terms of

188
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:58,360
net farm small business brought the
profits after taxes I'm sorry I didn't

189
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:04,420
97 billion the vet shortage of income
they a principal to 0 farm operator who

190
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,360
were short two hundred and twenty two
billion the next principle losses are

191
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:16,910
corporate profits was short 221
211 billion after taxes comply me the

192
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:23,330
small businessman was short 162 billion
and I would like to point out that a

193
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:28,220
large part of this loss that is a
greater proportional of it took place in our

194
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,840
rural communities because the business
small businessman in our urban areas

195
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:40,240
they had the benefit of the terrific
increase in the payrolls that took place

196
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,570
Carl I hope I have time to come back to
you but I'd like to ask Mr. Bowers

197
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,290
another question
I read your balance sheet on agriculture

198
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,540
but yours is from a different aspect
you've written or prepared a balance

199
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:58,850
sheet on production and I'd like to have
you comment on that what's your attitude

200
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,860
about the large type commercial farms
and so forth and is in your opinion is

201
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:19,760
that going to work well agriculture has
a better balance sheet and we'll say the

202
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,490
Iowa Public Service Company has for
better balance sheet and the Missouri

203
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:32,240
Pacific or the Illinois Central or
Northwestern railroads the the farmer

204
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,080
has less debts and more assets than any
other segment of our whole economic

205
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,540
system but that isn't true on his
operating statement his income and

206
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,490
expense statement the farmer is not
kidding as large return on his

207
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,570
investment as the Interstate Commerce
Commission allows the railroads and

208
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:59,330
allows the utility power and light
companies and so forth and as a result

209
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:06,140
the farmer is working in the red so to
speak and the only way he shows in the

210
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,360
black is the government subsidies that
he's getting from Washington the farmer

211
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,660
before the average farm in America
before his salary and before his taxes

212
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:23,810
and before his new equipment and before
his paying his debts is only averaging

213
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,960
three hundred and fifty dollars a month
and the average farmer probably has an

214
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,280
investment of $100,000 four or five
times that of a service station manager

215
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,390
and he should be earning six thousand a
year minimum after taxes

216
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:41,700
well the farmers got the best balance
sheet of the four basic segments of

217
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,600
private enterprise the poorest the
operating statement the poorest

218
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,580
operating statement and I wasn't making
enough money to hold on he's not making

219
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,260
enough to support his family he's really
in a depressed area so far this personal

220
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,730
income the scripts right well now here
is a bankers viewpoint you've heard Mr.

221
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:05,880
Bowers say that agriculture has got the
the best balance sheet of any segment of

222
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,580
our economy but would you agree that
even so that the only way that

223
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,070
agriculture can liquidate its depth is
by liquidating itself for selling out

224
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:22,770
that's what has been happening that is
been done now we talks about we haven't

225
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,720
had many farmers go bankrupt because
they see the handwriting on the wall and

226
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,130
they've taken the step of voluntary
liquidation to make the change but now

227
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:35,850
this is a condition of agriculture and
they've got the best balance sheet

228
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:41,880
better than the corporations or the
small business and so forth as a banker

229
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,250
what's your observation of the rest of
the economy then well of course we've

230
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,390
been encouraged in deficit financing
we've been told that that is the way

231
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:56,220
they get customers we've had the
Keynesian theory that we increase our

232
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:02,430
debts thereby we do more business
and so we as we owe this debt to ourself

233
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,000
it doesn't matter and we become
prosperous it doesn't disappear does it

234
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,910
no the debt doesn't disappear in other
words and the farmer has been staying in

235
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:19,260
business by increasing his that though
he's been has been this inflation which

236
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:24,030
has caused a markup in the real estate
values which has enabled him to borrow

237
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,690
more money on the basis of that
so-called increase in real estate value

238
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,950
and as a result of this this is what's
been keeping our rural communities alive

239
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,970
been keeping 'em going
has been this increasing bit Mr. Paulson

240
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:40,010
in other words what were the point we're
getting at here that agriculture has a

241
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:45,330
better balance but actually small
business in rural America is in worse

242
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,780
shape than agriculture
absolutely absolutely that's the point I

243
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:55,170
wanted to bring out and Carl you heard
Mr Bowers make the statement on the

244
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,290
balance sheet of agriculture and I think
we'll agree that they've got a better

245
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:02,130
financial statement than the
corporations and small business why

246
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:09,030
don't you point out the seriousness of-
the seriousness of this well the simple

247
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:17,610
facts are that agriculture in terms of
gross farm income is receiving a 49

248
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:23,520
percent of what they call parity of
income but on the net basis and that

249
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:30,480
farm income is only thirty three percent
of a very uncommon for the farmer now

250
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,270
the farmer if he didn't work long hours
and work his family just couldn't stay

251
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:39,900
on the farm he'd have to get up that's
how one of the things that has made it

252
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,530
possible for him to stay there well that
we credited much of the efficiency in

253
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:49,350
agriculture to the fact that they have
that they've been producing for half the

254
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:55,140
income they should what do you mean by that 
well in other words they say that the

255
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,650
reason that agriculture doesn't deserve
a price anymore like they did back in

256
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:03,180
the 30s is because they've become much
more efficient and they've increased

257
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:08,970
their production through technology well
that's that's why they don't need the

258
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,610
price
well that is what's been told to the

259
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:18,150
American people but here's the fact in
1946 they had a net income of fifteen

260
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:25,860
billion dollars in 1966 it was sixteen
billion what in 1966 their operating

261
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:32,840
costs were three billion dollars more
than all their income in 1946 Mr. Bowers

262
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,190
in your estimation what is the biggest
problem in agriculture today well the

263
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:42,140
biggest problem today is how to get farm
income

264
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:48,380
to the same level on a parody was what
the farmer has to pay in consumer prices

265
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:54,380
he's a buyer as well as a seller and
while how does he restore his parity of

266
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:59,330
income with a parity of income with
other segments of the economy and my

267
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,520
feeling is my little town it has a sales
volume of 5 million a year should have a

268
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,830
sales volume of 10 million a year if
they could restore the income of the

269
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,420
farmer to a parity of the people who
produce the goods that he buys what's

270
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:17,540
going to happen if we don't restore the
parity income of it well our little

271
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,050
towns gonna disappear and that's why I
came to this conference I want to know

272
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:25,130
how what we're gonna have to do to keep
our in town from going out of the existence

273
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,310
well what effect is this going to have
on the national economy if we don't

274
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:33,770
restore well it means there'll be vast
open areas of agricultural country in

275
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,780
this United States that will not be any
longer operated by this small individual

276
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,460
family unit well thank you very much Mr.
Bowers I see we're running short on time

277
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,290
would you agree Carl with what Mr. Bowers
said what's the number one problem in

278
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:53,270
agriculture today one of the number one
problem the only problem there's been in

279
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:58,250
the history of United States and that's
price so what's the answer you should

280
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:05,090
demand that Congress immediately restore
the 90% price support with an accurate

281
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,860
clarity formula based on the consumer
price level and the record proves from

282
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,560
43 that 52 that this program works
effectively and efficiently and the

283
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,780
source of this information can be found
in the 1962 economic report to Congress

284
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,370
by President John F. Kennedy I want to
make a point that that needs to be based

285
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:31,160
on the consumer price level that's the
governing factor that tells the story of

286
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,020
like preparing why don't you repeat he
statement once more Mr. Rash that we

287
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:43,760
need 90 percent support prices based on
a parity price level governed by the

288
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:51,440
consumer price level under the 1960
under the 1960 report the president's

289
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,450
1960 economic report would you agree
with these other two gentlemen that the

290
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:01,820
biggest problem in agriculture today are
the only problem is price yes sir how

291
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,910
about you
Ray well I certainly agree with this

292
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:08,810
to Arnold
because when farmers are being only paid

293
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:14,360
half what they should get their only
spending half of what they could spend

294
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,850
in rural America and this is why my town
if things aren't changed it's going to

295
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:25,700
go down the drain just like Mr. Bowers'
town in well thank you gentlemen this is

296
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,640
what we've been discussing at the
Blue-Ribbon conference in Sioux City

297
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:37,520
Iowa this past weekend and it was the
unanimous agreement of all those that

298
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,930
attended that the only problem that we
have in agriculture today is the price

299
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:47,360
structure and that all of rural America
is completely dependent on the gross

300
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,670
income of Agriculture and if the farmers
don't get their proper share of the

301
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:59,390
national income it's going to starve the
rural communities and one way that we

302
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:05,330
could restore prices to agriculture is
through legislation such as Mr. Wilken

303
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:09,710
and Mr. Bowers and the rest of the panel
agreed however we've been trying this

304
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:15,050
now for 15 years and it seems like
