00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,039
according to a case study

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,480
on saint lucia by the united nations

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,640
conference on trade and development um

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,080
saint lucia like many other small island

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,760
developing states

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,000
due to his geographic

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,600
location climate

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,079
and geology

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,079
have also made it susceptible to natural

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,000
hazards

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,800
the island is vulnerable to hydro

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,520
meteorological and geophysical events

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:49,120
the impacts of which can be severe and

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,000
pronounced by the island's small economy

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,320
historical information indicates that

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,640
storm induced flooding

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,800
and landslides have been the most likely

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,520
hydro meteorological impacts affecting

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,520
st lucia

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,280
average annual economic losses

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,439
associated with extreme hydro

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,720
meteorological events for the period

24
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,640
1992 to 2011

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,400
have been equivalent to roughly 2

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,920
percent of gdp

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,439
or about us 26.94 million

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,280
however

29
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,560
singular

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,040
high impact events can be devastating

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,280
example hurricane island 1980 resulted

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,040
in damages equivalent to about 60

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,119
percent of gdp

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,720
while hurricane thomas

35
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,920
2010

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,680
resulted in damages estimated at 346.2

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,600
million 43.4 percent of gdp

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,399
in all instances

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,079
we have measured economic loss including

40
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,479
the contribution of the agricultural

41
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,799
sector to gdp which now stands at two

42
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,360
percent of gdp

43
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,600
in the advent of more frequent and more

44
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,399
civil losses to agriculture

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,520
including the recent impact of hurricane

46
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,960
elsa

47
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,200
coupled with

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,720
minimal to no insurance coverage for

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,560
farmers

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,480
building a resilient

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,480
agricultural sector is paramount

52
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,400
therefore

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,720
based on the financing commitment

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,040
received from the adaptation fund and

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,680
the caribbean development bank towards

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,640
securing this resilience today

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,280
it is my honor to welcome each and every

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,040
one of you to the launch of the building

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,440
resilience for adaptation to climate

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,440
change and climate variability in

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,000
agriculture instant russia project

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,760
welcome each and everyone

adaptation to climate change and climate

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,840
variability in agriculture in saint

75
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,440
lucia project

76
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,000
it is a long name

77
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,400
but as the project unfolds i am sure

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
everyone will become familiar with this

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,640
name

80
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,720
we all know that this has been a very

81
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,000
long awaited occasion

82
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,560
and having you here with us this morning

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,720
definitely makes the occasion even more

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,200
meaningful

85
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,120
we are going through a very challenging

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,480
time in saint lucia

87
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,519
and kovi 19 has done nothing else but to

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,760
pack more on top of everything else

89
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,799
therefore it is imperative that we

90
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,519
demonstrate to our funding partners

91
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,439
that we are not only ready to receive

92
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,720
the support that they have generously

93
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,120
given to us

94
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,519
but also to give the assurance that the

95
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,799
confidence placed in us here in saint

96
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,280
lucia is well deserving well-placed and

97
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,239
that we as a country we are very much

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,319
aware of our responsibilities and we are

99
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,319
ready to deliver

100
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,400
as a designated national authority for

101
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,079
the adaptation fund the department of

102
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,440
sustainable development takes the

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,359
responsibility to maintain an open line

104
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,240
of communication with the adaptation

105
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,880
fund

106
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,800
the executing and implementing agencies

this is an extensive project that will

109
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,199
have numerous activities

110
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,680
this is not a project that will only

111
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,600
benefit the five selected agricultural

112
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,199
districts in saint lucia

113
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,919
but it is intended to be beneficial

114
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,840
nationwide it is a project that we will

115
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,040
be taking to the doors of all our

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,400
everyone especially our youth

120
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,039

121
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,440
department with a mandate to facilitate

122
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,560
and mobilize support to fulfill our

123
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,199
climate change agenda and to ensure that

124
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,280
we continue to review and update our

125
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,800
policy framework that will help us

126
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,039
develop other meaningful initiatives

127
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,759
we look forward to continuing work on

our national adaptation planning process

129
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,000
which will bring support in

130
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,039
strengthening other sectors

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,199
honorable ministers ladies and gentlemen

and therefore we are confident that we

135
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,600
are implementing a sound transformative

136
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,919
project here in saint lucia

137
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,360

the officers who have supported the

140
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,080

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,160
the agencies in saint lucia

142
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,280

144
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,120
with the consultant who dedicated very a

145
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,479
lot of effort rather in developing this

146
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,639
project

147
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,880

this project

165
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,039
building resilience and adaptation to

166
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,800
climate change and climate vulnerability

167
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,680
in agriculture in saint lucia

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,680
today we are elated to see it

169
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,479
get off the ground

170
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,840
or take wings as the technical staff in

171
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,520
the department of sustainable

172
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,160
development would see

173
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,199
to find its place amongst the strategic

174
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,599
efforts

175
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,680
being pursued in saint lucia

176
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,080
as we seek to build resilience in our

177
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,160
agricultural sector that has been hard

178
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,560
hit time and again

179
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,560
by extreme climate events

180
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,639
indeed the launch of this project is

181
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,360
being done at a time

182
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,280
when saint lucia must demonstrate its

183
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,440
fortitude as a country

184
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,680
as we find ways to recover from the

185
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,319
kovid 19 pandemic

186
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,639
which has eaten away at the economic

187
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:49,360
social and cultural landscapes

188
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,680
we have confidence that this project

189
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,919
will provide meaningful and sustainable

190
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,960
benefits to the farmers and community

191
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,440
members

192
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,440
in the five agricultural regions in

193
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,319
which it will be ruled out and by

194
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,240
extension to the economy of saint lucia

195
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,400
at large

196
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,479
many of you may not be aware

197
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,720
that this project has its roots in a

198
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,160
diagnostic study undertaken in 2015

199
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,759
with the support of the caribbean

200
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,840
development bank

201
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,039
a study which determined that saint

202
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,039
lucia has established a well-informed

203
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,639
and comprehensive framework for climate

204
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,199
change adaptation

205
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,520
to support deliberate measures to build

206
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,760
and enhance adaptive capacities for

207
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,000
climate resilience at all levels

208
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
realizing our vulnerabilities as a small

209
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,680
island developing state

210
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,919
this is indicative of the work that has

211
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,880
gone into positioning ourselves to

212
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,040
respond to the impacts of climate change

213
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,920
and equally important positioning

214
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,480
ourselves to receive technical

215
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,680
technological capacity building

216
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,760
and financial support from the global

217
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,120
community

218
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,720
furthermore

219
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,720
it is clear that the department of

220
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,880
sustainable development

221
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,360
with great support from fellow agencies

222
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,600
like the department of agriculture

223
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:14,640
remains committed to ensuring that our

224
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,000
policies and strategies remain relevant

225
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,800
we ensure

226
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,640
that they articulate our circumstances

227
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:26,080
and that there are

228
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:28,399
congruencies with our call for support

229
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,880
this is evident in the post-2015

230
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,200
undertakings such as the development of

231
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,760
our national adaptation plan

232
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,480
and in this case more specifically the

233
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,360
sectoral adaptation strategy and action

234
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,880
plan

235
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,040
for the agriculture sector

236
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,640
the medium-term development strategy for

237
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,440
20 of 2020 sorry to 2023

238
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:55,760
recognizes agriculture as one of the key

239
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,080
results areas for national and economic

240
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,600
development i repeat

241
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,839
the medium-term

242
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,399
development strategy of 2020 to

243
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:10,160
2023 recognizes agriculture as one of

244
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,160
the key results areas for national and

245
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,519
economic development

246
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,519
also

247
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,000
it is quite

248
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,160
rightly recognized it has quite greatly

249
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,640
recognized sorry climate change

250
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,760
as a component of the disaster risk

251
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,480
management

252
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,320
resilience and sustainable development

253
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,440
cross-cut informatic development areas

254
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,279
the nap

255
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,959
process and the medium-term development

256
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,560
strategy

257
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,120
are highlighted here

258
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,800
so that we can be reminded as agencies

259
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,800
of the need to continuously identify

260
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,279
and pursue the synergies

261
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,320
and to certain legislators and to seek

262
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:54,399
to align our actions with our priority

263
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,640
agendas identified in policy instruments

264
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,240
we must continue to ensure that no

265
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,480
sector is left behind

266
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,560
and that as a small and as a small

267
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,000
island nation

268
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:09,120
we make the best use of our resources

269
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,480
and any support that we receive

270
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,640
externally

271
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
and i think mrs leo spoke eloquently

272
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,880
about that when she addressed us

273
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,720
a few moments ago

274
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,959
so wild tourism is seen as the main

275
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,200
revenue owner for the country

276
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,399
the people must be fed

277
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,880
and local livelihoods must be sustained

278
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,160
by injecting the necessary capital

279
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,079
capacity and other resources

280
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,600
this is the aim of the project we are

281
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,680
launching today

282
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,760
which recognizes that if we do not

283
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,880
address the impacts that climate change

284
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,279
has

285
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,079
on our agricultural sector now

286
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,640
the effects will be irreversible

287
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:53,120
leaving our food security and the

288
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,440
livelihoods of many at serious risk

289
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,680
the details and implementation of the of

290
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,600
plans for this project have been well

291
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,720
thought out and articulated by various

292
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,120
proponents

293
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,800
and as the ceremony progresses you will

294
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,600
learn more about the building of

295
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,600
resilience and sustainability in our

296
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,079
farming systems

297
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,480
the establishing of agro-businesses and

298
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,560
the knowledge management aspect of this

299
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,000
project

300
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,680
the department of sustainable

301
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,639
development which i have the pleasure of

302
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,519
leading

303
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,639
as focal point under designated national

304
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,639
authority

305
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,120
to the adaptation fund

306
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,480
believes this project will serve saint

307
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,279
lucia well

308
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,680
as it will contribute to our economic

309
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:40,480
recovery especially in our rural

310
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,120
i'm happy to report if you do not know

311
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,279
that both myself and minister prosper

312
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,720
are parliamentary representatives

313
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,079
for rural areas in this country

314
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,000
we will continue to support the

315
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,079
department of agriculture that is the

316
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,399
department of sustainable development

317
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,880
as they take on the responsibility for

318
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,040
executing this project a project that

319
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,240
calls for strong and strategic community

320
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,279
engagement

321
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,360
management agency collaboration and

322
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,440
monitoring

323
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,320
we are confident that our agriculture

324
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,279
colleagues have long prepared for the

325
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,639
task

326
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,600
and are ready for a well-coordinated

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,120
to the smooth implementation of this

350
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,880
long-awaited

351
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,800
project

352
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,839
the people-centric approach is important

353
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,839
to us

354
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,760
as we continue to serve our country

355
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,560
the project proposal development phase

356
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,120
was an extremely extensive

357
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,600
and highly consultative one

358
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,639
that was well managed

359
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,800
for this

360
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,120
i first wish to recognize the caribbean

361
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,839
community climate change center

362
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,560
who supported the consultant and let me

363
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,120
also recognize the consultant

364
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,959

368
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,320
as we move forward with this project let

369
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,920
us do so with a spirit of

370
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,920
professionalism

371
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,560
and collaboration

372
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,920
we can only achieve the objectives of

373
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,399
this project

374
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,120
by working collaboratively

375
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,240
no one agency in government

376
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,120
has

377
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,720
all the resources required for success

378
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,360
to be ripped

379
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,800
let us keep at heart

380
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,360
the interest

381
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,360
and growth of saint lucia

382
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,079

lucia it gives me great pleasure

386
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,399
as the minister for agriculture to

387
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,560
address this distinguished audience

388
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,120
on the launch of the building resilience

389
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,360

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,759
building climate resilience and

422
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,399
sustainability of farming systems

423
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,600
through interventions for water security

adaptive capacities

431
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,480
component one is in perfect alignment

432
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,919
with the ministry

433
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,360
current thrust towards poverty elevation

434
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,720
in keeping with the sustainable

435
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,960
development goals

436
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,520
sdgs one and two of the united nations

437
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,280
this is also reflected in the food

438
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,640
security component

439
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,320
that is now

440
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,440
prominently featured

441
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,840
in the new

442
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,919
nomenclature of the ministry

443
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,960
food security will be more vigorously

444
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,720
targeted

445
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,559
and prioritized along the pillars of

446
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,480
food availability

447
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,240

food utilization

449
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,840
and food supply stability

450
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,840
the key strategy which will be employed

451
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,640
is the utilization and promotion of

452
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,840
climate smart agriculture practices

453
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,240
to mitigate against the negative impacts

454
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,160
on the availability of food due to

455
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,480
climate change

456
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,200
noticeably the project seeks to build on

developed over time you would have heard

545
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,159
it alluded to by our ministers piers and

546

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,760
gestation period dating far back as 2014

548
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,240
2015. and so over the next few minutes i

549

ask for your attention as we take a

550
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,360
brief look at

551
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,520
what it is this project is about and

552
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,240
what we intend to achieve

553
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,240
with this project

554
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,480
so this is according to the adaptation

555
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,720
fund standard regular project which is

556
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,080
anywhere from 10 million us dollars on

557
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,360
honda

558
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,440
we are the beneficiaries here in saint

559
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,679
lucia very specifically the agricultural

560
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,679
sector the title of the project by now

561
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,360
you know it's a long one building

562
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,360
resilience for adaptation to climate

563
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,120
change and climate variability in

564
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,880
agriculture in st lucia we have our

565
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,080
implemented implementing entity the

566
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,520
caribbean development bank

567
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,400
we also have

568
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,400
our national designated authority is

569
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,559
the sustainable development department

570
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,919
our problem statement was in the area of

571
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,679
looking at the agricultural sector we

572
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,880
recognize it contributes contributes to

573
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,600
about 22 for the incomes household food

574
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,840
security and livelihood security 22 of

575
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,679
our population benefits from that um of

576
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,679
course the productivity of our

577
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,679
livelihood is very vulnerable and of

578
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,400
course you'd have hood mentioned to some

579
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,440
of the recent storms like elsa and way

580
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,400
back as

581
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,919
1996 when we had debbie and thomas and

582
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,280
all the rest and of course we've

583
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,520
recognized that there is significant

584
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,440
decreases in annual rainfall

585
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,760
here in saint lucia but in the midst of

586
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,600
this significant decrease in rainfall

587
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,840
we're also having intense rains

588
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,080
seasons where we get land slippage road

589
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,799
blockage we get a lot of problems um

590
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,559
with losses in the agricultural sector

591
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,799
not to mention pests and disease

592
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,159
problems and the likes

593
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,240
we also

594
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,799
thought before the challenges including

595
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,280
incomplete data sets in many cases when

596
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,000
you seek for data related to

597
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,000
problems from

598
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,880
climate change and climate variability

599
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,120
we find that there are missing data sets

600
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,720
and so this project is looking at trying

601
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,799
to resolve

602
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,279
that particular situation for this

603
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:44,240
particular project it has geographical

604
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,240
limitations locally and i'm so starting

605
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,760
on the west coast as far as schwarzell

606
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,840
this project will cover from schwazel

607
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,120
sue frey henry's ancillary coming into

608
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,880
culisac and of course going across uh to

609
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,880
communities in babuna debara and

610
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,840
surrounding areas

611
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,080
yeah

612
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,880
the project has been conceptualized with

613
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,799
three broad areas and these three broad

614
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,080
objectives include contributing

615
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,080
positively

616
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,640
to the growth indicators

617
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,520
for agriculture looking at the midterm

618
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,320
development strategy and plan that was

619
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,039
developed in 2012 2016. of course we

620
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,480
recognize that the times have changed so

621
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,960
that is also going to be reviewed in

622
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,960
terms of where we're at taking a look at

623
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,360
the the sectoral strategy and action

624
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,279
plan and the new findings that we have

625
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,240
in those particular in those particular

626
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,320
plans

627
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,520
the other area of objective that we have

628
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,880
is to build resilience in the

629
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,600
agriculture sector for livelihood

630
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,080
security through enhanced

631
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,000
adaptive capacities for climate change

632
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,919
and climate variability and of course

633
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,279
the third objective is to build adaptive

634
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,600
capacities

635
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,760
of aggro ecosystems livelihoods to

636
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,000
threats so we're looking at

637
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,200
aggro processing and the likes there are

638
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,840
three broad integrated components

639
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,919
the first component is about building

640
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,840
resilience and sustainability of farming

641
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,279
systems through interventions for water

642
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,520
security soil conservation and

643
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,960
management we recognize that we have

644
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,320
issues in the dry season with

645
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,240
availability of water so we'll be

646
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,520
looking at rain water harvesting among

647
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,679
other things

648
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,159
establishing green agro parks including

649
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,679
the use of solar energy to increase uh

650
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,640
efficiency

651
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,080
the

652
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,559
agropak concept has been implemented in

653
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,240
nearby jamaica and so we have this

654
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,080
country and the example that they have

655
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,360
that they that they've set for us in

656
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,080
order for us to move forward with that

657
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,679
particular uh component and then we have

658
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,600
of course the knowledge management

659
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,080
aspect of it where we're looking at

660
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,039
building up knowledge within the sector

661
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,440
building uh the capacity to to

662
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,039
to respond to climate change and climate

663
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,960
variability i'm going to take the next

664
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,520
couple minutes just to give you

665
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,760
the broad project goals and the outcomes

666
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,400
based on these three broad areas that

667
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,720
have been identified here today

668
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,159
so the overall project goal really is to

669
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,520
build resilience in saint lucia's

670
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,679
agriculture sector for livelihood

671
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,840
security through enhanced adaptive

672
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,080
capacities what we hope to come out of

673
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,480
that the overall outcomes is to increase

674
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,640
the resilience of rural farm communities

675
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,480
increasing farm productivity

676
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,240
water and livelihood security and

677
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,559
reducing vulnerability to natural

678
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,320
hazards climate variability and climate

679
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,000
change of course at the end of this

680
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,480
process we anticipate that we will have

681
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,720
enhanced national capacity to plan

682
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,880
implement climate resilient and adaptive

683
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,120
actions in the agriculture sector to

684
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,480
transform the lives of the rural

685
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,480
population

686
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,760
so this is this is the actual

687
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,679
overarching outcomes and anticipated

688
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,880
outputs

689
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,400
component number one that looks at

690
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,559
building resilience and sustainability

691
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,120
of farming systems through interventions

692
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,880
for water scarcity and soil conservation

693
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,039
we're looking at increased farm

694
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,240
productivity as an outcome

695
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,400
we're looking at enhanced livelihood and

696
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,520
income security and of course we're

697
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,840
looking at

698
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,520
getting access to areas where farmers

699
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,159
have abandoned or lands have been

700
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,159
underutilized and getting those into

701
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,320
agricultural production that would

702
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:10,000
include doing stuff like getting access

703
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,320
to on one on on farm for water supplies

704
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,159
through rain water harvesting

705
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,440
there will be some investments made in

706
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,600
base slope

707
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,120
rain water

708
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,799
harvesting as well

709
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,760
of course the component will also be

710
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,559
looking at

711
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,919
farmers and staff of the department

712
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,240
being trained

713
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,880
in land management for climate

714
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,880
resilience

715
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,399
component number two that looks at

716
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,559
establishing green agro parks

717
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,000
including the use of solar energy for

718
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,919
increased efficiency and resilient

719
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,399
farming we recognize that many people

720
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,480
are talking about hydroponics and and

721
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,720
aquaponics not recognizing

722
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,360
that the high energy costs associated

723
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,760
with these new production systems is is

724
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,080
prohibitive and so through this project

725
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,000
we are anticipating to introduce some of

726
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,799
the renewable energy systems like

727
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,559
perhaps solar and wind energy to a less

728
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,480
extent and see how these could

729
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,120
contribute to reducing the cost

730
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,000
associated with energy for running these

731
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,000
new investments in agriculture of course

732
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,240
the same outcome here is increased

733
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,320
productivity and enhanced livelihood

734
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,720
security for this particular component

735
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,200
the major investments include uh two

736
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,880
green agro parks established one on the

737
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,960
west coast and one on the east coast of

738
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,600
the island and there will be two house

739
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,520
up certified agri-processing facilities

740
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,000
um that is going to be that are going to

741
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,480
be established under this uh particular

742
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,480
component

743
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,720
and of course the third component which

744
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,840
is knowledge management

745
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,679
which looks at managing the transfer and

746
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,880
building up the knowledge capacity of

747
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,360
both

748
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,840
farmers technicians and other

749
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,480
stakeholders within the sector this is

750
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,840
geared towards sensitizing people in

751
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,840
terms of what

752
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,840
climate change is actually doing to the

753
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,440
sector and the impacts of it and so

754
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,840
there's going to be a gender sensitive

755
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,600
baseline develop and let me say at this

756
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,960
point that one of the terms or

757
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,360
conditions for

758
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,000
the approval of this project is that we

759
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,080
will be rolling out

760
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,320
a gender a gender assessment and an

761
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,480
environmental and social management plan

762
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,840
this is part of the first activities

763
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,240
that's going to take place within the

764
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,240
first quarter of the implementation of

765
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,840
this particular project we also be going

766
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,679
to be looking at rehabilitated

767
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,120
infrastructure creating

768
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,520
climate change learning and

769
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,039
interpretation centers so all of these

770
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,919
are going to be part of this third

771
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,720
component of the project

772
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,039
the project implementation arrangements

773
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,159
so we have the implemented implementing

774
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,520
