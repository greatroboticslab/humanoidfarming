  "text": "i'm really happy that this morning we can welcome for our keynote speak speaker someone who really is exemplifying the solidarity um that jimmy has has so rightly suggested we need you mentioned that vex and vets medics don't always work that well together and we're now going to hear from a veterinarian who is working in a medical institution and developing vaccines which are appropriate for use across that divide in both livestock and humans professor professor george is a veterinarian who is the a pi at the chemri welcome trust unit here in in khalifi and is a assistant professor in the center for tropical medicine and global health at the university of oxford um he has just been um awarded an incredible prize by the royal society the royal society africa prize for his work on viral zoonoses and he's going to talk to us today today about his experience as um someone who crosses these boundaries and the development of a rift valley fever vaccine suitable for use in humans and livestock so with that i would like to pass across um to professor george worriemway and we're really looking forward to hearing from you today so thank you so much thank you liam and then i'd like to first start by thanking all the organizers for this uh fantastic conference uh i mean one health has been on the fringes for a very long time but uh it's now sort of center stage and this is our opportunity to really push this agenda that really makes sense in terms of disease control so um really like you know following jimmy smith's uh talk i mean that's that's gonna be a tough act but there are some things that he mentioned about siloed thinking and uh in all the sort of different facets that uh we deal with in health and you know my my view of one health in this space of vaccinology is looking at developing vaccines for humans through the lens of animal health and vice versa so if you're developing vaccines for veterinary you know for veterinary use looking at the the impact of those vaccines and the development process from from a human perspective so um i'm going to talk about a program that i've been working on for a while now so this started sometime in 2012 which which tells you about the sort of scale of time that you need to develop vaccines and and also speaks to the sort of rapid development of covet vaccines that we have seen because that has been shrunk down to about 100 days so it's about developing a single vaccine for using humans and livestock against reef valley fever this audience i don't think i need to talk about um sorry myself okay i don't think i need to talk about the the importance of animals to uh to human health for this particular audience in fact this this is a photo taken uh among a collection of lots of photos on the ill reflector sites so i would urge you all to look to look at that it's got fantastic visual representations of the importance of animal health to humans and i like this photo because it just demonstrates the pure joy that animals bring to to humans especially children but of course we also know about the the economic importance the you know there's been lots of studies demonstrating the uh impact of life you know animals to livelihoods financial security i always mentioned that i was only able to go to university because my grandparents who raised me on an animal and they saw that animal and that generated income you know some some funding for me to go to university and i'm sure there are many others in the audience who have uh similar stories one of the other things we share with uh livestock are infectious diseases in fact over sixty percent of infectious diseases are in humans have uh involved an animal uh sort of transmission and uh for the emerging infectious diseases that we're seeing now that you know that are increasing in incidence that percentage is much higher so um when you're thinking about controlling human disease it it just illustrates the point that you also have to think about animal health just because of that uh connection um so i'm going to talk about reef valley fever which is a virus that was identified in kenya in the 1930s it is an rna virus in the family fenu very day there are no vaccines available for it or no specific therapeutics which is why it has been prioritized by the african union and the world health organization so um rvf is is has a complex transmission cycle by complexity meaning that you know for me it involves quite a lot of mammalian species and lots of mosquito species so but the simplistic sort of explanation is that you have very heavy rainfall that causes floods which increases uh the number of mosquitoes to transmit the virus sorry um able to to transmit the virus this increase in mosquito numbers uh allows a mechanism for the virus to circulate in in animals some of the mosquitoes are infected you know for life the eggs are you know if they had had a blood meal uh that has infectious virus the virus has you know gone through its progeny through the eggs uh and so the virus transmits i mean the mosquitoes transmit the virus uh in animal species most commonly sheep goats cattle and camels and during these epidemics where where you have very high levels of viremia viral load circulating in these animals the viruses can then the mosquitoes can then transmit the virus to humans or also to wildlife now the virus um sort of has been detected in wildlife by way of seroprevalence studies but the impact of rvf in livestock is really not fully understood but in domestic ruminants like you know the ones of men should you you get to about adult animals and of course in young animals the mortality is much higher this is over 90 percent and you know the classic uh the classic sort of hallmark of disease is uh abortion storms so nearly all animals in a farm that are pregnant would abort in humans the disease um is described more like um through like illness with very non-specific symptoms but a proportion of these individuals develop severe disease with high case fatality rates and and there's been some sort of uh evidence uh although anecdotal suggesting that the case fatality has been you know of recent epidemics in humans has been rather high so ranging from about 30 percent at least for from the east african uh outbreaks so where is rvf common is predominantly in africa and um these maps you know are like you would have seen much like this for all sorts of things basically the darker it is the the more uh cases there are or have been reported on the left you've got humans on the right you have livestock the most important thing here to note is that there is a lot more um cases of rvf reported in livestock than in humans which possibly just illustrates the the poor sort of surveillance systems in in humans in some of these settings the other thing you will notice you'll note is that kenya and south africa or east africa and southern africa tend to be really severely affected by rvf outbreaks just based on the number over the previous years so what can we do to control rvf we have licensed inactivated vac and live vaccines for they're using in livestock these have some safety drawbacks and some need multiple doses to generate an effective immune response you need high containment for their production because it's an actual sort of rvf virus that you're dealing with whether inactivating it or modified in some way and it's not they're not diva compatible so you cannot differentiate vaccinated animals from um non-vaccinated animals because the antibody response to the whole virus is similar to that that's caused by natural infection so there are no licensed vaccines for human use and so the the the thrust of this program has really been about developing a vaccine for for human use but also developing safer uh vaccines that can be used in livestock this is a very old um table from the 1930s just that all i want to demonstrate here is that a humoral immune response so an antibody response is sufficient for protection uh because of time i i wouldn't really go into the table but but you the point i want to sort of make is that if you pass into animals again you can confirm protection uh suggesting that antibodies are important we also have from very many studies that have been done or over the years demonstrating that neutralizing antibodies uh correlate with protection and so if you're thinking about a target for a vaccine uh you know construct you want to develop antibodies you know develop a vaccine that can elicit neutralizing antibodies and we finally we know that if you recover from rvf infection then these neutralizing antibodies tend to be long lived and this is just a case demonstrating that an individual hard neutralizing antibodies up to 25 years later without exposure in the intervening period which is uh really remarkable so we know what the the target of this neutralizing antibodies are it's the surface of the viral glycoprotein of the of the virus and these are viral glycoproteins known as gn and gc uh the the analogous sort of situation here is the spike protein for coronavirus so it's like targeting the same sort of surface of the virus it's an enveloped rna virus so we set out to use the chadox one platform because at that time the chadox one vaccine platform which is basically just a vehicle to deliver the vaccine had been used in humans and had been shown to be safe in humans this is very important as a sort of starting point for a human vaccine because you've already saved so much costs by having uh already a track record in in the safety profile you will i will talk about the costs of developing vaccines later but the chad oxford platform was safe in humans previously when used for other vaccines and all we did basically is get the targets the the genes that encode the virus uh rvf gn and gc and uh you know inserted this into the chadox one vector which when in when you vaccinate an individual gets into the cell uh expresses the the proteins and these uh rvf glycoproteins then uh stimulate an immune response and hopefully you've got a very high immune response to confirm protection so the methods of manufacture were already well established so it really was a a matter of plug and play so this image just illustrates the um the the sort of uh pipeline for development is it's simplistic uh but it's just illustrates the point we've had the pre-clinical uh discovery period where we identified the rvf i mean inserted the rvfg and ngc into the chad ox1 platform uh the plan was to do pre-clinical studies in mice uh and then go on to livestock trials and human studies and and if you know hopefully if it all works well then you'd have a single vaccine for using multiple species so the first really encouraging data we found was that if you immunize mice and expose them to rvf virus two months later you had 100 protection and um you know this was very exciting whereas the group that uh were given a placebo uh did not uh you know were not protected and succumbed to infection so the next sets of studies in livestock were studies that we did um in very close partnership uh with hillary uh with vishnani and others and the idea here was to immunize animals and following um follow them up for a month for immune response to to develop and then expose them to rvf virus so this is a typical approach of evaluating vaccines so the long and short of it was that a single immunization in all those species provided a hundred percent protection so none of the animals that received chadox were shadows one um developed disease and in fact as illustrated on this on this plot the with the blue representing chadox one group and the black representing the licensed product and the uh gray representing placebo all the chadoxon vaccinated animals mounted on neutralizing antibody response uh for the rift wax which is available in kenya as a you know rvf vaccine uh two of the animals one in you know cattle and and goats did not mount a neutralizing response and were not protected further supporting this idea that um neutralizing antibodies are the main sort of thing you need to elicit to mount an immune response so the publication is up there if anybody wants to to follow that so the next step was to look at rvf in pregnancy again using a similar uh experimental design where you vaccinate uh for this we vaccinated early in gestation and challenge them later with a with a with a virulent virus and then monitoring the safety of the fetus and also our protection so these studies were done in the netherlands with uh jerome kotakaz and others and the top panels represent the results of the vaccine development in in sheep um and the bottom are the goats so that both i mean in both species the the antibody response was really very high it was within the range we observed in the kenyan study artillery and and uh the the chadox one vaccinated group in red here were um what protected against uh viremia so you see the viral load there it just means that the animals were protected against um you know rvf infection there was no illness in the pregnant uh animals um and no sign of infection in the fetuses in in sheep in the goats again we've got very high levels of uh protection although two of the 25 fetuses uh succumb to infection suggesting that there might be differences in the either the mechanism of protection or other factor in in goats in terms of uh the level of protection that you see following vaccination but the primary aim of this uh experiment really was to demonstrate that the chadox1 vaccine was safe which is something that current uh you know most of the vaccines currently uh are unable to you know show you know that we we really don't have any vaccines that can be used in pregnancy other than uh the inactivated versions that need uh multiple immunizations so this was a really um good point to sort of uh get that you know proceed from uh yeah so the next step was to look at the now that we've demonstrated the um the safety of the product in uh in pregnant and non-pregnant animals ensured you know very high levels of protection we the next step was to conduct a field trial looking at the um whether the vaccine elicits uh a similar you know performs as well as the licensed product in a study that is powered to evaluate data sort of population level so the previous studies were designed to look at efficacy uh you know for the first study and then the second one was to look at safety and pregnancy whereas this is now looking at a field level and these are studies that we did in uh kapiti where we um looked at 180 animals per species so this is with the as as indicated there that was a study protocol and this study was done to very high levels very high standards so uh to gcp and i believe it's probably the largest uh sort of gcp veterinary trial that's been done globally i haven't had anybody object to that in the different places i've talked about this um so as i say the study was done in kenya it's in healthy non-pregnant animals and the animals were followed up for a year and the end point of the trial the thing that we will use to say whether the vaccine performs as well as a licensed product is a neutralizing antibody titers now i don't have the results for this but um analysis is underway uh but should be available sometime early next year but the whole point is that this data will be used to support the registration of the product for use in east africa and other and other countries uh in africa where there is very high uh sort of exposure to rvf so i'll switch gears a bit so now we're moving to humans so the veterinary development is of course very advanced uh and we are now you know the point where we're thinking about registration but how about the human studies so we've begun a phase one study in humans in oxford and this is uh the typical uh approach is to start with a low dose go to a medium dose and a high dose for any of you who've been following uh you know the oxford astrazeneca kobe 19 vaccine development you will have seen some of this sort of experimental designs uh or trial designs very early on so this this sort of phase one study is is done in a small number of participants with the aim of just looking at the safety profile of the product and of course whether it also elicits an immune response the desired immune response so we already have for the platform in general so chadox1 in general we already have of a safety database over a billion doses of course because of the oxford astrozone coveted vaccine but now we want to add data specific to the rvf vaccine and so far the vaccine is performing well both in terms of the safety uh and the immune response and again we expect this data to be ready you know for sort of dissemination uh sometime early next year so i've i've taken that fairly quickly just because of time but but the summary of this work is that uh you know we've identified very high levels of protection in livestock now the vaccine is highly efficacious and safe in pregnant uh ruminants and the safety and immunogenicity is expected to be as good as current licensed vaccine which is the sort of the smith band vaccine supplied by kevin vappy analysis is ongoing as is the analysis of the human phase one study that is going to be available as from next year so in terms of so for the veterinary uh development the veterinary use of the product um that has a clear sort of pathway um that we would follow for the um are stipulated by uh the local regulators um and you know nba the the veterinary medicines directorate and and so and there is actually a harmonized process for for doing this in eastern africa but how about the the human landscape now one of the most difficult things to do as as you know the audience might appreciate is to predict when the next um reef valley fever outbreak would be if you if if you are to predict that with very high sort of confidence you would be able to design a vaccine efficacy study so um but in the absence of that it becomes really difficult to predict uh you know to design a vaccine efficacy study for you for rvf so an alternative approach would be to use correlates or protection as done for the vaccines so we know you know the threshold the antibody threshold you require to provide protection against rabies for instance and even yellow fever for instance um another another route is to think about an animal rule which is something that's done by the fda in the u.s but because this is a problem rvf is a problem that's predominantly restricted to africa and the arabian peninsula i think we think that there is a need to engage the regulatory [Music] national regulatory authorities in the continent about the the best sort of strategy towards licensure of this vaccine whether it's emergency use authorization as we have deemed as we have seen for uh covert 19 and then followed by sort of a a phase 3 study where you're looking at efficacy evaluation if ever there was a massive sort of epidemic you also need to think about what vaccination regimen is going to be eventually used and so this relies on doing further studies phase two studies where you look at a single dose versus two doses and and which of those performs well and think about the deployment and how would you deploy this vaccine would you deploy it in humans only or would you deploy it in humans and animals during an epidemic and you know this sort of thing calls for uh you know massive stakeholder engagement including the bodies listed there so very much a one health focused sort of uh strategy also not just the in the making of the vaccine and the planning of the experiment but also in the future work on the deployment or of the product so i think i will stop there um [Music] sorry yeah i'll stop there and just acknowledge that this is work that has involved um very many partners and uh at the center of this has been the international lifestyle research institute very close partners there uh as i mentioned earlier but also i can just or not i cannot overstate the importance of engagement with the regulatory and policy stakeholders including the national biosafety authority and the ministry of agriculture livestock and fisheries because this would not have been possible without their support um and you know and and guidance through the through the process uh at hillary you know campus and kapiti so i think i'll stop there and uh hand it over back to you leanne or for any kind uh questions thank you so much george for that great great talk um and uh there's lots of questions in the chat um but i'm going to just jump in with one that's maybe a little bit less technical we talked a bit at the beginning about the the difficulty of breaking down silos so i'm going to ask you a personal question um as as a a veterinarian i'm now working at chemry how how have you felt how have you found that transition sort of moving from the veterinary field into um sort of medical research how and have you got any um suggestions for those of us here or online about talking across disciplines and making those forging those connections thank you yeah that's a good question i mean i think um the first thing to say is is that i never left veterinary medicine my background is i'm a vet as you said and i think the the i have sort of enthused colleagues at camry and and others you know that i collaborate with uh globally about the value of animal health not just from the perspective of you know at the public you know deployment because when you think of one health there's a there's a big sort of bias i think towards thinking of control programs like a country you're deploying a control programs or brucellosis and you have to think about both but i think i've been using people to think about more even at the basic level that their difference in differences in uh animals and humans in terms of the uh immune sort of the way they mount an immune response the components of the immune response so you can understand pathogens and and how you know to how to control pathogens uh by looking at how the host paris you know house parasite or host virus interaction differs in the different species so it's been more about showing a different way of thinking about the particular problem that you know colleagues are working on and applying this sort of one health um basically exploiting synergies in in uh in sort of immunology in both humans and livestock it's not necessarily easy but it to me it just makes sense yeah no that that's wonderful and very sort of reminiscent of that original one medicine um concept and and also very great to hear that you never feel that you've left veterinary medicine i'm sorry if that was what came across i always have uh have this myself where people said oh you're in research maybe you're not a vet anymore but we're still we're still veterinarians at heart um so i'm just gonna pick up on a couple of questions that came in the chat um so there was one question that uh suggested that given the um the prolonged drought followed by um very heavy rains that we've experienced in the country you know does this make you feel that an outbreak might be more likely and if so is there anything people should be considering to protect themselves or protect prepare yeah i mean i think that's again is a good question um there are others in the audience you know bernadette and others who can make a really informed decision based on the sort of mathematical modeling and predictions i think i will i would emphasize more uh rather than moving rather than thinking about you know is there an outbreak that's going to happen because of these conditions i think i would emphasize being ready all the time which is uh something that jimmy mentioned in his sort of introduction to the introduction that we need to be ready we need to have surveillance systems that are ready to sort of uh go uh without necessarily um sort of having to wait for a set of circumstances to come to come into sort of existence so you you can always if we have surveillance systems that are full you know that are not just focused on a particular disease not just focused on rvf then you will be able to respond quickly um irregardless of whether there's a drought or whether there is not i think i would emphasize more on having um that of you know everyday sort of readiness to address sort of uh outbreaks i don't know whether i'm making sense there rather than focusing more just on an rvf outbreak yeah absolutely i think that that's really clear that we really need to put um our efforts into preparedness and surveillance um",
