00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,600
In the heart of Vermont circa 900 AD,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,839
the Abnaki people achieved a remarkable

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,719
agricultural breakthrough. They began

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,800
cultivating the three sisters, corn,

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,880
beans, and squash together in a

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,800
symbiotic planting method. This

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,359
innovation not only enhanced soil

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,000
fertility, but also provided a balanced

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,160
diet sustaining their communities. How

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,800
did this trio work together? Corn

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,119
provided a natural trellis for beans.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,519
Beans fix nitrogen in the soil and

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,200
squashes broad leaves suppress weeds.

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,960
This ingenious practice laid the

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,800
foundation for sustainable farming in

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,800
the region. See the description.
