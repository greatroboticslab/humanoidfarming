post and propublica investigated the

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,840
impact of sugar cane boring in florida

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,560
the harvesting practice helps reduce

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,360
more than half of america's cane sugar

75
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,519
but it sends smoke and ash into largely

state's heartland

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,640
in their reporting the journalists

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,480
learned that other countries have found

80
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,760
ways to harvest their crops without

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,159
those burns

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,959
they traveled to brazil the world's

83
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,120
largest producer of sugarcane to learn

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,560
how and why they switched to another

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,640
method

86

the video

132
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,280
and we wanted to start off by talking a

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,520
bit about what happened in brazil

134
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,000
health concerns were one of the factors

135
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,880
that led lawmakers to phase out the

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,520
practice of burning before harvesting

137
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,440
so this first question is for dotora

138
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,560
elena

139
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,000
i think your camera is still turned off

140
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,759
dr elena are you saying here i cannot

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,960
start my video because you close at me

142
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,039
ah

143
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,960
well let's see if we can work this out

144
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,639
oh there you are thank you so much for

145
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,400
joining us dr helen

146
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,360
sorry about that

147
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,720
um

148
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,280
so

149
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,520
dr elena giber you studied the health

150
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,160
effects of sugarcane burning in several

151
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,560
cities in sao paulo state

152
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,440
what were your major findings especially

153
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,160
with regard to disease hospitalizations

154
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,960
and mortality

155
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,240
well i had started studying

156
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,600
air pollution effects on health in the

157
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,199
city of sao paulo in the late 80s but

158
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,960
then around

159
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:08,560
2000 the year 2000 i started to study

160
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,120
the effects of biomass fire especially

161
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,840
because of the

162
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,919
great expansion of sugarcane plantation

163
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,960
in the state of sao paulo due to the

164
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,120
development of the flex fuel engine for

165
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,240
cars

166
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,680
at that time mainly small cities had

167
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,199
this problem

168
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,280
of

169
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,080
receiving the effects of the burning of

170
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,080
sugarcane

171
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,960
and so we selected some municipalities

172
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,600
in the state of sao paulo the first one

173
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,319
was the spirit center the turvo in the

174
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,280
west part of the state and we started

175
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,319
mainly direct effects because sugarcane

176
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,360
burning can have also indirect health

177
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:57,199
effects as climate change

178
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,400
uh caused by greenhouse greenhouse gases

179
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,280
in

180
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,479
car accidents due to the reduced

181
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,479
visibility but our studies focus

182
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,800
on direct effects and

183
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,800
mainly respiratory diseases

184
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,720
i also

185
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,120
advise that around eight dissertations

186
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,639
and teases on the team

187
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,039
on this team of and i had two large

188
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,080
projects financed by the ministry of

189
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,360
health of brazil and minister of science

190
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,199
education

191
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,120
the first one was undertaken in 2004 and

192
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,199
2005

193
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,759
in a municipality

194
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,479
where 100 percent of sugarcane

195
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,199
plantations were still burned in spite

196
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,759
of the law in 2002 because the

197
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,240
plantations were not adapted to receive

198
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,280
the machinery

199
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,840
at that time we met we installed air

200
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,400
pollution monitoring equipment at the

201
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,720
school at the city school

202
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,440
and we study uh

203
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,720
air pollution during hazard harvest time

204
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,840
and non-harvest time and we also study

205
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,560
respiratory symptoms in children from 10

206
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,680
to 13 years old

207
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,039
and our findings indicated that in spite

208
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,680
of the the level of pollutants

209
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,319
they were not over what

210
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,039
brazilian legislation allowed at that

211
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:31,280
time now brazilian legislation is more

212
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:34,320
strict but at that time it was permitted

213
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:38,080
the prevalence of respiratory symptoms

214
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,479
in children was very high among 28

215
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,919
symptoms that we studied

216
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,560
22 of them were higher than we had found

217
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,720
in this metropolitan regions of sao

218
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,120
paulo

219
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,320
and those symptoms were

220
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,279
mainly cough most days cough without

221
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,839
cold

222
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,720
wheezing bronchitis asthma ear

223
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,800
infections and allergies

224
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,680
those neighborhoods were usually

225
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,560
low-income neighborhoods

226
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,160
where population lived in simple houses

227
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,600
without

228
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,360
much protection for air pollution and

229
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,720
also

230
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,000
sugarcane harvest occurs in winter where

231
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,000
you have the problem of

232
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,440
more virus because of the cold that

233
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,000
starts

234
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,360
and also

235
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,279
temperature inversions which

236
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,320
difficult turns it difficult to

237
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,120
dispersion of air pollution

238
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:45,360
after that first studies

239
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:48,080
we undertook other studies in araraquara

240
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,120
which is the north part of the state and

241
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,680
we studied children uh

242
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,080
until four years old from zero to four

243
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,200
years old and old people

244
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,560
uh

245
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,959
65 years old and older

246
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,320
and we studied using a job processing

247
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,120
techniques

248
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,959
geographical information systems with

249
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,200
data on

250
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,399
sugarcane area

251
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,839
number of

252
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,279
fires

253
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,920
by

254
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:25,120
satellite image or by

255
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:28,160
set asb data which register the fires

256
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,240
hospital admissions by age and by

257
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,000
by

258
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:37,200
classification of disease and also the

259
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,959
social uh data on the population

260
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,839
affected

261
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,360
and and we found

262
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,320
that in

263
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,959
most of the studies that there was an

264
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,320
association with

265
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:56,000
sugar cane fires and respiratory

266
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:59,200
symptoms and a hospital admiss higher

267
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,120
levels of hospital admission during

268
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,959
sugarcane harvest

269
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,720
and especially in uh during or a few

270
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,000
days after

271
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,680
the

272
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,440
fires were allowed by ceteste which

273
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,760
allowed agriculture to to

274
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,480
put the fire on sugarcane before

275
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,480
harvesting

276
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:30,000
the other finding was that

277
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,880
the population was affected was mainly

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,680
low-income population

279
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,440
which had more difficulties in getting

280
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,519
to a

281
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,519
basic health system so they

282
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,959
save more days before getting to the

283
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,279
hospital and they would get a worse

284
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,160
health situation

285
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,880
uh

286
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,160
and the problem was also worse for

287
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,279
children and for old people that were

288
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,880
those were the main findings but uh

289
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,760
since those projects they lasted for a

290
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,079
while

291
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:11,519
we could see that after 2008 which was

292
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:14,079
five years after the law when

293
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,040
part of the the sugarcane plantation

294
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:21,279
could not be burnt anymore and from then

295
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,680
on there was a reduction in the number

296
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,120
of fires in the state of sao paulo and

297
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,600
there was also reduction in the

298
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,079
admissions of respiratory

299
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,880
due to respiratory diseases

300
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,480
in the population we could see that year

301
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,440
by year

302
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,560
this reduction so it was important to

303
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,160
see

304
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,320
uh how it happened uh i told about arara

305
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,800
kwara but we started in presidential

306
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,519
prudenti region and we study in the

307
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,480
northwest region of the state

308
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,440
where 25 municipalities

309
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,440
had large areas in sugar cane and in all

310
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,959
those areas we noticed this reduction in

311
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,839
fires and reduction in respiratory this

312
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,680
is

313
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:12,399
admission in hospitals with using data

314
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,760
from soos the brazilian unified health

315
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,040
system

316
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,959
uh we also at inara aquari we had

317
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,880
studied

318
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,519
uh airborne polycyclic aromatic

319
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:29,040
hydrocarbons to see the the cancer the

320
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,160
risk of cancer due to the pollutants of

321
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,920
the

322
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,160
sugarcane uh

323
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:40,000
fires and we identified that there was a

324
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,760
tolerable tolerable tolerable risk of

325
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,760
cancer

326
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,560
in the areas

327
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,399
where sugarcane was burned

328
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,120
and but this risk also uh decreases

329
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,959
along the time the data

330
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,399
with the the

331
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:03,600
the when we measure pollutant in 2002

332
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:05,760
was higher than in 2010 so

333
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,279
in the meantime

334
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,240
the law

335
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,240
brought benefits for the population

336
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,839
thank you so much that was very helpful

337
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,760
similar to what you've just described dr

338
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,839
elena

339
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,160
residents in florida's gleeds region

340
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,560
have raised concerns about negative

341
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,560
health impacts from cane burning

342
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,160
that was the driving factor behind the

343
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,560
lawsuit that was referenced in the

344
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,120
documentary and now that lawsuit was

345
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,480
recently dropped at the agreement of all

346
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,079
parties

347
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,240
and the major sugar companies in the

348
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,959
region say that the air is good and

349
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,760
meets federal clean air standards

350
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,360
but as we've reported the epa is

351
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,360
currently considering whether those

352
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,120
clean air standards are adequate to

353
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,199
protect public health

354
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,560
uh now dr christopher holmes thank you

355
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,639
for being here

356
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,360
your research examines the global cycles

357
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,600
of air pollutants and greenhouse gases

358
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,560
what kinds of pollution does sugar cane

359
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,720
burning produce in florida and what are

360
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,720
some of the challenges in tracking it

361
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,040
my research group has spent some time

362
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,120
looking at

363
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,000
data collected from surface monitoring

364
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,920
sites in south florida and also from

365
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,680
satellites which orbit the earth and

366
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,199
observe south florida as well as the

367
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,399
rest of the world

368
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,240
and

369
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,320
the first thing we looked at was uh

370
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,519
respirable uh particulate matter which

371
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,720
is also called pm 2.5

372
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,560
and this particulate matter can reach

373
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,560
deep into the lungs and cause a variety

374
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,680
of health

375
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,720
problems

376
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,519
there are

377
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,399
dozens of monitoring stations in florida

378
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,160
because it's well known that pm 2.5

379
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,279
causes disease

380
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,360
and we looked particularly at several

381
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,399
sites that were close to the sugar cane

382
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,399
fires

383
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,480
and at two sites near the sugar cane

384
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,160
fires we found that

385
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,800
the concentrations of this pm 2.5 were

386
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,240
higher during the harvest burn season

387
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,199
than they were in the rest of the year

388
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,600
and this was unlike any other sites in

389
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,079
south florida showing that that the

390
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,600
concentrations were higher closer to the

391
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,480
fires

392
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,480
this corroborated what other studies

393
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,800
have found in the past some researchers

394
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:31,120
at florida international university

395
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:34,079
measured concentrations of uh pahs which

396
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,440
uh dr ribeiro just discussed

397
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,680
and uh those were uh characteristic of

398
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,399
emissions from burning vegetation and

399
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,880
those were many times higher in the uh

400
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,040
sugarcane burning region than elsewhere

401
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,000
in south florida

402
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,519
it's now established from many other

403
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,040
studies that

404
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,759
these

405
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,000
small particles and pahs cause quite a

406
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,759
few different health impacts and dr

407
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,120
ribeiro listed

408
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,920
several of them

409
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,360
but i would emphasize that they are

410
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,559
associated with

411
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,880
cases of asthma bronchitis emphysema

412
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,760
other respiratory infections heart

413
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,839
disease heart attacks lung cancer

414
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,199
obviously this list goes on

415
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,000
but also things like um premature birth

416
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,880
of

417
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,600
and

418
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,079
low birth weight of of babies

419
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,600
um several of these can be fatal

420
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,600
and um

421
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,679
using these past studies in other

422
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,400
regions

423
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,559
that

424
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
relate the concentrations of particulate

425
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,880
matter to uh

426
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,720
mortality and health outcomes we

427
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,679
estimate that there's probably

428
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,360
about one to six deaths per year uh as a

429
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,400
result of the sugarcane burning

430
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,160
emissions in south florida

431
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,000
for the scale of these emissions i think

432
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,840
it's interesting to

433
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,240
compare them to something like motor

434
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,000
vehicle emissions from the area of sugar

435
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,120
cane that's burned each year we think

436
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,600
there's about 5 000 tons of particulate

437
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,160
matter produced in these fires and

438
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,080
that's pretty close to the emissions

439
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,240
from all of the motor vehicles across

440
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,880
the state of florida but the sugar cane

441
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,120
fires of course unlike the vehicles are

442
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,960
tightly concentrated in just one small

443
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,760
part of the state surrounding a few

444
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,760
different communities

445
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,200
thank you so much

446
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,919
that was really illuminating

447
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,080
environmental concerns also played an

448
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,559
important role in the decision in sao

449
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,840
paulo state to transition away from

450
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,080
burning and to harvesting raw cane

451
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,400
nearly all the cane in the state

452
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,679
in sao paulo is now harvested without

453
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,960
burning

454
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,440
so uh dr rafael joseto

455
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,600
what were the agricultural challenges

456
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,640
and the benefits of switching to raw

457
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,200
cane in brazil can you tell us what that

458
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,520
period of learning and adaptation was

459
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,520
like

460
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
opportunity

461
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,919
the first challenge was that we have no

462
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,640
machinery to harvest sugar cane

463
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,919
especially the moment the government

464
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,480
decided that we had to change things we

465
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,840
have no machinery for this reason we

466
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:41,039
have decided to create a timeline

467
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,720
and use a 10-year period to help us

468
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,200
adapt to the law

469
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,640
and while we were purchasing that

470
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,640
machinery we have learned how to do the

471
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,360
work in the new system

472
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,919
first we just thought that we would

473
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,280
no longer hire people and just use the

474
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,120
machines

475
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,000
so we

476
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,480
we were faced with new solutions and

477
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,760
lots of learning

478
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,240
so the first

479
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,600
challenge was machinery and the second

480
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,200
was

481
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,360
hiring people

482
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,080
because we knew that we would no longer

483
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,440
hire so many people because the machines

484
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,840
were there

485
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,360
luckily

486
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:27,200
the sugarcane sector was expanding and

487
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,720
we have hired people to do work in other

488
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,360
areas with

489
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,440
sugarcane expansion

490
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,919
later on the next challenge was that

491
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:42,000
sugarcane productivity

492
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,880
lowered because raw cane has lower

493
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,400
productivity than burnt cane

494
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,360
later on we understood that

495
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,640
the

496
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,440
machine

497
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,200
would

498
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,200
stamp on

499
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,400
the cane

500
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,600
or even the machine would cut some part

501
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,240
of the plant

502
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,720
so we have improved quality of the

503
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,640
machinery in the process

504
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,760
also we have resorted to gps and we no

505
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,039
longer

506
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,760
have the machinery go on top of the

507
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,919
sugar cane line

508
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:22,080
later on we had other

509
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:25,760
other challenges linked to pests

510
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:29,039
the only advantage of burning is that

511
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,120
burning kills off pests

512
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,200
and as time goes by

513
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,200
the past

514
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,440
are faced with their

515
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,159
uh natural killers

516
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:44,320
basically we need to be patient we need

517
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:48,960
to learn and try to calibrate the system

518
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,039
also we have developed some pesticides

519
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,840
that we used in the beginning and

520
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,559
nowadays we are phasing out

521
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,280
the use of pesticides

522
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,880
we

523
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,919
currently we only use pesticides where

524
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,720
we have problems with certain pests

525
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:10,559
also we have changed

526
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,799
some plants that were harmful to

527
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,200
sugar cane

528
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,280
we have developed new techniques to

529
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,320
fight those plants

530
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,360
also we have changed fertilization

531
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,200
because the straw is really

532
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,480
nurturing for

533
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,520
the soil

534
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,960
we

535
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,640
need to be careful when adapting and

536
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,360
using new types of fertilizers

537
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:41,840
we've learned so much

538
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:45,039
over the first 10 years and i dare say

539
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,360
that now the system is still a work in

540
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,280
progress we're still improving our

541
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,559
techniques we're still

542
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,320
using

543
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,799
new machines

544
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,200
i've told you about the challenges but

545
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,480
now i'll tell you about the benefits the

546
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,520
benefits are we have more protection for

547
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,960
the soil we have better

548
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,919
soil humidity now

549
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,280
we have better soil

550
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:16,080
conservation and better physical

551
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,760
qualities for the soil as well as

552
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,559
biological life for the soil

553
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,600
a large number of micro

554
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,360
organisms have developed because of the

555
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,440
straw

556
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,080
and all of this has

557
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,840
brought more organic material and more

558
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,880
life to the soil

559
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,480
and i

560
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,440
can tell you that the biggest

561
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,760
advantage is to raise

562
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:49,200
environmental awareness in the

563
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:52,480
sugar industry i think that in brazil

564
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,000
there's nobody who thinks that

565
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,200
sugarcane burning is the best technique

566
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,320
nobody agrees with that anymore our

567
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,600
grown agronomic engineers they have

568
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,400
shown us

569
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,480
how good it is to

570
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,960
use the new techniques

571
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,400
and whenever we're faced with challenges

572
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,960
they

573
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,080
they help us see that

574
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,279
the new method is much better thank you

575
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,279
thank you for listening to me

576
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,080
thank you that was really informative

577
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,559
um

578
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,960
so brazil's sugar companies seem to have

579
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,120
embraced that transition to not burning

580
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,799
as you mentioned

581
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,279
throughout the course of our reporting

582
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,279
florida sugar companies have denied that

583
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,559
pre-harvest burns have a significant

584
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:45,120
impact on air quality or public health

585
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,039
now prior to this event propublica asked

586
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,760
florida crystals and u.s sugar the

587
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,400
largest sugar producers in the region

588
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,279
for their perspectives on brazil and

589
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,360
alternative harvesting methods florida

590
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,600
crystals did not respond

591
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,679
and us sugar provided a statement but it

592
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,120
did not address our questions

593
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,120
the company said

594
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,200
u.s sugar proudly stands behind the

595
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,840
safety and integrity of its farming and

596
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,320
processing practices in addition the men

597
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,480
and women of u.s sugar are also employee

598
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,240
owners of our company with jobs that

599
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,440
meet the world's highest standards for

600
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,840
worker safety environmental stewardship

601
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,679
sustainability and technological

602
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,480
innovation

603
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,559
antonio queros this question is for you

604
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,799
you work with the state environmental

605
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,640
agency in sao paulo that regulates

606
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,919
agricultural burning

607
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,480
in brazil

608
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,640
what was the reaction of the industry

609
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,279
when regulators first announced that

610
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:45,840
they were going to end sugarcane burning

611
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,840
and how did that change over time

612
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,720
the question is that sugarcane industry

613
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,520
was having a lot of claims of the

614
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,159
population nearby due to the all the

615
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,559
health problems in this city so the

616
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,960
problem due to the burning of the

617
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:04,559
sugarcane leaves so it was not

618
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,520
a new question

619
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:12,159
satisby is the state company

620
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:15,440
in charge of control pollution sources

621
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:20,159
of course a big burning is a pollution

622
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:23,279
source so when satellite has a question

623
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,720
of the justice of the population about a

624
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:30,000
large burning causing very big problems

625
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:33,039
so the company needs to take action and

626
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,559
please do not burn now because we have a

627
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:38,559
very low umt in air we have a very low

628
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,480
content of humanity

629
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:46,400
below 20 percent you cannot burn now

630
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,200
justice also start actions against these

631
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,799
farmers just asking you cannot burn it

632
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,919
you are

633
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:58,080
causing a big health problem so it was

634
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:01,919
not a new question to these companies

635
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:05,440
when in 2002 we got a state law

636
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,559
um just trying to ban the fires

637
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,919
this law was as raphaela said

638
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:15,440
really well done because it gives to the

639
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,120
companies time to make these adoptions

640
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,399
we got a

641
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,360
period of time of 20 years to burn the

642
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,919
fire and the places where harvest could

643
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,039
be made by mike mcqueen

644
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:32,080
and 30 years where the harvest should be

645
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,520
manual due to the inflammation of

646
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,480
the land

647
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,840
so

648
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,480
companies start to burn the fire and in

649
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,960
the beginning it was a big mess because

650
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,960
we were working on paper

651
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,320
just try to imagine

652
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,679
large

653
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,919
companies bringing maps on paper

654
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,320
saying fear is the 20

655
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,840
of my area that i'm not going to burn

656
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,720
this year it was almost impossible to to

657
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,399
monetize to give to communicate

658
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,799
and the company

659
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,399
developed uh

660
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,480
a way to make everything by the internet

661
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,480
and

662
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:18,080
a system that we got all the maps of the

663
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:21,200
the farms and the farmer just put this

664
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,399
is the area the 20 of the era that i am

665
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,320
not going to burn in this five first

666
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,799
years of the law

667
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,720
so what happened was that when the

668
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,760
companies start

669
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,840
having this machinery they start

670
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,919
improving this

671
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,880
mechanical harvesting

672
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,600
and

673
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,600
just talk with the environmental

674
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,679
agency and talk hey

675
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:50,559
we are expected to end this burning in

676
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:54,799
uh 2020.

677
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,600
let's see what if i just make it earlier

678
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,760
so

679
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,200
the the companies just talked with the

680
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,159
agency and we got a environmental

681
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,200
protocol to anticipate the end of

682
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,640
burning because when they start

683
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,840
to buy this this machinery when they

684
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,399
start just you need you need to to make

685
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,919
big changes in the way you plant if you

686
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,960
are going to

687
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,000
use machinery harvesting you cannot have

688
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,279
level curves you need to make everything

689
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,679
flat so the machinery machinery can pass

690
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:33,600
through the cane just making the harvest

691
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,960
a better way so why do not accelerate

692
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,960
this process

693
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,159
and also these companies just uh and the

694
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,720
problem that they had with the

695
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:47,200
municipalities nearby and the population

696
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,720
always claiming about this fires in the

697
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,440
burning especially in the dry season in

698
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,200
brazil that is our winter

699
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,240
so

700
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,279
the sugarcane sector did not

701
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,480
try not to to

702
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,919
to

703
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,120
ban the files they just had to have

704
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,279
their time to make this the patient and

705
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,480
it was really a success

706
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:18,559
meanwhile in one of the regimes of the

707
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:22,480
state in jawa there was a

708
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:25,760
action as this election and it went to

709
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:29,039
the supreme court of brazil that

710
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,360
said that it was forbidden to burn in

711
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,279
all that region right

712
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,039
but a lot

713
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,799
before the

714
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:41,279
date that the law stipulated

715
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,799
so it was very important for the sector

716
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:48,159
to say hey wait a little i am doing my

717
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:50,080
job i am banning gradually and i'm

718
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,600
making it enough

719
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,320
in a way that i can maintain my economic

720
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:00,480
creativity and we will have the same

721
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:03,360
result in 2017 for us the

722
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,799
last year that we got big fires and the

723
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,919
bigger farms today we have only very

724
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:13,200
very very little burning in the the

725
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,919
properties where it's impossible to make

726
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,760
the mechanical harvest so it was a

727
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:22,159
process it was not very hard it

728
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,840
took a lot of work but

729
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,159
it is done

730
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,320
yeah well yes you mentioned a lot of

731
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,880
work and um in the united states

732
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,960
similarly we often have conversations

733
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,519
about that balance between

734
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,000
regulation and the economy

735
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,120
and in florida many people are concerned

736
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,120
about the economic impact of making that

737
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,080
harvesting transition

738
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,399
how did you as a state regulator

739
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,399
evaluate that dynamic in brazil

740
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:54,399
balancing health and safety with jobs

741
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,200
let's see it in two ways in two

742
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,519
different ways well you have an industry

743
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,399
and then you buy a very very new

744
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,519
machinery and you need to dismiss 200

745
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,880
employees

746
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,240
oh

747
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,760
i'm so sad but i importantly you lose

748
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,039
your job all right what's the problem no

749
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,080
okay

750
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:19,200
why because i just need to have my

751
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,159
profit okay it's a way to see it

752
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,640
if i say to you well now you have a new

753
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,440
regulation i need you to have a better

754
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,799
pollution air pollution control and you

755
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,840
say whoa but i will need to to to spend

756
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:36,240
a lot of money to do it yes but it's for

757
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,279
the help of everybody

758
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,000
so i'd like to understand why one can

759
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:45,600
just sneeze people in name of a better

760
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,559
profit and one cannot have a less profit

761
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,760
in behalf of all the population and it's

762
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,799
not a new problem you see here in brazil

763
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,760
we have a licensing process that has a

764
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,799
previous license an installation license

765
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,159
and operation license so the first one

766
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,159
says well

767
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,200
what you want to do is possible in this

768
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,039
place the second one says well you can

769
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,600
build your factory you can build your

770
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,880
plan and the third one well start

771
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,640
operating but you need to renew your

772
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,440
operation license in three five years or

773
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,120
two years it depends upon how dangerous

774
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,519
is your your activity for an environment

775
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,200
well here in brazil there is no such a

776
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:34,000
thing like a acquired right to pollute

777
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,279
because when you come to renew your life

778
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,919
your operation licensee i can say to you

779
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,880
well you know your

780
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,039
air pollution controls are not so good

781
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,240
in this last three years

782
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:51,760
we have another technology much better

783
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,919
and i want you to improve your

784
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,360
your control your your air pollution

785
00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:01,360
control so the review of the operation

786
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:04,799
license can ask for the the

787
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:08,000
the industry to buy different operations

788
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:10,480
to buy new equipments and to attend to a

789
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,359
high street standards

790
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,560
because in brazilian constitution

791
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:20,560
they it's granted to all brazilians the

792
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:24,240
right to a healthy environment

793
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,720
so i need to grant it that's my

794
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,720
that's why my duty as a

795
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:34,240
government agency and health is one of

796
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:37,599
the most important things that we must

797
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,399
look when we are licensing an activity

798
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:43,200
so of course in some activities you will

799
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:46,320
have some sound pollution some water

800
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,960
pollution some air pollution but you

801
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,480
cannot compare any pollution from an

802
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,720
industrial activity to a burning of

803
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,960
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of

804
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,760
acres of sugarcane in the free space

805
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,480
so

806
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:06,640
for us it's really a question of a

807
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,640
health environmental event

808
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:18,800
thank you so much antonio quiroz

809
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,720
in florida uh the agency so somewhat

810
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,800
analogous to the agency that you work

811
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,920
for but in florida the agency that

812
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,560
regulates sugar harvesting practices is

813
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,400
the state department of agriculture and

814
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,640
consumer services

815
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,440
we invited florida's agricultural

816
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,000
commissioner nikki freed and her staff

817
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,480
to participate in the panel today

818
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,320
they declined saying they were short

819
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,520
staffed in the middle of a legislative

820
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,000
session

821
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,920
in the past commissioner freed has says

822
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,320
she believes it's possible for quote

823
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,440
unquote green harvesting or the

824
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,920
harvesting of raw unburnt sugarcane to

825
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,599
be feasible in florida but they still

826
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,560
need to examine

827
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,359
quote pest and plant diseases worker

828
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,160
safety florida's ecosystem and soil

829
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,160
composition and industrial demand for

830
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,200
green harvesting

831
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,920
dr rafaela joseto you spent a year

832
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,640
working in florida's glades region and

833
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,680
given these concerns pests worker safety

834
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,720
the soil etc do you think a transition

835
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,440
to harvesting raw unburnt cane would be

836
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,440
possible in florida

837
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,760
i know

838
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,480
agronomists in florida

839
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,680
i think they are as good or even better

840
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,839
than brazilian professionals

841
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,400
and if brazilians

842
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,320
have managed to overcome the technical

843
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,599
problems i'm sure

844
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,160
american

845
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,280
agronomic engineers are also going to

846
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,440
make it i think that you have to start

847
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,560
you don't need to start with 100 of the

848
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:12,320
areas you could start with 20 of the

849
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:15,599
areas you could um you know learn from

850
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:19,200
the process maybe in five six years ten

851
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:23,280
years then you overcome the burning

852
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,040
and not having problems with past or

853
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,240
infestation

854
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,800
you

855
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,440
need to take action now

856
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,359
you need to take action and do you work

857
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,280
little by little and you're going to

858
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:41,119
overcome the challenges as they come

859
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:45,280
and you can learn from us here in brazil

860
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,640
we know that issues are regionals but

861
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,000
you know

862
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,200
we offer a case study for florida in any

863
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,040
way

864
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,760
i think that it's important to take the

865
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,160
first step and then you

866
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,760
tackle the problems the problems are not

867
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,720
that hard because the hardest problems

868
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,880
are

869
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,560
offering people work

870
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,440
and we know that

871
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:12,000
in the u.s you have machine harvesting

872
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,359
already so what's the problem of stop

873
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,960
burning

874
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:18,640
maybe the

875
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,119
machinery is going to be slower to do

876
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,520
the harvesting

877
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,480
you know it's going to take some hours

878
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
more

879
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,079
to

880
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,599
harvest raw cane

881
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,839
than it would with burnt cane

882
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,599
there will be some past but it's

883
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,880
something temporary that you can

884
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:42,240
overcome in some years

885
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,280
natural natural enemies are gonna

886
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,359
come up but i think that you have to get

887
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,240
started florida

888
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,400
can

889
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,839
lead the way and

890
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,200
show people clean techniques

891
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,079
and

892
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,040
eco-friendly practices

893
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,800
here in brazil one thing that was really

894
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,040
good is that

895
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,960
the

896
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,240
plants are proud of saying they have

897
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,000
modern

898
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,599
ecologic practices that they do socially

899
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,359
responsible work

900
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,400
environmentally

901
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:22,400
right work and they use this to showcase

902
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,079
their success

903
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,720
it's so good that the largest industries

904
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,200
the largest plants in brazil they have

905
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,480
embraced it and they like to show they

906
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,480
protect nature

907
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,000
thank you so much for that perspective

908
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,720
dr rafaela that was really insightful

909
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,440
we are coming up on the 20th anniversary

910
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,640
of sao paulo's original law to phase out

911
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,119
the burns

912
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,760
meanwhile in the u.s we've never had any

913
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,320
laws banning sugarcane burning

914
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,000
lawmakers have taken an interest in air

915
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,400
quality however

916
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,079
last month three u.s representatives

917
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,240
introduced a bill that would create a

918
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,319
pilot program for air monitoring and

919
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,440
low-income communities and communities

920
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,040
of color

921
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,000
among the sponsors of the bill is

922
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,079
florida representative kathy castor

923
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,599
in florida's sugar growing region there

924
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:20,400
is only one government-run air monitor

925
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,839
dr holmes as an expert in air monitoring

926
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,960
and modeling

927
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,400
you've said that the government should

928
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,880
take a closer look at the air in

929
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,960
florida's sugar growing region

930
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,440
what should additional government

931
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,920
monitoring look like

932
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:39,319
given the short duration of those burns

933
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,319
and what might that monitoring tell us

934
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,160
right so in urban areas across the us uh

935
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,160
we have

936
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,839
typically an urban area will have

937
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,160
multiple monitors

938
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,119
and that allows you to map out the

939
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,960
concentrations of particulate matter and

940
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,200
other pollutants

941
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,319
in various neighborhoods

942
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,079
the

943
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,680
area of florida where sugarcane is

944
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,440
burned has multiple

945
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,480
different communities

946
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,119
and

947
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,440
the one official monitor there is not in

948
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,240
the center of any of those communities

949
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,960
um

950
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,640
and so i think if you want to know what

951
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,800
the concentrations of these pollutants

952
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,599
are obviously you want to have

953
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,200
a measurement in in the center of of

954
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,319
each of the communities or somewhere

955
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,040
within the the general population area

956
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,160
um there is a

957
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,640
rising

958
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,680
availability of low-cost sensors which i

959
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,240
know the

960
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,599
pro-publica worked on deploying several

961
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,640
of those in

962
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,480
in the

963
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:43,280
area and those are a

964
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,000
tool that can be used to supplement uh

965
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,680
the

966
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,640
regulatory monitors they aren't as

967
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,640
accurate

968
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,800
but they um our they are um

969
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,720
or they can be reliable so

970
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,640
uh they have to be checked carefully but

971
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,119
but they can be used for mapping things

972
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,400
out and uh that's being used routinely

973
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,640
in in a variety of other states and

974
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,839
and cities to map out air pollution on

975
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,240
fine spatial scales

976
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,839
we also use satellites because

977
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,160
satellites are

978
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,400
peering down from space all the time

979
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,680
and what we've seen from space

980
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,640
uh

981
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,880
re reinforces what we saw from just the

982
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,839
the couple of monitors that are in the

983
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,880
in the

984
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,480
area where sugar cane is burned uh

985
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,000
the

986
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,079
thing that i mentioned earlier was that

987
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,200
the concentrations of particulate matter

988
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,680
are higher

989
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,800
at the two sites that are

990
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,680
near the

991
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:43,040
sugar cane fires and the satellites

992
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,520
further showed that the area of that

993
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,920
elevated particulate matter coincides

994
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,720
very closely with the boundaries of the

995
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,520
sugarcane fields so the satellites are

996
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,280
providing spatial information uh that we

997
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,560
can't get from current

998
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,000
sensors on the ground but it really does

999
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,760
again support

1000
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
the conclusion that

1001
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,960
there is a source of particulate matter

1002
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,960
in the sugarcane burning region

1003
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,880
thank you so much for that i'm not in

1004
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,040
lulu for beginning to take us through

1005
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,920
that discussion um we're now going to

1006
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,920
turn it over to our audience q a but

1007
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,720
before doing that i'd like to just share

1008
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,880
a quick link to our event survey in the

1009
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,960
chat box that i am dropping in now we

1010
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,040
really appreciate your feedback again if

1011
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,280
you'd like to ask a question click that

1012
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,880
q a icon at the bottom of your screen to

1013
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,440
submit it to us

1014
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,440
we already have a few in so i'm going to

1015
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,560
go ahead and pass it back to nada to

1016
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,560
deliver that first question

1017
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,720
thank you so much to all of our

1018
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,640
panelists thank you racio and thanks to

1019
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,200
everybody who asked questions

1020
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,960
um so i'm going to start with one it's a

1021
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,280
bit of a double question

1022
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,920
is the reluctance of the florida sugar

1023
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,560
industry to invest in machinery thus

1024
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,280
costing them money a part of the problem

1025
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,000
and did the price of brazil's sugar

1026
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,240
increase after the burns stopped

1027
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,319
and so for the first question about the

1028
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,440
machinery i just want to say that

1029
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:19,520
florida's sugar is already harvested by

1030
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,839
machine so in brazil you saw the manual

1031
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,920
cutters in the video that practice has

1032
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,640
been replaced by machine cutting in

1033
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,040
florida already

1034
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,920
antonio queras maybe you can answer the

1035
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,079
question about the price of brazil's

1036
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,079
sugar and if it went up after the burns

1037
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,079
stopped

1038
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:44,079
i i don't know if if you have a rise in

1039
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,040
the price with the stop of the bernies

1040
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,280
but the truth is that the industry

1041
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,040
sugarcane industry in brazil look

1042
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:56,400
forward a green protocol just to be able

1043
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,599
to sell to markets where these

1044
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:03,280
worries with environmental subjects were

1045
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:06,720
really important just to close man just

1046
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:09,440
to to open markets and not to close down

1047
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,000
so when we talk about the green protocol

1048
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,319
that industry just assigned with the

1049
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,800
environmental uh

1050
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:20,720
departments of sao paulo state this

1051
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:23,359
brought a very a very good marketing for

1052
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,560
these companies so these companies could

1053
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:30,160
say i am a green company i have my sugar

1054
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:33,599
without burning i have my sugar in a

1055
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:37,359
very very strict law observance so that

1056
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:39,920
was the uh the improvement in the to the

1057
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,040
company profile i don't know exactly

1058
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,160
about the

1059
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,760
the compartment of the prices but i

1060
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:51,119
i heard it of many of these big planters

1061
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:54,720
that they say no i want to have a green

1062
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:57,200
seal on my sugar because europe wants it

1063
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,520
because all the markets won't see i want

1064
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,839
to be a green product and it's a good

1065
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,839
way

1066
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:08,000
thank you and thank you to all of the

1067
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,960
attendees for the excellent questions um

1068
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,079
we got one here for you dr holmes

1069
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,720
um

1070
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,400
uh the attendee asks uh any time that

1071
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,560
health outcomes and the relationship

1072
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,480
between burning and negative health uh

1073
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,400
health outcomes are mentioned

1074
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,400
uh they're told that the data does not

1075
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,760
support a negative health outcome you

1076
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,680
mentioned this when you were speaking

1077
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,920
earlier can you speak a little bit more

1078
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:33,760
about that link between mortality and

1079
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,800
morbidity and burning cycles

1080
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,359
right

1081
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,480
we know from lots of studies in urban

1082
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,880
areas

1083
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,280
across especially in the us but also in

1084
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,079
europe and many other countries

1085
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:49,200
that um inhaling particulate matter

1086
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,599
is harmful to your health and

1087
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,560
dr rivero has done some of those studies

1088
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,640
and she spoke directly about that

1089
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,960
you can think of this as

1090
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,560
analogous to

1091
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:04,319
smoking cigarettes

1092
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:07,440
which are also sources of um particles

1093
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,160
and um tobacco is of course a plant and

1094
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,599
so

1095
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:14,000
there's some not a not a tight analogy

1096
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,800
but there's some analogy to burning it

1097
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,680
to

1098
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,760
uh

1099
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,000
inhaling smoke from a cigarette which is

1100
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,040
well known to be uh

1101
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,440
toxic

1102
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,079
and um inhaling smoke from other burning

1103
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,040
vegetation whether that be a wildfire or

1104
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:32,480
an agricultural fire

1105
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,240
and so we know that the

1106
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,200
injuries that come from that depend on

1107
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,640
how much of that smoke you burn

1108
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,319
we have

1109
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,640
now established or the scientific

1110
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,839
community has now established that that

1111
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,839
the

1112
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:47,440
there are harmful effects of burning

1113
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:49,440
excuse me of inhaling

1114
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,440
particle particulate matter down to very

1115
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,160
low concentrations at least

1116
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:59,040
concentrations of

1117
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:02,559
five micrograms per cubic meter and uh

1118
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,359
i bring up that specific number because

1119
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,440
the

1120
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:08,079
the way that air quality is generally

1121
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,079
regulated in the us is based on a

1122
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,200
threshold system called the national

1123
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,920
ambient air quality standards and um

1124
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,400
that's set by the us epa

1125
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,640
and they pick a threshold

1126
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,760
above which uh there are consequences

1127
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,520
and below which um there there are not

1128
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,400
and there's a lot of

1129
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,480
um

1130
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,280
factors that go into setting those

1131
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,280
standards but the current standard is

1132
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,440
that um

1133
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,599
the air quality should have

1134
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:41,280
concentrations of 12

1135
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:43,760
micrograms per cubic meter or less of pm

1136
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,000
2.5 so

1137
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,119
the scientific literature shows that

1138
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,200
there are

1139
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:52,160
harmful effects of inhaling particulate

1140
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,480
matter at concentrations that are below

1141
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,520
what the ambient air quality standards

1142
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,400
allow

1143
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,200
so

1144
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,480
when i have said that you know we expect

1145
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,520
that there are

1146
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:07,440
uh impacts of inhaling smoke from sugar

1147
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:11,119
cane and from other burning sources

1148
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,800
even though the concentrations in

1149
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,880
the

1150
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,079
sugarcane burning region are indeed

1151
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,920
below 12 micrograms per cubic meter we

1152
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,119
still do effect expect that there are

1153
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,640
going to be

1154
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:26,400
um

1155
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,400
uh health impacts from those

1156
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:32,400
thank you and and just to throw that

1157
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,480
question to dr hibero as well um

1158
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,480
you mentioned that that threshold for

1159
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,800
what's healthy and what's allowed under

1160
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,280
the law in brazil also changed over the

1161
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,960
course of the discussions so what does

1162
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,800
that look like what did that transition

1163
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,319
look like when

1164
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,079
research and

1165
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:50,079
new information emerged in brazil

1166
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,599
well brazil now is in the process of

1167
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,119
adopting world health organization

1168
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,440
thresholds

1169
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:02,160
which is slower a little lower than the

1170
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,640
american apa standards

1171
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,440
and uh but we we have

1172
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:11,359
a time like we did for the sugarcane

1173
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:14,240
harvesting in and using fire we have a

1174
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:15,680
period of adaptation for the cities

1175
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,480
especially

1176
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,000
and

1177
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,960
for

1178
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,280
car engines to adapt

1179
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,440
to the new standards the state of sao

1180
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,400
paulo has a progressive

1181
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,960
[Music]

1182
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,440
process with intermediate phase and

1183
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,400
phase intermediate phase one two and

1184
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,319
three

1185
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,839
until we get to the world health

1186
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,319
organization

1187
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:42,040
uh thresholds for controlling air

1188
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,280
pollution

1189
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:48,319
[Music]

1190
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:51,920
but but as i said it's not only the the

1191
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:54,720
pollution at the ground level it's also

1192
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:57,680
the greenhouse gases that

1193
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:00,000
the burning produces and this is not

1194
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,720
being discussed

1195
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,079
the forest fires in the amazon are so

1196
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,520
much discussed and around the world and

1197
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,400
and why

1198
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:14,480
a volunteer fire like that is not

1199
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:16,559
discussed because it produces methane

1200
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,760
co2

1201
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,280
seo

1202
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,640
and ozone

1203
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,760
which are greenhouse gases and this may

1204
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,400
affect

1205
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,640
uh climate and

1206
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,000
increased temperatures around the world

1207
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:35,119
so i i guess we we need to have a more

1208
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:39,040
encompassing discussion regarding the

1209
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,040
indirect effects also

1210
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,359
dr elena hibero thank you so much for

1211
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,079
that um

1212
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,000
so

1213
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,520
you know in the short time we have we

1214
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,040
probably won't get to the fully

1215
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,800
encompassing discussion that you're

1216
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,040
talking about but it's definitely

1217
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,880
something we should continue to discuss

1218
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,440
in the future

1219
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,880
we have a question that i think would be

1220
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:06,000
good for dr rafael joseto

1221
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:08,720
have the transformation processes away

1222
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,079
from burning been published in english

1223
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:15,280
and is it available so what resources

1224
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:17,920
are out there based on the experience of

1225
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,839
brazilian agronomists engineers and

1226
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,960
others who work in the sugar cane

1227
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,599
industry

1228
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,559
about transitioning from

1229
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:29,960
using prescribed burns to having a no

1230
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,960
burning harvest

1231
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,920
yes

1232
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,520
most of

1233
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:47,920
um scholar work is written in portuguese

1234
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,800
but we have plenty of material in

1235
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,359
english too especially as regards to

1236
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,359
straw

1237
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:58,079
you know

1238
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:01,119
nutrient cycles based on straw the

1239
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:03,280
changes in terms of fertilization all of

1240
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:07,760
those agronomic

1241
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,359
processes are documented in technical

1242
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,880
journals

1243
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:15,520
you know if you google information

1244
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,680
lots of um

1245
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,400
scholar work is going to show up for you

1246
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:24,319
we have plenty of

1247
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,319
scientific material on that

1248
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:31,040
thank

1249
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:33,760
you um there are a couple questions here

1250
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,160
about employment and some of the

1251
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,559
repercussions of making that transition

1252
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:41,680
in brazil um perhaps this question is

1253
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:44,400
best for you antonio queras um

1254
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:47,359
what happened what was the feedback like

1255
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,119
from those who potentially lost jobs

1256
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:52,000
because of that transition and what did

1257
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:54,400
the employment trends look like overall

1258
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,160
with the sugar industry

1259
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,319
when they made that transition away from

1260
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,839
burning

1261
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:04,640
as i said it was a slow transition so we

1262
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:07,520
have something like 15 years

1263
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:11,200
before the total ban of big fires in sao

1264
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:15,119
paulo state and this job of cutting raw

1265
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:17,839
con the the sugar cane it was not a good

1266
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:21,119
job right people came from northeast

1267
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:23,839
brazil the poorest region in brazil came

1268
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:27,119
to sao paulo state and to the southwest

1269
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:30,240
just to cut sugarcane and then can go

1270
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,960
back to northeast brazil this job

1271
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,599
requires people to stay in a very

1272
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,119
reclined position and

1273
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,640
making this this

1274
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:44,000
sharp too to cut the sugar cane and it

1275
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:46,960
was expected from one person to cut

1276
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,480
something like eight or ten tons of can

1277
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,160
per per day

1278
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:55,760
not a good job not a healthy job so this

1279
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:59,359
transition was not of a good job to a no

1280
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:02,559
job it was from a a a not so good job a

1281
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:03,920
job that only provides you some money as

1282
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,880
uh

1283
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:09,680
as rafaela said some of these people

1284
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:12,520
were employed in sugarcane industry from

1285
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:15,520
this this and this

1286
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:18,319
2002 to 2007.

1287
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,400
we got a big growth of sugarcane

1288
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:23,760
industry in sao paulo state

1289
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:26,480
so we got sugarcane uh going over the

1290
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:29,200
west of the state so some of these

1291
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:32,480
people went to these activities and the

1292
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,839
others were just absorbed by the market

1293
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,440
all right it was the question of do it

1294
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:40,240
in uh

1295
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:43,440
in the time to to give time for people

1296
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,680
to find jobs but it's completely

1297
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,240
different from the situation you have in

1298
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:51,040
florida you do not have people you are

1299
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,920
going to lose no jobs if you stop

1300
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:56,559
burning sugarcane then you will have

1301
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:59,760
only the good part you will have the

1302
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:02,319
aeronautical benefits that rafaela said

1303
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:06,640
and we will you will not have this

1304
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:09,040
health risks that elena said so i

1305
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,280
i see no problem in this

1306
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,599
in this question of jobs for florida

1307
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,599
right

1308
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,079
i would if you if you permit me i i

1309
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:23,680
looked in the chat and i saw a question

1310
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:26,559
about uh somebody asked uh if uh there

1311
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:29,200
is in our constitution the protection of

1312
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:31,920
the help of the people yes

1313
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:36,559
this we have a very very large

1314
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:39,559
constitution and then his 220

1315
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,559
225

1316
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:44,720
article

1317
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,319
we have this protection of environment

1318
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:51,920
if you allow me i will read it to you

1319
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:54,559
everyone has the right to an ecological

1320
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:57,599
balanced environmental

1321
00:56:54,559 --> 00:57:01,200
a good for common use by the people and

1322
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:04,000
essential to a healthy quality of life

1323
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:07,200
imposing on the public power and the

1324
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,400
community the dirty to defend and

1325
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:13,280
preserve it for the present and to true

1326
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,400
generations so this is a constitutional

1327
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,359
command

1328
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,720
right

1329
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:21,520
environment is a good of common use and

1330
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,559
we need to protect and we need to grant

1331
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,079
a health

1332
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:28,880
environment so article two to of our

1333
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,880
constitution

1334
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:37,040
thank you so much antonia

1335
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,960
i saw that there was a question

1336
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,520
have there been health studies in

1337
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:45,119
florida and how large is the exposed

1338
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:47,520
population so i wanted to ask dr

1339
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,760
christopher holmes about that and then i

1340
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:52,160
wanted to follow up afterwards for some

1341
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,000
of our brazilian panelists to learn a

1342
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,880
little bit more about how their studies

1343
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,480
came about so let's start with dr holmes

1344
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,559
please

1345
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:04,319
so my research group has done some of

1346
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,880
that and we have um articles that are

1347
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:09,680
in peer review at a journal so

1348
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:12,480
i uh yes the studies have been done but

1349
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,920
they haven't been published yet um so i

1350
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,280
will be able to share more about that

1351
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,160
hopefully soon

1352
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,599
um

1353
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,920
in terms of the population that's

1354
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,000
exposed the most heavily exposed

1355
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,559
population are the people that live in

1356
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,720
the in the cities of mel glade and

1357
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:29,359
clewiston and pahokee

1358
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,280
and uh i believe there are about 40 000

1359
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,640
people that altogether live in those

1360
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,520
communities

1361
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:38,319
um the smoke however is not confined to

1362
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:40,480
those communities and it does drift both

1363
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:42,559
east and and west

1364
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,240
and so um

1365
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,480
we do expect that even though the

1366
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,720
concentrations of smoke are

1367
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,520
low over the coastal cities

1368
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,000
and uh further to the west into uh

1369
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,160
glades in hendry county we do expect

1370
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,280
that there would be some health impacts

1371
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,559
in those regions and um

1372
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,480
i

1373
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:05,680
noticed reading through the questions

1374
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:09,119
that you know some people are interested

1375
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:11,119
in having more specific details and um i

1376
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,359
i expect that within the next

1377
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:15,119
uh few weeks i would be able to share

1378
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:17,119
some figures that that would address

1379
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:19,839
some of those uh questions that i'm

1380
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,839
noticing in the chat

1381
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:27,040
thank you so much dr holmes

1382
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,880
and dr helena gibero you mentioned this

1383
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,880
a little bit but

1384
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,200
you did a number of studies related to

1385
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,559
sugarcane burning and health effects

1386
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,720
specifically

1387
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:39,599
and i think you had mentioned that some

1388
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:42,480
uh had done in partnership with or

1389
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,400
funded by government agencies so i just

1390
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,520
wanted to ask at the state level or the

1391
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,760
federal level to what extent is this

1392
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,799
something that government

1393
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,440
is

1394
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:55,839
trying to pursue as a research matter in

1395
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,839
brazil

1396
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,079
well

1397
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,359
i had

1398
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,480
mainly

1399
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:05,280
funding from federal agencies

1400
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,200
like the the ministry of health has a

1401
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,319
health surveillance

1402
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:12,640
secretary with it has a

1403
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:17,359
secretary it's called vigiar

1404
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:20,640
the air surveillance and in this program

1405
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:25,599
uh it has it open beads for

1406
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:29,359
studies regarding air quality and i

1407
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:31,680
enter in one of those bids for financing

1408
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:34,319
part of the study

1409
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:37,280
other parts of this area were financed

1410
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:39,920
by cnp which is the research brazilian

1411
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,799
institute which belongs to the ministry

1412
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,119
of

1413
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:46,720
technology of brazil

1414
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:49,599
and some of the the students the phd or

1415
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:52,640
massage students they got financing from

1416
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:55,119
the ministry of education campus or from

1417
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,400
fapezp which is the state

1418
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:59,760
agency

1419
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:03,280
but during this time we have partnership

1420
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,880
with cetasb sometimes which allow gave

1421
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,559
us the data

1422
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,359
or with

1423
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:12,880
even the the sugar industry which

1424
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:13,920
allowed us to put a monitoring equipment

1425
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,559
in

1426
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,440
in the sugarcane plantations

1427
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,000
and

1428
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,480
we had all the freedom to publish the

1429
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,400
results

1430
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:28,240
and one thing i wanted to mention is

1431
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:30,480
regarding the labor we had one of our

1432
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,559
research we interviewed

1433
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,480
la uh workers

1434
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:36,799
from the sugarcane plantation because

1435
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,720
there are many small towns in the state

1436
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:41,359
of sao paulo that have

1437
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,839
like a rural population that work in

1438
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:48,079
sugar cane plantations and

1439
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:51,440
and we we did study in one of these

1440
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:53,040
villages and we interviewed them and and

1441
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,559
they were at

1442
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:58,640
the same time relieved that the the uh

1443
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,960
manual harvest and was

1444
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:04,240
finishing because that was a very

1445
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:07,440
stressful labor but they were anxious

1446
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:09,280
about finding new jobs

1447
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,839
and what we we

1448
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:13,920
found was that the unions

1449
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:15,440
of sugarcane

1450
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,920
growers

1451
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,280
provided courses

1452
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,400
for them

1453
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,640
at night

1454
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,960
on weekends they could

1455
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,960
learn

1456
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:32,160
to use computers or they could learn

1457
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:35,039
agriculture practices so they were

1458
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,160
prepared for other jobs

1459
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,480
when

1460
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,760
they were expecting to lose their jobs

1461
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:44,720
and many of them got employed as antonio

1462
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,400
said in sugarcane plantations in other

1463
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,520
parts of the state

1464
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,680
for

1465
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,200
planting sugarcane

1466
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,480
or uh

1467
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,680
they went to soybean plantations or to

1468
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,039
work in

1469
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,440
uh

1470
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:02,160
tree planting you know reforestation

1471
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,720
areas in the state of sao paulo and

1472
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,160
those who came from the northeast of

1473
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:09,039
brazil

1474
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:10,079
i guess they stayed there

1475
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:13,760
because

1476
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:16,240
tourism was developed during those years

1477
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,760
also in the northeast so it was easier

1478
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:21,520
to find jobs

1479
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,480
in the northeast area of the country

1480
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,200
so

1481
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:28,799
we don't see in the the cities of the

1482
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:32,640
state of sao paulo a process of

1483
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:33,599
impoverishment because of lack of jobs

1484
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,119
of

1485
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:40,000
formation of favelas or things like that

1486
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:41,440
on the contrary we we see that there is

1487
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,440
a

1488
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:48,559
increased dynamism in those cities

1489
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:50,720
middle-sized cities that have suggest

1490
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,960
meals around them

1491
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,880
thank you thank you so much for that um

1492
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,880
so we have one last question we'll try

1493
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,520
to keep it brief if you can

1494
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:02,880
um but several questions have been posed

1495
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:05,039
that mention the um political

1496
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,119
donations and sort of

1497
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:09,520
the power of the sugar industry and

1498
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:12,000
their opposition to

1499
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,319
shifting away from burning and perhaps

1500
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,400
antonio you can speak to this but was

1501
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:17,440
there a large-scale

1502
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,640
um

1503
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,640
resistance to cain burning being phased

1504
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,720
out in brazil and how did you counteract

1505
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,240
any difficulties that you did that you

1506
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,079
were confronted with and if you could

1507
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:30,240
keep that short we're closing out here

1508
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,240
but

1509
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,280
there was no such resistance

1510
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,640
just no resistance at all

1511
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,920
because

1512
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:43,280
industry had time to do it it was

1513
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,880
something that everybody knows it should

1514
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:48,079
have an end

1515
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:52,319
everybody was seeing the problem you you

1516
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:55,520
cannot have an idea of the area what

1517
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:58,960
sugar came in sao paulo state we're

1518
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:02,720
talking about a large a really large

1519
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:06,240
area so when you were traveling in the

1520
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:09,680
countryside in june or may

1521
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:12,160
it was possible for you to just drive in

1522
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:15,839
a cloud of smoke

1523
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:18,960
in the road it was a big problem

1524
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:21,280
apart is everywhere you went in the

1525
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,039
countryside you could see

1526
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,559
the ashes

1527
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,440
in the house

1528
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:30,720
in the swimming pools in the gardens in

1529
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:34,000
the whole city and everybody could think

1530
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:37,839
well these ashes that are in the ground

1531
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:41,200
maybe part of them are in my lungs too

1532
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:44,799
it was so obvious that this was not a

1533
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:46,160
good thing to be done that there was no

1534
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:48,079
opposition

1535
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:49,039
the question was

1536
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,799
other

1537
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,760
how do you make a good monitoring on

1538
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:56,000
meat

1539
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,880
how can i prove that

1540
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,839
this sugar cane that burnt

1541
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:04,400
was not born by my fault

1542
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:07,440
someone just threw a cigarette from the

1543
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:10,960
car and it start burning and you see

1544
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:13,200
this is a sugar cane planted in a place

1545
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:15,760
able to receive the harvest the

1546
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:18,160
mechanical harvest for me it's not good

1547
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:20,640
that it burns now i do not have

1548
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:22,160
equipment to wash this

1549
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:25,680
this stalks

1550
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:28,079
before milling them so this was

1551
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:31,359
these were the big problems the the

1552
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:34,720
planters said well you are charging me

1553
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:36,799
with a penalty because i i burned

1554
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:40,000
in a place that i was not

1555
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:42,960
authorized to burn but it was not me

1556
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,880
i could say this was the biggest problem

1557
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,039
so we started a

1558
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,559
question of this

1559
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,680
this uh

1560
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:53,039
this fact

1561
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:55,359
my sugarcane burnt but it was not me

1562
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:59,119
that was the biggest problem we have

1563
01:06:55,359 --> 01:07:02,720
also we got some problems as to how each

1564
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:04,640
one give us to the agency the place as

1565
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,440
well here is my twenty percent i will

1566
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:10,559
not burn here are my thirty percent here

1567
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:13,440
my fifty percent how we make it in the

1568
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:15,839
maps it was a

1569
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:19,760
little hard to do but

1570
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:21,760
it went but never we had an opposition i

1571
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,319
want to to

1572
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:27,599
continue burning we have no

1573
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:30,640
judicial plane i want to to burn because

1574
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:33,440
i have the right to burn it was almost

1575
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:36,319
impossible for one to win a civil

1576
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,119
erection with this but we have no head

1577
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,079
no

1578
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,000
so

1579
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:41,520
we got no opposition

1580
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,559
it was a

1581
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:46,880
case of success all this is

1582
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:48,319
i believe some power statement must be

1583
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,119
very proud

1584
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:52,400
uh

1585
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:56,799
so the agency as the the sugarcane

1586
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:58,960
sector that we do the right thing like

1587
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:02,240
