1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,440
by the way M Farmers have you ever asked

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,240
yourself this question how many number

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,440
of bags do you produce in your small

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,960
piece of land do you produce such number

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,640
of BS because you assume you know how to

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,439
farm these or it's because of ignorance

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,800
to learn new knowledge on how you can

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,920
grow much

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,240
better well I don't want you to answer

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,560
me that but today we are focusing on the

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,960
basic on how you can manage to grow Maze

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:37,960
and get high from planting to harvesting

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,000
including the best soil for me farming

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,399
and we're going to jump lat away on the

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,960
best soil for ma

16
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,640
fing maze drives in Fertile l or Sunday

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,199
L soils supplementing these soils with

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,800
cow or shap manure can enhance growth

19
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,559
and when it rains this mixure retains

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,879
moisture further promoting growth

21
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:03,399
conversely clay soil can has poor

22
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:07,240
drainage and can lead to flooding which

23
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:10,520
starts growth and results in no yeat

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,159
after getting light on the best s for ma

25
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,560
family now let's focus on which are

26
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:19,280
these best varieties of maze that you

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,600
can plant in Kenya and get good needs

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,400
now the suitability of maze varieties

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,840
varies by regions in the Norther region

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:31,520
where there is only one maze season five

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:36,200
month maze varieties are the best these

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:40,200
varieties have high producing over 50 PS

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,759
of 90 kg per acre some of the

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:49,719
recommended varieties include Pioneer

35
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:52,439
v253 Pioneer v g90 h64 h628 h 629 it is

36
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:55,159
crucial to plant these varieties during

37
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,719
the long range season for the best

38
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,960
results in Legion with two M Seasons

39
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,479
Farmers should op for three month

40
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,920
maturity maze varieties these fast

41
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:13,440
maturing varieties such as haraka 101

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:15,120
haraka 31 Dum 43 SC 301 DK c31 DK h33

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,599
and sa V

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,599
4141 typically yield an average of 25 to

45
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:26,760
35 90 kg bags per acre and matures

46
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:30,000
within 75 to 90 days after getting it

47
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,680
right on the best mze varieties then how

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,680
well do you plant this seeds before

49
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,239
planting ensure the land is clear of

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,800
food farmers can either weed manually or

51
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,319
you can use n selective herbicides such

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,239
as CA or Roundup a recommended plant is

53
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:52,319
spacing of 60 cm by 30 cm compared to

54
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:55,159
the traditional 90 CM by 25 cm increases

55
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:59,120
CR population per requiring a c rate of

56
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:01,879
11 to 12 kg per and of course the yield

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,080
if using a maze planter calibrate it

58
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:09,640
first for precise spacing after planting

59
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,319
this crop need to be fed with the best

60
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,680
fertilizers and then that's how we give

61
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,040
you the best maze

62
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,799
fertilizers us P are influenced not only

63
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,159
by the maze variety but also by proper

64
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:27,120
fertilization High crop populations

65
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:30,519
require adequate Fe to bless with dap

66
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,680
18460 on the 10th day after sewing to

67
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,159
promote faster growth at this stage the

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,040
maze plants have developed strong roots

69
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,319
that can absorb nitrogen and phosphorus

70
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,120
effectively using fertilizers during

71
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,439
planting is not effective as seeds do

72
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,879
not utilize them leading to reaching dap

73
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:54,360
is preferred of NPK 23230 due to its

74
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:58,200
high phosphorus content which supports

75
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:02,400
rapid root growth NPK 23230 should be

76
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:05,760
top on after sewing or C fertilizer

77
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,879
should be applied 55 days after sewing

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,079
to enhance seed formation and with game

79
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,799
after planting you need to control the

80
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:19,079
past the full arm is a significant past

81
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:22,560
in M fing responsible for more than 50%

82
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:26,639
of crop cost to control F apply Amon

83
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,320
that PC or escort ideally 21 to 40 days

84
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,240
later that is after sewing this should

85
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,039
be combined with a sticker such as

86
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,759
Integra or aqua and a booster or for

87
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:38,800
feed this application is most effective

88
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:42,440
when done in the late evening when the

89
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,840
full army war is most

90
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,639
effective when you've done this you need

91
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,880
Now to control weed keep the farm free

92
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,440
of weight at all times this is essential

93
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,759
farmers can choose between manual

94
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:02,080
weeding or using selective hites such as

95
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:05,960
tinga governor maguma theine to for

96
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,919
this all this they simplify the work of

97
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,919
controlling whe also implementing zero

98
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,039
to L can help conserve moisture thereby

99
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,440
promoting faster growth now with all

100
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,520
this you have a complete gu that you can

101
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,800
follow step by step and manage to yield

102
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,000
more from your small P of land let me

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,720

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,470
any question or query about m and also
