  "text": "[Music] well uh al rods i'm an agricultural engineer with usda a agricultural research service at university park pennsylvania and what i'm going to talk about today is a little project that we've done over the past year looking at whole farm assessments of nutrient extraction technologies we're developing a model that takes a better look at this co-authors are colleagues of mine and they include clint church who's well the mastermind i guess behind the map x system and we he had a talk yesterday on that well as the theme of this conference goes and every and we all know um manure is a beneficial resource it has value for the nutrients but even more now as we look at the soil health and organic matter carbon sequestration it's all kind of tied together that manure does have value but of course it has its challenges and and a big one is just a low concentration of nutrients and fairly on uniform often uh distribution of the nutrients within the material our dairy farms in particular getting larger and larger and often that means more animals per unit of land more purchase feed bringing nutrients in over applying nutrients onto the farm and and build up of excess nutrients and and we have nutrients we have to get rid of so this has led to the development and you know there's a lot of work now being a lot of thought being put into different types of extraction technologies that can be used on dairy farms i've listed a few here i guess our view of this was that you know it might be good to have a tool that cannot really look at how these technologies will impact the actual farm how do they interact with all the other parts of the farm and ultimately what are the production costs in the impact on profitability uh farm nutrient losses the resources particularly fertilizer that have to be brought in in conjunction with the use of the technologies and that sort of thing and we also want to look at some life cycle impacts greenhouse gases of course is a big one that gets a lot of interest now and fossil energy use was another one that we looked at so our objective in this particular study was to perform a comprehensive assessment of phosphorus extraction in particular from from dairy manure and we were using a decanter centrifuge centrifuge for this particular study we're kind of using this as an example of how we could implement this type of technology in the model and and do a whole farm assessment so the model we're using is the integrated farm system model this is a a tool that's been under development for an application for many years we've used it to look at a wide range of technologies and strategies for dairy farms and and beef production systems so what we needed to do here was just to develop a new component and put into this model to represent these extraction technologies and again we tried to be pretty general in in the formation of this model so that it could be applied to various technologies and then after doing that then we wanted to look at how it actually fit in to an actual farm in pennsylvania and we looked at the farm in two different ways first is the base farm the way it is today the the farm's in a in a long-term nutrient balance basically there there's enough land there we're producing enough feed to you know recycle all the nutrients and then we wanted to look at what if we were reducing that farm area some and there was excess phosphorus that they really needed to get rid of how does that affect things a little more on the model itself it is a whole farm process level simulation so we're simulating as shown indicated here all the major components of the farm uh looking at the flow of nutrients in and out of the farm and and among the various components so it really does look at a lot of the interaction so if you change one part of the system how does it affect all the other parts of the system the model does predict various gaseous emissions greenhouse gases ammonia hydrogen sulfide and docs also denitrification losses of n n2 n2o and no2 nitrate leaching runoff losses of phosphorus and nitrogen and so forth it does do a whole farm balance of each of the major nutrients as illustrated here with phosphorus it kind of tracks all the phosphorus in and out through the system it also includes a cradle to farmgate life cycle assessment as illustrated here we have the greenhouse gases that are coming directly off the farm either enteric from the animal and then the emissions from the manure and so forth but we also look at what we call the upstream emissions those that would occur as we develop produce resources that are being used on the farm uh fuel electricity fertilizer and that sort of thing so that's where we get the cradle to farm gate everything that goes up to the point where that milk leaves the farm is accounted for as far as the extraction component then the technology can be used to extract or export whatever you the user defines as coming out okay so it can be any combination of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium again we're trying to kind of general in the way we set it up so it could represent a wide variety of applications and by setting entering the the initial costs and and labor prices and fuel electricity price so forth it does do an economic analysis to look at the the effect on on cost of the farm and then of course it looks at all the interactions as you change the nutrient cycling how does that affect crop production and various environmental impacts of the farm so the base farm that we're working with here is an actual farm or where it's representing an actual farm in pennsylvania we have 2 000 hosting cows and replacements pretty good milk production rate of 24 600 pound per cow we have uh 34th acres of crop land again that's enough to produce all the feed essentially for these animals and with a very major part all the grain and forage so we're producing alfalfa grass corn and rye for the for feeding the animals the lactating cows are maintained in freestyle barns with a flush manure system and we have a screw press that's extracting the manure solids and they're recycled as bedding something that's maybe somewhat unique about our region it's called the ridge and valley region you can see here this you see the long ridges and the long narrow valleys between them so the a farmer this size can really stretch out long distances so they're hauling this speed for fairly long distances and then of course returning that manure very long distances if they want to redistribute that uniformly throughout the farm so as an alternate then we wanted to look at something actually that the actual farm is considering and that's to do away with the flush system and go to a scrape system how does that affect the farm for one and then the use of the centrifuge the other was to reduce the crop land down to 2 700 acres we got rid of any corn grain production we bought and brought in all the corn grain and this created a a surplus of phosphorus that had to be removed so in terms of the the original farm then by using the centrifuge we were able to reduce the hauling distance by about 50 percent and the number of trucks by about 30 percent what we're doing here instead of hauling all the manure out to all the fields we extract a large portion of the phosphorus into a concentrated material that can be hauled much more conveniently to the outside areas and it also leaves the remaining manure with a higher end to pee ratio that's more suitable for the areas close by the farm facility so that's what we're really modeling here and that's the impact so all that is the annual fuel use in manure handling was decreased 16 this was offset by 79 percent increase in electricity to drive the centrifuge and the pumps and so forth that are associated with that so over all the energy costs did increase the annual cost of owning and maintaining the equipment increase labor costs decreased a little uh by the reducing the manure hauling time all total the manure handling costs increased you know a little over 27 000 per year here so wasn't an economic win with this system with the better distribution of phosphorus we did find a slightly less a slight decrease in the phosphorus runoff losses from the farm going to a screw press then we were working with a more concentrated manure because we weren't recycling all that flush water so we got by with one less screw press so where we had two in the original farm it went down to one this reduced the electricity consumption energy costs were reduced 24 labor costs increased 65 because we were now using a scrape system where in this case we were using a skid steer or tractor to scrape that manure which required some labor overall the manure handling cost did decrease nine percent slight increase in soluble p runoff with this type of system while the sediment p runoff decreased and overall the farmgate life cycle energy consumption decreased about two percent no real impact on greenhouse gas emissions then when we put this the extracting the centrifuge in with the scrape system it was more economical okay uh we were able to get more efficient extraction of the phosphorus for one and then we were we greatly really reduced the volume of material that had to go through the centrifuge so electricity use increased and fuel consumption decreased as compared to without the centrifuge a little effect really on the environment other than there was a two percent increase in the farm gate intensity of fossil energy use which kind of offset what we just saw that they saved by going to a scrape system equipment and labor costs reduced and the centrifuge extraction reduced the total annual cost by about two thousand dollars a year so not it's positive anyhow i guess it's pretty much break even i i guess when you look at the long-term in terms of the overall cost of operating the farm when we went to the system that with a smaller farm with access p that we wanted to get rid of uh use of the the centrifuge we had to use it about eight hours per day to extract the excess surplus p okay the in this case the model calculated that there was around 16 500 pounds of p that had to be removed from the farming system to maintain a long-term balance so operating it eight hours per day increase the equipment electric energy costs with some small increases in facility and labor costs to maintain the equipment uh increase the annual manure handling cost by a little over or eighteen thousand dollars a year so looking at what the cost was to remove that pee that comes out to a little over a dollar a pound of pea removed from the farm so you're ending up with this material that really does have some pretty high value as far as a pea fertilizer source and maybe for other uses as well but nevertheless the cost for remove for producing that material is still more than the cost of just buying phosphate fertilizers so perhaps for organic markets and such you know it would be a little bit more more economical so in summary i guess use of the centrifuge for pea extraction on the dairy farm it really appears less feasible and pretty on economical when used with a flush system just because of the sheer volume of material that you have to re continually recycle through the system but with a scraped manure system the increased extraction costs may be more than offset by the reduced transport costs you know we're looking at these large farms where we have to call it for long distances as we saw it was it was economical to to extract the peak by extracting a significant portion of the p from the from the manure you do end up with a better end of p ratio in the remaining manure again it could be used close by where you have this more concentrated pea that can be transported longer distances more efficiently and more cost effectively so if you have excess phosphorus to get off the farm you know centrifuge provides a material with a high p concentration that can be exported for other uses but the cost of producing that be if you're comparing it particularly to fertilizer you know it's it's not necessarily a win but i mean again there's the organic market and there's also more nutrients left in this than just the phosphorus too that we haven't really properly accounted for so it does have more value than just the phosphorus itself and of course a cost that's really hard to put a value on is the long-term potential impact i guess of on eutrophication uh you know so there is this long-term reducing risk you know for for eutrophicationary by by pulling out extracting this phosphorus and using it more efficiently so there's a benefit to society there that's really hard to put a value in so in conclusion i guess this this is primarily a research tool but we feel it's it's it's a good tool that we can be can be used to evaluate a wide range of these different types of technologies that can be used for this particular study it had it was just published in applied engineering and agriculture if you'd like to look it up and and get more detail on use of the decanter centrifuge on a dairy farm right thank you is the annualized capital cost on it on the centrifuge and other equipment that was being used amortizing the the initial costs over the lifetime of the equipment and putting that in with the annual cost along with any electricity use and labor total operating costs [Music]",
