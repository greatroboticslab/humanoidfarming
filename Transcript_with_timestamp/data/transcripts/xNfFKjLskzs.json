  "text": "this is synched a kawaii community matters here hi you've joined it you know lickable science I'm your host Ethan Allen here on think tech Hawaii thanks for joining us today and what is more lickable than food I love food right and today joining you by Skype is dr. Joseph - Frank hi Joe bye Ethan how's it going it's always a pleasure to be back with you and likeable science right great to have you on board again here so Joe - Frank is a plant scientist tropical plant and soil science group at uhm on OA it's got a doctorate from Michigan State a bit ago and he works on all kinds of things related to weed control and but not in the traditional way lot of people now think of it as we control with chemicals and pesticides Joe's really very interested in in sort of appropriate non pesticide non chemical through low tech ways that we can we can control weeds and keep the soil intact we don't have to tilt it up and and all that kind of stuff that takes energy time so once you tell us a little bit about sort of go back in the history of agriculture as it were Joe to give us a little context great Ethan well what we're going to talk about today is no-till farming for organic farmers as well as home gardeners no-till farming came into prominence in the American agriculture sometime around 1973 about the time when we had the bowl was called the Arab oil embargo where farmers needed to reduce their energy consumption with gasoline right so in one of the ways they did that was by trying to reduce the plowing of the fields in preparation for seeding yes that's what you mean by no-till right yes not plowing oh so we don't want to plow so generally what you would do is you would have like a crop of winter wheat for example and instead of plowing down the remaining stubble of the wheat in the spring of the year they would spray it to kill whatever her weeds were there and then they would use specialized planners the plant seeds directly into that stubble so you would have a nice mulch to retain moisture around soil erosion and of course you say baby four or five trips across the field by not plowing oh I was interested at in the early 70s at Michigan State and then all these years I've been trying to figure out a way we could adapt that system for organic farm right because for again a farmers of course they don't want to spray it and spray the chemicals on the previous cover of crop and you know they can't do that in call it organic anymore so what would your session Brix so organic farmers of course they can't spray herbicides to kill off weeds and the only way they can terminate a cover crop number crop is going to be a plant that you're not going to eat you're not going to consume it's there to enrich the soil increase aeration and also serve as a break for certain pests so once you have this vigorous cover crop on the soil surface organic farmers were restricted to using the plow or disc to invert the soil bury that organic matter and then have a clean surface in which to plant in of course that takes a lot of energy has a pretty big carbon footprint with the tractors moving and so forth so what we were wanting to do is to develop a system where busying something other than the plow and the tractor to terminate the cover crop or using light exclusion and light exclusion through the use of these durable woven plastic fabrics is what we've been experimenting with right because plan says everyone knows need light to grow right and if you really cover your plant over well and keep it dark the green plants don't get the light they don't manufacture their own food they up and die right so it's there's nothing new there plants need light they don't get light they die so let me just briefly through what we're talking about in terms of a technique for commercial farmers as well as home gardeners I think it really shines for homeowners who may not be too crazy about taking a shovel to the ground and flipping it over so yeah we rose to is that you need to establish a cover crop for whatever reason like I said organic matter add nitrogen through legumes and allow that thing to grow vigorously to the point where you want to plant your cash crop at that point what conventional organic farmers are doing is doing what's called creeping or rolling right that means there we go alright we got we got the pictures up now alright so this is the first picture here ok so the first picture is actually our student the gardens in the weed science class this fall but uhm Noah and what you're looking at is a five species cover crop meaning that there's five different see that were playing it give you this a diverse nice green luscious crop in in the composition there that you're looking at is Calpis borage radish black mustard outs and buckwheat so we have a diverse group of cover crops that we we can address any sort of pests that may be adapt it's one of them we know will have something there that'll that'll grow well and the alpi of course is a legume that's gonna pull nitrogen from the air and add it to the soil excellent that would be the first picture right so next here we go there's somebody rolling okay so the next picture you see a student they're using a roller to crush down the cover crop a farmers would be using a tractor based roller and maybe not a smooth over one with crimpers you know these rays that is that and break the stem so what what organic farmers try to do is terminate the cover crop by you know crushing the stems and then they plant their crop in there the only problem is is that may not completely fill the cover crop there may be weeds underneath that emerge once you master you do the rolling right next picture would be illustrating the weed mats or the thurible polypropylene fabrics that are available at most stores that sell commercial supplies to nurseryman and so forth right now wait these down on their edges with some sort of little sandbags or water tube or something so what we're using for securing that plastic to the ground is what everybody who's familiar with ten fumigation in Hawaii whenever they fumigate your house they usually use water filled hoses to secure the plastic to the ground so it doesn't come off so that's what we're using to get these used fire hoses fill them with water or we even have some hoses filled with say in the shorter lengths and that way we can like we can cover the cover the ground and then secure the fabric in windy areas with water filled hoses so it's a convenient way to hold it in place without poking holes and without having a bunch of rocks and stones to lug around and then take off what we want to remove it ya know it's beautiful that it makes a nice solid light tight cover and when you remove it then it's the next photo I think we'll show now when you remove it what you're looking at there is a one week of coverage so what we do is we rolled that cover crop we covered it for one week and you might not think that one week of coverage is enough to disable that rubber crop but it is because it's high dark and so now that the cover crop is killed you haven't we haven't done any additional work we haven't used any chemicals now we're ready to plant but I believe in them in the next image we'll see that the corn transplants have been playing it if that's up and then you can see that the corn is growing normally so I say well what's what's remarkable about all this well what's remarkable that number one we haven't plowed the ground that soil has been laying unplowed for well over a year and so it's relatively firm but what we do is we poke a hole in the ground we put in corn transplants because we want to give the corn a big jump on any weeds that might grow and we just poke a hole on the ground sticking the corn transplants cover it back up keep irrigating and the nutrients are released from that dead and dying cover crop and voila we have no-till farming for organic farmers yeah beautiful beautiful and in that one week of course right not only does the existing plants that were there they're all starting to die and decay but then any weed seeds or anything probably start to sprout but without light they're not gonna do anything right that's correct so generally whenever you play in a cover crop like that not only are you getting the cover crop you're gonna get certain weeds that grow and they may be suppressed by the vigorous cover crop but once that canopy is removed those weeds will just sprout up that's the advantage of combining rolling and crimping with covering that we kill the cover crop and we kill whatever weeds may be in the understory of the cover crop exactly yeah that's beautiful nice wonderful how you put these sort of seemingly simple little bits and pieces you know the idea of a roller to crush the cover crop down idea of a like tight cover over the the ground roughly simple concept nothing really high-tech nothing that had to be mixed up in a chemical lab nothing that didn't involve some fancy machine that's right right so it's all relatively straightforward and you say well yeah I guess you just cover it up and then everything dies and you pull it off and then your plant makes a lot of sense challenges is how large a scale can we do that you can imagine if you have a you know plastic that's you know 300 feet long and 12 feet wide that could be pretty challenging laying it out in the field and then securing it so the question is not every crop would be adapted to this I see that the majority of crops that would be at that would be things like mallow greens or microgreens where you can more or less seated in a complete block and then harvest you know things aren't in rows or just growing as a complete flock and in that way these organic farmers who are getting a premium for their products will have incentive to try to do this of course there's expense to the plastic but as opposed to plowing and tractors and if it rains you take it in the field and it gives the I think farmers a lot more flexibility in timing when they pull off that fabric they might want to wait until they may have a bunch of these fabrics out there they pull one off plant but that gets started well the next one open plant and they don't have to worry about weeds growing while they're timing the plane things of their crop so I just think it adds a lot of flexibility for commercial farmers and for the homeowner it's great too because you may have a piece of ground that's a weedy mess and you go yeah I like to start gardening dr. D how do I do it I say well but get a sheet of plastic which you can get it various hardware stores now this is a plastic that's woven it's not a film so it allows the irrigation water to go through it so we just knock down the weeds cover them eeep moisten the soil over the top with irrigation and then when you're ready to plant pull it off put a hole in the ground and plan some transplants and see what you get of course you got to fertilize but you're not plowing the ground so you're not going to get a whole bunch of weeds and if you mulch if you add mulch in addition to your transplants you might be able to get away with a prop without any weeding whatsoever and then you're done with the field all right backed up and when you're ready to Braille again pull it pull it off and plant again yeah it's it seems like it's got a lot going for it and makes a lot of sense it would seem like it's economical to a good extent the fabric I assumed to be used at least several times certainly right oh yes the fabric is very durable and I would expect that you know a farmer would get I don't know maybe five years of use from a piece of fabric and then I think they would get you know if they if they worked it out where they they had their crops on a regular basis I think they could actually make money on it and the reason why I throw this out were farmers to think about is because the farmers are gonna innovate on how are they going to how are they going to use it how they going to time their plantings and or you know picking it up and rolling it when it's a big sheet of plastic that's gonna take a couple people so that's where you need a but if you know more than more than one person pulling it off rolling it up and getting it ready for the next usage so there's some innovation that the farmers will need to come up with really make this an efficient practice sure like almost any technology you need to a bit to it you need to think of some new ways to sort of support it and apply it but it's it you've got you've given people really a really nice set of tools to use a really interesting approach that should be really applicable and as you say for sort of moderate scale organic farms for things like the mixed greens and salad mix kind of stuff that should be really sort of perfect thing ya know farmer can get two or three people out there they could they could do a number of these patches at once they can wait until they see the there's rains on their way so it won't have to irrigate as much too hot timing whole issue is really great a lot of advantages just I can see yeah and one of the big advantages is you know in Hawaii you know we always think that it's always a great growing season year round but we do have a rainy cycles and one of the big problems is that for organic farmers is we control you ask any organic farmer one of the biggest challenges for production is we control so let's say you get into a rainy spell November December it's raining every other day you can't go out in the field and control those weeds with mowing and plowing because it's too wet you're just stuck there watching the weeds grow and watching them put out seeds but the ground is covered with this fabric there's no worries you know the the weeds are going to grow as a matter of fact adding moisture once the fabric is there is causing weeds that are in the soil to germinate thinking that they're going to reach the surface but they here they're underneath of plastic so what you're actually doing is purging right beet seeds from the production cycle but it's the actual way to store the soil get a bunch of weeds to germinate and and the farmer it could be the wettest day of the year when he wants to peel all of that plastic plant you know like I said for moderate sized farmers or for you know large own gardeners I think it's a real a real you know simple innovation makes sense to the average person to go yeah and why didn't somebody think of that before so when I said the same thing I go well I wonder if anybody's gonna think that this is a realistic thing and then I started doing my laboratories with the students and they just seemed to accept it as you okay that that's okay that's fine now that looks good right and we're gonna we're gonna dig into this in more depth here when we come back but right now we have to take a quick break here we'll be right back Jodi Frank is with me here I'm your host Ethan Helen here on likable science and we'll be back in a minute [Music] so any [Music] so it Aloha my name is Marx klav I am the host of Fink tech Hawaii's law across the sea law across the sea comes on every other Monday at 11:00 a.m. please join us I like to bring in guests that talk about all types of things that come across the sea to Hawaii not just law love people ideas history please join us for law across the sea Allah and you're back here on likable science I'm your host Ethan Allen here on the attack Hawaii with me today via Skype is dr. Joseph de Frank welcome again Joe Nathan good to be back again yes indeed and we're talking about some innovations that Joe has developed a really a very interesting sort of low-tech but but very effective ways to help gardeners small-scale farmers avoid the need to till the soil to turn on their soil to have the heavy equipment to run their tractors his approach by essentially crushing a cover crop and then covering it for as little as a week really opens up some some great opportunities and one of the nice things I was thinking a little bit over the break via it was you can leave that cover than in place right sort of as long as you want you say a week but it doesn't hurt if it stays on for two weeks three weeks or whatever right right we've had it on as long as eight nine months over the summer just waiting for the class to start we pull it off and we're ready to go so a great way to store the soil eventually store that soil in a in a ready condition for planting with little to no effort it's just there ready to go yeah it's not it's not your roading you're not getting new weed growth it's not blowing away it's not packing down it's it's just as you say it's sort of sitting there waiting yeah yeah oh it's it's a good way to store store the soil in the go mode for planting yeah so I mean if you look in that soil just just this is purely my curiosity look in that soil you'll find the same kinds of invertebrate populations earthworms and various little bugs all sort of sitting there doing their little business right right and what we found is that you know if we leave that cover on for you know if we cover but if we put the plastic over the top of weeds or or or other cover crops what happens is that we have a real explosion of soil insects that consume that organic matter because they're not being preyed on by birds so you have an accelerated breakdown of the organic matter in a mineralization of those nutrients back to the soil so all around it's a it's a pretty interesting approach and it also gives us an opening for a pest management there's a thing called nematodes in the soil nematodes are microscopic worms and will penetrate the roots and ruin them and for organic farmers it's very difficult to get rid of those microscopic worms but we've developed a way to combine a cover crop with the plastic to accelerate the removal of these microscopic pests and the way that works is a little counterintuitive you know you think that well if I got this soil borne worm that's eating my roots I gotta plant things that that aren't susceptible to it right but the counterintuitive idea is to know we're gonna plan something that's super sensitive because these nematodes respond to root exudates of the septum aplan and just like a seed those nematodes germinate from eggs so once they perceive the roots growing a Germany and they try to attach to the plant but if we know the lifecycle of those nematodes we can then roll that fabric before they start to reproduce cover it up with plastic the plants dies the nematode dies now we have a non chemical way to get rid of this very persistent and challenging soil pest nematodes and use the same technique only with a slight little variation where be playing a susceptible crop makes the nematodes come to life they try to attach to the roots and before they can reproduce we kill off the plant with this covering and nematodes die we pull it off and then we play susceptible crops oh it it's also giving us a new approach to pest management I don't think we've we've thought about it in that way I like that that's it sort of a little a little a fake-out a little faint as it were you you draw them out by print planting something they really like when they all sort of go for that then you zap them basically you can cover the cover over and they can't they don't get a second chance basically right no I didn't think that up years ago we had a scientist from North Carolina State Don Schmidt and he was a guy he was always testing chemicals for nematode control and soybeans he goes you know Joe the best year that I had was when we had an early spring in North Carolina I mid the soybeans I put out all my treatments but then we had a early frost and all the soybeans died when we re-established the experiments and we threw the soybeans again we couldn't tell untreated fields from treated fields because of just what I said the nematodes all came into the soybeans the frost killed him he died and so it's the same concept sort of like a a bait and switch your roots and then you switch him by turning off the lights that's beautiful that's beautiful yeah and it looks to me like this has a lot of interesting options to go new places right I mean this you're using right now one kind of fabric but you could conceivably think about that fabric in different ways right right now I was thinking like how can we make this better you know the fabric is kind of heavy when you get large sheets of it you know it gets to be kind of cumbersome to pick it up and put it away and and one of the things that happens when we use the fabric of course we can kill a living plant but sometimes there's weed seeds that need light to germinate and grow so what happens then is that we gotta we gotta stimulate those weed seeds to grow over it kill them off and then uncover it now with all the budding engineers and nanotech scientists out there it occurred to me that you know we we probably have the technology somewhere in our industrial base to do what I call nano blankets or nano fabric so what would that be that would be like a super light fabric that you know with a certain electrical potential it's translucent and let's light into the soil so that would I would allow the weed seeds to grow underneath of the blanket and now we add another little electrical potential and they reorient the molecules and then it turns it black then the weeds die so this way we could start to purge beet seeds that are light sensitive grow without pulling the fabric on and off and then once the fabric is all the weeds are dead boom we pull it off and move it to another field so I think that there's probably you know engineers out there that maybe have is ready to go maybe it's ready for off you know they're using it as a as a blanket for a space shuttle the block light or to turn it on and off but I don't think I've never heard of an agricultural use for such a thing but I'm sure there might be some compliances out there that maybe they can let us know if they got something like that and we can work together on yeah I sounds great I mean it actually reminds me a bit of the another one of my sort of favorite technological advances which is the a thing called Mattie drops which was a ceramic chemist Jim Smith from the University of Virginia had been working for years on pushing water through porous ceramics to help filter it and clean it up and adding silver into that helped kill off the the microbes as it went through and finally realized that he didn't actually need to push the water through it he essentially put sawdust in with the clay and the silver nitrate baked it in a kiln and got a very porous ceramic so water flowed by itself in through there and literally pulled off the silver and distributed this over around the water killing off all the microbes sort of again it's nice little aloe to a low-tech twist on a hi-tech idea and I like what you're thinking about there I think it has a lot of that potential great yeah so that's that's kind of what I wanted to share with everybody today and like I said everybody thinks that we need to plow through in a soft soil for roots to grow but really I like to say let the worms do flowey you know we had enough organic matter and the plant roots when they died make channels and the worms come up and and eat the organic matter so I say let them let the worms do the plough and we'll do the planting and the eat yeah yeah people don't appreciate how how much work worms do what is it they say in the over the course of a year the worms in an acre of ground will turn over something like a ton of soil or something some some incredible figure I heard I don't know I'm sure it's incredible and like I said what and see when you start plowing then you're breaking up that earthworm habitat you're killing them you're breaking their channels though a no-till farming was something that was like I said in early 70s it became popularized but the organic farmer never really had a chance to use it because again I can't use chemicals to kill off the leads they fell off cover crops but I think with this technique we can start to get them thinking about it and probably be developing some grants to expand it and I've already presented this to some farmers in Hawaii and my understanding if they went out and got some fabrics and are going to try it so start to break out of the you know the the idea phase and into the reality phase I'm pretty happy about yeah well you should be very proud of it and I could see great applicability of this technique to down in Micronesia where people just really started and try to do some of this more push towards self sustainability developing vegetable crops and things like they can support a tourist industry they can have more varieties of fresh foods themselves and none of its huge a lot of it is this this sort of ant farm small scale right so you know and you know tractors equipment fuel takes a lot of effort to you know to put make a field that's that's all we D and maybe cover with grass and make it acceptable for crop production but I think now we can just flatten it out to the point where we can cover it it doesn't blow away after a while you know plant like I said plants don't do too good when they're covered and then once they die off they break down pretty quick and yeah I'm pretty excited that it can really be at something they said it's new that plants need light to grow but I think the idea of the fabric and if anybody can develop on new super light fabric oh we could have some real exciting things happen yeah exactly this this could go anywhere though because again just you can ship that fabric out rolls of it that's not not really the hard hard thing to do it's not like shipping out a very complex piece of machinery yeah hey well this is great Joe I've enjoyed talking with you here and I've learned learned a lot of learn learned a lot the first time you were on and even more this time I'm pleased to see that you're continuing this and developing developing it in new directions it's great thank you so much for for sharing with you and I hope all our viewers will share this with their organic farmer friends it's always great talking to you in the audience for likeable science all right thank you Joe you take care thank you very much and have a good weekend yes indeed so that's about it for another episode of likeable science here on think tackle I will see you next week [Music] you [Music]",
