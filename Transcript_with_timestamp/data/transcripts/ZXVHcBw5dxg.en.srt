00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,680
regenerative agriculture is a holistic

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:08,040
farming approach that focuses on

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,200
restoring soil health and biodiversity

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,160
while reducing carbon emissions it

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,200
builds resilience against climate change

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,920
by enhancing natural processes such as

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,840
carbon sequestration and water retention

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,000
techniques include cover cropping crop

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,720
rotation and reduced tillage all aimed

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,480
at improving soil structure and

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,439
enhancing ecosystems its goal is to

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,519
regenerate not just sustain the

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,079
environment

14
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,960
offering a solution to both food

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,960
security and climate change
