  "text": "i'm standing in a field with a cover crop mix planted and this probably went in around the middle of july it is now the 29th of august so this was a wheat field that was harvested so we're seeing some volunteer wheat coming up as it normally does and the obvious thing is that buckwheat is flowering um that's going to make seeds so that's obviously a problem we have radish lots of radish that is doing nicely but many of them are really pale so it is running out of nitrogen so it's retrieving all the nitrogen but a good radish cover crop should have a better nitrogen supply than this one does we have a few odds and ends so we've got a soybean coming up we've got corn coming up don't know what they're doing sunflowers were part of the mix and here and there the sunflowers are doing very well one of the challenges with sunflowers of course is that they make quite a thick stem and that is going to be difficult to manage once they mature so the question is what's the decomposition going to be in this how are they going to manage the buckwheat seeds and the radishes are going to be undersized because they don't have enough nitrogen but they've done a better job managing the radishes so that one's only as big as my thumb so far so it's got a ways to go and maybe a challenge getting there and oh look there we've got clover too so by spring this may be primarily a clover stand and along with the winter wheat so there's a look at a cover crop mix that looks okay now good combination but it's really a question whether it's going to do any job particularly well",
