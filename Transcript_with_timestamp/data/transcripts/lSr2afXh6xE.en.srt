1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
then they say oh Dwayne and Dakota the

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,040
cows have no legs

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,500
[Music]

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,960
I always tell the story of my South

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,360
American friends coming to South Dakota

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,280
and seeing all the balers we use here

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,199
because it's a very predominant thing to

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,660
do is to bail hay up and move it into

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,520
the feedlot for the winter time and they

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,859
they would see that and they say oh

11
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,779
Dwayne and Dakota the cows have no legs

12
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,820
meaning that the cows should be able to

13
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,279
walk out and get her own food and I

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,199
think that's exactly right it just saves

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,300
us a lot of money and it keeps us from

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,040
hauling nutrients back and forth how

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,899
many pounds of nutrients go to that

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,000
feedlot well they don't really get back

19
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,399
the nitrogen for sure doesn't get back

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,320
and if we take the manure in the form of

21
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,780
getting a phosphorus and potassium back

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,300
yeah that kind of works but it again is

23
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,579
another fossil fuel thing so we're

24
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,879
trying to take the fossil fuel guy out

25
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,879
of it
