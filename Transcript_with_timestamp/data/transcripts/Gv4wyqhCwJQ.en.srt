1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,560
Health in a lot of ways is about

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,440
complexity you need a complex gut biome

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,160
you need a complex set of lots of

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,360
different types of

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,639
micronutrients that's true for people

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,200
that's also true for plants right so

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,279
plants are sending their Roots out into

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,320
the soil and they're asking for a

9
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:22,400
complex bed of micronutrients they need

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,920
like organic Healthy Living soil most of

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,760
the time what they get in conventional

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,880
farming operations unfortunately is

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,279
effectively industrial limitation soil

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,560
it's just pumped full of a handful of

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,279
nutrients

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,800
um and without that fertilizer is

17
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,160
completely incapable of supporting life

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,640
that's not soil that that's imitation

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,920
soil and when you grow plants in that

20
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,200
kind of soil you get imitation plants

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,280
and then you get imitation food and then

22
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,000
you get sort of a host of host problems

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,000
associated with that
