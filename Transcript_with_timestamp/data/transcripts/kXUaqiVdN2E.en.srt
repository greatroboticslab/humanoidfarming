00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,720
of modern

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,080
agriculture focusing on revolutionary

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:25,000
techniques that maximize efficiency and

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,000
productivity in Greenhouse farming

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,680
join us as we explore the process of

8
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:43,600
growing and harvesting egg plant using

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,600
advanced technology

00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,119
this method maximizes space while

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,000
ensuring plants are efficiently

14
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:15,520
nourished from seedling to

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,400

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,000
as a revolutionary method reshaping

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
traditional agriculture

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,560
the technique we explore today

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,040
emphasizes vertical growth making the

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,560
most of every inch of available

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,560
space this method allows us to save

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:52,159
maximum space and use as little land as

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,360
possible not only conserving resources

25
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,640
but also reducing the environmental

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,960
footprint of agricultural activities

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,880
let's take a closer look at this amazing

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,880
process that takes place inside a modern

29
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,200
Greenhouse we start by checking the size

30
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,200
of the

31
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,319
greenhouse the Netherlands a country

32
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,599
famous for its innovative Greenhouse

33
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,760
farming methods is a prime example of

34
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,360
the modern efficiency of this

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,519
agricultural method the facility is

36
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
spacious

37
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,840
thoughtfully designed and and equipped

38
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,840
with state-of-the-art

39
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,519
technology every element of the

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,400
greenhouse from the configuration to the

41
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:48,280
automated crop monitoring system is

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,120
meticulously crafted for optimal

43
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,519
efficiency for example the pesticide

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,840
spraying process operates fully

45
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,360
automatically ensuring that each plant

46
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,720
receives the amount of pesticide needed

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,000
while eliminating resource waste this

48
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,200
level of automation significantly

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,959
reduces the need for manual labor

50
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,000
allowing Farmers to focus on more

51
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,799
strategic elements of crop management

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,640
the Journey Begins With

53
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,840
seedlings which are carefully cared for

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,959
in a controlled environment before being

55
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,400
transferred to the main Greenhouse here

56
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:31,560
the wonders of contemporary agriculture

57
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,560
are on display in remarkable ways

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,920
this process uses little or no soil

59
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,840
instead plants grow through an advanced

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,360
hydroponic system that delivers a

61
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,599
nutrient-rich solution directly to the

62
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,799
plant roots through plastic tubes this

63
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:52,400
method ensures that plants get all the

64
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,400
nutrients they need for optimal growth

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,319
without the limitations and potential

66
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,959
diseases common in traditional soil

67
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:03,079
farming methods as the eggplants grow

68
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,799
they are supported by a network of

69
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:10,079
hanging wires with the top of each plant

70
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,120
being fixed to these wires providing the

71
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,720
necessary support as they grow taller

72
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,519
and heavier this support system is

73
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,519
essential as it prevents the trees from

74
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,840
falling over under their own weight and

75
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,000
ensures they can reach their full

76
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,479
potential each tree typically requires

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,320
two fixed wires to support the structure

78
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,320
and health of the

79
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,400
tree this systematic method of plant

80
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,440
care contributes significantly to the

81
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,280
success of greenhouse farming in

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,680
taken correctly until the plant begins

84
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,680
to bloom

[Music]

86
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,720
this is a critical stage in the plant's

87
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:13,560
growth cycle and every effort is made to

88
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,039
ensure the plant remains in the best

89
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,160
possible condition regular assessments

90
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:21,000
are made to assess plant Vigor and

91
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,639
confirm that the eggplant plants are

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,639
growing as

apart from traditional methods allowing

96
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:38,800
for greater control over the growing

97
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,680
