[Music]

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,679
i'm a fourth generation farmer here uh

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,400
we've we've uh

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,240
in 2012 was really bad i'm seeing 2012

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,280
maybe even just a little worse in 2012

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,039
right now

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,000
already feeding hay if you have to

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
purchase hay which we're going to

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,080
purchase probably 600 bail this year uh

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,960
you're already seeing a 65 to 85 dollar

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,320
hay

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,359
and you know it's some of that hate it

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,800
was built in the media that's what

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,160
scares me the quality of the hay that

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,279
we're gonna have to purchase because

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,119
there's nothing else growing you look

17
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,600
here and it's just burn up everywhere

18
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,520
but what i what i hope in the the

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,520
positive in the future will be

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,600
i hope we see like we did in 13 some

21
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,320
higher priced cattle if if we can stay

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,640
hooked and get by this drought

23
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,000
um i think i hope we see some hard

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,559
cattle i don't think we'll see them as

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,840
high as we did in 13 but if if we can

26
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,199
get higher than where we was and for

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,320
sure where we're at now i think it's a

28
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,280
positive

29
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,360
uh you know and in the future if we knew

30
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,039
that we was going to get rain we would

31
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,160
know that we how much was going to have

32
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,280
to buy but it's just hard to tell if

33
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,120
we're going to get it when we're going

34
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,239
to get it it's been in the future we

35
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,799
don't get it

36
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,280
we had rain here since i think june 8th

37
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,640
we finally got two tenths of rain about

38
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,640
five days ago

39
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,560
it was gone in 30 minutes you know so

40
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,320
hopefully it will get better but that's

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,280
kind of my positive is i hope the cattle

42
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,799
market

43
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,320
if we can make it

44
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,520
and don't have to sell out

45
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,479
i think the cattle market should be a

46
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,240
little better

47
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,040
being a rep for the sale barn there i

48
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,040
see a lot of people you know uh they

49
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,360
call me a lot ask what what i should do

50
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,799
what what should they do you know want

51
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,360
to know a lot of perspective about

52
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,720
what's going on but uh say four weeks

53
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,240
ago we had

54
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,479
80 head of cows

55
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,799
next week we had 180 something ahead the

56
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,439
next week we had 590 something ahead of

57
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,360
cows not just calves but cows when you

58
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,759
see that many cows coming to the sale

59
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,920
barnes problems and there's a lot of

60
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,000
people selling out right now which when

61
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,840
you demand that the man comes in of that

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,079
very that many cattle it is going to dry

63
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,159
the market down uh we're seeing a drop

64
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,399
of ten dollars a k uh you know 100 on

65
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,880
cows right now from from 80s in the low

66
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,280
six low 70s and upper 60s

67
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,119
and we did have a special wing sale this

68
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,720
last week is one reason you've seen a

69
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,040
lot of the big calves

70
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,319
big groups but the reason is also is

71
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,760
they're not going to hold until fall

72
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,840
like me i wean in the spring i sell them

73
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,800
in the fall i i back around my own

74
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,560
cattle

75
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,879
and with that

76
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,239
people's not keeping cows and calves are

77
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,080
keeping their calves and wind calves as

78
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,319
long because the the commodity prices

79
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,239
are high right now grains high you know

80
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,920
corn i seen took a little bit of a drop

81
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,760
that might help a little bit

82
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,519
but people just can't afford to feed

83
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,879
their cattle because they know that

84
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,120
there's not going to be enough hay to

85
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,720
feed what they don't have to keep we're

86
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,239
supplementing a lot right now i mean i'm

87
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,840
not a salesman for any feed company or

88
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,360
anything but we're using liquid feed

89
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,480
we're using salt mix to you know that

90
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,560
salt mix and let it meet some of the

91
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,959
dryer but motor grass or dryer hay get

92
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,879
something out of it stretch what you got

93
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,840
don't sell out unless you just have to

94
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,840
uh but use some supplements you know and

95
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,680
and the best thing to do is if you do

96
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,200
have to buy hey get it tested

97
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,560
if your quality of hay is good you don't

98
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,680
have to supplement but this year i'm

99
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,280
afraid we're going to get a lot of hay

100
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,440
that is just either too dry when it's

101
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,720
bailed so uh it's not going to have the

102
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,400
quality

103
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,920
go to your county extension agent get it

104
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,599
get it tested they can tell you if you

105
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,560
need to put anything if you need a

106
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,159
better

107
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,440
supplement or liquid feed or something

108
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,239
to get them by and just to stay in there

109
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,480
hey

110
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,840
i've i went through 12 we had another

111
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,280
small

112
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,400
winter deal you know where we fed a lot

113
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,080
of hay i mean i've been through some

114
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,040
droughts not like a lot of the old

115
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,599
timers

116
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,799
but if we can make it through i feel

117
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,400
like the cattle market's going to get

118
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,239
better after this i mean

119
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,040
this is something that happens every 10

120
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,720
or 12 to 14 years you know so just stay

121
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,480
in and and supplement where you need to

122
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,480
just don't get a lot of overcost in it

123
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,770
[Music]

124
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,760
you
