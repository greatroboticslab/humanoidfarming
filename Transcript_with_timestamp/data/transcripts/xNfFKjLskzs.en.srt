00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:29,119
this is synched a kawaii community

2
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:30,590
matters here hi you've joined it you

3
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,500
know lickable science I'm your host

4
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,930
Ethan Allen here on think tech Hawaii

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:39,410
thanks for joining us today and what is

6
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:42,620
more lickable than food I love food

7
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:46,580
right and today joining you by Skype is

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:48,739
dr. Joseph - Frank hi Joe bye Ethan

9
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,329
how's it going it's always a pleasure to

10
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:51,950
be back with you and likeable science

11
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:55,760
right great to have you on board again

12
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:58,610
here so Joe - Frank is a plant scientist

13
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,630
tropical plant and soil science group at

14
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,719
uhm on OA

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:06,020
it's got a doctorate from Michigan State

16
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,170
a bit ago and he works on all kinds of

17
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,940
things related to weed control and but

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,180
not in the traditional way lot of people

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,039
now think of it as we control with

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:19,060
chemicals and pesticides Joe's really

21
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:22,659
very interested in in sort of

22
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:25,510
appropriate non pesticide non chemical

23
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:28,640
through low tech ways that we can we can

24
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:31,189
control weeds and keep the soil intact

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,390
we don't have to tilt it up and and all

26
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:36,530
that kind of stuff that takes energy

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:39,250
time so once you tell us a little bit

28
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,360
about sort of go back in the history of

29
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,570
agriculture as it were Joe to give us a

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,390
little context great Ethan well what

31
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,430
we're going to talk about today is

32
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:52,850
no-till farming for organic farmers as

33
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,530
well as home gardeners no-till farming

34
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,259
came into prominence in the American

35
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,210
agriculture sometime around 1973

36
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,070
about the time when we had the bowl was

37
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,500
called the Arab oil embargo where

38
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:07,009
farmers needed to reduce their energy

39
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,540
consumption with gasoline right so in

40
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:09,920
one of the ways they did that was by

41
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,420
trying to reduce the plowing of the

42
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,250
fields in preparation for seeding

43
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:17,000
yes that's what you mean by no-till

44
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,829
right yes not plowing oh so we don't

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,120
want to plow so generally what you would

46
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:22,610
do is you would have like a crop of

47
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,650
winter wheat for example and instead of

48
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,630
plowing down the remaining stubble of

49
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,270
the wheat in the spring of the year they

50
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,620
would spray it to kill whatever her

51
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,140
weeds were there and then they would use

52
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,030
specialized planners the plant seeds

53
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,670
directly into that stubble so you would

54
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,080
have a nice mulch to retain moisture

55
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,510
around soil erosion and of course you

56
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,780
say baby four or five trips across the

57
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,820
field by not plowing oh I was interested

58
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,800
at in the early 70s at Michigan State

59
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,240
and then all these years I've been

60
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,240
trying to figure out a way we could

61
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,220
adapt that system for organic farm right

62
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,440
because for again a farmers of course

63
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,050
they don't want to spray it and spray

64
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,360
the chemicals on the previous cover of

65
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,700
crop and you know they can't do that in

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,360
call it organic anymore so what would

67
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,610
your session Brix so organic farmers of

68
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,260
course they can't spray herbicides to

69
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,590
kill off weeds and the only way they can

70
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,820
terminate a cover crop number crop is

71
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,080
going to be a plant that you're not

72
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,870
going to eat you're not going to consume

73
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:23,500
it's there to enrich the soil increase

74
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:26,080
aeration and also serve as a break for

75
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,050
certain pests so once you have this

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,730
vigorous cover crop on the soil surface

77
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:34,060
organic farmers were restricted to using

78
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,530
the plow or disc to invert the soil bury

79
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,590
that organic matter and then have a

80
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,660
clean surface in which to plant in of

81
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,430
course that takes a lot of energy has a

82
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,340
pretty big carbon footprint with the

83
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,950
tractors moving and so forth so what we

84
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,860
were wanting to do is to develop a

85
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,630
system where busying something other

86
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,030
than the plow and the tractor to

87
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:57,940
terminate the cover crop or using light

88
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,100
exclusion and light exclusion through

89
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,720
the use of these durable woven plastic

90
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,240
fabrics is what we've been experimenting

91
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,250
with right because plan says everyone

92
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,050
knows need light to grow right and if

93
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,810
you really cover your plant over well

94
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,440
and keep it dark the green plants don't

95
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,820
get the light

96
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,190
they don't manufacture their own food

97
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:20,320
they up and die right so it's there's

98
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,210
nothing new there plants need light they

99
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,910
don't get light they die so let me just

100
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,850
briefly through what we're talking about

101
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,040
in terms of a technique for commercial

102
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,050
farmers as well as home gardeners I

103
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,600
think it really shines for homeowners

104
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,070
who may not be too crazy about taking a

105
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,790
shovel to the ground and flipping it

106
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,940
over so yeah we rose to

107
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,560
is that you need to establish a cover

108
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,390
crop for whatever reason like I said

109
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,210
organic matter add nitrogen through

110
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,940
legumes and allow that thing to grow

111
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,340
vigorously to the point where you want

112
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,100
to plant your cash crop at that point

113
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,020
what conventional organic farmers are

114
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,900
doing is doing what's called creeping or

115
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,310
rolling right that means there we go

116
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,770
alright we got we got the pictures up

117
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,710
now alright so this is the first picture

118
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,810
here ok so the first picture is actually

119
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,390
our student the gardens in the weed

120
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,430
science class this fall but uhm Noah and

121
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,920
what you're looking at is a five species

122
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,590
cover crop meaning that there's five

123
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,490
different see that were playing it give

124
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:25,410
you this a diverse nice green luscious

125
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,870
crop in in the composition there that

126
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:32,610
you're looking at is Calpis borage

127
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:35,880
radish black mustard outs and buckwheat

128
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,820
so we have a diverse group of cover

129
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,740
crops that we we can address any sort of

130
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,330
pests that may be adapt it's one of them

131
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,060
we know will have something there

132
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,040
that'll that'll grow well and the alpi

133
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,660
of course is a legume that's gonna pull

134
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,490
nitrogen from the air and add it to the

135
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,700
soil excellent that would be the first

136
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,890
picture right so next here we go there's

137
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,810
somebody rolling okay so the next

138
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,540
picture you see a student they're using

139
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:03,270
a roller to crush down the cover crop a

140
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:06,120
farmers would be using a tractor based

141
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,580
roller and maybe not a smooth over one

142
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,830
with crimpers you know these rays that

143
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,350
is that and break the stem so what what

144
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,360
organic farmers try to do is terminate

145
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,730
the cover crop by you know crushing the

146
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,370
stems and then they plant their crop in

147
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:23,010
there the only problem is is that may

148
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,410
not completely fill the cover crop there

149
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:31,440
may be weeds underneath that emerge once

150
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:34,650
you master you do the rolling right next

151
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,290
picture would be illustrating the weed

152
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:40,050
mats or the thurible polypropylene

153
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:43,590
fabrics that are available at most

154
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:46,200
stores that sell commercial supplies to

155
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,760
nurseryman and so forth right now wait

156
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,130
these down on their edges with some sort

157
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,139
of little sandbags or water tube or

158
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,990
something so what we're using

159
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:56,939
for securing that plastic to the ground

160
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,969
is what everybody who's familiar with

161
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:01,710
ten fumigation in Hawaii whenever they

162
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:04,379
fumigate your house they usually use

163
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,180
water filled hoses to secure the plastic

164
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,099
to the ground so it doesn't come off so

165
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,580
that's what we're using to get these

166
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:13,110
used fire hoses fill them with water or

167
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,999
we even have some hoses filled with say

168
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,599
in the shorter lengths and that way we

169
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:20,819
can like we can cover the cover the

170
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:22,680
ground and then secure the fabric in

171
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,599
windy areas with water filled hoses so

172
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,189
it's a convenient way to hold it in

173
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,870
place without poking holes and without

174
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:30,060
having a bunch of rocks and stones to

175
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,009
lug around and then take off what we

176
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,770
want to remove it ya know it's beautiful

177
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:37,590
that it makes a nice solid light tight

178
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,569
cover and when you remove it then it's

179
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,830
the next photo I think we'll show now

180
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:43,710
when you remove it what you're looking

181
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,659
at there is a one week of coverage so

182
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,060
what we do is we rolled that cover crop

183
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:50,550
we covered it for one week and you might

184
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,669
not think that one week of coverage is

185
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:57,300
enough to disable that rubber crop but

186
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:59,039
it is because it's high dark and so now

187
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,629
that the cover crop is killed you

188
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,909
haven't we haven't done any additional

189
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:04,770
work we haven't used any chemicals now

190
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:07,319
we're ready to plant but I believe in

191
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:09,719
them in the next image we'll see that

192
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,229
the corn transplants have been playing

193
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:15,029
it if that's up and then you can see

194
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:17,250
that the corn is growing normally so I

195
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:19,469
say well what's what's remarkable about

196
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,259
all this well what's remarkable that

197
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:24,930
number one we haven't plowed the ground

198
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:28,050
that soil has been laying unplowed for

199
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,719
well over a year and so it's relatively

200
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,579
firm but what we do is we poke a hole in

201
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,500
the ground we put in corn transplants

202
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:38,279
because we want to give the corn a big

203
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,690
jump on any weeds that might grow and we

204
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,490
just poke a hole on the ground sticking

205
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,709
the corn transplants cover it back up

206
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,660
keep irrigating and the nutrients are

207
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:48,990
released from that dead and dying cover

208
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,579
crop and voila we have no-till farming

209
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,949
for organic farmers yeah beautiful

210
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:56,010
beautiful and in that one week of course

211
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:57,959
right not only does the existing plants

212
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,440
that were there they're all starting to

213
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:03,600
die and decay but then any weed seeds or

214
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,080
anything probably start to sprout but

215
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,310
without

216
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,890
light they're not gonna do anything

217
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,420
right that's correct so generally

218
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,800
whenever you play in a cover crop like

219
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,360
that not only are you getting the cover

220
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,670
crop you're gonna get certain weeds that

221
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,430
grow and they may be suppressed by the

222
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,530
vigorous cover crop but once that canopy

223
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,320
is removed those weeds will just sprout

224
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:26,160
up that's the advantage of combining

225
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,870
rolling and crimping with covering that

226
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,670
we kill the cover crop and we kill

227
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,980
whatever weeds may be in the understory

228
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,620
of the cover crop exactly yeah that's

229
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,260
beautiful nice wonderful how you put

230
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,900
these sort of seemingly simple little

231
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,230
bits and pieces you know the idea of a

232
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:49,290
roller to crush the cover crop down idea

233
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:49,710
of a like tight cover over the the

234
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,840
ground

235
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:55,950
roughly simple concept nothing really

236
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,320
high-tech nothing that had to be mixed

237
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,590
up in a chemical lab nothing that didn't

238
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,840
involve some fancy machine that's right

239
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:05,580
right so it's all relatively

240
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,380
straightforward and you say well yeah I

241
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,060
guess you just cover it up and then

242
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,880
everything dies and you pull it off and

243
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:15,180
then your plant makes a lot of sense

244
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,590
challenges is how large a scale can we

245
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,380
do that you can imagine if you have a

246
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:22,080
you know plastic that's you know 300

247
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,240
feet long and 12 feet wide that could be

248
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,550
pretty challenging laying it out in the

249
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,120
field and then securing it so the

250
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:32,640
question is not every crop would be

251
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,830
adapted to this I see that the majority

252
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,020
of crops that would be at that would be

253
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:41,070
things like mallow greens or microgreens

254
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:44,190
where you can more or less seated in a

255
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,960
complete block and then harvest you know

256
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:50,010
things aren't in rows or just growing as

257
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,270
a complete flock and in that way these

258
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,570
organic farmers who are getting a

259
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:56,880
premium for their products will have

260
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,790
incentive to try to do this of course

261
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,520
there's expense to the plastic but as

262
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:05,130
opposed to plowing and tractors and if

263
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,550
it rains you take it in the field and it

264
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:10,500
gives the I think farmers a lot more

265
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,600
flexibility in timing when they pull off

266
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,610
that fabric they might want to wait

267
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,080
until they may have a bunch of these

268
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,800
fabrics out there they pull one off

269
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,019
plant but that gets

270
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,100
started well the next one open plant and

271
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:24,040
they don't have to worry about weeds

272
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,200
growing while they're timing the plane

273
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,750
things of their crop so I just think it

274
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,000
adds a lot of flexibility for commercial

275
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,250
farmers and for the homeowner it's great

276
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,589
too because you may have a piece of

277
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,450
ground that's a weedy mess and you go

278
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:40,690
yeah I like to start gardening dr. D how

279
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:42,490
do I do it I say well but get a sheet of

280
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,160
plastic which you can get it various

281
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,930
hardware stores now this is a plastic

282
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,399
that's woven it's not a film so it

283
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,500
allows the irrigation water to go

284
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,920
through it so we just knock down the

285
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:56,290
weeds cover them

286
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,730
eeep moisten the soil over the top with

287
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,010
irrigation and then when you're ready to

288
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,470
plant pull it off put a hole in the

289
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,430
ground and plan some transplants and see

290
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,440
what you get of course you got to

291
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,430
fertilize but you're not plowing the

292
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,850
ground so you're not going to get a

293
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,560
whole bunch of weeds and if you mulch if

294
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,269
you add mulch in addition to your

295
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,430
transplants you might be able to get

296
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:17,529
away with a prop without any weeding

297
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,970
whatsoever and then you're done with the

298
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,529
field

299
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,660
all right backed up and when you're

300
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:24,880
ready to Braille again pull it pull it

301
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,890
off and plant again yeah it's it seems

302
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,459
like it's got a lot going for it and

303
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:33,430
makes a lot of sense it would seem like

304
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:35,950
it's economical to a good extent the

305
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,500
fabric I assumed to be used at least

306
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:41,410
several times certainly right oh yes the

307
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,540
fabric is very durable and I would

308
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,220
expect that you know a farmer would get

309
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:49,750
I don't know maybe five years of use

310
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:51,220
from a piece of fabric and then I think

311
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,220
they would get you know if they if they

312
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:57,040
worked it out where they they had their

313
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,690
crops on a regular basis I think they

314
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,850
could actually make money on it and the

315
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,010
reason why I throw this out were farmers

316
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,600
to think about is because the farmers

317
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,610
are gonna innovate on how are they going

318
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,149
to how are they going to use it how they

319
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:12,100
going to time their plantings and or you

320
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:13,360
know picking it up and rolling it when

321
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,880
it's a big sheet of plastic that's gonna

322
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,220
take a couple people so that's where you

323
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,410
need a but if you know more than more

324
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,760
than one person pulling it off rolling

325
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,740
it up and getting it ready for the next

326
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,149
usage so there's some innovation that

327
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,490
the farmers will need to come up with

328
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:30,790
really make this an efficient practice

329
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,180
sure like almost any technology you need

330
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,590
to

331
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,140
a bit to it you need to think of some

332
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:37,510
new ways to sort of support it and apply

333
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,400
it but it's it you've got you've given

334
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,120
people really a really nice set of tools

335
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,650
to use a really interesting approach

336
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,810
that should be really applicable and as

337
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,990
you say for sort of moderate scale

338
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:52,660
organic farms for things like the mixed

339
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:55,740
greens and salad mix kind of stuff that

340
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:58,600
should be really sort of perfect thing

341
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,800
ya know farmer can get two or three

342
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,360
people out there they could they could

343
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,240
do a number of these patches at once

344
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,890
they can wait until they see the there's

345
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,690
rains on their way so it won't have to

346
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,420
irrigate as much too hot

347
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:13,330
timing whole issue is really great a lot

348
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,160
of advantages just I can see yeah and

349
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,600
one of the big advantages is you know in

350
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,880
Hawaii you know we always think that

351
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,220
it's always a great growing season year

352
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,020
round but we do have a rainy cycles and

353
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,850
one of the big problems is that for

354
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,070
organic farmers is we control you ask

355
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,840
any organic farmer one of the biggest

356
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,140
challenges for production is we control

357
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,970
so let's say you get into a rainy spell

358
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,190
November December it's raining every

359
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,930
other day you can't go out in the field

360
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,790
and control those weeds with mowing and

361
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,470
plowing because it's too wet you're just

362
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,630
stuck there watching the weeds grow and

363
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,970
watching them put out seeds but the

364
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,200
ground is covered with this fabric

365
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,910
there's no worries you know the the

366
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,030
weeds are going to grow as a matter of

367
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:54,520
fact adding moisture once the fabric is

368
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,320
there is causing weeds that are in the

369
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,870
soil to germinate thinking that they're

370
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,190
going to reach the surface but they here

371
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,620
they're underneath of plastic so what

372
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,170
you're actually doing is purging right

373
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,200
beet seeds from the production cycle but

374
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,580
it's the actual way to store the soil

375
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,460
get a bunch of weeds to germinate and

376
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,840
and the farmer it could be the wettest

377
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:17,170
day of the year when he wants to peel

378
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:19,330
all of that plastic plant you know like

379
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,910
I said for moderate sized farmers or for

380
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:24,520
you know large own gardeners I think

381
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,950
it's a real a real you know simple

382
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,930
innovation makes sense to the average

383
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,800
person to go yeah and why didn't

384
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,710
somebody think of that before

385
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,210
so when I said the same thing I go well

386
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,740
I wonder if anybody's gonna think that

387
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,960
this is a realistic thing and then I

388
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,570
started doing my laboratories with the

389
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,940
students and they just seemed to accept

390
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,920
it as you okay that that's okay that's

391
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,139
fine now that looks good right and

392
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,639
we're gonna we're gonna dig into this in

393
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:50,109
more depth here when we come back but

394
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,869
right now we have to take a quick break

395
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:54,429
here we'll be right back Jodi Frank is

396
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,959
with me here I'm your host Ethan Helen

397
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:58,410
here on likable science and we'll be

398
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,410
back in a minute

399
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:16,549

the host of Fink tech Hawaii's law

404
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:41,000
across the sea law across the sea comes

405
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:42,840
on every other Monday at 11:00 a.m.

406
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,910
please join us

407
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,400
I like to bring in guests that talk

408
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,980
about all types of things that come

409
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:56,880
across the sea to Hawaii not just law

410
00:16:49,980 --> 00:17:00,960
love people ideas history please join us

411
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,790
for law across the sea Allah and you're

412
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,290
back here on likable science I'm your

413
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,740
host Ethan Allen here on the attack

414
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,580
Hawaii with me today via Skype is dr.

415
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:12,300
Joseph de Frank

416
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:14,480
welcome again Joe Nathan good to be back

417
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,190
again yes indeed and we're talking about

418
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,110
some innovations that Joe has developed

419
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:22,290
a really a very interesting sort of

420
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:25,770
low-tech but but very effective ways to

421
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:28,050
help gardeners small-scale farmers avoid

422
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,520
the need to till the soil to turn on

423
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:34,200
their soil to have the heavy equipment

424
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,960
to run their tractors his approach by

425
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,380
essentially crushing a cover crop and

426
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,690
then covering it for as little as a week

427
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:45,210
really opens up some some great

428
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,100
opportunities and one of the nice things

429
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,930
I was thinking a little bit over the

430
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,240
break via it was you can leave that

431
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:54,270
cover than in place right sort of as

432
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,650
long as you want you say a week but it

433
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,440
doesn't hurt if it stays on for two

434
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,120
weeks three weeks or whatever right

435
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,700
right we've had it on as long as eight

436
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,230
nine months over the summer just waiting

437
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,180
for the class to start we pull it off

438
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,760
and we're ready to go so a great way to

439
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,940
store the soil eventually store that

440
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:14,580
soil in a in a ready condition for

441
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,920
planting with little to no effort it's

442
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,500
just there ready to go yeah it's not

443
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,870
it's not your roading you're not getting

444
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,230
new weed growth it's not blowing away

445
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,160
it's not packing down it's it's just as

446
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,790
you say it's sort of sitting there

447
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,740
waiting yeah yeah oh it's it's a good

448
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:34,050
way to store store the soil in the go

449
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,730
mode for planting yeah so I mean if you

450
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,620
look in that soil just just this is

451
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,510
purely my curiosity look in that soil

452
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,000
you'll find the same kinds of

453
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,640
invertebrate populations earthworms and

454
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,490
various little bugs all sort of sitting

455
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,680
there doing their little business right

456
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:52,960
right and what we found is that you know

457
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,000
if we leave that cover on for you know

458
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,360
if we cover but if we put the plastic

459
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,550
over the top of weeds or or or other

460
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,559
cover crops what happens is that we have

461
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:04,780
a real explosion of soil insects that

462
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,550
consume that organic matter because

463
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:09,190
they're not being preyed on by birds so

464
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:11,530
you have an accelerated breakdown of the

465
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:14,200
organic matter in a mineralization of

466
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:15,670
those nutrients back to the soil so all

467
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,490
around it's a it's a pretty interesting

468
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:22,540
approach and it also gives us an opening

469
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:24,580
for a pest management there's a thing

470
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,320
called nematodes in the soil nematodes

471
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,050
are microscopic worms and will penetrate

472
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,630
the roots and ruin them and for organic

473
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:34,750
farmers it's very difficult to get rid

474
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:37,540
of those microscopic worms but we've

475
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:40,630
developed a way to combine a cover crop

476
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:43,450
with the plastic to accelerate the

477
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:45,070
removal of these microscopic pests and

478
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,080
the way that works is a little

479
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:50,440
counterintuitive you know you think that

480
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,640
well if I got this soil borne worm

481
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,070
that's eating my roots

482
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,350
I gotta plant things that that aren't

483
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:58,780
susceptible to it right but the

484
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,040
counterintuitive idea is to know we're

485
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,200
gonna plan something that's super

486
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:06,640
sensitive because these nematodes

487
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,920
respond to root exudates of the septum

488
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,900
aplan and just like a seed those

489
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,950
nematodes germinate from eggs so once

490
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:16,240
they perceive the roots growing a

491
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,070
Germany and they try to attach to the

492
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,040
plant but if we know the lifecycle of

493
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,650
those nematodes we can then roll that

494
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,720
fabric before they start to reproduce

495
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:28,600
cover it up with plastic the plants dies

496
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,300
the nematode dies now we have a non

497
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:35,309
chemical way to get rid of this very

498
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:37,690
persistent and challenging soil pest

499
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:39,940
nematodes and use the same technique

500
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,010
only with a slight little variation

501
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,860
where be playing a susceptible crop

502
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,660
makes the nematodes come to life they

503
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,880
try to attach to the roots and before

504
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,280
they can reproduce we kill off the plant

505
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,320
with this covering and nematodes die we

506
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,660
pull it off and then we play

507
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,440
susceptible crops oh it it's also giving

508
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,420
us a new approach to pest management I

509
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:04,110
don't think we've we've thought about it

510
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,580
in that way I like that that's it sort

511
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,190
of a little a little a fake-out a little

512
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,750
faint as it were you you draw them out

513
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,500
by print planting something they really

514
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,780
like when they all sort of go for that

515
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,520
then you zap them basically you can

516
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,370
cover the cover over and they can't they

517
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,110
don't get a second chance basically

518
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:24,720
right no I didn't think that up years

519
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,790
ago we had a scientist from North

520
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,490
Carolina State Don Schmidt and he was a

521
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:31,410
guy he was always testing chemicals for

522
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,900
nematode control and soybeans he goes

523
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:36,420
you know Joe the best year that I had

524
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:40,590
was when we had an early spring in North

525
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:41,940
Carolina I mid the soybeans I put out

526
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,640
all my treatments but then we had a

527
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,680
early frost and all the soybeans died

528
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,510
when we re-established the experiments

529
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,580
and we threw the soybeans again we

530
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,980
couldn't tell untreated fields from

531
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,930
treated fields because of just what I

532
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,780
said the nematodes all came into the

533
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,820
soybeans the frost killed him he died

534
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:03,510
and so it's the same concept sort of

535
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,980
like a a bait and switch your roots and

536
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,740
then you switch him by turning off the

537
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,730
lights that's beautiful that's beautiful

538
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:13,890
yeah and it looks to me like this has a

539
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:17,370
lot of interesting options to go new

540
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:20,580
places right I mean this you're using

541
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:23,580
right now one kind of fabric but you

542
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:26,250
could conceivably think about that

543
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,930
fabric in different ways right right now

544
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,550
I was thinking like how can we make this

545
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,980
better you know the fabric is kind of

546
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:33,450
heavy when you get large sheets of it

547
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,950
you know it gets to be kind of

548
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,410
cumbersome to pick it up and put it away

549
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,270
and and one of the things that happens

550
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,700
when we use the fabric of course we can

551
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:44,610
kill a living plant but sometimes

552
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,800
there's weed seeds that need light to

553
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:50,130
germinate and grow so what happens then

554
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,980
is that we gotta we gotta stimulate

555
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,890
those weed seeds to grow over it kill

556
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,290
them off and then uncover it now with

557
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,390
all the budding engineers and nanotech

558
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:02,340
scientists out there it occurred to me

559
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,320
that you know we we probably have the

560
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,070
technology somewhere in our industrial

561
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,590
base to do what I call

562
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,420
nano blankets or nano fabric so what

563
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,790
would that be that would be like a super

564
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,710
light fabric that you know with a

565
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:16,480
certain electrical potential it's

566
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,220
translucent and let's light into the

567
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,100
soil so that would I would allow the

568
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,020
weed seeds to grow underneath of the

569
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,210
blanket and now we add another little

570
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,830
electrical potential and they reorient

571
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:30,010
the molecules and then it turns it black

572
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:33,430
then the weeds die so this way we could

573
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:35,950
start to purge beet seeds that are light

574
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:38,650
sensitive grow without pulling the

575
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:42,340
fabric on and off and then once the

576
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,840
fabric is all the weeds are dead boom we

577
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:47,350
pull it off and move it to another field

578
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:50,230
so I think that there's probably you

579
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,970
know engineers out there that maybe have

580
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,650
is ready to go maybe it's ready for off

581
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,230
you know they're using it as a as a

582
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:58,120
blanket for a space shuttle the block

583
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,430
light or to turn it on and off but I

584
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,670
don't think I've never heard of an

585
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:05,620
agricultural use for such a thing but

586
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:07,540
I'm sure there might be some compliances

587
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,980
out there that maybe they can let us

588
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,200
know if they got something like that and

589
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,000
we can work together on yeah I sounds

590
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,460
great I mean it actually reminds me a

591
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,560
bit of the another one of my sort of

592
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,100
favorite technological advances which is

593
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:23,140
the a thing called Mattie drops which

594
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,460
was a ceramic chemist

595
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,710
Jim Smith from the University of

596
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,410
Virginia had been working for years on

597
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:31,240
pushing water through porous ceramics to

598
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,670
help filter it and clean it up and

599
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,440
adding silver into that helped kill off

600
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:37,420
the the microbes as it went through and

601
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,160
finally realized that he didn't actually

602
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,880
need to push the water through it he

603
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:45,220
essentially put sawdust in with the clay

604
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,110
and the silver nitrate baked it in a

605
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,570
kiln and got a very porous ceramic so

606
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:52,120
water flowed by itself in through there

607
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,650
and literally pulled off the silver and

608
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,450
distributed this over around the water

609
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:58,090
killing off all the microbes sort of

610
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:00,550
again it's nice little aloe to a

611
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:02,740
low-tech twist on a hi-tech idea and I

612
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:04,380
like what you're thinking about there I

613
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,900
think it has a lot of that potential

614
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,760
great yeah so that's that's kind of what

615
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:13,510
I wanted to share with everybody today

616
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,390
and like I said everybody thinks that we

617
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:18,790
need to plow through in a soft soil for

618
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,590
roots to grow but really I like to say

619
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,940
let the worms do

620
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,130
flowey you know we had enough organic

621
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,200
matter and the plant roots when they

622
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:27,179
died make channels and the worms come up

623
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,559
and and eat the organic matter so I say

624
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,539
let them let the worms do the plough and

625
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,880
we'll do the planting and the eat yeah

626
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:34,620
yeah people don't appreciate how how

627
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,260
much work worms do what is it they say

628
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:40,110
in the over the course of a year the

629
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,580
worms in an acre of ground will turn

630
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,380
over something like a ton of soil or

631
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,850
something some some incredible figure I

632
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,250
heard I don't know I'm sure it's

633
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,600
incredible and like I said what and see

634
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,850
when you start plowing then you're

635
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,350
breaking up that earthworm habitat

636
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,080
you're killing them you're breaking

637
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:57,029
their channels though a no-till farming

638
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,149
was something that was like I said in

639
00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:02,039
early 70s it became popularized but the

640
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:04,710
organic farmer never really had a chance

641
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,120
to use it because again I can't use

642
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,700
chemicals to kill off the leads they

643
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,549
fell off cover crops but I think with

644
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,190
this technique we can start to get them

645
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:16,679
thinking about it and probably be

646
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,270
developing some grants to expand it and

647
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,309
I've already presented this to some

648
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,870
farmers in Hawaii and my understanding

649
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:25,200
if they went out and got some fabrics

650
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:27,539
and are going to try it so start to

651
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,399
break out of the you know the the idea

652
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:31,649
phase and into the reality phase I'm

653
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:33,059
pretty happy about yeah well you should

654
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:35,429
be very proud of it and I could see

655
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:39,179
great applicability of this technique to

656
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:41,070
down in Micronesia where people just

657
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:43,020
really started and try to do some of

658
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:47,100
this more push towards self

659
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:49,110
sustainability developing vegetable

660
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,289
crops and things like they can support a

661
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:54,299
tourist industry they can have more

662
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:56,130
varieties of fresh foods themselves and

663
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:59,669
none of its huge a lot of it is this

664
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:01,529
this sort of ant farm small scale right

665
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:04,620
so you know and you know tractors

666
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:06,720
equipment fuel takes a lot of effort to

667
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,490
you know to put make a field that's

668
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,700
that's all we D and maybe cover with

669
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:13,799
grass and make it acceptable for crop

670
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,419
production but I think now we can just

671
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:18,360
flatten it out to the point where we can

672
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:19,860
cover it it doesn't blow away after a

673
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,120
while you know plant like I said plants

674
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,770
don't do too good when they're covered

675
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,779
and then once they die off they break

676
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,429
down pretty quick and yeah I'm pretty

677
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:29,130
excited that it can really be at

678
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:31,289
something they said it's new that plants

679
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:33,120
need light to grow but I think the idea

680
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:33,299
of the fabric and if anybody can develop

681
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,850
on

682
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:38,129
new super light fabric oh we could have

683
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,720
some real exciting things happen yeah

684
00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:41,789
exactly this this could go anywhere

685
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,590
though because again just you can ship

686
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:45,690
that fabric out rolls of it that's not

687
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,649
not really the hard hard thing to do

688
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,840
it's not like shipping out a very

689
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:50,429
complex piece of machinery yeah hey well

690
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,960
this is great Joe I've enjoyed talking

691
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:53,429
with you here and I've learned learned a

692
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,960
lot of learn learned a lot the first

693
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:56,249
time you were on and even more this time

694
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,619
I'm pleased to see that you're

695
00:27:56,249 --> 00:27:59,850
continuing this and developing

696
00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:02,610
developing it in new directions it's

697
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:04,710
great thank you so much for for sharing

698
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:06,960
with you and I hope all our viewers will

699
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,419
share this with their organic farmer

700
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,730
friends it's always great talking to you

701
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:14,220
in the audience for likeable science all

702
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,419
right thank you Joe you take care thank

703
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,279
you very much and have a good weekend

704
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,929
yes indeed so that's about it for

705
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,620
another episode of likeable science here

706
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:35,640
on think tackle I will see you next week

707
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:36,750
[Music]

708
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:49,000
you

709
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:49,000
[Music]
