words the silent superheroes of healthy

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,680
soil champions of the vermicompost who

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,870
with the right conditions turn scraps

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,059
into the black gold gardeners dreams are

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,830
made of it's a style of composting that

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,660
can be done in any space big or small

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,940
and costs very little to get started

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,859
welcome to the first video of my firma

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,810
composting series where I help you get

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,910
started with Verma composting and answer

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,920
your questions along the way today's

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:34,320
video is all about starting a simple

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:35,910
vermicompost the single total fit now

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,100
before we really hop into things here I

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,559
just have to say what's up to all 400

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,469
plus new subscribers here hello Amanda

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,750

should we do to celebrate our next

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,530
milestone a 5000 I don't know tell me

24
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:01,739
what you guys think in the comments down

25
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:04,439
below alright the moment you've all been

26
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,060
waiting for it for a composting 101 in

27
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,830
this video we are gonna talk about how

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,770
you can get your vermicompost set up

29
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,450
really fast and easy from a composting

30
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,580
does not have to be hard it does not

31
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,560
have to be complicated and here to help

32
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,990
you overcome the overwhelm fellow

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,790
beginner gardener you can become an

34
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,270
expert from a composter so let's hop

35
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,270
into things

36
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,909
[Music]

37
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,369
so first step you're gonna need

38
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:32,560
something for your worms to live in

39
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:35,200
bedding today I'll be using some soil

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,509
that you can use compost it's Fagen peat

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,720
moss coco coir anything that would be a

42
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:42,700
good substrate next step you're gonna

43
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,679
need some worms I have some worms on

44
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,569
hand for my worms in the garage but you

45
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:48,369
can use my links down below to get some

46
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:49,899
worms from Uncle Jim's worm farm that's

47
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:51,789
where I purchased them in the past and

48
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:53,350
I've always been really happy next up

49
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:55,329
you're also gonna need some source of

50
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,549
carbon I'm using leaves because it's

51
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:59,860
what mimics nature but you can use

52
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:02,259
anything from shredded up grocery bags

53
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,539
to shred it up packing paper to

54
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:08,289
cardboard anything that's been dried up

55
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:10,179
basically next up you'll need some food

56
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:12,010
scraps this is what I have on hand I

57
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:14,019
usually try to go for things that are a

58
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,390
bit more broken down but here's the list

59
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:18,220
of foods that you'll want to include and

60
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,099
here's a list of foods that you'll want

61
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,989
to avoid adding to your vermicompost

62
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,849
you'll also need some form of grit which

63
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:26,829
is why I've got coffee grounds with us

64
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:29,130
today it's a great source of great you

65
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:31,810
can also use egg shell or oyster shell

66
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,700
and last up you will need a bin of some

67
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,709
kind there are so many different ways to

68
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,359
vermicompost but for today's video I

69
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:39,489
want to show you just a really simple

70
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:43,170
one that you can do in just any old

71
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,170
storage tote so we're using this one

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,859
hello this is my worm bin now you might

73
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,530
be wondering aren't worms photosensitive

74
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:54,549
is clear really the best option and he's

75
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,930
in the clear bin because it's not a

76
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,359
stinking have right now

77
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,760
quarantine life you know what I mean but

78
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:03,310
something that might be cool to use the

79
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,870
clear bin and then you can actually see

80
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,030
what's happening inside it's kind of a

81
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,040
fun science experiment for kids you

82
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,680
actually see what's going on inside to

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,420
see all the layers and all of that so it

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,040
might be a way to go but just keep it

85
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,319
somewhere dark so that the worms aren't

86
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,269
you know overwhelmed or anything now on

87
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,290
top of my worm bin I've got a homemade

88
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:26,049
sieve this is literally just one by two

89
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:29,799
very poorly nailed together here with

90
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:32,769
some quarter-inch mesh screen on top I

91
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,470
use this to make my potting mix for my

92
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:36,849
seed starts and I literally will rub the

93
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,890
peat moss on the top leg

94
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,840
and just I'd make it really really fine

95
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,299
and that's actually important for worms

96
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,939
too this smaller the component that you

97
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:48,219
add the better your worms will do so I

98
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:50,650
would recommend breaking things down for

99
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:52,209
worms when possible it's not necessary

100
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,129
but if you're really excited to get

101
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,849
compost quick you can help them along by

102
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:59,620
breaking it down for them alright so

103
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:01,629
time to make some lasagna and by lasagna

104
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,120
I mean a worm in but we are going to

105
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:07,599
make lots of layers as if we were making

106
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,280
the lasagna but with dirt and stuff

107
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,220
we're gonna get your vermicompost bin

108
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:25,430
set up right now

109
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:25,430
[Music]

110
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,010
so this this soil is nice and fluffy and

111
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,169
the worms are gonna be really happy to

112
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,760
live in this this is really good stuff

113
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:40,460
and it's a little bit moist which is

114
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:44,580
perfect for worms so something like this

115
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:51,420
texture is really good

116
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,420
[Music]

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,149
[Music]

118
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,160
so something to remember here is that

119
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,080
the more you break this down the easier

120
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,910
it will be for your worms to break this

121
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,250
down and the quicker you'll get compost

122
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,810
I didn't do a very good job of crunching

123
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:18,950
down these leaves but you get the idea

124
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:21,740
so by squishing this banana out of the

125
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,390
peel I'm hoping that the worms be able

126
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,930
to break this down just a little bit

127
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:29,030
easier it was kind of a sticky mess if

128
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,890
I'm honest so it was kind of gross I

129
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,320
don't really recommend doing it like

130
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,970
this but you get the idea the more

131
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,760
broken down it is the easier it is for

132
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,800
them to break it down so that's what I

133
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:46,760
tried to do even if it made my hand

134
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:48,950
disgusting Here I am just using my

135
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,640
homemade sieve to add another layer of

136
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:54,320
getting another layer of leaves make

137
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,530
sure you take out any Trader Joe's

138
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,170
precedes our worms really likes juice

139
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,910
scraps avocado and banana but this is

140
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,010
all I had on hand so I'm adding these

141
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:08,300
apple and this carrot

142
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:11,310
[Music]

143
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,540
this parts pretty easy just sprinkle

144
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:25,169
some grit in there and you're good to go

145
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:27,729
[Music]

146
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:31,030
right and just like that we have a very

147
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:33,490
very very simple firma composting system

148
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,349
set up all that's left to do is drill

149
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,879
some holes some quarter-inch holes

150
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:42,849
around the top and put a lid on this

151
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:44,199
thing and you're good to go now let's

152
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:46,870
talk about some common things that could

153
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,750
happen in this first 24 hours your worms

154
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,969
could be a little distraught worms like

155
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,830
any living creature need time to adjust

156
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:56,770
and so you're gonna want to give these

157
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:59,770
worms 24 to 72 hours to get used to

158
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,939
their new environment now with that said

159
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:09,159
you want to make sure that their

160
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:11,439
environment is what they like want you

161
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:12,639
to know how to troubleshoot just a

162
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,949
little bit here in the beginning we're

163
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,110
gonna go nose dive into troubleshooting

164
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,430
more issues later but just in the

165
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,169
beginning I want you to know that the

166
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,120
texture and the moisture in your bin

167
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:24,610
should be that of about a wrung out

168
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,620
sponge too much and the worms can drown

169
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,389
too little and the worms don't have

170
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,330
enough moisture so you want to get it

171
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:34,360
just a little damp but not too damp you

172
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:36,279
need to add a little water you can i

173
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,680
soil and so I know that they're gonna be

174
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:41,050
happy with that you can do the same

175
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,550
thing and also use moist soil and I'm

176
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,319
sure that your worms will be happy with

177
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,270
that as well thanks for joining me today

178
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,520
you guys that is all I have for you a

179
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,080
very simple introductory video to verbum

180
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,909
composting I hope this video helps you

181
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,560
guys get started of course if you have

182
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:55,419
any questions leave them in the comments

183
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,129
