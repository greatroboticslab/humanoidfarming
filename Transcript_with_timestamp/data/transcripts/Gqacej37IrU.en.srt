1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,399
folks how we doing thanks for stopping

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:05,960
by today we are going to talk about a

3
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:08,800
common question that I'm asked enough to

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,440
make this video so we're looking at a

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,080
small area however you can replicate

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,600
this times as big of an area as you have

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,960
to do the question of the day is how do

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,000
you level out a bumpy lawn a bumpy field

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,720
a bumpy

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,800
pasture how do you level these areas out

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,560
well the biggest challenge with these

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,599
areas that you're going to deal with is

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,120
size all right or maybe it's weeds

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,440
inside or it's all that organic matter

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,719
that's on the surface that's rooted in

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,200
there all right and most customers when

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,079
they reach out to me they're looking for

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,879
a tool or tools to

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,800
accomplish this

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,520
renovation the first thing that they

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,199
mention is using a box blade or a lamp

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,399
plane and if you have sad those are not

23
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,160
going to be the right tools to use they

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,000
are very challenging because of the root

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,760
systems and if you have the scarifiers

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,080
or the shanks that are on those tools

27
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,760
you may think I can rip through that

28
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,439
surface rip it all up and then just use

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,640
the box blade or the plane just to kind

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,000
of pull it all to the side but what

31
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,439
you're going to find is it's just

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,040
creating a huge mess those Shanks are

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,799
going to rip through the ground every 6

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,320
8 10 Ines apart you're going to have to

35
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,720
drive back and forth over and over and

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,040
over again to get all of the different

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,600
root clumps worked up and then you're

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,840
going to have to drive all over it again

39
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,960
over and over and over and over again to

40
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,680
repeatedly collect all that material

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,640
you're going to wind up with a gigantic

42
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,000
pile of it or multiple piles of it

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,680
scattered all about that you have to

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,479
then clean up with a bucket it's just

45
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,880
going to be a long arduous tedious

46
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,799
process that's not going to give you

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,759
great results on top of that you're

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,840
stripping away a lot of good organic

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,399
material that should be there to help

50
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,840
Reed your pasture your lawn whatever it

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,560
is basically those nutrients that you

52
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,560
would want to have in the soil to begin

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,200
with to help give it a good start what I

54
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,560
have found and we've done this actually

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,320
in in many different scenarios we've

56
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,479
we've used tillers okay we've used a

57
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,399
tiller right here and if you follow the

58
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,599
channel this area was actually littered

59
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,920
with stumps just like this

60
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,239
one there's one that's just off to the

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,160
side a little bit an area that we

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,560
haven't renovated but stumps just like

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,920
this one this whole area was full of

64
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,959
them and we used our stump wer we dug

65
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,959
all those out and made a big old mess

66
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,360
okay there were holes here and piles of

67
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,959
dirt around and then the stumps of

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,239
course that we got out of there but then

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,959
we just kind of used our bucket and

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,319
pushed the dirt back in those those

71
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,239
holes where the stumps were at just to

72
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,480
get it kind of a a rough level then we

73
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,000
came back through with a tiller and we

74
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,599
tilled this whole area all right we

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,519
didn't till just the areas that had the

76
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,599
bumps we just tilled everything so that

77
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,319
it worked the entire surface up

78
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,920
consistently right and we did that two

79
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,280
or three times just back and forth back

80
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,959
and forth back and forth and so what

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,480
that's going to do is it's going to

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,120
break up consistently all the side

83
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,840
clumps here it doesn't mean it's going

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,920
to get rid of every single last one and

85
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,799
break it down into a super fine matter

86
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,159
but it's doing it repeatedly across the

87
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:12,040
whole area so it's smooth and consistent

88
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:13,840
and you can work with it and the great

89
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,360
part is it leaves all that organic

90
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,640
matter right there it's right there

91
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,440
where it needs to be where it's going to

92
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,280
do its best work helping to regrow the

93
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,879
grass or um The Orchard grasses or

94
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,159
whatever it is that you're planning in

95
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,959
that area that you want to succeed and

96
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:32,959
so we did most of this work last spring

97
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:35,560
okay we dug out the stumps I tilled

98
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,319
everything up and then I used a deer

99
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,120
rake you could also use a landscape rake

100
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,560
if you had that on hand or depending on

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,200
what your long-term application is you

102
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,080
want a tool that's versatile a landscape

103
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,319
rake or a dethatcher either one is super

104
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,040
versatile and this is just one

105
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,680
application for it but I took the decher

106
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,079
and raked everything to one side so

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,959
there was still some you know little

108
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,200
side clumps and there are some sticks

109
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,840
and some other little bits of debris in

110
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,720
here rake those all to one side it was a

111
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,519
lot less material and and the

112
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,760
rakes and the deers they're going to let

113
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,079
the dirt kind of fall out for the most

114
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,239
part you're just stuck with the debris

115
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,640
that you don't want there so it's still

116
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,239
leaving a lot of the nutrients there as

117
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,959
well got what you see here okay and then

118
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,840
of course what happened well we had no

119
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,759
rain all right I kept waiting for there

120
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,440
to be rain in the forecast to seed this

121
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,360
area and we had a super dry Spring and

122
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,840
most of the summer as well and so I

123
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,880
didn't do anything I didn't put any seed

124
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,080
down to that point because it wasn't

125
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,520
going to be successful and there were

126
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,520
some weeds that were growing up here and

127
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,759
there and so what I did is when I came

128
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,280
back in the fall when I was planting

129
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:39,400
food plots I repeated that process I

130
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,639
tilted up one more time okay which was

131
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,400
really easy to do because i' previously

132
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,960
tilled it then I came back through and

133
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,759
used the Thatcher EG one more time just

134
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,280
to get a nice final level right cuz that

135
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,400
rake whether it's the Thatcher or the

136
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,960
landscape rake is one long plane right

137
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,479
it's at the same level and so you can

138
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,360
get a 5 foot or a 6ot or an 8ot whatever

139
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,759
size rake you want to get one grade okay

140
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,000
so it makes it much more consistent back

141
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,639
and forth to be a level surface at that

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,560
point I seated I used our Beth Co seater

143
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,360
broadcast seated this area and then I

144
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,039
use my rake one more time to kind of

145
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,520
help cover all that seed up and give it

146
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,639
the best possible chance for germination

147
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,759
did that in it was either late August or

148
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,120
early September actually that's not true

149
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,560
it was late September I got to it a

150
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
little bit late and so this is what you

151
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,039
see going on and so it the grass the

152
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,600
seedlings all got a good start for now

153
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,479
had about maybe a month or so of uh

154
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,960
decent growing conditions in the fall

155
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:35,560
and this will be great next spring and

156
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,960
in fact we actually had sprinklers put

157
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,000
in down in this area here so we'll be

158
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,600
able to irrigate this water this on a

159
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,680
regular basis and uh and maintain it

160
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,440
just like part of our yard but the same

161
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
concept the same process can be applied

162
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,400
to whether it's a little just a little

163
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,319
patch here that's what 40 by 80 ft or if

164
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,520
you're doing a two or three acre

165
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,000
renovation you don't have to do the

166
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,360
whole thing at one time you can still

167
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,840
break it down into chunks maybe a

168
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,680
quarter here and a quarter there maybe

169
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,759
get your process down right do a smaller

170
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,000
area the first time see if you're doing

171
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,800
everything in the right order the right

172
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,520
sequence that you want to do and then

173
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,199
just repeat that on the rest of it and

174
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,280
it it can make it seem like it's not an

175
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,199
insurmountable task either but I'm

176
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,080
telling

177
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,599
you the first thing you can

178
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,840
do a lot of folks don't like to spray

179
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,280
but if you can spray if you're okay with

180
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,039
that and kill all the grass and the

181
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,520
weeds that's going to weaken the root

182
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:27,919
system and make the rest of the job a

183
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,000
lot easier if you don't want to spray

184
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,720
then I would at least SC

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,800
your field or your lawn or whatever it

186
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,560
is scalp it so it's if the sun's hitting

187
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,599
it it's burning the grass and basically

188
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,960
killing it at that point and maybe scalp

189
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,919
it again if there's still anything

190
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,599
existing the idea being you want to

191
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,800
weaken those root systems as much as

192
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:46,360
possible because it's going to make your

193
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,400
life a lot easier for the rest of this

194
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,639
project so after you accomplish that

195
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,400
step that's when you come through with

196
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,360
the tiller tilling is fun it's a great

197
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,520
job I mean it's amazing the results the

198
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,400
before and after results that you can

199
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,720
get with a tiller there's no tool like

200
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,080
it it's just incredible and you think

201
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,520
they're just for putting and food plots

202
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,879
and Gardens but they're for so much more

203
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,360
we actually use it for our our driveway

204
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,360
our gravel driveway

205
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,840
installations you want to peel out top

206
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,520
soil when you're put in a driveway and

207
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,960
again to make that top soil easily

208
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,080
reusable not full of sad clumps a great

209
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,479
way to do that is to till it up first

210
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,599
right because it just makes everything

211
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,080
consistent and and and breaks down as

212
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,160
you have it sitting there in your side

213
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,000
pile then you can scoop out some bucket

214
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,160
fold and use it in different areas of

215
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,560
your of your property and different

216
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,400
projects that you have coming up instead

217
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,919
of having big of dirt that you're then

218
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,400
picking out a whole hunk of sad and have

219
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,039
to throw to the side that stuff's

220
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,080
already chopped up with the tiller so

221
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,960
they're great tools to have very handy

222
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,599
to have around and you get creative you

223
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,240
can find more ways to use it so again

224
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:44,120
after getting done tilling that's when

225
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,879
you come through with your rake do all

226
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,280
that final grading take it as far as you

227
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,440
want right I mean if it depending if

228
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,400
it's just a rough pasture if it's going

229
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,360
to be a yard you spend more or less time

230
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,960
on there depending on the application at

231
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,360
hand at that point is when you're going

232
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,440
to seed use that RI again to lightly

233
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,400
cover up the seed so it has good seed to

234
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,280
soil germination apply some water and

235
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,319
fertilizer and Away you go we are proud
