  "text": "in today's video you will learn or be refreshed about the Tom point is to grow healthier vegetables in organic garden organic gardening faces more challenges in conventional gardening methods due to a zero tolerance to harmful chemical use but it is very possible to get a higher yield in harvest because other gardening methods overlook fundamental points to a stronger crop this brings me to my first tip nitrogen fixation nitrogen fixation is a key building block to fertile soils for your vegetables pods needs the ammonia form of nitrogen for central life components like proteins and amino acids however they can't use a nitrogen which makes up 80% of the air we breathe in there for planting legumes like peas and beans will fix nitrogen in the soil by being stored in their nodes this nitrogen can then be used up by other plants require this companion plant broad beans sugar snap peas peas and other legumes with other vegetables and as a result they will promote plant growth secondly is to mulch raised beds in the autumn with a three-inch layer of either well watered mineral leaves or leaf mold and cover with the dark plastic make sure it is moist beforehand this will let earthworms and decomposers to work thoroughly at decomposing the organic matter overwinter resulting in a more fertile soil to grow vegetables in the spring and also being warmer as per plastic absorbs warmth ensure you poke a few holes to allow the flow of oxygen otherwise decomposition will not be possible if you like to see a detailed video click on the annotation above and learn the steps to success in six minutes thirdly is growing in containers this is an especially important tip if you have a small garden or even limit to a balcony but growing organic vegetables can be done in almost any situation also people with larger gardens should strive to include containers to grow some of their produce in butwhy containers make it easy to transport plants stop some becoming invasive for example mint and it can be used to grow vegetables and hard surfaces for example on a patio on a trellis which will Aksum eyes yells containers don't have to be plastic they can easily assemble together wooden plant boxes or make hanging baskets out of dowels to grow cherry tomatoes the possibility is endless my fourth tip is to work with nature by attracting beneficial insects such as pollinators or both which will help keep pests numbers down I strongly suggest you devote at least 10 percent of your space to attracting beneficial insects that is not mean to simply plant flowers as you can still use the plants you grow as food barrage is one well-known flowering herb which both attracts dozens of beneficial insects but you can also add the leaves and flowers to salads a colorful way to bring pollinators is to grow a flower border consisting of herbs of the likes of marjoram mint and borage along with corn flowers and buckwheat this will create a paradise for visiting bees and why not create a movable paradise for example planting in a bucket or a wheelbarrow and being able to move it around your garden the fifth and final tip for growing organic vegetables is to get ahead of the game with weeds as organic vegetable gardening is against the use of chemical weed sprays it can only take a few weeks to get overrun by them weeds unfortunately will always outgrow vegetables originally all vegetables are weeds but after thousands of years of cultivation they're weaker therefore weeds will win their battle for space but there are plenty of methods will which will help you get that vital step ahead of the game my personal favorite method is mulching using up the abundance of free resources for example leaves cardboard and grass clippings we can source from our own backyard in the house or in your local park this fall collect leaves and in the spring you can use them to place in between the rows of plants stopping light to hit the bare patches of ground and also adding nutrients as they slowly decompose add a two to three inch layer and repeats when you see weeds poking through another great mulch is wood chippings which you can get for free or for a very cheap price at a local sawmill black plastic is a less aesthetically appealing method however you get great results when we used it on our squashes and you can see that video by finding the link in the description I hope you found this video interesting and I would love to know what your top tips are so please post them down below in the comment section I thank you very much for watching and I'll see you again soon in another video remember don't panic and grow organic",
