  "text": "[Music] when you think of chicken farms you might picture chickens crammed into small tight cages according to the food and agriculture organization in 2023 there were about 34.4 billion chickens raised globally the majority of these chickens are pushed to lay up to 300 eggs per year under harsh conditions a world where chickens roam free living in harmony with nature might sound like a far-fetched dream but this is actually happening in some parts of China in the mountainous regions of guong Province a special method of raising chickens has existed for many years [Music] among the freerange chicken breeds thriving in yanan the yanan chicken is renowned as one of the eight best chicken breeds in Southeast Asia these chickens are muscular and easily recognized by their distinctive golden feathers thanks to their organic corn diet they mature after 4 to 5 months of roaming the hills and typically weigh around 2.5 to 3 Kg besides Yang Shan chickens other breeds living at altitudes between 800 1,500 m above sea level are also raised in these Highland [Music] regions the Stark difference between raising freerange chickens and caged chickens lies in their living conditions freerange chickens spend their lives wandering the hills basking in the Sun and foraging for food leading a natural life that boosts both their physical and mental health however they don't lay as many eggs producing only around 100 to 120 eggs per year and the eggs are smaller weighing about 40 to 45 G each but these eggs are more flavorful and packed with omega-3 fatty acids vitamins and minerals the chicken's active lifestyle also results in better tasting meat which turns a bright golden color when cooked [Music] the Journey of raising Mountain chickens begins with high quality eggs from reputable hatcheries or Farms the ideal temperature for incubating eggs is around 99. 5\u00b0 f with humidity levels between 55% and 70% it takes about 21 days for the eggs to hatch in large scale hatching operations like those in minching County halong Jang Province China up to 400,000 chicks are hatched each year a significant increase from just 70,000 chicks 5 years [Music] ago once hatched the chicks are usually transferred to well ventilated coups Farmers prepare the CPS with 7 to 10 cm of sterilized straw or husks for insul and warmth a coupe of around 3 S M can hold about 100 chicks during their first 2 to 3 weeks since chicks can't regulate their body temperature effectively constant lighting keeps them warm enough to eat and drink Farmers provide them with clean warm water mixed with electrolytes and 6 to eight small meals a day the chicks are still fragile so farmers keep everything clean washing the feeding troughs twice daily and giving them medicine as prescribed by a vet [Music] [Music] as the chicks grow organic food sources such as greens and grass are introduced so they can get accustomed to Mountain foraging on favorable weather days the chickens are released to the hills early in the morning morning and spend most of their day there Farmers often Monitor and live stream their chickens to build an online customer base and boost sales the hills where the chickens roam are scattered with trees providing shade and opportunities for the chickens to perch play and catch insects the chicken's diet is as buried as their environment and during the summer Farmers hardly need to feed them since grasshoppers are abundant some Farmers even get creative by encouraging the chickens to run more by feeding them behind a moving [Music] vehicle studies from our world and data have shown that freerange chickens experience 57% to 70% less pain and suffering compared to cage chickens recognizing the benefits of Freer range f farming the European Union plans to ban the use of any type of cages by 2027 to encourage egg laying Farmers create simple nests from bamboo wood or leaves in the mountainous regions of tanan in northern China more than 50,000 freerange chickens roam across 200 hectares of Hills laying eggs in around 30 chicken CPS built right on the mountain tops the CPS and sleeping areas are often designed to save space and mimic the mountain Terrain [Music] [Music] the most chickens prefer to lay eggs and nests some might choose to lay under a tree or directly on the ground to ensure no eggs are missed check the grps and roaming areas twice daily to collect the eggs Farmers with around 7,000 chiens can Harvest up to 9,400 eggs per day despite the large quantities manual labor remains High provide employment to local World communities after collection the eggs go through a simple inspection and gring process to protect the natural prot coating on your shelves receiving only a light cleaning workers carefully place the eggs into paper of plastic trays to ensure they are well protected during transport these trays are then loaded onto trucks and delivered to local markets or preordered customers [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] large scale freerange egg producers often have on-site packing facilities capable of packing up to 74,000 eggs from all nearby Farms these fresh highquality eggs are then distributed to supermarkets and retail stores where consumers are willing to pay a premium offer from $3 to $4 per de in comparison P eggs May cost only $125 to $2 per dozen during unfavorable we such as extreme heat or Cal the chickens are brought indoors to ensure their comfort and health inside large groups still provide enough space for them to stress their legs perch on platforms and interact with each other a typical prange chicken and comfortably C about 600 chickens some Farmers prepare fresh daily combining lovely B ingredients from the hills with these pets and of course regular fresh water for these chicken [Music] the location of freerange farms is carefully selected to minimize the risk of predation however in some cases natural Predators such as Hawks and foxes can pose a threat to protect their chickens Farmers remove bushes and potential hiding spots for Predators around the coups they also build sturdy fences and regularly check the surrounding areas for signs of Predator activity if predators are caught they are either sold or consumed the exact weight of chickens at Harvest varies by breed but Freer range chickens typically weigh between 1.8 and 2.4 kg although lighter than caged chickens free-range chickens have more muscle and less fat thank you for reading our newsletter if you enjoyed this Edition don't forget to hit
