00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,880
hey hey everybody it's jeff from cackle

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,480
hatchery i wanted to talk a little bit

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,440
about some tips today when you get your

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,840
baby chicks from cackle hatchery uh they

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,519
arrive in boxes kind of like this or

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,320
they might be bigger

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,240
our main topic today though is making

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,080
sure you get your baby chicks off to a

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,240
good start

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,640
there's a big difference between

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,599
hatching out baby chicks at home under a

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,800
hen

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,720
or an incubator versus getting mail

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,040
order checks okay

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,840
chicks that have hatched at a hatchery

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,760
or the chicks that go to feed stores uh

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,879
you know they've been through two days

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,520
of of transit so they have lost some

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:48,000
body mass they've been stressed and they

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,640
require a lot lot more heat on arrival

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,360
than let's say you're taking some chicks

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,360
out of your incubator okay so there's a

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,199
big difference on how you want to start

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,359
your baby chicks out

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,000
when you're getting a mail order uh baby

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,239
chicks through the mail so

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,239
we

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,640
say that you have to have in order to

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,720
have success

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,880
you need a brooder reflector lamp

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,960
something like this one it's got a guard

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,799
that you take off and put on it so if it

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,080
ever happens to drop it won't start a

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,840
fire

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,840
these are relatively cheap you pick

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,880
these up anywhere

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,600
we really recommend to have a

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,479
a red bulb you can have a light

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,119
uh bulb if you want to but these will

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,799
put out the uh and warm the air around

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,880
the chicks not only

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,159
warm the chicks but warm the air around

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,600
the check

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,159
we usually recommend 125 watt for every

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,079
25 chicks and then of course they got to

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,119
have a lot of room to get away from the

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,320
heat

48
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,159
but you want about a hundred 105 degrees

49
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,960
at the floor level

50
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,399
for the baby chicks so uh when they

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,960
arrive

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,079
their body temperature is

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,479
is low and they don't have it in them to

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,439
raise their body temperature up so their

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,200
normal temperature is around 104

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,720
so you've got to figure out and

57
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,840
artificially

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,480
warm their bodies up to that temperature

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,040
so they'll start getting active starting

60
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,400
to eat and drink so that's real

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,680
important so

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,319
may order chicks require a lot more heat

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,879
than if you're taking chicks out of your

64
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,200
brooder or out from underneath your hen

65
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,640
if you have a gqf these are really good

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,599
brooders too for mail order chicks

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,760
it has a heating element in here that

68
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,480
heats up really hot

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,560
and uh it's got a thermostat on it

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,319
and so you know if all your chicks are

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,920
huddled right here

72
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,160
they're too cold

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,640
if the chicks are kind of sleeping

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,120
around this area they're just right if

75
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,480
all your chicks are way up to the front

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,720
of the brooder

77
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,840
then it's too hot and you need to lower

78
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,200
the temperature so as your chicks grow

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,640
they're going to take less and less

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,680
temperature

81
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,800
now

82
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,840
after

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
five

84
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,319
generally more like seven to ten days

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,680
you want to try to figure out a heat

86
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,159
source that does not produce a light

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,440
okay so we want to get your chicks off

88
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,640
of having 24 7 light so

89
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,799
this is where these come in handy

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,280
uh after seven to ten days uh

91
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,640
you know you could install one of these

92
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,560
for the chicks

93
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,560
i've got several different brands here

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
there's other brands i'm not trying to

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,599
leave out any other brands it's just

96
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,799
that these heat plates do not heat the

97
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,840
air

98
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,239
and they're a lower temperature

99
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,519
and they don't produce a light so that's

100
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,640
good later on but you cannot use these

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,360
on arrival for baby chicks

102
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,439
i mean i'm you you can have

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,840
success but you've gotten really lucky

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,799
if you have in the past so

105
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,120
these are more for chicks after uh

106
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,040
you know like i said seven to ten days

107
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,640
for mail order chicks if you've got an

108
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
incubator at home and you're hatching

109
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,200
your chicks out

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,840
you can probably have success with these

111
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,799
uh but we got one brand here there's

112
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,239
another

113
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,400
brand

114
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,080
basically again it's a heat plate that

115
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,520
does not produce

116
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,759
a heat source that heats the air

117
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,639
so but there's several different brands

118
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,919
here

119
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,240
so the theme of this short video is

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,600
for mail or chicks we're not talking

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,440
about when you're hatching at home we're

122
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,280
talking about when you are ordering

123
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,400
chicks through the mail day old baby

124
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
chicks

125
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,240
you cannot start them off with a heat

126
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,919
plate like these okay

127
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,320
they have to have

128
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,080
you know a good heat source that's gonna

129
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,280
heat the air around them

130
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
and uh

131
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,360
so

132
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,280
that's uh

133
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,000
the theme of this uh

134
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,000
video and we thank you for listening

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,199
this is jeff at cackle hatchery hope you

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,199
have a blessed week
