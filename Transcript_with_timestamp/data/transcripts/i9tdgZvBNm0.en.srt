00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,140
okay

11
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,800

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,800
on hey big big

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,739
ready for breakfast

14
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,260
some of you might wonder how pigs keep

15
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,720
warm

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,720
when it's cold outside if they're not

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,460
in some sort of a shelter

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,680
they do that by building themselves

19
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,420
nests you can see

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,799
well I'm not sure how well it shows up

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,900
on the video but

22
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,820
there's where one of the pigs spent the

23
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,020
night and the ground is literally

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,840
steaming

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,380
because it's so warm compared to

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,380
outside

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,340
so they dig themselves in

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,680
used a bunch of old grass and

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,900
debris from the trees there

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,479
and it's just steaming step stayed warm

31
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,119
over here I have straw you can see some

32
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,500
here there I just have straw spread

33
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,180
around the

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,759
Forest here in different areas for them

35
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,340
and they'll get themselves all nice and

36
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,979
cozy and that helps keep them warm it

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,439
insulates them from the

38
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:05,479
from the ground but yeah

39
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,479
they're able to keep warm

40
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,780
as long as they have

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,580
a proper amount of feed

42
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,520
to feed their

43
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,520
system they can keep themselves warm
