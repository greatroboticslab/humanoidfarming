  "text": "what's going on everyone it's joe to loan more back with another video today i want to talk about gardens and how to water them efficiently in a process that i love to do i've had it for years now and i absolutely love it so let's get started [Music] so the process that i'm going to talk about today is right here in these three raised beds right here it's called drip irrigation now i did a video on this last year i think it was too much of an in-depth video it's very simple to do very easy to do anybody can hook this up you have plenty of options out there to get this stuff you can get them on amazon you can get it at home depot or lowe's i got my stuff right at home depot um so if you run out of something you can go get it bring it back and put it together so right here is a perfect example of drip irrigation you can see right here we have these emitters right here i'll show you how i've run it to this to the sprays bed here in a second but what these emitters are they what they do is they drip every six inches to 12 inches depending on the style that you get and what you can find but what's really great is just a little bit of a droplet that basically drops into your garden a little bit at a time and that way it controls the flow of what's coming out into your beds the great thing about drip irrigation is it can hook right to your faucet to the side of your house as you can see here i have a melnor water timer i've had this for probably three or four seasons now haven't had a problem with it as you can see here i have two different settings right here on my melnor water timer i have the one here this is for actually the drip irrigation line you can see here this is the half inch pipe that comes with it it goes into a obviously you want to have a backflow provider on there and then this one's a two port they also sell four port if you're interested in that if you're interested in above ground irrigation these things are really great you can set them up to four different cycles meaning four different times of the day they can come on this is a two zone obviously has a manual off and on so if you wanna if you see a little bit of a dry spot in your garden and it doesn't the timer you know comes on at a certain time and you want to hit that a little bit extra you can have a manual on off i've done a full in-depth video on the 4-port one i show you how to set it up i'll leave that link below it's a very popular video because it is a little confusing when you first set these up but again i have my drip irrigation right here my half inch pipe it runs down and it basically what happens is that half inch pipe right there runs right along everything that you want the half inch pipe that i have runs right along the bottom of my uh mulch bed right here and then it goes all the way back into my garden and then from there you can branch off to various things so let me tell you let me explain to you what i mean by how branches off of that so this is the half inch pipe that you can buy it obviously you real you really need this this is what connects to the timer that i showed you behind me uh there's a couple different fittings that you can get very easy to figure out so i'm not going to go in super in depth i just want to give you guys the basic idea of how the drip irrigation works but basically this half inch line is what i use as my main line and then from there i branch off to everything the shrub right here behind me the rose bush has is branched off of this to a nice emitter that feeds it regularly on schedule every day so that's why these rose bushes right here behind me they look really great all my shrubs always look really great throughout the time of the year because i'm always branching off of these half inch pipes right here so what you want to buy is one of these hole punchers right here and then all you got to do is punch puncture a hole right into the tubing right here i have a couple right here but there see there you go and then from there you can branch off to wherever you want to go so obviously there's a bunch of different accessories that you can get you have some of these right here these are some different fittings there's a 90 degree in here there's a uh there's a t in here so if you want to branch off the two different spots you can and then from here these are the drip emitters right here uh actually the company that makes them is called dig i think these ones are sold at home depot but as you can see here this bag right here has a 10 pack and it does uh it does two gallons per hour so i really don't go off the the gallons per hour thing i just kind of judge what my plants are doing if i think my plants need a little bit more water then i'm going to upgrade the timer if i think they're getting too much maybe i'll down the timer just things like that i don't get too carried carried away with the gallons per hour i've used these emitters here for years now and they've worked just fine so what you want to do is you want to branch off of your half inch line right here so what you want to do is use one of these little guys right here basically what this does is goes into one of the holes right here just like so and then from there with another accessory that you need to buy is these micro tubes now again these micro tubes they're a lot smaller i don't exactly know what diameter is but you can see it's a lot smaller so basically what you do they come in a roll i forget exactly probably 25 50 feet something like that you buy this then all you got to do is snip it to how long you want same thing with the tubing you can snip it they have end caps on here as well i juice use regular uh clippers that you use for pecs this works really great to snap these off either or you can use anything you want um but the pack but the pex clippers work really great for this again it has an end cap it cut you have to buy that separately it has an end cap so the water ain't you know obviously squirting out the other end but from going back to your emitter right here this is what i was talking about each of my shrubs or each of my garden strips that i have i branch off so again i have my adapter on here i take my micro tubing now sometimes this micro tubing doesn't go on easily so what i like to do is i like to use a torch something like this and if you have something even bigger you can use one of these guys and all you got to do is heat up the tubing a little bit and then from there you can put on whatever you want so if i'm going to branch off to say a shrub i have my micro tube branch off of the half inch line then on the other end i'm going to take my drip emitter right here i'm going to throw that guy on and there you go i have one of these again i'm going to show you in a second all my flower beds so oh my plants are getting water just like this drip right off the half inch line don't have to worry about don't have to worry about getting a sprinkler out you don't have to worry about throwing your hose out there ordering anything by hand you just have the water timer on and you're good to go so again i have this system all along this flower bed right here all the way down each plant is getting a drip emitter just like this right off the half inch line so just imagine this on the ground right here that that half inch tubing right there is running all along down the front side of my house and then it's branching off to this shrub right here it's branching off to this shrub right here and then again all the way down so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to flip it on and show you guys what the drip irrigation looks like in the garden we're gonna put it on for 15 minutes just so you guys can see what it looks like and just like that it's flowing through so let's go show you so we're back out back now and as i said this half inch line it runs literally right along the edge of the fence all the way down the fence line and into the back of the three beds back there and then from there again we just branch off you can either use one of these drip emitters like i have on the end of here or you could use the drip emitters where it drips like every six inches or 12 inches depending on what kind of style you can find so right here is a perfect example of the drip emitter right here this is a blueberry bush right from hamilton new jersey and as you can see i have my branch my line goes way down this way again that half inch line just goes underneath all the way down and we're just branching off and as you can see we have the drip emitter right here and it's just feeding this bush right here and then again we have one all along here to feed all the other blueberry bushes some are underground some are above ground it doesn't really matter it's going to get fed so here's a perfect example of the drip emitter right here the one that's every six inches as you can see it's literally just dripping just a little bit at a time and we have this all through our three raised beds i have an actual half inch here in the middle as well because the half inch obviously more water is going to come out of that than these little drip emitters right here but these drip emitters right here are a lifesaver it really does make gardening so much easier you have your timer set up it's so much easier to do you don't got to get out there with the hose anymore you just put it up on that timer and you're good to go i'm going to show you those three raised beds right here and then we'll finish up the video and again here you go we have the drip emitters right here this one i believe is it spaced out to 12 inches i'm not 100 sure again you might have to go online and buy these ones sometimes you don't always get these ones in store the ones that are the six inch or the 12 inch emitters i believe i got mine on either amazon or on brain bird's website i believe i got on rain bird's website before i'm not 100 sure um if i can find it i'll leave it linked below for you guys to go check it out an affiliate free link for you guys um and again this is a lifesaver and there you guys have it a quick video on drip irrigation and why i love it it's really awesome it's really easy to do if you have any questions on today's video leave it down in the comment section below i'll help you out go check out my video from last year as well if you're still interested in more learning more about your drip irrigation again if you're going to get in the garden if you're going to have raised beds like we have right here these three big ones and we have ones over there or you want to keep your shrubs and your plants and your different rose bushes or whatever you have irrigated drip irrigation is the way to go you hook it up it's worry free goes on the timer comes on goes off you're good to go if you found today's content helpful or if you enjoyed today's content make sure you smash that like button it really does help out with the channel if you're interested in any of my other content check me out on instagram check me out on tik tok and until next time guys i'll see you in the next one [Music]
