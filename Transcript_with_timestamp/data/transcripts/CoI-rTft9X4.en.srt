very important thing that we all can do

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,640
is to get this love of gardening down

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,619
through the younger kids

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,720

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,180
here with the screen now because I've

42
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,520
had you raising your hand and so on if

43
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,920
you have questions along the way you can

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,380
go ahead anywhere along the line to type

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,380
your question into the chat pod that's

46
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,780
that little white area usually on the

47
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,640
left of your screen or it is on mine and

48
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,380
we'll try to track that so that we

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,380

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,819

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,060
would be okay with you following up

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,040

thanks Julie that's really nice of you

00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:42,000
to absolutely really nice to be here we

90
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,120
have such a nice group of folks with us

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,940
today so I'm kind of excited to tell

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,500
everyone about the opportunity in

93
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,400
growing herbs

94
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:57,720
uh this first slide here is my son and I

95
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,180
in our high tunnel filled with uh basil

96
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,220
and right now the high tunnel doesn't

97
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,799
look like that it's just a black dirt

98
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,120
but it has been tilled and it's

99
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,220
anxiously awaiting

100
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,739
um some seeds

101
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,920
growing your old herbs can be a great

102
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,739
way to enhance your home cooking or it

103
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,820
can be a way to create additional sales

104
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:23,940
for your agriculture-based business

105
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:26,820
herbs are a niche market so you have to

106
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,820
know that you have the right place to

107
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:33,180
sell them or the right Market to Market

108
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,759
to If you're looking at adding them to

109
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,800
your agriculture business

110
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:39,479
but they certainly even if you are not

111
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,060
selling at a farmer's market or pick

112
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:44,940
your own or through a CSA they certainly

113
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,520
are a great way to enhance your home

114
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,280
cooking and they have great nutritional

115
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,740
value as well besides your cooking

116
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,800
there's a lot of other ways that you can

117
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,620
grow and use herbs in your everyday life

118
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,040
some of them besides the cooking include

119
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,780
of course pea and beverages there are a

120
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,900
lot of herbal teas on the market right

121
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,060
now to kind of give you ideas on what

122
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,280
can be used but many of those things you

123
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,180
see in those pea mixes can be grown on

124
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,419
your own

125
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,120
there are of course medicinal herbs that

126
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:21,419
can be used in cosmetics in in bath

127
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,180
bombs and facials and soaps and all

128
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:28,320
sorts of cosmetic items just for the

129
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:31,500
aroma itself such as potpourri's or even

130
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,080
we often have people buy Bunches of

131
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,880
Basil from us just to take home and put

132
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,280
them in a base and put them on their

133
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,100
counter because the the smell is so

134
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,800
lovely and of course just the beauty and

135
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,539
Aesthetics whether that is the beauty of

136
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,419
growing them in your garden because they

137
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:50,300
are quite beautiful or using them around

138
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:54,240
the home such as

139
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,360
Reeds or door swags or decorations so

140
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,900
there's many uses for herbs

141
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,360
that you can grow quite easily

142
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:07,740
some of the common herbs that we think

143
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:12,240
of most often of course are basal stage

144
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:15,000
Thyme and cilantro and that's what's

145
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,160
represented in the pictures here the

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,780
upper left with my hands that of course

147
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,600
is basil to the right of that is Sage

148
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,160
below the sage is the cilantro and to

149
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,900
the left of that is time so kind of

150
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,639
working clockwise wise around that

151
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,620
picture you know it's quite interesting

152
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,380
because right now

153
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,259
um where I'm at South of rugby close to

154
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,240
Esmond we still have lots of snow and

155
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,699
and there are places where there are

156
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,340
three or more feet of snow on the ground

157
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,620
still and we're just starting to get a

158
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,720
little bit of open space and and bear

159
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,319
dirt back again but in my production

160
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:57,539
field the sage and the time

161
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,039
um because they were green and with the

162
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:02,280
straw mulch like you see in the picture

163
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,900
underneath the snow they tended to warm

164
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,840
up a little bit faster than the

165
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,960
surrounding uh bare dirt and so they are

166
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,199
out there up and looking good and sage

167
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,880
and time are actually perennial they

168
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,819
will come back year after year and

169
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,460
they're also evergreen or semi Evergreen

170
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:24,180
so if I wanted to today I could walk out

171
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,340
and pick some nice fresh sage and Thyme

172
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,259
and add them to my supper tonight which

173
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,340
is is kind of a

174
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:34,080
added bonus to having that really early

175
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:37,199
green stuff in your garden is being able

176
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,020
to taste that right away in the spring

177
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,599
other common herbs again starting from

178
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,840
the upper left you might think that's

179
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,300
Dill but it's not that's actually fennel

180
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,039
leaf many times when we're cooking with

181
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,900
fennel we think of the fennel bulb

182
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,340
fennel bulbs are a little bit more

183
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,740
difficult to do here in North Dakota

184
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,840
because they take such a long season it

185
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,360
can be done but they're long season but

186
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,259
it's on a leaf will add just as much

187
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,840
flavor to your cooking and Aroma and

188
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:10,440
they make a really nice filler flower in

189
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,900
arrangements so we grow a fair amount of

190
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,720
fennel Leaf here at the farm to the

191
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,819
right of that is the Rosemary our

192
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,800
Rosemary plugs should be coming in on

193
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,539
Friday so I'll have Rosemary to

194
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,720
transplant on Saturday

195
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:28,919
below the Rosemary in the lower right is

196
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,919
a Greek oregano it's another perennial

197
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:34,080
the Greek oregano is and that also is

198
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,360
out in the field up green looking good

199
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,580
and if I wanted to make some spaghetti

200
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,580
sauce this weekend which I think I just

201
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:45,779
might I could run out and pick some

202
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:49,560
fresh green oregano in the left and the

203
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:53,279
lower left is mint of course and mint

204
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:57,060
has many many uses uh in cooking and

205
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:59,820
around the home and in Aesthetics

206
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,180
so there are a few general rules when

207
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,980
growing herbs that kind of go across the

208
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,260
board no matter what variety you're

209
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,700
growing most of them like Sunny

210
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,940
locations

211
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,720
and if you think about herbs and there

212
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,279
and their purpose and what they're like

213
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,720
we like herbs because they smell and

214
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,820
they taste good and they smell and they

215
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,160
taste good because they have a high

216
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:29,100
amount of oil in them and the more sun

217
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,740
that herb has the more concentrated that

218
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,600
oil is going to become within the herbs

219
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,760
so it's going to have better flavor and

220
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,580
it will actually do much better in Sunny

221
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,480
locations for most herbs most herbs also

222
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:46,800
like well-drained soil no mint really

223
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:50,100
kind of likes a moist soil not soggy but

224
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,160
moist it certainly likes its share of

225
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,920
water but other than the mint most of

226
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,060
them really on the dry side is fine for

227
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,120
most of them

228
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,980
most herbs do not need large amounts of

229
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,800
fertilizer or need to be fertilized

230
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,899
again going back to you know what

231
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,019
doesn't kill us makes us stronger and

232
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:12,000
it's the oil in the herb that we want to

233
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:16,260
be very concentrated to give it the best

234
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,899
flavor and Aroma and you will get that

235
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,120
in uh in a plant that is struggling just

236
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:24,660
a little bit and we certainly don't want

237
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,399
to plant them in hard pan clay but you

238
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,800
you don't need to worry about too much

239
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,720
fertilizer either

240
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,000
um there are a lot of herbs that are

241
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,160
well suited for containers so if you

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,279
don't have a spot in your garden or a

243
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,440
production lot or a large space and you

244
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,660
just want to add them to containers on

245
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,079
your deck or your patio there are many

246
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:48,360
many varieties out there that are well

247
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,240
suited to container growth

248
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,779
some of the myths or semi myths that are

249
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,579
out there about growing herbs is that

250
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,380
most herbs should be picked right away

251
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,399
in the morning right after the duo is

252
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,300
gone

253
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,000
um

254
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,000
while I agree with that and it's a semi

255
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,540
miss for you know I agree with it to a

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,519
certain degree it's not always true what

257
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,459
you do want to avoid

258
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,459
is the heat of the afternoon you know

259
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:20,100
don't go out on a 100 degree day when

260
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:22,620
the sun is blasting down on things and

261
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,380
pick the herbs then because they are

262
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,720
very much like us plants are

263
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,779
um they have stoma they open and in the

264
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,339
same way we sweat they transpire and

265
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:34,740
along with that moisture leaving the

266
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,540
plant will be that oil that I've been

267
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,339
talking about that gives it good flavor

268
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,100
and

269
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,660
um good aroma so picking them when it's

270
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,660
a little cooler whether that's in the

271
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:49,320
morning or in the evening is fine to

272
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,480
stay away from that heat of the day

273
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,300
there's another myth out there that says

274
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,519
oh you know it's it's blooming so I

275
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,800
can't I can't eat it or it's not going

276
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,339
to taste as good

277
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:06,480
honestly most herb flowers are edible we

278
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:09,720
make a Great Sage pesto with sage

279
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,000
flowers when it's In Bloom here and it

280
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,500
really would take an extremely refined

281
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,899
palette

282
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,279
um to for a person to taste the

283
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,279
difference between an herb that was

284
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,140
celery and one that was not

285
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,660
so if you keep harvesting of course it's

286
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,880
going to delay that flowering but

287
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,860
actually if if you've gone on vacation

288
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,959
and you come home and you find that your

289
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,019
herbs oh my goodness while I was gone

290
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,660
they started flowering don't let that

291
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:41,940
stop you go ahead continue harvesting

292
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:44,220
and using and eating those herbs anyway

293
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,139
um and the last one at downright live

294
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,139
when using the followers pick them

295
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:52,019
before they're fully open honestly they

296
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:53,700
will have a a better flavor if you pick

297
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:56,579
them a little bit more in blood stage

298
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,139
with any flour the longer it's open the

299
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:00,600
more it declines

300
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:03,060
um and and loses bigger and flavor so if

301
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,980
you are going to eat the flowers

302
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,899
um actually eating them or picking them

303
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,519
choosing them when they're on the more

304
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,519
of a bud stage is better

305
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,300
excuse me

306
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:18,000
um so growing herbs for season long

307
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,579
sales what you need to consider is you

308
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,639
will need to plant them in succession

309
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:25,560
a lot of times people with our other

310
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,360
garden plants our Flowers and Things

311
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,339
They go out and we plant our Marigolds

312
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,800
in the spring and that lasts us all

313
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,680
season long and that's great but if you

314
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,980
are actually in the business of growing

315
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,779
herbs for sale you're probably going to

316
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,519
want especially culinary herbs you're

317
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,980
probably going to want them to plant

318
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,100
them in succession in other words you're

319
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,160
going to plant the seeds or the plants

320
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:53,160
more than one time and this is

321
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,740
specifically true of annual herbs not so

322
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,839
much The Perennial ones but annual herbs

323
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,399
and we're talking about the basil Dill

324
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,740
cilantro

325
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,500
those sorts of herbs that are very

326
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,540
fleshy they grow very fast and you want

327
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,620
them to be nice and succulent

328
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:12,660
keeping records is extremely important

329
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:15,600
and those records will help you from

330
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:19,860
year to year remember okay I planted my

331
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,320
first basil seeds on May 15th and I

332
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,540
planted the next seeds three weeks later

333
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,279
and oh guess what that was a little too

334
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,519
close together maybe I should move them

335
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,560
now everyone's growing situation is a

336
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,200
little bit different so it's extremely

337
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,660
important that you keep records of your

338
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,839
own plantings so you can gear it towards

339
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,760
your microclimate and your soil

340
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,920
um one of the things I like to express

341
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,560
to people is don't over buy seeds

342
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,279
although most herb seeds will last

343
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,519
several years without losing a great

344
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:56,279
amount of germination power

345
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:58,320
it really is unnecessary it adds

346
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,680
unnecessary expense to your bottom line

347
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,019
to over buy those seeds

348
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,699
we did you know for years I've over

349
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:08,579
bought seed and I've carried seed over

350
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:12,480
from years year to year but this last

351
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:15,000
year and I'm we really couldn't get a

352
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,699
couple of our varieties to grow to save

353
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,279
my soul I kept succession planting and

354
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:23,579
succession planting and they just were

355
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:25,320
not doing well and finally I kind of ran

356
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:27,300
a germination test on the seat I was

357
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,760
using and looked at the package and went

358
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,740
well no wonder it's a couple years old I

359
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,800
ordered fresh seed and for the rest of

360
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,500
the season we did fine so I really would

361
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,420
um suggest ordering only the seeds that

362
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,820
you need for a year

363
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,980
with herbs you will always have a time

364
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:46,560
when you must either find an alternate

365
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,260
use for them or compost them it's the

366
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,899
nature of things

367
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,880
I prefer when I can to find an alternate

368
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:56,579
use for them of course you know at the

369
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,620
end of the season we might have a whole

370
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:01,980
lot of Basil left over it's just been

371
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:05,279
that kind of a good growing Year I'll go

372
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,800
out you know gather bunches and make up

373
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,720
a lot of pesto and freezes there are

374
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,180
some of our other herbs that I'll gather

375
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,639
together and make wreaths for around the

376
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,339
house or sell them at local trade shows

377
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,680
or craft fairs give them away for gifts

378
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,120
we've done that a lot we've gone out and

379
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,180
harvested at the end of the season

380
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:28,500
everything we could before the first

381
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:32,459
first Frost and dried them and made all

382
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,260
sorts of holiday gifts with them but if

383
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:37,019
you can't do that you're going to end up

384
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,759
composting them it's just kind of the

385
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,459
nature of the way it goes you end up

386
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,800
with more green matter than you can

387
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,060
then you can take care of or find a

388
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,060
market for

389
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:50,459
so being creative and finding those new

390
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,920
markets for leftovers in the field is

391
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:55,139
really important and being creative you

392
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,720
may be like us

393
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,820
growing and selling culinary herbs or

394
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,980
cooking herbs but you might just find

395
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,380
yourself at the end of the season or the

396
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,860
middle of the Season making some

397
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,380
potpourri or making some other products

398
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:12,540
so that you are using what you're

399
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,020
growing to the best Advantage for you

400
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,020
and your business

401
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,280
when you're looking at season long sales

402
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,980
you might find that it's not profitable

403
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,260
to begin your sales until your biggest

404
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,140
seller is ready and I'll give you an

405
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:32,100
example of that with Garden dwellers

406
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:34,620
Farm our biggest seller is basil and

407
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,200
although as I mentioned I have stage and

408
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,539
Thyme and oregano out there that are

409
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,340
looking good and you all if you've grown

410
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:43,020
them before you know that those chives

411
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,360
are going to be up and looking good in a

412
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,360
few weeks here you know so we would have

413
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,740
product to sell in a matter of two to

414
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,559
three weeks

415
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,700
our biggest seller is basil and that

416
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,340
will be ready

417
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,980
for another month and a half to two

418
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,220
months and and so it's just not worth

419
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,900
our time and the travel to get to our

420
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,880
markets

421
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,220
um it's not profitable for us to begin

422
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,220
our sales for the year or for this

423
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:14,220
season until our biggest seller is ready

424
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,620
so you want to capitalize on the season

425
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:20,580
of the year that works out best for your

426
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:23,820
production methods and your crops

427
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:26,280
you can also use your herbs as an ad on

428
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,080
sale to other products or someone else's

429
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,780
and it's a great way to increase your

430
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,500
profits when we were selling at farmers

431
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:37,440
markets we love uh being next to the the

432
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,020
big produce vendor next to us because we

433
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,880
would talk to them and say okay what's

434
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,620
coming into season next week and they

435
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,620
say oh next week is going to be the

436
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:50,160
first week for broccoli so you can bet

437
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:54,720
but that next week we would have a

438
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:58,080
recipe along with us for broccoli and

439
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,980
some herb or you know we'd have a recipe

440
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:05,280
for corn and corn and tarragon when that

441
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:07,500
came into season and always playing off

442
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,200
of what else is in the market can

443
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,799
increase your sales another way to do

444
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,840
that would be if you are maybe growing

445
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,360
and selling

446
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,860
[Music]

447
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,440
um

448
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:22,559
home decorations like swags and wreaths

449
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,740
and things like that many herbs have

450
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:30,660
dual uses you might only be doing the

451
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,660
the home craft or home decorations but

452
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:37,080
Anna's hiccup is also a great tea herb

453
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:40,140
and maybe your neighbor or someone else

454
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,860
at the market is is selling dried tea

455
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:46,140
mixtures and you can work with them to

456
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,419
sell them your product that they could

457
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,520
make into theirs or maybe there's

458
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:53,340
somebody that's making soap and and they

459
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,280
want mint in their silk so work with

460
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,799
others around you for those add-on sales

461
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,440
or those additional sales that you can

462
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,320
use your product in more ways than maybe

463
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,760
what you're just focusing on

464
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,559
so

465
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,600
um if that's your goal remember to focus

466
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:12,840
on only those that are are well known

467
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,419
easy to grow and easy to sell it's

468
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,520
difficult sometimes with herbs that are

469
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:19,740
going to give you trouble

470
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,900
to to get them to grow and make them

471
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,640
extremely marketable

472
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,240
I do want to say a little bit about

473
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,700
medicinal herbs I getting away from

474
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,940
medicinal herbs most medicinal herbs

475
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,460
have not had clinical trials

476
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,500
and you use all herbs at your own risk

477
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,080
some herbs can have adverse reactions

478
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:43,200
with other medications standardized

479
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,840
doses have not been set for herbs and so

480
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,220
you're never sure if you are taking too

481
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,500
much or too little

482
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,720
the potency of herbs can vary greatly

483
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,000
depending upon the growing conditions

484
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,000
and the environment these are some of

485
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,220
the reasons that I personally have kind

486
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,880
of stayed away from the medicinal herb

487
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:05,220
Market I really encourage you to have a

488
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,460
great level of knowledge in education if

489
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:11,640
you're going into that area

490
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,500
however there are a few herbs that have

491
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,260
been

492
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,539
scientifically proven to to be of health

493
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,280
benefit

494
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:23,460
echinacea is one it goes to the immune

495
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:26,100
system garlic is good for the heart and

496
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:29,820
cholesterol ginseng is also good for the

497
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:32,159
heart St John's Wort Ginkgo and parsley

498
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,140
Believe It or Not which contains very

499
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:39,419
high levels of iron they've all been

500
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:42,720
proven to be a benefit to your health so

501
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:46,080
I I encourage you if you are going into

502
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,120
the medicinal herb area to have a great

503
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,419
amount of Education a great amount of

504
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,820
knowledge do your scientific research

505
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:55,980
um and be very careful about any claims

506
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,000
you might make we don't want to be out

507
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,039
there

508
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,740
um making false claims with anything

509
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,240
that we're selling

510
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,659
and when we're talking about the

511
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,260
culinary herbs the cooking herbs we know

512
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:13,140
from TV and magazines and and all of the

513
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:15,620
media around us that cooking at home and

514
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:18,320
being more adventurous in your cooking

515
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,360
is really

516
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,220
grown in popularity lately people are

517
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,200
are maybe doing a bit more home cooking

518
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,240
than they used to and and they're

519
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,940
getting more adventurous so they're

520
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,460
trying new herbs and new things on the

521
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,700
left hand side I have a list of of the

522
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:39,600
common culinary herbs basil Sage thyme

523
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:42,600
rosemary garlic or chives Savory parsley

524
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,400
oregano margarine and cilantro which of

525
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,960
course goes well with almost any tomato

526
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,840
based dish

527
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,480
on the right hand side are maybe those

528
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,820
that are not quite as common

529
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,880
um but they are still they have great

530
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,520
value in The Culinary World fennel as I

531
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,299
mentioned we use the the leaf instead of

532
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,980
a bulb lemon balm or lemon gravina is

533
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:08,220
not only good with chicken and fish it's

534
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:11,340
also great in teas and as hiccups cakes

535
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,080
and candies and also tea Stevia

536
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,179
um that's come on the market and gotten

537
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,780
very popular within the last

538
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,780
oh

539
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,860
seven eight years

540
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,440
um it's on the market it has Truvia the

541
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,600
natural sweetener and you'll see a lot

542
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,640
of stevia's that can be grown from seed

543
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,460
and actually does quite well here in

544
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,080
North Dakota as an annual

545
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:37,020
calendula is often thought of as a

546
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,360
flower in your flower beds very easy to

547
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:42,000
grow but the petals are great we have

548
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,700
some wonderful recipes for cookies and

549
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,340
and baked goods with the calendula and

550
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,559
the petals add wonderful colors to

551
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,299
salads

552
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,880
nasturtiums if you've never eaten an

553
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:56,159
assertion again which is thought of as a

554
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,080
flower in your flower bed but if you've

555
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,360
never eaten the leaves or the flowers

556
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,240
themselves I really encourage you to try

557
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,640
them they have a wonderful peppery

558
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,980
flavor to them

559
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,740
um that that adds just so much to a

560
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:13,559
fresh salad not only the color of the

561
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,320
flowers but also the leaves themselves

562
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:17,880
celery act if you like celery boy you

563
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,140
can add celery act to just about

564
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,720
anything

565
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,940
same with lovage it has that kind of

566
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,880
celery sort of flavor

567
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,919
mint any any of the mints of course and

568
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,980
then tarragon those would be some but

569
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,080
that are a little bit more Uncommon and

570
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,179
might not if you were selling themselves

571
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,240
quite as well as the list on the left

572
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:42,539
hand side but certainly would be easy to

573
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,320
grow offerings that you could have as

574
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,320
part of your sales

575
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:53,940
so a little bit more about some of those

576
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:55,940
easy to grow ones basil it is an annual

577
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:59,580
it grows from seed

578
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,980
some people buy basil plants I honestly

579
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:05,700
don't see the need to do that basil seed

580
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:08,400
is very inexpensive and it grows really

581
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:11,400
fast you do want to make sure that you

582
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,460
have a ground temperature of 55 degrees

583
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,700
or more but if your ground is nice and

584
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,440
warm and you put that seed in you'll see

585
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,140
some seedlings popping through within

586
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,380
two to three days that's how fast it is

587
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:28,140
and so that's why I guess I've never

588
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:31,080
seen the need to purchase basil plants

589
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,960
it is an annual and it is very Frost

590
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,000
sensitive so you want to make sure all

591
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,279
danger of frost is passed in the spring

592
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,080
and that you do everything you can do

593
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,100
with it before the first Frost in the

594
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,360
fall

595
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:48,000
time most times are perennial

596
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,059
here at Garden dwellers Farm I like to

597
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,980
plant a variety called German winter

598
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:56,400
time

599
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:59,400
during the winter time has proven itself

600
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,039
to be not only the most flavorful of the

601
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:05,159
varieties but also the most reliably

602
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:07,440
hearty you know Winters so I like that

603
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:09,240
kind there's lots of different kinds of

604
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,960
time out there though everything's from

605
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:17,299
creeping to woolly time to to other

606
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,299
taller white blooming varieties

607
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,159
stage it's also a perennial but I do

608
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:27,900
have a question mark there because I

609
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:28,740
have in extreme Winters with no

610
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:33,000
um

611
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:37,919
snow cover I have lost sage plants and

612
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,679
they tend to only get three years uh

613
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,919
yeah around three years out of a stand

614
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:47,460
of sage so I kind of plan every third

615
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,840
year as a new planting of sage so even

616
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,940
though it does make it through the

617
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,059
winter most years for me

618
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:57,299
um you know I I do plan every couple of

619
00:26:54,059 --> 00:27:00,779
years to rejuvenate that bed just

620
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:04,380
to be sure I have it on hand

621
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:08,100
winter savory is one that it's not very

622
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:10,440
common in cooking you will see just the

623
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,779
word Savory uh different recipes will

624
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,460
just call for Savory there are two kinds

625
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:17,640
of savory there's summer Savory and

626
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:20,460
winter savory the winter savory is

627
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,340
listed at the half hearty perennial but

628
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:26,400
my winter savory comes through every

629
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:30,000
year I mean it's just for me at least

630
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,100
has been hearty as heck and shows up all

631
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,380
the time

632
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,940
um I see we had a question about in your

633
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,400
comments about replacing this age every

634
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,200
couple years is that in your high Towers

635
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,200
my high tunnels are outside that's

636
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:47,100
outside the only thing we put in our

637
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,679
high tunnel is uh basil because it likes

638
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,960
it warm and that's one way we can get a

639
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,299
jump on the season is to put the basil

640
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,779
in the high tunnel and I will also put

641
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:59,220
some about half of the Rosemary I grow

642
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:01,980
in there

643
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,860
um only because my Rosemary plugs come

644
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,120
in so early in the season that I just

645
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,880
don't have a lot of room in the house

646
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,799
for them so I end up putting about half

647
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,240
of them out into the high tunnel um

648
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,760
that's the only thing we grow in there

649
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,559
the rest of our herbs we put out in the

650
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,880
field so they're they're out in the

651
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,039
field

652
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,179
so the winter savory to go back to that

653
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:26,100
is a really well behaved uh plant a nice

654
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:28,260
sturdy stocks

655
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,679
um it's a hearty for me reliably hearty

656
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:34,799
for me has a good peppery flavor to it

657
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:39,419
great whenever a recipe calls for Savory

658
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:42,419
um it's very tidy it stays in a nice

659
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:46,080
round ball and it doesn't Runner all

660
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:49,080
over and and very well behaved in in my

661
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,299
garden and my production laws Giants of

662
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,039
course also perennial and you can also

663
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:56,520
get garlic chives

664
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,380
they grow very fast very early very

665
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:02,940
reliably Hardy

666
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:05,159
parsley is truly a biennial which means

667
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,559
that the first year is going to put out

668
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:11,640
a lot of greens and the second year it's

669
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:14,039
going to try and go to flower or seed in

670
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,860
our area we grow it as an annual in

671
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:18,779
other words we till it under at the end

672
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,700
of that first year because in my

673
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:22,980
experience when it comes back that next

674
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,380
year you're not going to get a lot of

675
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,200
leaf off of it it's going to try and go

676
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,779
to seed right away now if you're seed

677
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,820
savings you may want to keep some of

678
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:34,620
those around that second year to collect

679
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:39,419
that seed

680
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:42,000
if you your goal is the leaves

681
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:45,960
themselves treat it as an annual and

682
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,320
grow it from seed my parsley seed I put

683
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,419
out as early as I can in fact as soon as

684
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:54,720
my production lot out there the snow is

685
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:57,779
gone and the soil is dry enough to work

686
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,539
I put the parsley seed out there even if

687
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:02,940
I know it's going to frost several more

688
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:06,360
times I still go ahead and plant because

689
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:09,539
parsley can take a frost and and not

690
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,039
have any issues with that and so by

691
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:13,260
planting it really early like that

692
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,120
that's one less thing I have to think

693
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:19,320
about planting later on

694
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,240
parsley also takes up to 20 21 days to

695
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,760
come up from feed so it's going to take

696
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,159
its darn sweet time so I I get that in

697
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,260
as early as possible

698
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,440
I talked about the winter savory the

699
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:34,919
summer Savory is an annual in comparison

700
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,860
to its winter savory cousin which is a

701
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:39,480
perennial so an annual you would as an

702
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:43,320
annual you would want to seed it every

703
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,539
year and that I also grow from seed oh

704
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,880
that one's not quite as pretty it tends

705
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:50,460
to fall over in the wind it doesn't have

706
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,500
quite as strong as stems and it does

707
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,659
have a bit of a different flavor from

708
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,480
the winter savory but it still has that

709
00:30:54,659 --> 00:31:01,440
has a very good flavor and is still very

710
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:04,080
good for cooking and the last uh one on

711
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,460
this slide is lemon balm it's a relative

712
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:11,279
of the mint family

713
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:14,100
um I have found it again to be kind of

714
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,559
half hearty perennial some years it

715
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:19,380
comes back really good for me and other

716
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:22,260
years it doesn't kind of depends on how

717
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,059
much snow we've had how cold it got

718
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,940
um the good thing about lemon balm is it

719
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:30,419
does grow really easy from seed so if

720
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,919
you have some seed packets or a seed

721
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:35,399
packet that you can pick up for lemon

722
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,380
balm it really you can replace it quite

723
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:41,120
quickly if you were counting on it to

724
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,120
come back over the winter and it didn't

725
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,380
some of the culinary herbs that are more

726
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,440
of a challenge

727
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,659
are Rosemary I've mentioned Rosemary

728
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,120
several times already and I've mentioned

729
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:55,919
that I I get in clubs or little plants

730
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,899
they're little rooted cuttings is what

731
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,020
they are

732
00:31:56,899 --> 00:32:03,179
Rosemary is not Hardy in North Dakota

733
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:04,919
and so you need to either bring your

734
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:07,380
plants inside if you have them in a

735
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:10,200
container or if you're growing them on a

736
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,440
larger scale you need to replant them

737
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,679
every year

738
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:19,080
you can purchase Rosemary seed and it's

739
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:20,159
not that hard to get it to germinate to

740
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,220
come up

741
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,620
but after it germinates it just seems to

742
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:28,080
languish and sit there and I haven't had

743
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:29,700
really good luck out of all the years

744
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,120
I've tried

745
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:35,580
um to get it to push past that initial

746
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,159
germination point to really end up with

747
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:40,500
a good looking rosemary plant so

748
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,960
um I just go ahead and order limited

749
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,480
cuttings another way that you could do

750
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,059
that would be if you had a place to to

751
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,700
overwinter in your home or or a

752
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:52,799
greenhouse a large Rosemary mother plant

753
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:57,059
you could take cuttings because they do

754
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:59,399
root quite easily from cuttings

755
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:01,260
Lavender is another one that I know

756
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:03,779
we've all seen in our seed catalogs

757
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:06,140
those beautiful pictures of the rows of

758
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:09,059
lavender and oh how pretty it is

759
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:12,240
lavender really is not fully hearty in

760
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:13,919
our area I know Sage burden herbs up in

761
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,140
Manitoba they'll tell you they can get

762
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,340
their their lavender to overwinter just

763
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,039
fine

764
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:22,440
um they really know some secrets and

765
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:26,039
some tricks because I've never been able

766
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:29,399
to get the lavender to to reliably over

767
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:31,080
winter I'll put in a row of 50 foot roll

768
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:33,679
and maybe

769
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,840
10 plants will come back and that's all

770
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:40,559
so it's not really reliable however

771
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,320
that said there are some varieties out

772
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:47,340
there that you can purchase seed for

773
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:50,399
that we can treat as an annual one such

774
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,159
variety the variety name is Lady

775
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,620
and you can grow that from seed and get

776
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:57,539
it to bloom quite well in one season

777
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,000
it's going to be later in the season

778
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:02,580
before it blooms but if you're looking

779
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,460
for those blossoms to use in potpourried

780
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,080
or in soap so that sort of thing and

781
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,240
you're counting on them to be ready in

782
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,879
the fall you should be able to manage

783
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,679
that

784
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,740
we've all seen or heard of using bay

785
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,460
leaves in cooking that needs to be a

786
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:22,919
house plant it is a a tree or shrub-like

787
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,740
bush it needs to be started from

788
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:27,839
cuttings so you know if you want to have

789
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:30,119
some bay leaves around you can treat

790
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,520
that as a house plant in the winter move

791
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:35,220
it outside in the summer and you can

792
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,379
have bay leaves which is kind of cool

793
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:39,119
fennel I've talked about that several

794
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:40,560
times you know we don't do the bulbs

795
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,080
there are some folks in North Dakota

796
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,500
especially the southern part Bismarck

797
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:49,200
Mandan Jamestown Fargo that can get some

798
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,359
fairly decent sized fennel bulbs in one

799
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,020
season but up here in the North Country

800
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,119
Bottineau rugby up in our area it's just

801
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:00,960
really difficult to get any bulb of any

802
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,339
size but the fennel leaves are awesome

803
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,720
tasting

804
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:05,160
um and if you're not going for that

805
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,339
crunch of the bulb you're just going for

806
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,839
the flavor that always is pretty easy to

807
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:13,200
grow

808
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,420
oregano and marjoram they are very

809
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,339
closely related plants

810
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:20,820
that's why you'll see both of them quite

811
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:24,180
often in in Italian cooking or in

812
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:28,140
cooking that has maybe a tomato base to

813
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:30,000
it they both grow really well here my

814
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,800
one caution and this is why they're on

815
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,680
this slide as being more of a challenge

816
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,619
is because they are so closely related

817
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:41,040
and there are so many varieties

818
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:44,700
it's difficult to find a good culinary

819
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,619
variety an example of that is I grow two

820
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,300
kinds I grow Greek original and I grow

821
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:50,700
Italian oregano

822
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,880
and I had always sourced my Italian

823
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,680
oregano from one place and one year I

824
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,640
thought you know I'm ordering Rosemary

825
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,380
plugs from this other Greenhouse maybe

826
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,900
I'll just go ahead and order the Italian

827
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,000
oregano at the same time from the same

828
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,359
place and I got it in and even though

829
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,599
they called it Italian oregano it was

830
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:16,140
not the same variety it was not exactly

831
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:18,180
the same plant and that that 280 plants

832
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,660
of Italian oregano that I was looking

833
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,520
forward to ended up being more like the

834
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:26,640
Greek oregano and just really didn't

835
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,720
have the flavor I was looking for so you

836
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:35,339
really have to know what you're ordering

837
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,160
paste it if you can see it smell it and

838
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:40,920
be very familiar with what you want

839
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,720
before you order it because there's lots

840
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,359
of varieties out there that are not the

841
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,280
best flavor

842
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:51,000
lemon balm as I mentioned may not

843
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,180
overwinter and then tarragon only being

844
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,020
a challenge because it's hearty here

845
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:00,240
it's a perennial it grows quite large

846
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:02,480
it'll take off and just be crazy all

847
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,280
summer long and that

848
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,980
is probably the challenge is that it can

849
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,980
get quite large but it can sucker or

850
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:13,500
Runner itself out and not be the nicest

851
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,900
guest in your garden

852
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,940
um and so it's it's a little bit more of

853
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,400
a challenge only in that way it grows

854
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,200
like crazy and it is a perennial

855
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,599
um you want the French tears on for

856
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,980
cooking that's the kind there's Russian

857
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:30,000
and there's french you want the French

858
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:32,780
but it it is quite um

859
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,780
prolific

860
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,280
so harvesting storing and using your

861
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:41,760
herbs

862
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,220
you can dry them I recommend drying them

863
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,460
in a in an oven if you do it that way

864
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,960
you want them to be at 100 degrees or

865
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,660
lower

866
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,040
um as low as it will go until they're

867
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:56,640
very crispy

868
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,680
some people if they have a gas oven they

869
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,579
will not turn the oven on at all they'll

870
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,420
just use the ambient heat of the pilot

871
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:06,180
light

872
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,320
in the oven it takes longer of course to

873
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,520
do it that way and you don't want to

874
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,420
forget that they're in there when you go

875
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,400
to make supper that night but

876
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,599
the lower temperature that you can dry

877
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,200
them at

878
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,980
the less chance you will have of cooking

879
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,140
them

880
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:25,320
instead of drying them because the

881
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:27,300
purpose is to remove that moisture that

882
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,000
water out of the plant without removing

883
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:33,060
those oils that give it its good flavor

884
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,079
so the lower temperature you can go the

885
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:38,040
better

886
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:40,980
an alternative way to to store them or

887
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:44,880
to preserve them is to hang dry them

888
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:47,339
very easy simply just um you know Bunch

889
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,040
them together in in small bunches not

890
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:53,700
too big a bunches

891
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:56,760
and with a a clip or a rubber band and

892
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,680
hang them in a warm dark place Out of

893
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,960
the Dust until they're dry

894
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,119
now if you live in the country or on a

895
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,099
gravel world like I do and you say now

896
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:09,180
that's great but we're really dusty

897
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:11,160
around here you can put a paper bag over

898
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,359
them to kind of keep the dust off which

899
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,200
is a nice way to do that as well

900
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:17,700
excuse me

901
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,760
um you can freeze them and this happens

902
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:23,040
to be one of my favorite ways to do this

903
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,220
because it's quicker

904
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,859
to me it seems easier when I freeze my

905
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:30,900
herbs I rough chop them

906
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:32,700
so in other words they're bigger pieces

907
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,640
not teeny tiny pieces

908
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:39,240
put them in an ice cube tray fill the

909
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:42,240
ice cube tray up with water or butter or

910
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,280
oil depending on how you're going to use

911
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,560
them later and I put them in the freezer

912
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,960
and once they're frozen I pop them out

913
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:52,380
of that ice cube tray I put them in a

914
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,599
freezer bag an appropriate Ziploc

915
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,160
freezer bag and label them because once

916
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:58,619
they're in ice cube steak they all kind

917
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,240
of look alike green little cubes so make

918
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:03,540
sure that you label them with what they

919
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,339
are and pop them back in the freezer the

920
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:09,180
interesting or the nice thing about

921
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:11,760
doing it this way is an ice cube tray

922
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,560
once you've added some water it's pretty

923
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,780
much equivalent to like a tablespoon

924
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:18,060
depending on your ice cube tray a

925
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,280
tablespoon or two tablespoons which is

926
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,980
just about right for a lot of your

927
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,800
recipes so it comes up being really

928
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,339
convenient in the end

929
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,040
um

930
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:30,839
if you're going to dry them whether you

931
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,160
dry them in the oven or you're hang dry

932
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:34,619
them

933
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,880
when you are storing them you want to

934
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:42,359
keep them as low or as whole as possible

935
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,880
until you use them when you start to

936
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:47,640
crush them up and crumble them up you

937
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,320
are you're releasing those oils and

938
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,359
again that's what gives it its flavor

939
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,520
and I thought it was interesting because

940
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,359
within the last several months

941
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,700
um the the very well-known and large

942
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:03,180
seasoning manufacturer McCormick has

943
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,800
started that that Trend now they've

944
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,540
really started that marketing push to

945
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,180
say you know we're putting everything we

946
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:11,359
have in Grinders now because the more

947
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,140
whole it is the better it is

948
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,660
Suzanne has asked a question about

949
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,579
dehydrators

950
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,619
dehydrators are great again you want to

951
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:22,920
make sure your dehydrating hydrating

952
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:23,760
them at a low temperature 100 degrees or

953
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,220
under

954
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,300
and and then dehydrators yes of course

955
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,300
work wonderfully

956
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:38,520
herbal teas are really uh they're good

957
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,920
for you they are low in calorie higher

958
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,640
in nutrients and they just taste darn

959
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,980
good some of the common herbs or teas or

960
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,200
drinks are of course the mint

961
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,000
the hiccups if you're not familiar with

962
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,180
yourself it has kind of a licorice

963
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,800
flavor so if you like licorice

964
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:58,320
um you might want to consider some of

965
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,640
the hiccups I particularly like anise

966
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,619
Jacob

967
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,820
which has a beautiful purple flower and

968
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:08,640
works well as a substitute for lavender

969
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:12,119
Bergamot or bee balm Lemon Verbena lemon

970
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:16,020
balm chamomile and lemon basil are all

971
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:19,680
wonderful in herbal teas lavender or

972
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:22,500
Hound Beaver Pew Angelica sweet grass or

973
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,380
lemongrass and rose hips are all common

974
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:29,880
herbs that you can grow we don't often

975
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,480
think of roses as an herb but they are

976
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,060
um

977
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,060
the hips of course are actually seeds

978
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:39,380
not the third part of the plant

979
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:42,599
but they fall into that herb category

980
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,460
lemongrass or sweet grass is one that

981
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:46,500
you will want to have in a pot so you

982
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,300
can take it in the house because to get

983
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:53,400
the good

984
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:56,700
base or bulbous end of the plant

985
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,339
um which is what's best for tea

986
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:03,560
you will want to have a very long season

987
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:03,560
or or keep them as a houseplant

988
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,540
this is a picture of annasop I mentioned

989
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:12,060
that it works really well as alternative

990
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,859
to Lavender and you can kind of see that

991
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:16,619
in this picture this is a bunch that I

992
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:18,720
had harvested for some tea way back in

993
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:20,400
2004 they use we looked at that

994
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,859
beautiful purple color isn't that

995
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,079
gorgeous it also looks really good in

996
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:27,240
the flower bed can you imagine how

997
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:31,140
beautiful that would look next to other

998
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:33,599
colorful flowers yellows oranges it

999
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:35,819
really is a standout in the garden it

1000
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,940
tends to be for the most part perennial

1001
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:40,560
again like lemon balm if if we have one

1002
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:43,319
of those really bad Winters you may lose

1003
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:46,859
it but it grows really well from seed

1004
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:49,800
and for most cases will be perennial for

1005
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:52,920
you but it's about two and a half feet

1006
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:55,560
tall and is really pretty in my opinion

1007
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,300
what is what a nice addition to either

1008
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,339
of the flower garden herb garden Olive

1009
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:02,099
vegetable garden

1010
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:05,280
when you're making herbal tea we do not

1011
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:06,180
recommend sun tea because leaving things

1012
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,640
out

1013
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:10,800
what a great way to grow bacteria let's

1014
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,780
take some moisture and put it in the sun

1015
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,480
where it's warm and and leave it there

1016
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:17,760
so I don't recommend something the best

1017
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,500
way to gather is gather your herbs put

1018
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,680
them in a cheesecloth bag or a tea

1019
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:26,280
holder boil your water separate and then

1020
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:28,920
pour the water over the tea leaves don't

1021
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,960
put them all together then you're going

1022
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,660
to let it steep for three to five

1023
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,900
minutes depending on what you like to

1024
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:38,520
taste and then enjoy

1025
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,079
one note here though currently in North

1026
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,060
Dakota is not allowed by the State

1027
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,359
Health Department or any of the local

1028
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:47,520
Health districts to actually sell the

1029
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,520
beverage tea

1030
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:54,060
at farmers markets or other markets

1031
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:56,599
however you could make the tea bags with

1032
00:44:54,060 --> 00:45:00,140
the dried tea

1033
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:00,140
and sell those

1034
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,819
of course you can make all sorts of Home

1035
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,640
Cosmetics bath disease that's soaking

1036
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:10,140
soaking bags lotions soap massage and

1037
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,660
Body Oil

1038
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:15,180
um all of those things can be made very

1039
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,700
easily with your herbs and the recipes

1040
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,800
are all over the Internet so you know

1041
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,720
it's not something I'm going to spend

1042
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,480
time going into here

1043
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:27,000
um but but that's a potential Outlet or

1044
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,079
a potential market for herbs that you

1045
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,079
could be growing at home

1046
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:38,420
herbs just for the aroma Sweet Annie is

1047
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:44,940
a type of Artemisia that grows very tall

1048
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:47,400
five to six feet tall has a beautiful

1049
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:52,500
golden color in the fall and it makes

1050
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:54,660
great wreaths and swags and decorations

1051
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:58,260
um lavender as I mentioned we talked

1052
00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:00,060
about that heliotrope has a very vanilla

1053
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,119
scent and there's another purple flower

1054
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,000
you can find that in your local

1055
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:08,760
nurseries and garden centers

1056
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,420
Bergamot is a is also bee balm and is

1057
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:15,780
wild around here Artemisia or wormwood

1058
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:18,119
and I see we have Michelle has asked any

1059
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,680
of these herbs repel insects like box

1060
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:23,180
elder bugs

1061
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:28,260
now the Sweet Annie and the wormwoods

1062
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:30,780
have been said to repel insects and in

1063
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:34,020
fact I used to sell a fair amount of the

1064
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:36,480
Sweet Annie and wormwood in Reeves when

1065
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:38,460
we were in Minnesota

1066
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,859
um to people that had cabins because

1067
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,780
they would put them in their cabins to

1068
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:45,000
keep kind of the the spiders and the

1069
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:47,280
bugs out over winter

1070
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,400
um the Patchouli that's listed on this

1071
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:53,099
slide Lemon Verbena and rosemary all

1072
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,440
kind of have that same

1073
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:57,900
um

1074
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:00,359
insecticidal properties to them but you

1075
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,280
know I'll be real honest and say you

1076
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:04,079
know some people say basil oil does the

1077
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,720
same thing repels flies

1078
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:10,200
I will sit in my high tunnel surrounded

1079
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:13,560
by thousands of basil plants and be

1080
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:15,119
covered with insects so you know I think

1081
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,060
it uh

1082
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,079
there's room for improvement on any of

1083
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,400
these

1084
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:26,300
but if I had to

1085
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:28,859
recommend trying any of these for

1086
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:32,339
repelling insects it would be the Sweet

1087
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:34,680
Annie and any of the artemisions

1088
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:38,780
and the patchouli

1089
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,780
and maybe they're Rosemary

1090
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:44,400
uses for aromatic herbs stewing herbs if

1091
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,960
you're not familiar with storing herbs

1092
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,960
that they used to when they had

1093
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:53,400
dirt floors they would they would put

1094
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,440
the herbs down on the floor and walk on

1095
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:59,220
them to make it smell good in the house

1096
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:02,339
of course potpourri wet or dry sachets

1097
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:04,560
for your closets and and in amongst your

1098
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:07,020
Linens and your towels and of course

1099
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,339
I've mentioned wreaths and swags many

1100
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:11,339
times

1101
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:14,160
some herbs to think about winter savory

1102
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:16,740
chives still basil Sage Bergamot lemon

1103
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,720
balm thyme Anna take up and the mint

1104
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:21,180
when you can contain them because they

1105
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,540
will get away from you they like to

1106
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:26,339
crawl and be friendly with other places

1107
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,680
um but those are kind of my favorites

1108
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:31,140
and if I had to choose what to start

1109
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:35,819
with that would be my list of where to

1110
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:39,119
start my least liked herbs comfrey

1111
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:40,440
chicory oregano only because it's like I

1112
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,540
mentioned it's tough to get a good

1113
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,339
tasting one

1114
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,200
um mints when they're not contained when

1115
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:48,720
you can't keep them where they belong

1116
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,420
they're not my favorite some are Savory

1117
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,060
I mentioned it's just not pretty it's

1118
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:56,280
it kind of Falls over in the winds and

1119
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:59,220
the cilantro only because it's a

1120
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:02,339
challenge to keep cilantro from bolting

1121
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:04,440
In the Heat of the summer and here's the

1122
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:06,000
cilantro I know we're running out of

1123
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,220
time but I just want to take a couple of

1124
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,240
minutes to talk about

1125
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:15,720
um the cilantro to do it well

1126
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:19,319
you need to plant cilantro in succession

1127
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,119
here at the farm we plant cilantro every

1128
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:23,099
two weeks

1129
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:27,000
and it only gets

1130
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:29,579
six inches tall and we're cutting it and

1131
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,740
it only lasts two to three weeks and

1132
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:35,099
then we take that whole room out

1133
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:37,140
because once it gets hot once we start

1134
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:39,780
getting into the heated summer the first

1135
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:42,060
thing it's going to want to do is form

1136
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,740
flowers and seeds

1137
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:45,000
and that's not what you're planning it

1138
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:48,060
for you're planning it for that

1139
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,680
wonderful aromatic Leaf to use in that

1140
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,000
summer salsa with those home grown

1141
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,880
tomatoes

1142
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,140
um so my suggestion people ask me very

1143
00:49:53,880 --> 00:50:00,420
often how do I grow good cilantro my six

1144
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:04,560
suggestion is to just keep planting it

1145
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:07,619
every two to three weeks Deb says that

1146
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:10,800
her cilantro gets bugs now honestly I

1147
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:12,480
have never had my cilantro get bugs if

1148
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,359
if you happen to know what kind of bug

1149
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,280
it gets please let me know because then

1150
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:19,859
I could probably give you a suggestion

1151
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,460
on what to do about that

1152
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:23,160
um

1153
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:26,819
but I've never had that issue so I'm I'm

1154
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:29,099
not sure what kind of bug would be

1155
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:32,520
bothering it although it is kind of in

1156
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:36,200
the same family as the parsleys and some

1157
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:38,780
of the monarch butterfly

1158
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,920
caterpillars may like it

1159
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,020
here's just kind of a list of things

1160
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:48,059
that we grow I've talked about all of

1161
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:49,980
these throughout the presentation in in

1162
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:51,900
different forms

1163
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:54,599
um

1164
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:57,720
just giving you a lift to maybe kind of

1165
00:50:54,599 --> 00:51:00,119
uh spark your interest in growing

1166
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:02,520
something new or something different or

1167
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,800
going down an Avenue for add-on sales or

1168
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,000
for sales for your home agricultural

1169
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,460
business

1170
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,780
when harvesting as I mentioned avoid the

1171
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,420
heat of the day

1172
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:14,880
you want to cool down the herbs as

1173
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:17,819
quickly as possible

1174
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,900
high humidity is the key to Fresh long

1175
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:24,960
lasting herbs you do not want them wet

1176
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:27,540
just in kind of a humid environment

1177
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,720
most herbs will regrow for a second

1178
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:33,480
cutting within two weeks so plan to

1179
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,220
plant twice what you need if you're

1180
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:38,400
cutting every week if you're taking them

1181
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:42,599
to the farmers market every week

1182
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:47,220
and you think okay I'm going to cut uh

1183
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:49,200
20 feet of cilantro every week to take

1184
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:51,599
to the market then you're going to want

1185
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,859
to plant 40 feet

1186
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:58,140
make sure you use clean utensils to help

1187
00:51:54,859 --> 00:51:59,760
prevent the spread of disease here is

1188
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:02,220
what it looks like when we are

1189
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,960
harvesting our basil

1190
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,760
um you know it's kind of backbreaking

1191
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,579
work you're down on your hands and knees

1192
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,440
I I have a little stool that I use quite

1193
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:13,559
often to sit on and go down the row and

1194
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,480
cut we cut each piece each tip by hand

1195
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:17,520
with the basil

1196
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,460
and then they get dunked in this cooler

1197
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,900
this cooler is full of

1198
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:24,839
fairly cold water we don't want it ice

1199
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:27,780
cold but but you want cool water what

1200
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:31,260
you are trying to do is shock those

1201
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:33,839
stoma into closing first of all and

1202
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:37,380
second of all you're you're taking the

1203
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:40,559
field heat out of those herbs so that it

1204
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:43,500
starts that cooling process

1205
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:46,380
um and then you want to get them we put

1206
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:48,480
them in plastic tubs or totes uh like

1207
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:51,900
you can see there we put the lid on and

1208
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,119
we put them in a cool dark place the

1209
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:56,520
plastic totes with the lid on will hold

1210
00:52:54,119 --> 00:53:00,000
the humidity in and that's what I was

1211
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:02,280
saying is you want them humid but not

1212
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,160
wet

1213
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,839
packaging at a farmer's market how you

1214
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:08,640
display and package your herbs that the

1215
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:12,180
market really depends on your Market

1216
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,339
customer preferences we like large tubs

1217
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:16,260
with lids

1218
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:17,339
because we again can keep the humidity

1219
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:20,220
up

1220
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:21,960
um but if you're going to package them

1221
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,400
because that's what the customers at

1222
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:26,280
your market like

1223
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:29,700
make sure that you package them in a

1224
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:32,760
breathable package and packages closely

1225
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:35,460
to sale time as possible because again

1226
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:38,640
water is the enemy

1227
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:41,220
if you're packaging to wholesale uh to

1228
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,619
restaurants or institutions most of them

1229
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:45,480
will take them by the pound or an

1230
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:48,300
increments of a pound half pound quarter

1231
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:51,119
pound and we'll take them in in just a

1232
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:53,160
plain bag a plain clear bag make sure

1233
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:56,520
that you are using

1234
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,920
um bags that are specifically for food

1235
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:02,400
and that's what they're intended for

1236
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:05,760
food grade bags are good vented ones

1237
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:09,599
ones with holes in or or a way for air

1238
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:12,180
exchange is our best and purchase the

1239
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,160
bag that fits the most usual quantity

1240
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:17,280
you are selling it's what you sell the

1241
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,480
most of is a pound then purchase bags

1242
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,380
that uh

1243
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,420
that will hold a pound and I say this

1244
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:27,180
because again as a business you don't

1245
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:29,640
want to spend a whole lot of money

1246
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:32,579
buying up a bunch of inventory such as

1247
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:35,839
four different sizes of bags

1248
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:38,339
when really you only need one size a bag

1249
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:40,740
to make do for most of your customers

1250
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:43,440
it's going to save your business money

1251
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:44,220
and inventory

1252
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,040
um

1253
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,780
packaging to retail stores such as

1254
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,599
grocery stores is a little bit trickier

1255
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:53,819
you want to visit with them and talk to

1256
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,339
them about their expectations

1257
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:57,780
if you were in a grocery store and you

1258
00:54:56,339 --> 00:55:00,599
think you want to sell herbs to them

1259
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:02,880
take a look at what they have some

1260
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:05,940
grocery stores just have their herbs

1261
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,599
packaged in a clear plastic bag with a

1262
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:11,339
very simple label on it others have them

1263
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:14,220
bunched in bunches that are tied with

1264
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:18,480
rubber bands or twist ties and others

1265
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:20,640
have them in soy or plastic based clam

1266
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,460
shells what we call clam shells

1267
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:26,460
the best thing you can do is to look at

1268
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:28,200
at their packaging and mimic things that

1269
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,900
as closely as possible

1270
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:34,619
some stores may require you to have a

1271
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:37,160
UPC label or a PLU which is a product

1272
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:37,160
lookup

1273
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:43,380
packaging can be your most expensive

1274
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:45,660
cost in herb sale right after

1275
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,819
transportation and distribution and

1276
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:50,099
finding labels and packaging materials

1277
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:52,319
can be really difficult if you're

1278
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:54,960
interested if and you intend on

1279
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,460
packaging your product be careful to

1280
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,819
have the equipment or facilities

1281
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:02,760
necessary to store it before delivery

1282
00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:06,300
and when I say that what I mean is you

1283
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,740
know some you put one ounce of herbs in

1284
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,180
packages they're going to take up a

1285
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:13,319
whole lot more room

1286
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:16,020
then if they were in

1287
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:19,260
the tubs like I showed earlier

1288
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:21,599
this is a picture of our product on the

1289
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:25,319
grocery store itself you can see that we

1290
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:27,359
do use the plastic clam shells and I

1291
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:29,160
will tell you and we have a UPC label

1292
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:32,819
you can see that down in the lower right

1293
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:35,460
and I can tell you that the packaging

1294
00:56:32,819 --> 00:56:37,980
and the labeling of our product

1295
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,740
is the the part of our product that

1296
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:44,520
takes the most time and costs us the

1297
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:47,040
most money and so if you really want to

1298
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:49,559
do your homework lay out your business

1299
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:52,800
plan before you go down that road but it

1300
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:55,020
can be very enjoyable

1301
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:57,059
growing organic remember not to use

1302
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:59,099
phrase or chemicals on food products if

1303
00:56:57,059 --> 00:57:01,260
you can avoid it if you do need to do

1304
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:02,960
that be sure you're following all of the

1305
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:05,339
label and manufacturer instructions

1306
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,619
manure is a wonderful soil conditioner

1307
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:09,780
as well as fertilizer when applied

1308
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:12,420
appropriately so be sure that you

1309
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:15,540
understand the food safety rules for

1310
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:18,900
applying soil amendments and most herbs

1311
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:21,119
are relatively disease and bug free I

1312
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:22,800
can honestly tell you other than

1313
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:26,760
grasshoppers

1314
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:28,440
I've never really had an issue with bugs

1315
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:31,200
on our

1316
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:33,960
herbs at all I know I've done a little

1317
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:37,559
bit over the time for questions asking

1318
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:40,740
but certainly uh would be available

1319
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:42,900

1327
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,460
interesting and I'm sure everyone

1328

enjoyed it we have time for a couple

1329
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:07,819
questions

and I'll I'll put the slide back in case

1333
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:31,700
you want to write down Holly's email

1334
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,260
here we have a question for you how well

1335
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:40,099
do cold frames work around here they're

1336
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,099
in Mandan

1337
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:47,400
I love cold frames they work really well

1338
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:49,980
especially for those things that are

1339
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:53,700
um kind of cold tolerant to begin with

1340
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:56,520
the dill cilantro fennel

1341
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:58,680
um all parsleys of all of those things

1342
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:00,900
are are fairly cold tolerant to begin

1343
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,940
with as well as many of The Perennial

1344
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,980
ones

1345
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:07,500
if they're also a great way to get as I

1346
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:09,780
mentioned basil likes it warm and while

1347
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:12,299
you wouldn't be able to start basaling

1348
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:14,460
your Cold Frame now you certainly would

1349
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:16,380
be getting a jump on having them planted

1350
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:18,540
in the garden by putting them in a Cold

1351
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,780
Frame you could get at least two to

1352
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:23,760
three weeks jump on them that way

1353
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:26,640
next question was how well does Stevia

1354
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:29,940
grow for me Stevia grows really well for

1355
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,079
me I the stevia seed is a little bit

1356
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:33,059
expensive

1357
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:36,180
but it's come down a lot in the last

1358
00:59:33,059 --> 00:59:39,299
couple years I always start mine from C

1359
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:41,640
I put it out uh in the field and it just

1360
00:59:39,299 --> 00:59:45,359
it grows like crazy I mean it gets uh

1361
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:47,760
well 20 to 22 inches tall and if you

1362
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:50,040
pinch it when it's young so that you are

1363
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,559
encouraging it to Branch you can get

1364
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:54,540
more branches which of course means more

1365
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:58,020
leaves off of it

1366
00:59:54,540 --> 01:00:00,359
um and I've really never had any disease

1367
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:04,099
or insect issues with the stevia at all

1368
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:04,099
I've really had good luck with it

1369
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:11,160
so I will bring our session to a close

1370
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,260
even though I think we could go on all

1371
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,059
afternoon

1372
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:16,640
