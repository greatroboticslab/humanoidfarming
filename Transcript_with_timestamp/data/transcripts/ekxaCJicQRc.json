  "text": "[music] my name is Butch Swaim a farmer from\nsoutheast Iowa also national promotional director for the national farmers\norganization NFO at Corning Iowa today on our Midwest farm report we have a\nnumber of guests that are interested in the farming picture as a whole quite\ninterested in business and various other interests from around the country and\nI'd like to start out by introducing to my extreme right over here Coleman Scott\na businessman in the Midwest and other places throughout the country then to my\nimmediate right Jim Parker the Parker vacuum-cleaner supply company of Des\nMoines Iowa and then on my left I have Ed Shima a large farmer from over in\nIowa County Iowa that helps in his spare time to get people to understand the\nfarm problem to get others to see that we farmers should work together to solve\nthis problem and to start off with today we would like to bring a few figures\nhere in a recent survey that was made of the Sioux City, Iowa livestock market now\non one given day there was enough hogs and enough cattle on this particular\nmarket that we want to show you the loss of income that is taking place in rural\nAmerica there was receipts this particular day and these are actual\nreceipts and actual prices that the farmers received neveress receipts this\nparticular day of twelve thousand ninety nine head of cattle and the top price\nwas twenty one dollars now supposing that everyone received the top price\nwhich everyone knows they don't but nevertheless they were still being\nshortchanged at least $11.50 a-hundred from the prices they should be to get\nthe farm prices and balance with the rest of it\nand the same has been figured out on hogs and it was found that in this one\nday's marketing the farmers in the area around Sioux City, Iowa marketing area\nalong with shortchanged one million, six hundred, and four thousand, a hundred and\nninety three dollars just on one day's marketing this is the astounding figure\nthat has caused the businessmen of rural America is causing them I should say to\nwake up and find out that the farm problem is not just a problem of the\nfarmers but a problem of everyone in the United States and first I would like to\ncall on Mr. Coleman Scott who is a businessman advertising business\nvarious other things why don't you tell us Coleman how your business is and how\nit affects you as you see it well butch I think probably the most important part\nof it as it immediately appeared to me a few days ago I was in one of the areas\nnot to very far from Des Moines talking with a man in the automobile business\nnow this man does all of his business with what we call rural America about 95\npercent of all of his business is done directly with the farmer I was talking\nwith him about a problem which was quite important to him and it was important to\nme because he was a part of an advertising campaign which my firm was\nabout to handle and he said truthfully Coleman I don't want to do any more\nbusiness well this is up obviously something that is very strange because\nhere's a man that is not only a good merchant but he has a record of being a\ngood businessman and I said what causes you to make a\nstatement like that or he reached in his desk for a stack just about this side\nand he said all of these represent a series of people with whom I've done\nbusiness with for years who have had excellent records of pay these people\nare now all delinquent this has now forced me to become de liquid at the\nbank this has never happened since I've been in business in my conversation he\nwent on to say it's very tough for me to sell something to a grocer for instance\nwho does business with a farmer when the farmer doesn't have any money now over\nand over I guess all of us have heard the story of the farmer who benefits to\nthe extent of having two Cadillacs one for town a one to drive down in the\nSouth Forty this automatically caused me to ask questions from him it was this\nthat caused me to first make my visit to you to ask for additional information\nNFO was comparatively new to me I've of course seen it read it as a as a newsman\nI've been in cut in touch with it to a large degree because I've come in\ncontact with certain activities certain things that have been said certainly\ntheir national meetings and frankly butch I wondered who it was that was\nopposing the farmer from getting his legitimate share of the National part of\nthe gross national product this was what first caused me to ask these questions\nof you now at your office I picked up a sheet of paper it's a pink one here this\nis obviously something people may see I guess the cameras not turned on it but\nit impressed me because I had recently driven through the area- pardon me- which\nwas mentioned in this particular article was referring to a particular part of\none county of the state of California which to a large degree is owned by a\nmajor land corporation now this company has a holding of two million four hundred\nand twelve thousand a hundred and twelve acres now this is one company now if\nsomebody were to call this corporate farming this would obviously make a lot\nof sense but that isn't the truth because in addition to owning this two\nmillion four hundred thousand acres they're also the largest producer of\nlivestock in one of the foreign countries they own 51% of the stock in a\nmajor implement corporation but their big cash return comes from the 27\npercent oil depletion benefits which they enjoy through the series of the one\nthousand five hundred and fifty producing oil wells which are on there\ntwo million four hundred and fourteen thousand acres so they produce cattle\nenjoying a tax benefit from the oil depletion of the twenty seven\nand a half percent allowance and suddenly you're not talking about\nfarming anymore you're talking about people in a variety of businesses the\nstrangest part was not their holding of this but the fact that their board of\ndirectors also had members of the board of directors of one of the largest food\nchains in the United States now in reading some of your material which was\nplaced at my disposal I noticed that many times many of those people had been\nmost belligerent in opposing the farmers position for collective bargaining what\nis this story Butch well this story is to make a long story short come right to\nthe point here I don't know if the camera can see this or not but in the\nOctober convention of the chain stores why the vice-president of the chain\nstores called for an out-and-out abolishment of the family farm system of\nagriculture in America but what's the problem I don't know really unless it's because\nthe fact that in the next 35 years the amount of food produced in the United\nStates is going to have to weigh more than double we're going to have have to\ndouble everything virtually in America with the exception of the tombstones out\nhere in the graveyard Coleman and Agriculture has produced seventy percent\nof the new wealth that goes into the money streams of America to keep our\nindustry running and it's very obvious that some of the large interests would\nlike to own control agriculture this is the only reason that I can see they\ndidn't say why they attacked of the family farm system agriculture but\nnevertheless they call for the abolishment of the family farm system of\nAgriculture well now one of the things that I have noticed the National farm\nbreeders the breeders of cattle those who are feeders of cattle consistently\npoint to the amount of money that has been lost by the cattle raisers yet one\nof the largest rubber companies in the United States maintains ten thousand\nhead of cattle on one of its ranches again enjoying a series of the twenty\nseven percent oil depletion it's pretty tough it would seem to me for a man who\nraises a hundred head to be able to compete with this kind of an operation\nwell NFO would correct this situation because the people that all the people\nthat grow a hundred head would band together and would equal ten thousand\nhead in in a lot in other words it would equal anything far greater than all the\nrest of them own put together this is what the family farm must do they must\nband together through the NFO collective bargaining plan so that their\nbargaining strength is not only just as great as any other food producers in the\nUnited States but is greater then the bargaining power of those that are\nbuying the farm commodities well I had a man pardon me Butch I had a man explaining\nto me I asked some questions of people in the processing business\ntoday knowing that I was going to appear with you and he said Coleman it's probably\nthe strangest situation that exists he said we in turn create a processed meat\nproduct we know what we have to sell it for because the people we're going to\nsell it to tell us what they want to sell it for they're going to add their\nprofit and we work backwards they're going to sell it for 69 cents we know\nwhat their markup is so we know what we're gonna sell it to them for him by\nthe time we finally reached the point where we buy the product that's going to\ngo into it we have to say to the farmer this is all we can tell you because\nthat's all there is now everybody else's profit had been added to it now\nthey were at the point of origin this is exactly opposite of any other\nmanufactured product in America this is exactly right and this is why the\nfarmers must act and act now because their whole industry is in jeopardy and\neveryone else in America sets their price based on a cost of production and\nthen a reasonable profit why shouldn't the American farmer be entitled to do\nthe same thing to start at the origin of the product in other words maybe to set\na price of it based on what they know it's going to cost to produce it before\nit to the crop is ever planted before this operation starts and then ask and\nreceive that price well Butch of course the biggest the biggest argument against\nwell let's take one particular item the biggest argument of course against the\nbusiness of the farmers collective bargaining has been the fact that you'd\nprice yourself out of the European markets in the foreign markets now I\nfound that interesting reading well where's this \nto me isn't a problem because why should we depend on the European market for a\nliving when we have plenty here in America why should we depend on the\nEuropean market last year Coleman we did sell one acre and four out of each four in\n foreign trade but you know why we sold one acre and four in foreign\ntrade for the simple reason that we couldn't make a living on the three\nacres that we sold at home so we built a surplus product so we\nbuild a surplus and we operate wholly in surplus so there's only one difference\nno doubt you realize this much better than I would\nor much better than the average farmer out here but did you ever stop to think\nwith the only difference between a surplus or a so-called surplus and an\ninventory is to set the price on it so we at NFO believe that we\nshould get together and set the price on our commodity change our so-called\nsurplus into an inventory just like any other good business in America does\nwell Butch I was in your office as you will recall when Jim Parker another\nbusinessman walked in and asked almost identically the same type of questions I\nasked so I was real pleased when you said Jim and I would be together in the\nsame show this is ironic folks these are two businesspeople that walked in the\noffice the very same day within a matter of a few minutes apart concerned about\nthe same things concerned that their business was going down with the farmer\nso that farming the farm problem is no longer just the problem of the Farmers\nof America but it's a problem of all America and at this time I would like to\nto ask Jim Parker to express his business views and why we walked into\nthe office and why but his he told it as he put it and I want him to explain it\nin his own words a little later and, as he, the more and more that he looked at\nthis farm situation the more that he felt the noose tightening around his\nneck but he would no longer be in business if the NFO should fail and this\nwas just two days ago I never saw the man before but he's a real shrewd\nbusinessman folks and i would like to express get\nhim to express his opinion why it is that he thinks as he put it to me that\nevery businessman in America should be concerned and every businessman could\nshould be willing and ready to help solve this farm problem\nwell Butch this is an unpaid testimonial I agree unpaid for sure but\nwhether or not it'll be a testimonial depend the course on whether or not I\ncan learn a little about the NFO and that's my reason for being here that's\nmy reason for having come into the office my business consists of\ncontacting dealers in small communities through Iowa northern Missouri little of\nKansas a little of eastern Nebraska and about two years ago I began to feel this\npinch I put a dealer in a little town of Pattonsburg Missouri and I come back\nsix weeks later to call on him and he was gone\nnow this has happened a number of times I'm becoming aware and I had become\naware at that time that this little businessman in this town when he tells\nme he doesn't have the money to buy today I contacted approximately six\ndealers that told me this and these dealers were well-established had been\nin business for a number of years and they feel it\nif these dealers are affected then they're going to be other businessmen\nsurely like me I would presume several businessmen who have already been put\nout of business I'm on the verge at least in this phase of it I come into\nyour office in the hope that I could find out something from NFO I've\nbeen concerned about this holding action some people agree with it some people\ndisagree but one thing about it I was favorable to the NFO because they're\ndoing something I saw these television programs that you have had on Sunday\nafternoon and they  were good they had they had good effect I like the I\nlike the way they go about this thing they're going to make an effort to do\nthis if they can find a way to bring to the\nattention of the businessman to the Iowa citizen to the citizens of this country\nthe fact that we surely got to take care of our farm program we've surely got to\nget the economy of the farmer right every time isn't it true that every time\na farm closes goes out of business we die a little more yes this is true\nand we lose more business people all the time I'm real glad Jim that you brought\nup this fact of the NFO holding action because this is probably the most\nmisunderstood thing there is about our whole program but I'd like to call your\nattention in fact with everybody in America that's in business every working\nman that works for a wage all of them have a holding action all the time did\nyou ever stop to think that you have a holding action on your on your business\nall the time that you set a price on your commodity and you hold for that\nprice but simply this has been established before you were entered\nbusiness to the point that everybody walks in or that buys from you pays\nthis price without ever thinking that you have a holding action and the fellow\nthat you sell it to from the wholesale level he has a holding action too he\nholds it until he gets this price he puts the legitimate market based on a\ncost of production plus a profit the same way you operate your business and\nhe has a holding action now is it so wrong or the American farmer to do\nexactly the same thing we hope to educate the people and the public that\nwe're entitled to a cost of production plus a reasonable profit and then as\nsoon as they become aware of this situation and acknowledge this fact then\nwe will no longer have to have a holding action such as we had before that you're\nreferring to this holding actions we've had in the past have been to call\npeople's attention for the situation and to test our bargaining strength with the\nprocessor the very much the same way that a labor union for instance has a\ntest of strength when they have a walkout\nor at least to gain the same respect that everyone else has the right to set down\nand bargain in America for a fair price Jim this basically is NFO are we moving- is\nit moving forward now moving forward real well we've been expanding into many\nmore states recently where we have somewhere in the neighborhood of two or\nthree hundred people that are working whatever time they can out in the area\nwe're gaining very rapidly at this time I made this statement many times and\nit's true it's been proven true all the time but everyone in America will\nsupport the NFO plan of action will support the NFO efforts as soon as they\nunderstand again in fact is I will make this statement to anyone anywhere in\nAmerica that's against the principles of the National Farmers Organization are\nagainst American form of government and I say this for two reasons\nthat number one it's been the law of our land for some 23 years now it's been\nlegal for the farmers to band together and organize and do exactly what the NFO\nis doing and number two it's the same business principle that everyone else in\nAmerica uses all the time every day that they're open for business right now can\nI make another point Butch just before you leave me here every community in\nIowa at least every little town that I go to when I Drive down the Main Street\nI see empty buildings businesses used to be in these buildings but now they're\nnot there anymore we can't pin this all down to one little\ncommunity or one group of communities just recently I drove down the Main\nStreet of Cedar Rapids from Marian driving west down First Avenue and right\ndown in the heart of the middle of Cedar Rapids in in an area of a block or a\nblock and a half I counted four or five empty buildings now here's one of our\nleading cities in the state of Iowa Coleman you you saw this yeah I saw that\nthe thing that the thing that impresses me when I see such a thing is I wonder\nwhat it was that caused a businessman who had an investment in a community to\nsay it's got me I can't take it I wonder what it was that caused\nthis man to say there is no future in business and get out of it now this is\nwhat scares me when I see that do you think it's all of the farm, to\nattribute it to the to the farm economy no I don't attribute it to the farm\neconomy if I did I wouldn't I wouldn't keep asking questions I don't know who's\nto blame I keep wondering these points if a man\nwho works in a factory does not make enough money to pay the milk bill I know\nhe can't buy milk so the government says to him look we're gonna give you free\nmilk right now this doesn't make sense to me somebody should pay him enough\nmoney so they can go buy the milk right but if they do this why did- they why did\nthe milk cost 30 cents a quart when it gives given away free to him because he\ndidn't have enough money to get it and the farmer got six and a half cents a\nquart for the milk anyway that he can't buy it either if the farmer didn't have\nthe milk on the farm he doesn't make enough money to bought it either\nnow if the farmer does not produce a milk product he can't buy milk for his\nkids today in many cases now this is the thing that causes me to ask why if\nwork is work and labor is honest I started to ask a question a moment ago\nhere butch says this has been going on for 20-some years actually Arthur capper\nwho was the great friend of the farmer originated the act in 1922 the\ncapper-volstead, 43 years 43 years that's what I was going to correct you\non but thank you for letting me interrupt I didn't mean to and now we're\ngoing to turn to farmer the fellow that farms for a living raising his family\ndoing a real good job farming one of them more or less a big scale not real\nbig scale but as far as a family farm it's considered a real bit operation a good\n50 operation an operation where efficiency is practiced\nwhere's diversified he raises a number of things and Ed would you care to\nfill in as you see it what is the solution of this farm problem so-called\nfarm problem well butch we have in my community over the years a number of our\nreally what you'd call good farmers have been leaving and this trend is\ncontinuing as I see it looking at my community we're by and large we are\nall of us are pretty efficient farmers we have rather large operations we\naren't what you'd call marginal farmers at all but still when I look at the my\nneighbors practically all of them almost without exception are working in the\ntown to supplement their farm income or if they aren't their wives probably are\nalmost without exception now this is a great concern actually then you look at\nthe community I live in fairly good land and fairly good-sized farm operations\nbut still they aren't making a go of it now over the years we've seen these\nhouse farms be become larger being consolidated and going into the future I\nthink this is going to continue then as you look at these farms now they're\nlarge investments it's hard to finance this type of operation as they continue\nto get bigger I can I wonder who's who's going to finance these\ncertainly the family type farmer can't continue to finance a large-\nlarger operation under the present income structure that we have so then\nthe question is what should we do about this and as a farmer in Iowa County Iowa\nit seems to me that we need to look at this in a more businesslike way do like\nbusinessmen do put ourselves in a business position of pricing our\nproducts and in doing this this requires some responsibilities you have to accept\nsome responsibility to price your product you have to accept the\nresponsibility for the surpluses the market might not absorb at this price\nyou have to accept the responsibility for an even flow into the market you\nhave to be in a position to convince a consumer that this product is worth is\nthis increased priced or and without elaborating on these points I think that\nthere's no question what there's only one solution to this problem today as I\nsee it and that's the National Farmers Organization I think that until farmers\nare willing to put their heads together in terms of marketing I don't believe\nthat there's too much hope in improving the farm situation today thank you ed\nand I think you did a real good job summing it up I'd like to touch on what\nit really cost not to have the farmer in balance with Reston\nit not only cost the farmer it costs all of our total economy fact is a survey\nmade by the independent bankers organization this is the small banks or\nrural banks of America where the new wealth originates they've made a survey\nand they prove beyond a shadow of a doubt had the farmers been paid in\nbalance with the workingman and with interest that our total national economy\nwould have been 303 billion I said billion dollars more than it would have\nbeen in 1963 in other words it would have been 50 percent higher everyone in\nAmerica would have profited by increased farm prices because this price would\nnecessarily have to raise at all to the consumer\nfact is consumers were paying far more for a pound of beefsteak\nwhen we were getting 32 dollars and a half or 32 and a half cents a pound for\nour cattle on the hook and we were getting 24 to 25 dollars for hugs then\nthey were paying far less for food than they are now the Department of\nAgriculture shows that while food prices have gone up 29 percent to the consumer\nthe prices that the farmer received for the same amount went down some 12 to 15\npercent so I don't know Coleman who's getting this but I'm beginning to wonder\nlike you who is it when it will help everybody help the total economy and\nhelp everybody in America who is it that would hold down the farmer what is the\nulterior motives behind it to starve out the family farm in America there's no\nquestion about it now the independent bankers made a\nlittle bit farther study they showed that if the farmer had been in balance\nwith the rest of the economy that he would have had twenty one and eight\ntenths billion dollars more than he did receive in 1963 or in other word folks\nfor every dollar that the farmer got to keep or was able to keep in his business\nas income he was cheated out of approximately $2 by somebody somebody\ngot about $2 that should belong to the farmer now had this happened rural or\nbusiness and professional income would have been 11 billion dollars more rental\nincome would have been 4 and 5/10 billion dollars more corporate profits\nof America would have been 10 and 4/10 billions more in other words forget the\nfarm income up where it belongs would cost\nnobody anything wouldn't cost anything at all because the total economy would\nfar more than make it back the working man would get much more income or an\nopportunity to work more hours for instance in the loaf of bread the farmer\nonly receives about 2 and a half cents of it anyway\nso if bread went up 1 cent a loaf the farmer would get 2 or 300 percent more\nprofit than he gets off in the wheat that's in the loaf of bread\nso as you see it costs nobody anything to get the farm price up and it's\ncosting everybody it's costing them billions of dollars three hundred and\nthree billion dollars gross national product because they wouldn't let it\ncome up where it belongs now I wonder why and I would like to say this to you with\nall sincerity if you're not opposed to all this new wealth coming into rural\nAmerica at decent farm prices it's time that you begin to look around as these\nbusinessmen have done begin to look around and see and wonder who is causing\nthe farm prices to be low who is getting this extra money that all should be\navailable to the farmers and to all of our economy on an equal basis I think\nit's time that we look around now in closing I would like to call on the rest\nof the farmers in America to become good businessmen and women and set our\npattern up in a businesslike structure and operate our business by all except a\ngood business principles this program today has been brought to\nyou by the farmers in this listening area and others interested in seeing the\nfarmer get a fair price tune in again next week for more information and join\nthe farmers of America to solve the [music]\nnext week for more information and join\nthe farmers of America to solve the problem thank you",
