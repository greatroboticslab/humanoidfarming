1
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,179
get at it is

2
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,379
almost

3
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,800
hi everyone my name is Valentin and I'm

4
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,140
here on behalf of community language

5
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,000
cooperative and I'm here to provide and

6
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,640
guarantee your commitment to language

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,979
Justice language Justice is a type of

8
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,600
simultaneous interpretation that seeks

9
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,820
to create spaces in which no one

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,140
language is dominant spaces in which

11
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,460
everyone can participate with the

12
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,439
language of their heart

13
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,659
so to achieve this objective we will be

14
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,860
using zoom's interpretation feature what

15
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,180
you will see in a couple of minutes is

16
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,799
that I need a little button that looks

17
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,720
like a globe will appear on the bottom

18
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,340
bar of your screen on that same bar

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,080

45
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,819

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,379

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,440
extra special

190
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:30,720
um so I'm really curious for all of us

191
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,300
to get a little sense of what experience

192
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,100
anyone here has had with any USDA

193
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,220
programming in this bucket so the United

194
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,980
States Department of Agriculture is the

195
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:48,420
big department that the nrcs natural

196
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:51,420
resource conservation service is under

197
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,640
um and so I'm hoping folks can use the

198
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,380
raise hand function which is in your

199
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,660
reactions if you see a little smiley

200
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,339
face emoji you can click on it and it'll

201
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,200
give you a raised hand in the lower hand

202
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,300
so we're going to go up and down a few

203
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,120
times

204
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:11,160
um but just wanted to jump in and say

205
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:14,720
who here has registered signed up with

206
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,720
the Farm Service Agency

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,640
yeah let us know right on so that's the

208
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,080
FSA Farm Service Agency it's an acronym

209
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,300
that the need to know in the

210
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,360
conversation we're having and they're

211
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,820
the first step to being able to access

212
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,480
nrcs programming if you don't sign up

213
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,339
and get a farm and track number with the

214
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,220
Farm Service Agency and there's a local

215
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:40,560
office in not all counties but many

216
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,100
counties and I'm sure we'll throw up in

217
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,160
the chat a link to how to find those

218
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:50,040
um you can apply for any nrcs programs

219
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,140
and there's a whole other bucket of

220
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,880
support and assistance that comes to the

221
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,279
Farm Service Agency that we're not going

222
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,320
to talk about but good for you everybody

223
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:02,220
who signed up you can lower your hand

224
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,980
awesome congratulations you have taken

225
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,260
you've opened the door to Opportunity by

226
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,079
doing so you've also ensured that your

227
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,660
farm gets invited to be counted in the

228
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,640
AG census which in New Mexico we're

229
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,459
super undercounted as small world

230
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,380
largely indoorspano farms and just like

231
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:22,980
with the regular senses it can impact

232
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:26,160
the resources that go to our regions so

233
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,660
there's an equity aspect and

234
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,579
um you know for this group beginning

235
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,920
Farmers we want beginning farmers and

236
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:34,740
ranchers counted too so

237
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,920
I think you got my point on FSA

238
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:41,339
here's the next question

239
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,860
how many here have ever applied

240
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:46,380
to nrcs it doesn't mean that you

241
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,339
received a grant or it's not a grant

242
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,820
you're not supposed to use that word

243
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:54,120
cost assistance but okay right on my

244
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,700
dogs are gonna go crazy now great timing

245
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,160
neighbors dropping by and honking at me

246
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,399
and that's all they're gonna get is dog

247
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,399
bark

248
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,260
one second

249
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,260
foreign

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,700
okay I have a taped to a room that's

251
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,120
further away from the animals and

252
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,279
visitors pardon the interruption that's

253
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,680
part of just how we roll in our rural

254
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,220
community stopping by for visits

255
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,500
um so I see a bunch of you have applied

256
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,720
it would be really cool if folks want to

257
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,240
throw in the chat some of the practices

258
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,380
that you've applied for and that's a

259
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,320
term that nrcs uses to describe are you

260
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:12,360
applying for irrigation practices High

261
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:14,639
tunnel practices soil Health initiatives

262
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,700
um Aaron's going to go way deeper into

263
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:21,380
what some of those options are and the

264
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:23,760
cost share and reimbursement type of

265
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,380
on-farm improvements

266
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,120
um right on high tunnel that's that was

267
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,240
my it's a really good point of entrance

268
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,579
to nrcs programs is the high tunnel work

269
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,779
so right on and feel free to keep

270
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:36,420
sharing those because I think it's

271
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:40,560
really helpful from a peer-to-peer

272
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:43,139
experience to see what other people are

273
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,940
interested in and what potentially is

274
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,440
working for them

275
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,120
um and I think Aaron will touch on what

276
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,100
some of the most popular programs are

277
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,260
but if we let him know what we're really

278
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,740
interested in he might be able to best

279
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:57,480
speak to some of those programs too

280
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,779
so

281
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,000
um and that last question I'm going to

282
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:04,800
ask well main last question so you can

283
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,800
lower your hands if you put them up

284
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,100
congratulations on applying

285
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,620
um way to go and then the final one to

286
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,639
have you received

287
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:20,519
um a contract or implemented an nrcs

288
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,260
program and so if you want to raise your

289
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,980
hand if you've implemented one we can

290
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:27,899
see who the the veterans are in the

291
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,220
crowd yeah we got some folks with

292
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,220
knowledge so you guys could be

293
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,540
co-hosting with us up here and what's up

294
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,060
CJ

295
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,880
um explaining your experience uh right

296
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,800
on good work and one of the things you

297
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,899
all have probably found

298
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,180
um and I know I experienced is that once

299
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,459
you implement a practice and your

300
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,860
neighbors find out about it you become

301
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:52,440
an emissary for these programs and it

302
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,120
just multiplies after that so my mentor

303
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,639
I moved to New Mexico to work with Don

304
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,680
Bustos who's a Visionary farmer in our

305
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,019
region and he was like the first guy in

306
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,360
the north to do high tunnels and then he

307
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:06,180
did them and I did them and they're just

308
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,320
like multiplied and we see it in our

309
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,240
arid

310
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,880
um high altitude climate as like a

311
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,199
climate change adapting to seasonal

312
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,800
change

313
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,300
um

314
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,880
strategy

315
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:19,139
so we've had a lot of fun and I love the

316
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,360
plastic part but we've had a lot of fun

317
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:24,180
replicating that and creating a lot of

318
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,000
farmer's market opportunities for folks

319
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:29,399
um and then lastly if you haven't

320
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,139
applied and you don't even know what the

321
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,699
programs are but just you know what's

322
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:35,040
the kind of support you're looking for

323
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:37,980
on your farm that you think brought you

324
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,260
to this Workshop you know what what is

325
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:43,260
it that you have a need for

326
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,660
um that you're hoping nrcs might be able

327
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,579
to address and if you want to throw that

328
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,519
in the chat oh my gosh it's so cool

329
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:52,079
another dumb was still spin he says

330
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:53,760
woohoo that's like his woohoo by the way

331
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,740
if you know

332
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,120
um

333
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,860
and he changed my life I wouldn't even

334
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,139
be here in this whole chapter of my life

335
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,100
if it wasn't for Dom boosters total

336
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,980
homage

337
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,360
anyhow that's a longer story than we're

338
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,620
here for today

339
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,899
so

340
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,639
um thank y'all for your input and your

341
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,260
sharing and just like your engagement

342
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,420
like you're doing it and way to show up

343
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,100
to his Workshop just to get any tips and

344
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,760
tricks you can

345
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,399
um I want to talk briefly about why the

346
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,440
New Mexico a second sensation and if you

347
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,300
don't know where to secure that's a

348
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,480
traditional irrigation canal that's

349
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:34,500
Community run we're a local political

350
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,320
government and I'll leave it at that

351
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,720
um but we work with Farmers across the

352
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,820
state to protect our water rights our

353
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,220
cultural traditions and grow healthy

354
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,779
food for our families

355
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,380
and

356
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:51,420
um we're doing this work really honoring

357
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,899
and as a part of the legacy of Southern

358
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:58,500
black farmers who stood up and addressed

359
00:16:54,899 --> 00:17:00,360
Injustice systemic discrimination within

360
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,040
the USDA

361
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,260
I'm the United States Department of

362
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,500
Agriculture

363
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:10,020
excluding a number of different

364
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,939
um communities and in New Mexico that

365
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,100
was largely indo-ispano farmers and

366
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,400
ranchers in the south in the case the

367
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,199
Pickford case that was settled in 2010

368
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,780
that was black Farmers across the

369
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:25,319
country but especially in the South and

370
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:27,500
so many communities including women at

371
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,000
times have been historically

372
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,640
marginalized marginalized and kept out

373
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,100
of these programs and that funding and

374
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,760
support for our farms and ranches was

375
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:42,059
denied anime gets a grant from the USDA

376
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:45,179
to do Outreach into historically

377
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:48,240
underserved communities and nrcs has

378
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:51,419
changed a lot even in the last decade or

379
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,299
two and we have some awesome folks in

380
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:56,160
our local County offices who look and

381
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,320
experience more of what our communities

382
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,940
look like as well as energy as being a

383
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,559
national org so we have movement from

384
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,380
across the country with folks who

385
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:08,580
understand and are allied with local

386
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,320
farms and ranches so for us it's part of

387
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,080
our social justice mission

388
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,860
to ensure that our communities who have

389
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,940
in so many ways been historically

390
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,760
disenfranchised feel like they have a

391
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,559
seat at the table and have access to

392
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,200
these programs so we do a lot of what we

393
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,000
call hand-holding to get people their

394
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,760
Farm Service

395
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,679
um registration done and to apply for

396
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,580
these programs and to some

397
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,799
lesser degree Implement them we also we

398
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,720
just went through historic and tragic

399
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:42,059
Wildfire season in New Mexico and we

400
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,140
know with climate change whether you

401
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,059
know you're in the Midwest and you're

402
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,340
getting flooding these climate disasters

403
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,840
are coming and they're coming hard and

404
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,000
they're hitting farmers and ranchers

405
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,780
particularly hard

406
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,720
um

407
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:58,140
so we realized more than we ever had

408
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,020
that ewp program emergency Watershed

409
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,299
program Aaron referenced you you want to

410
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,520
be a part of the system if you want to

411
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:08,100
access a lot of the Disaster Assistance

412
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,260
if you lose livestock you need to be

413
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,240
registered to the Farm Service Agency

414
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,419
for the livestock indemnification

415
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,299
program and I could go on so registering

416
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:22,200
with Farm Service Agency is an important

417
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:24,480
step to being prepared for disasters

418
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,220
um and for some degree of relief but

419
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,919
also for some programs that can help

420
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:32,160
mitigate and make us more resilient to

421
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,140
disasters that come

422
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,059
um and in general we think there's a lot

423
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,220
of great strategies we're for anything

424
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:40,320
that helps our local farms be more

425
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,500
viable for us

426
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,679
um growing food for Community is a very

427
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:50,100
deep value and something we really still

428
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,700
depend on in Northern New Mexico

429
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,000
um

430
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:57,240
but we also think the practice is nrcs

431
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,179
office offers can be useful in climate

432
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,440
change adaptation overall

433
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:04,200
um

434
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,860
I think the last few things that I would

435
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,559
mention is that it is paperwork it is

436
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:13,080
bureaucracy it's really none of our

437
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,960
favorite things to be in the system and

438
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,400
have to kind of follow

439
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,280
um the specs

440
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,880
um that are exterior to us but I really

441
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:26,640
encourage you all to explore the

442
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:29,100
offerings to reach out to your local

443
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,580
County offices both of the Farm Service

444
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:36,480
Agency and the nrcs

445
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,580
in order to establish relationships

446
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,799
create a site visit that's the number

447
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,780
one after you do FSA it's all about

448
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:46,860
getting a site visit so you can learn

449
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:50,400
more about what might work on your farm

450
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,600
your local nrcs rep is an ally and

451
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,120
someone who's there to give you

452
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,039
technical assistance whether or not you

453
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,500
want to apply for any programs to get

454
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,400
feedback to get support

455
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,559
um

456
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,799
and so we just really encourage everyone

457
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:07,440
to know the ins and outs of a contract

458
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,299
before they're signing it I have lots of

459
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,299
thoughts on that

460
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:14,039
um and you know then just go ahead and

461
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,660
once you feel confident jump into feet

462
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,760
first but I think one of the best things

463
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,039
is connecting with folks locally who've

464
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,320
done a similar program and gaining

465
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:24,960
lessons learned from them

466
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,720
um so with that I just wish all of you a

467
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,360
bountiful happy safe growing season that

468
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,120
you find all the resources that you need

469
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,980
and if you are a farmer a Rancher

470
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,080
um often a sick in New Mexico the anime

471
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,059
A is here to provide more detailed

472
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,740
technical assistance I'm looking forward

473
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:42,299
to the rest of the meeting and

474
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,460
potentially supporting with any

475
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:48,200
questions you all have and now you've

476
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,200
seen my bathroom while we're at it too

477
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,299
foreign

478
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,000
if you could please put your contact

479
00:21:54,299 --> 00:22:00,000
information in the chat

480
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,520
um we also have a New Mexico nrcs staff

481
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,520
here Aaron who's going to share a little

482
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,620
more for those of you who may not be as

483
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,960
familiar with who the natural resources

484
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,400
conservation Services is and what they

485
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,260
do

486
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,460
all righty thank you so I'll go ahead

487
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,460
and share my screen

488
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,580
all right well uh again good morning

489
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,940
good afternoon everybody

490
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:34,980
um again my name is Aaron Reynolds and I

491
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,919
am a resource conservationist with the

492
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,860
natural resource conservation Service uh

493
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,419
based out of Albuquerque for this first

494
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,900
portion that I'm going to present on

495
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:50,039
it's mainly going to be around what nrcs

496
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:52,080
is and what our two major programs we

497
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:55,080
like to see I know there's been a lot of

498
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,559
mentioned of the ewp or the emergency

499
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,120
Watershed Protection Program and

500
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,460
um at the end of the presentation I can

501
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,460
mention what that program is because it

502
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,860
is significantly different than any of

503
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,539
our other programs that we offer to

504
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,700
people and it's mainly based around

505
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:14,100
natural disasters

506
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,380
um fires and floods and things of that

507
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,080
nature that pose a threat to human life

508
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,880
and property but at this point in time

509
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,100
I'm not going to go too much into depth

510
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,659
on it

511
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,940
so my contact information is on the

512
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:29,400
slides and these slides will be shared

513
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,080
with everyone but I can also put my

514
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,000
contact information in the chat for

515
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,620
people

516
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,299
um so

517
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,740
um just giving a brief introduction

518
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:40,200
about myself

519
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,600
um I've been with the agency going on 12

520
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,360
years now I've actually worked in

521
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,100
multiple States so I'm originally from

522
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,559
Wisconsin where I grew up on a small

523
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,780
farm and started within RCS in the

524
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:55,620
midwest then I actually moved to

525
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:58,500
Colorado and I worked out on the Eastern

526
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:00,960
Plains on more conventional agricultural

527
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,539
operations and then I moved to New

528
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,820
Mexico where I eventually ended up in

529
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:09,000
Albuquerque as a resource

530
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:13,919
conservationist or program manager

531
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,500
so uh for those who don't know nrcs is

532
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,080
an agency within the United States

533
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,679
Department of Agriculture so this is a

534
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,480
federal agency and um very commonly we

535
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:27,380
work with a lot of conservation

536
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,760
districts locally in areas and other

537
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:35,000
organizations that assist farmers and

538
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:37,080
ranchers to improve their operations but

539
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,720
nrcs or the natural resources

540
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:43,080
conservation service provides landowners

541
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,080
with technical assistance and a vice

542
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,940
advice for their land specifically and

543
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,480
one of the things I always like to

544
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,760
mention to nrcs staff and also the

545
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,280
landowners is that those local

546
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,860
landowners know their land better than

547
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:01,559
anybody else you know we just come in

548
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,360
and try to help them improve their

549
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:07,799
Landing continue what they're trying to

550
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:10,320
achieve on that land so nrcs provides

551
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:14,640
common technical goal assistance in the

552
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,520
area will assess resource resources and

553
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,780
then we'll also come in with practice

554
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,400
design and resource monitoring

555
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,200
all of this is done throughout the what

556
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,419
we call the conservation planning

557
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,640
process and

558
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:31,740
um you know it's a very fluid motion and

559
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,080
it changes depending on what the needs

560
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,659
of that landowner are so that's just

561
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,360
briefly where nrcs comes in is that

562
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:42,059
we're a scientific scientific and

563
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,059
Technical based agency that will assist

564
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:46,620
uh you know landowners and again I'll

565
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,960
get it more into the details of who's

566
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,020
eligible and what are the requirements

567
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,659
for our programs but there is financial

568
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,919
assistance to implement a lot of these

569
00:25:54,659 --> 00:26:00,059
programs

570
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:02,100
so um for those who don't know um nrcs

571
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:07,140
used to be called The Soil Conservation

572
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:09,720
service and the roots of nrcs is

573
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,520
um based in the 1930s and the Dust Bowl

574
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,400
so if people

575
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,799
um can recall back to their history

576
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,779
courses the Dust Bowl was a time in

577
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,080
American history where there was a lot

578
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:23,760
of tillage occurring and soil in the air

579
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,980
and

580
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,279
um you know the president at that time

581
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,860
so FDR actually saw the need to

582
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,080
implement

583
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:37,380
conservation Nationwide and thus that's

584
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,080
how nrcs was born

585
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:44,340
um nrcs has evolved and I should say

586
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:49,140
changed tremendously in recent years and

587
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:52,559
now our Focus has expanded to

588
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:55,559
um soil water air plant and animals

589
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,360
there are soil resource concerns so um

590
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,820
it's a much different agency and it's a

591
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,940
much broader agency than what it used to

592
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,940
be

593
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,960
um so

594
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:09,960
as mentioned I'm gonna the two cost

595
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:15,240
share programs that we have through nrcs

596
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:16,980
are the equip program and CSP so in

597
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,960
simple terms um

598
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,580
because we don't have enough time to go

599
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,679
in depth on all these programs so I'm

600
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:26,400
just going to give a brief summary of

601
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:29,279
what each one of these programs are and

602
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,720
then we can build from there so the

603
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,140
first program that I'm going to mention

604
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,520
is the Environmental Quality incentive

605
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,640
program

606
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,460
and uh we call it short we call it equip

607
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,640
as its acronym and it provides Technical

608
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,220
and financial assistance to producers to

609
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,400
address a natural resource concerns

610
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:53,100
deliver environmental benefits through

611
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,100
conservation practices to protect soil

612
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,620
water air and other natural resources

613
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,679
concerns and in simple terms the way you

614
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,960
look at this is equip treat specific

615
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,320
concerns and I'm going to provide a few

616
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,240
scenarios of how equip is used and then

617
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,220
eventually our um

618
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,419
guest presenter that has actually

619
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:17,880
implemented this can describe how they

620
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:20,400
installed these practices so

621
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,500
as mentioned eqip is very specific you

622
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,720
have one resource concern that you're

623
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,240
trying to treat so

624
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,419
um one of the common uh comments that I

625
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:34,140
saw was a lot of people utilize them for

626
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:36,360
high tunnels and when high tunnels are

627
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:39,360
installed which um I guess real briefly

628
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:42,140
what a high tunnel is a high tunnel is a

629
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,360
structure that is covered in plastic

630
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:47,159
that extends your growing season so you

631
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,460
can start for example your cool season

632
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,140
crops earlier or get some of those warm

633
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,179
season crops to go a little later

634
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,820
depending on what you need them

635
00:28:54,179 --> 00:29:00,419
so through eqip

636
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:03,600
um you could receive cost share on the

637
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:06,299
high tunnel itself the irrigation inside

638
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,940
that high tunnel there are some specific

639
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:11,159
requirements on the irrigation and

640
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,960
what's needed to meet the install and

641
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:15,240
irrigation but you could have the

642
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,039
irrigation you could have nutrient

643
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,520
management which is testing your soil

644
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,980
and get an idea of you know how many how

645
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:27,299
much of nutrients do I need in my soil

646
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,559
to achieve my desired yield goal and

647
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,720
then also

648
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,380
um there's things like Pest Management

649
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,480
to manage disease and other pests that

650
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,880
could damage you and then also one

651
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,640
called irrigation Water Management to

652
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,159
better manage your water usage on your

653
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,520
property and you know that's just one

654
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,260
specific example of how equip could be

655
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,640
used for this

656
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,100
um you know eventually I'll talk about

657
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,840
some of the land uses that equip could

658
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,899
be used on you know because it can range

659
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:01,020
from forestry can range from rangeland

660
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:03,659
pasture crop land so there's a it's a

661
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,520
variable program that gives you a lot of

662
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:09,480
flexibility depending on what your

663
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,140
specific needs are for this program

664
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,179
um

665
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,320
then the next program I'm going to

666
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:16,919
mention and this isn't one of the

667
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:19,080
programs I manage specifically

668
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:22,919
but it's called our conservation

669
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:25,020
stewardship program and simply put the

670
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:28,679
conservation stewardship program

671
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:30,299
the goal of the program is to build on

672
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,159
good conservation that you're already

673
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:33,720
doing so you're far if you're already

674
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,779
testing your soil if you're already

675
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,240
monitoring your water it assists those

676
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:41,640
producers to take it to a Next Level and

677
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,240
do more advanced forms of those

678
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:48,299
conservation systems and specifically on

679
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,720
the CSP program that makes it unique is

680
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:54,539
in order to be eligible for CSP

681
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,820
um you have to sign up for five years at

682
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:59,340
one time equip doesn't have that

683
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:02,100
requirement equip can be a one and done

684
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,799
up to 10 years to get your work done but

685
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,779
you won't be tied into the program

686
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:08,279
through equip

687
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:09,960
um and then

688
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:13,500
that's going to be just a pretty good

689
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,240
summary of the programs um eventually I

690
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,480
will talk about some of the eligibility

691
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,820
of the programs and what all goes into

692
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,860
um actually signing up

693
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:25,580
so I'll go ahead and hand it off to the

694
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,580
next presenter

695
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,940
all right well I'm just gonna jump in

696
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,220
then

697
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,419
um and say hello to everybody I think

698
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,419
I'm next is that right

699
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,760
um all right so my name is Ellie for

700
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,539
those of you that weren't on the call

701
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,960
yet

702
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:51,419
um I'm from solidarity farm and

703
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,059
um I am going to share my screen so that

704
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:55,500
you guys can see some pictures

705
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:58,760
of

706
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,299
um what we do

707
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,580
[Music]

708
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:04,620
all right

709
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:08,100
so what I'm excited to talk to you today

710
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:10,080
is is how we've leveraged nrcs and

711
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:13,200
combined it with other resources to make

712
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,940
it really work for our farm

713
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,039
um and just want to start by saying that

714
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,419
you know solidarity Farm is a modest

715
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,700
sized Farm

716
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:23,520
um we prefer we produce um Diversified

717
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,020
fruits and vegetables and we collaborate

718
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,240
with our neighbors

719
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:30,059
um through a small farm Distribution

720
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Company called food shed

721
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:34,380
um and you know we

722
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,899
um

723
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,480
well we Farm probably at any given time

724
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:42,539
about five out of those 10 acres and

725
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,919
we've been doing it for about 10 years

726
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:45,659
um so I'm going to start just by telling

727
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,140
you guys a story about a really

728
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:51,899
important year which was 2017.

729
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,360
um we you know had just really gotten

730
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:55,500
our feet under us and had had crops in

731
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,200
the ground and we're selling

732
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,820
commercially and our kids were involved

733
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,799
on the farm

734
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:05,340
um and we had a heat event that was

735
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:08,159
about 122 degrees following a winter of

736
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:11,520
severe freezing and

737
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:14,159
um we understood that if we didn't get

738
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,779
serious about

739
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,340
um really investing in our soil and

740
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:19,260
figuring out how to be more resilient

741
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,899
that we were not going

742
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:24,779
um to be able to continue farming and we

743
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:27,960
really wanted our kids to to see that

744
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:29,899
you know you can adapt to challenges

745
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,179
um and that you have to adapt in order

746
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:35,940
in order to survive so that was really

747
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:37,620
our our impetus and so we came up with

748
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,899
these four goals

749
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:42,120
um and I also really quick want to give

750
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:43,919
a shout out about that time

751
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,919
um we had a

752
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,779
um a intern or an apprentice come to

753
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,820
stay on the farm named Andy Williamson

754
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:53,220
who's on the call today

755
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,919
um who really pushed us also to to try

756
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,899
out some of these practices so

757
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,240
um I just want to acknowledge Him and

758
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:02,100
how important he was to us

759
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,559
um but we decided that if we wanted to

760
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,600
keep farming we really need to needed to

761
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,879
invest in four things right we needed to

762
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,879
keep our soil covered we needed to

763
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,040
improve water delivery efficiency we

764
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:16,740
needed to reduce evaporation that was

765
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,659
caused by wind and we needed to buffer

766
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,940
against cold and heat events with better

767
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:24,000
infrastructure and and that's a picture

768
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,919
of the barn that was toppled by the

769
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,500
winds that we get these winds called

770
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,119
Santa anas out in in San Diego

771
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,919
and so

772
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,320
um we really you know it was that same

773
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,599
year that that Barn fell down

774
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,020
um and so just sharing that the impacts

775
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:41,820
um that pushed us were pretty severe

776
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:45,179
I realize I'm talking too quickly I'm

777
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:48,480
going to slow down for interpretation

778
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:50,399
um and so in our need in our desire to

779
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,320
address these four

780
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,560
um these four issues we looked around

781
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,660
for allies and resources

782
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,359
um and obviously today we're gonna um

783
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:02,099
we're talking about nrcs

784
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:04,440
um but I just want to acknowledge that

785
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:07,140
there were three other resources that we

786
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,359
we really relied on one is called the

787
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:12,180
healthy soils program

788
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:15,200
um which is a California state program

789
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:18,540
uh zero food print which is a private

790
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,280
Foundation that leverages money for um

791
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,320
through restaurants

792
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,320
um for regenerative agriculture

793
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,240
and then the coastal conservancy and I

794
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,760
just want to point out that you know we

795
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,920
need as Farmers we need to to leverage

796
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,079
all of these resources and find out

797
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,540
what's happening in our area because

798
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,099
there really isn't a one-size-fit-all

799
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,599
program

800
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:41,599
um that can help us get the job done

801
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,520
so here are the practices that we have

802
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:51,359
implemented

803
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:53,940
with an nrcs conservation equip Grant we

804
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:56,220
have been able to put in hedgerows and

805
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:59,220
wind breaks and we've improved our

806
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,680
irrigation efficiency so we used a lot

807
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:04,740
of lay flat to move the water all the

808
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,720
way across our farm and we were able

809
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:11,339
within our CS funds to put those pipes

810
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,900
underground and get you know um new new

811
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:14,820
Outlets closer to the fields that we

812
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,720
were working in

813
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,460
um and uh two high tunnels and in in our

814
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,500
first round of equip

815
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,420
um our healthy soils Grant

816
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,119
um from California Department of food

817
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,660
and agriculture let us address cover

818
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,560
cropping and reducing tillage on our

819
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,260
farm

820
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,000
zero food print brought in the compost

821
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,760
that we needed

822
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,560
and the coastal Conservancy

823
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,820
um helped us to or supported our

824
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,599
perennial some of our perennial

825
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:48,119
transition and allowed us to use native

826
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,339
more drought tolerance seed in our cover

827
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,740
crop which was really important to

828
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:56,400
Southern California but wasn't something

829
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:58,859
that was affordable given that the nrcs

830
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,920
practice really covered you know cheaper

831
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:05,880
seed like barley

832
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:08,160
foreign so some of the challenges

833
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,320
um to consider words of wisdom for

834
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,079
things that we learned

835
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,980
um as short-term renters our landlords

836
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:18,359
had to agree to facilitate this process

837
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,540
um we were really grateful that our

838
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:23,760
landlords saw the benefit and they LED

839
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:27,300
on this

840
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,640
um we found that nrcs was busy our local

841
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:33,480
office was busy and we had to be

842
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:34,380
persistent to get our first meeting

843
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,359
um

844
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,220
and this is the part that I think is

845
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:39,660
really important for smaller scale farms

846
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,160
and I I saw in the chat when we were

847
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,619
getting started that people are already

848
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,260
kind of aware of this but

849
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:49,079
um you know a lot of these programs are

850
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,940
cost reimbursement and so it requires

851
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,619
really thoughtful planning and

852
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,180
partnership

853
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:55,680
um to really think about how you're

854
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,000
gonna Fork out the money for these

855
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,280
practices and then wait for

856
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,720
reimbursement

857
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,540
um and I thought it was really

858
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,119
interesting that nrcs could not tell us

859
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:08,880
how much something might cost to

860
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,320
actually Implement in our area and they

861
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,359
really could only tell us what the

862
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,180
reimbursement rate was

863
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:17,280
um and so that was a little intimidating

864
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,440
um because you know you're getting into

865
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,780
it Without Really knowing what how

866
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,460
expensive everything's going to be so do

867
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,859
your homework and build a budget for

868
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,540
yourself and don't assume that the cost

869
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:29,700
is actually going to cover what you need

870
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,920
for your area

871
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,619
and the other thing is that your local

872
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,800
nrcs office may not have the expertise

873
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:40,020
that you need in-house so we live in an

874
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,060
area that's very

875
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:46,280
um it's full of citrus and avocado

876
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:49,380
farmers and so our local technical

877
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,599
advisors are really great at Citrus and

878
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,780
avocado but they don't have a lot of

879
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:58,079
knowledge about row crops and so you

880
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:01,619
need to Advocate that your nrcs folks

881
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,900
reach outside of their comfort zone and

882
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:08,099
and to other Ally you know other staff

883
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:10,920
in nrcs who have that expertise

884
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:13,740
and then finally you need to account for

885
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,500
specialized equipment needs as you apply

886
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:18,660
for the practice so something like if

887
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,000
you're putting in cover crop and you're

888
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:24,060
reducing tillage you might need access

889
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,220
to a no-till seed drill

890
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,380
um but you you know you don't want to or

891
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:31,200
can't afford to go out and buy one just

892
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:33,720
for the practice right or you might need

893
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,520
to rent scaffolding to be able to put up

894
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,960
your high tunnel or you might need a

895
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,820
mulch spreader

896
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,980
um that that you don't quite have yet so

897
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,900
really think about what you actually

898
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,520
need to implement and if it's even

899
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,520
available in your area

900
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:53,280
so ways to overcome some of these

901
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:55,140
barriers I do want to say that bringing

902
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,079
you know advocating and bringing that

903
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:00,839
nrcs person out early

904
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,480
um and then trusting the process

905
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:06,180
um is is really important

906
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:09,300
um don't do too much homework before you

907
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:12,060
actually bring them out to your farm

908
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:14,700
um you can ask a resource Conservation

909
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,680
District or other ta providers in your

910
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,560
area to connect you with a mentor

911
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,180
another farmer who's done this work

912
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,859
before

913
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,740
um I think is really would be really

914
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:27,720
really helpful and advised

915
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:30,660
um and you can advocate for overlapping

916
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,599
your practices so the field Prep Plus

917
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:36,420
the irrigation plus the planting so that

918
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,220
you can maximize the reimbursement

919
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,980
um and make sure you can actually cover

920
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,240
your costs

921
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,200
um and this one I think is really

922
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,359
important

923
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,760
um to overcome that barrier of cost

924
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,339
reimbursement you can find a lending

925
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,260
partner that understands the nrcs

926
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:54,540
program so I noticed someone was here

927
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:57,660
from farmlink today California farmlink

928
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:01,500
or even the Farm Service Agency if you

929
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:04,800
have an NRC if you have a nrcs equip

930
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,500
contract you should be able to get a

931
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,320
loan right to match that contract and

932
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,940
then when you get paid back by nrcs you

933
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,240
could use that money to pay back the

934
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:17,760
loan now the terms and the length and

935
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,619
all that is something to consider but it

936
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,020
could be a really great opportunity to

937
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:25,440
build your credit and to and to make

938
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:27,780
those two sort of programs mesh together

939
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,460
and then finally you can look for

940
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,220
contractors

941
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,160
um that can that you can pay with nrcs

942
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:37,500
funds to help you install the practice

943
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,300
so for example this is a picture

944
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:42,060
um of a gentleman from Fresno so

945
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:44,280
Fresno's Way North in California we had

946
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:46,020
to pay him to drive his no-till seed

947
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,300
drill all the way down because one

948
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:51,000
didn't exist to do our cover cropping

949
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:53,220
practice in San Diego

950
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,140
um but he had the expertise and he just

951
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,359
busted it out and it actually ended up

952
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,520
being more affordable than if we had

953
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,099
tried to figure out how to broadcast it

954
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,380
or do it ourselves so definitely look

955
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:06,800
for people who can help you with the

956
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,800
practices

957
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,880
um because we're farmers and and really

958
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:14,579
implementing this practice these

959
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,320
practices is all about our bottom line

960
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:19,140
um I wanted to share some of the impact

961
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,480
that this programs have had for us

962
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:24,599
um we have definitely seen a reduction

963
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,400
in losses during extreme weather events

964
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:27,960
um because of the practices that we've

965
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,180
implemented

966
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,359
we've seen our soil organic matter

967
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:35,040
increase from about the you know the

968
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,500
normal threshold which is about one

969
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,000
percent to seven percent in some of the

970
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,420
areas that we've really been applying

971
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,820
these soil building techniques

972
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:47,099
um that additional soil organic matter

973
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:50,520
has a huge impact

974
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:52,020
um on reducing our water bill

975
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,720
and

976
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,760
um the hedgerows also have had a big

977
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,560
impact in reducing the wind that's

978
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,140
directly hitting the beds that are

979
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,839
behind them and that also has an impact

980
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:06,599
on reducing our summer water bill

981
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,119
we've also seen improved pollination

982
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:10,800
rates and yields near the hedgerows

983
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,440
although we're just really starting to

984
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,500
be able to monitor that

985
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,920
as our hedgers are getting bigger

986
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:22,560
um and we've seen this is a big one

987
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,900
we've seen improved infiltration and

988
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,180
reduced flooding during Heavy Rain

989
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:31,440
events

990
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:33,599
and we've seen Financial gains from the

991
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,480
season extension that our high tunnels

992
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,300
bring that's really a huge one and why I

993
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,680
think Kai tunnels are the most popular

994
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,819
or one of the most popular nrcs

995
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,800
practices

996
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:45,540
and then finally you know really

997
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,599
investing into bringing this diversity

998
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:51,119
onto our farm gives us an opportunity to

999
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,579
bring education and other types of

1000
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,680
activities onto the farm so this is an

1001
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:57,420
herbalism class for kids

1002
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,240
um and and just wanted to kind of share

1003
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:03,060
that um there are sort of benefits

1004
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,060
outside of just the economic ones

1005
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,859
um to your community

1006
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,780
so I'll close with that this is my

1007
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:12,240
contact information

1008
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,339
um and happy to you know kind of connect

1009
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,579
and answer any questions you all might

1010
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:16,579
have

1011
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:26,099
wow congratulations those are some

1012
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:29,339
really huge successes to uplift

1013
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:32,180
um and more specifically wanted to go

1014
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:35,339
into a few of those programs some that

1015
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:37,079
solidarity Farms using others that

1016
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:40,740
you've heard mentioned

1017
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:43,680
um and also if you're having any trouble

1018
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:46,500
keeping track of the different acronyms

1019
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:51,240
being thrown around I did post in the

1020
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:55,800
chat uh key uh acronym sheet as well as

1021
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:57,240
steps for receiving USDA assistance and

1022
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,300
then we're going to pass it back to

1023
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,760
Aaron to to go into more specifics

1024
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,099
great thank you and Ella that was great

1025
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,079
to hear that story and hear the local

1026
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:08,819
benefits and your goals being met on

1027
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,500
that operation

1028
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:12,000
um real quick before I get into the

1029
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,060
presentation

1030
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,800
um I'm a big fan of soil health I like

1031
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,140
hearing that you're implementing soil

1032
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,740
health and helping the system just reach

1033
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:24,839
its natural state because our soil is so

1034
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,760
unhealthy at this point so that's great

1035
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:29,460
to hear you're you know reaching for

1036
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,720
those goals to improve your soil which

1037
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,540
ultimately is going to make your

1038
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,819
pocketbook a lot bigger as well so

1039
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:38,280
um that's very great to hear

1040
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:42,319
so um

1041
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,319
I'll bring up my slides again

1042
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:48,540
um and I Ellie was talking about the

1043
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,940
high tunnels this was a high tunnel I

1044
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:53,400
actually worked on in New Mexico

1045
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,900
um in Southwest in the Gila that we

1046
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,000
installed for him and you can see the

1047
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,339
benefit this is having for him

1048
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,240
specifically so

1049
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:06,380
um what I'm gonna review today is I'm

1050
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:10,140
going to briefly review the

1051
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:12,480
application process through nrcs there

1052
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,980
is a link that does go a bit more in

1053
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,160
depth that you can follow that's been

1054
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,839
posted in the chat and it just explains

1055
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:23,280
all these different sections from the

1056
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:25,380
planning application eligibility ranking

1057
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,880
and then the implementation as well and

1058
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,980
I'll mention a little bit about the

1059
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,780
implementation towards the end of this

1060
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:33,900
presentation as well and how the

1061
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:36,300
reimbursement program works and some of

1062
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,579
the things I like to recommend to a lot

1063
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:42,599
of the farmers to implement the

1064
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:44,700
practices and not go Belly Up and afford

1065
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,680
to do the good the good conservation

1066
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,220
work as well

1067
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,560
um

1068
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,700
so as mentioned

1069
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:54,780
um

1070
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:57,000
almost every county has an nrcs office

1071
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,680
in there but there are going to be a few

1072
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,960
scenarios where there's not an office

1073
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:04,020
there and

1074
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,180
with how an RCS programs work it's very

1075
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,940
personal and it's based on your

1076
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:11,700
operation so we need to go out to your

1077
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,319
operation really to help you you know we

1078
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,880
can talk to you at our desk and say

1079
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:16,619
here's what we think you need but we

1080
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,740
ultimately can't make that decision

1081
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:24,000
until we go out to your specific Farm

1082
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:26,280
Ranch or you know Forest stand so

1083
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,280
if you're unsure of where your office is

1084
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:32,040
located you can follow that link to find

1085
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,960
it you can just match it to what county

1086
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:39,660
you're located in and go from there

1087
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,520
once you find where your office is

1088
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:44,339
located

1089
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:48,480
you can then fill out a uh see what we

1090
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:51,900
call a CPA 1200 or for simple purposes

1091
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,119
it's our application that you can fill

1092
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:57,660
out and you can actually go into the

1093
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:59,339
office and fill it in at the office and

1094
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:02,220
we can make sure we can kind of line you

1095
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:04,140
up make recommendations of you know how

1096
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:07,740
who you need to go and see and where you

1097
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:11,160
would need to go and one thing nrcs did

1098
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:13,740
just Implement recently is we now do

1099
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:17,940
have applications and other contract

1100
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:19,920
documentation in multiple language so

1101
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:22,560
um you know in most cases the staff will

1102
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,839
hand a application in English but if you

1103
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:28,440
are looking for another language just

1104
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:32,460
let that local field staff know and they

1105
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:35,579
can get you an application in another

1106
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:37,500
language and there's numerous I want to

1107
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,240
say it's I don't even know how many

1108
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,880
total languages but there are a lot of

1109
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:43,859
languages that the application forms are

1110
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,900
offered in now

1111
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:48,720
after that

1112
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:50,880
um if you haven't already you I guess

1113
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,920
it's it's up to you how you you would

1114
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,500
want to proceed

1115
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,140
um you can come to our office at any

1116
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:01,200
time and we can take an application but

1117
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:04,380
one thing we will need from you is we

1118
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:08,760
will need you to go to the Farm Service

1119
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:11,220
Agency so FSA and register with them and

1120
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,200
uh if you ever have any issues on that

1121
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,540
paperwork you can either go to them or

1122
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,040
we can help you fill out a lot of that

1123
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:19,079
information because it can be a little

1124
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:22,200
complicated and you know there is a lot

1125
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:23,819
of red tape but it is necessary and all

1126
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,780
the information

1127
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:30,060
um that FSA collects or nrcs collects we

1128
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:32,099
don't share with anyone we um view that

1129
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:35,099
as very important information and it's

1130
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:36,660
very personal so when you apply you

1131
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:39,119
don't need to worry about

1132
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:40,560
um any identity theft or anything like

1133
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,599
that because we will protect your

1134
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:47,420
information and we're not going to share

1135
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:47,420
it with anyone else around the country

1136
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,680
so after you go through that process of

1137
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:54,720
filling in an application you know as

1138
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:57,359
Ellie mentioned um it's good to get an

1139
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:00,599
RCS out there right away

1140
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:02,880
and um then we can go out to your

1141
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:05,760
property we can walk around with you we

1142
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,819
can identify what your specific concerns

1143
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,640
are and we can also identify additional

1144
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:13,880
concerns as well

1145
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,839
um you know as I mentioned some of the

1146
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:20,339
resource concerns we're going to be

1147
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:22,740
looking at Are soil water air plant and

1148
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:25,140
animal and obviously we go a lot more in

1149
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:26,760
depth than that um as elliemann as Ellie

1150
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:29,520
was talking you know for soil we do

1151
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:32,160
stuff with soil Health but if it's water

1152
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:35,640
we'll do work with water quantity water

1153
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,560
quality things of that nature and real

1154
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,599
quick just taking a step back one thing

1155
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,540
I did want to mention is we do take

1156
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:45,839
applications year-round we do have set

1157
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:48,480
deadlines that are established every

1158
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:50,640
year but regardless of a time you can

1159
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:54,119
come into our own office and submit an

1160
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,859
application for for possible funding and

1161
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:58,020
we'll just roll you into when the next

1162
00:50:55,859 --> 00:51:00,300
sign up occurs and work with with you in

1163
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:04,079
that ranking process so never hesitate

1164
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:05,579
to submit an application for nrcs

1165
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,839
programs you know our door is always

1166
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:08,900
open

1167
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,900
um

1168
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:14,339
so going into the programs and these are

1169
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:18,240
true with any of our programs uh whether

1170
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:18,960
it be equip or CSP

1171
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,880
um

1172
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,819
who is eligible to apply for our

1173
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,160
programs as you can see on the screen it

1174
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:28,380
varies from an individual just based on

1175
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,940
your social security number it could be

1176
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,940
a legal entity if you're in a

1177
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:36,480
corporation or a partnership it could be

1178
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:38,760
a joint operation we do help the tribes

1179
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,800
if they wish to sign up there are some

1180
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,960
different rules and

1181
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,640
um in some areas I know in New Mexico

1182
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,460
this is a very big deal our water

1183
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,800
management entities are very influential

1184
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:53,160
and historic in the state of New Mexico

1185
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:55,740
and simply put a water management entity

1186
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:59,099
is a governing body that has

1187
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:01,200
jurisdiction over water usage and they

1188
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:05,400
can actually enter into a contract with

1189
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,599
an RCS to improve water distribution for

1190
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,960
their property so it could actually

1191
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:13,140
impact most multiple people so just keep

1192
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:16,200
in mind that a sakias and irrigation

1193
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:18,180
districts are eligible for our funding

1194
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,819
but in most cases it's either going to

1195
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,220
be your individual visual or legal

1196
00:52:20,819 --> 00:52:25,380
entity

1197
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:30,359
another important aspect of our programs

1198
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:32,780
is control of land and specifically when

1199
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:36,540
it comes to control of land

1200
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:39,059
nrcs can enter into a contract with one

1201
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:41,160
or more participants that have control

1202
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:42,960
of the offered land and when we talk

1203
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:46,079
control of land it doesn't necessarily

1204
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:49,200
mean you have to own that land but you

1205
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:51,359
can also be renting that land and then

1206
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,460
also depending on how you're planning

1207
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,559
your contract you don't have to show

1208
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:57,780
control for the entire length of the

1209
00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:00,859
contract so if you're in a year-to-year

1210
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:03,420
lease like a lot of renters are

1211
00:53:00,859 --> 00:53:05,460
we you can update that at least every

1212
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:07,740
year and still be eligible for

1213
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,300
Contracting so don't feel like you

1214
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:11,280
wouldn't be eligible if you don't own

1215
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,500
the land or you don't have you know a

1216
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,500
five-year lease that doesn't matter we

1217
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,839
look at control of land every single

1218
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,660
year so just remember that you know it

1219
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:24,720
can be at least you know at least rent

1220
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:27,660
or a permit and when I say permits

1221
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,440
that's relating to federal land whether

1222
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:34,920
it be BLM Bia or I should say Bureau of

1223
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:39,559
Land Management Bureau of Indian Affairs

1224
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,559
um those Acres can be included as well

1225
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:44,819
um next I'm talking about land types

1226
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:47,280
specifically and when I say land types

1227
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:51,420
it's pretty much how the land is used

1228
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:53,579
and just to give you an idea on a some

1229
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:57,000
of the eligible land types that nrcs

1230
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:59,220
will contract on is we do have crop land

1231
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,280
which can either be rural like in the

1232
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,740
photo on the right on the top or it can

1233
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,680
be just your conventional lag as on the

1234
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:09,240
right and uh I know I saw a few mentions

1235
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,180
of

1236
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:15,720
um silviculture and trees and we do lump

1237
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:18,059
in that type of land use into the crop

1238
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:21,000
fund pool so there is some flexibility

1239
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:23,940
when it comes to that a few of the other

1240
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,540
eligible land uses are pasture which is

1241
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:29,579
irrigated and grazed by livestock

1242
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:32,819
rangeland which is grazed by livestock

1243
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:35,640
which is a term used in the western USA

1244
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:38,460
for where the cattle Grays we do have

1245
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,760
Forest industrial or non-industrial and

1246
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:43,200
when we say forest it was historically

1247
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:46,559
Forest land and that's where we do a lot

1248
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,480
of fire management practices and even

1249
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,520
some grazing practices if it's grazed

1250
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,819
force and then also Association

1251
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:56,880
Associated Agland and farmsteads

1252
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:59,280
so after we identify that you are

1253
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,880
eligible for our programs we do go into

1254
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:07,020
a ranking process sadly not everybody is

1255
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:09,180
funded in the program but there is a set

1256
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:11,040
amount of dollars set aside for those

1257
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,660
practices

1258
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,119
so I won't go in depth because there's a

1259
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:17,579
few other things I want to review

1260
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:19,880
um later on and specifically it's on

1261
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:23,119
what we call historically underserved

1262
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:27,079
applications and when we use this term

1263
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:31,440
it's members of groups have been

1264
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:33,240
historically underserved or have been

1265
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,760
subject to discrimination in federal

1266
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:38,400
programs so it was actually set dollars

1267
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,040
for these producers and it's actually at

1268
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,160
a higher cost share rate as well and a

1269
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:46,619
socially disadvantaged individual

1270
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,599
um or entity is a member

1271
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:50,460
excuse me individual or industry who is

1272
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:52,319
a member of a socially disadvantaged

1273
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:54,540
group socially disadvantaged groups

1274
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:57,780
consist of the following so American

1275
00:55:54,540 --> 00:56:00,240
Indians are Alaskan native Asians black

1276
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:03,059
or African-Americans native Hawaiians or

1277
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,260
Pacific Islanders and Hispanics

1278
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:06,180
um sadly

1279
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,880
um just being female alone doesn't

1280
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:10,619
qualify for socially disadvantaged these

1281
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,020
are just rules that were set in policy

1282
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:15,480
but it's still important to know if you

1283
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,559
qualify for any of these

1284
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,420
um another

1285
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,040
common one that I think we're going to

1286
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:23,040
see happening more often with Urban

1287
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:26,400
agriculture is uh beginning Farmers so

1288
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:28,319
someone who hasn't farmed a ranch for uh

1289
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,540
more than 10 years if you qualify for

1290
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:32,640
that you actually receive a higher

1291
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:34,440
payment rate than you would normally and

1292
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:37,020
then the veteran farmer and Rancher is

1293
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,220
just a beginning farmer that has veteran

1294
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,740
status

1295
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:43,740
and then the last one is the limited

1296
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:45,960
resource farmer Rancher and

1297
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:48,240
um with director indirect gross sales

1298
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,819
not more than the current index value in

1299
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:53,220
each of the previous two years and who

1300
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:55,440
has a total household income at or below

1301
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:58,559
the National Poverty Level level for

1302
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,420
family a four or less than 50 percent of

1303
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:02,640
the county median household income in

1304
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,980
each of the previous two years so those

1305
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,180
are just some of the terms that um you

1306
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:08,700
know it's important that you guys

1307
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:10,800
remember that you're eligible for those

1308
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,660
programs or eligible for those

1309
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,420
definitions

1310
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:17,940
um and then I guess what we can do is I

1311
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:21,059
did provide a few links as mentioned and

1312
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:23,040
if people have specific questions about

1313
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:24,780
um the payment process I can cover that

1314
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,540
uh later on just so we can keep things

1315
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:32,780
rolling along so at that um that's just

1316
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:32,780
a very fast rundown of our programs

1317
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:41,339

1353
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:21,359

1354
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:23,160
yeah thank you guys for this Workshop um

1355
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,599
you pronounced it correctly adiola is my

1356
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,780
name

1357
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:30,000
um and my question is

1358
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,980
um in regards to the last speaker if he

1359
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,540
could answer this question I have

1360
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:35,579
applied for I don't know if you guys can

1361
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:39,599
answer this question but I've applied

1362
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:41,520
for um an equip program in my state and

1363
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,400
I followed all the procedures that you

1364
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:46,380
mentioned however and I actually applied

1365
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,480
before the deadline for my particular

1366
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,520
State maybe a few days before because

1367
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,839
that was when I learned about it but I

1368
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,299
haven't heard anything back from them

1369
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:56,160
what would you suggest that will be my

1370
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:58,079
next steps because I've reached out to

1371
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,140
the person that was in my that was my

1372
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,780
contact uh twice she did reply me once

1373
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:07,140
but I have yet to hear back from her so

1374
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:09,780
I wanted to find out what should be my

1375
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:12,119
next steps should I contact her again or

1376
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:13,440
should I go up to the office or what

1377
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:15,660
should I do

1378
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,700
yeah so in the and thanks for your

1379
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:20,400
question so in that scenario I know it

1380
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:23,400
can be frustrating when they haven't

1381
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,740
um responded back to you I what you need

1382
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,660
to do is kind of multi you kind of need

1383
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:29,640
to be a little bit of persistent a bit

1384
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:31,920
of thorn in our side if we're not

1385
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,440
responding to you I would show up at the

1386
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,839
office I'd call us you know if you don't

1387
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:39,420
even get anywhere there if you use that

1388
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:41,040
locator that was mentioned you can

1389
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,720
actually look at

1390
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:45,119
um contacting people higher up the chain

1391
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,099
as well if you do find that that field

1392
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:51,240
office isn't responding to you I mean

1393
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:53,520
ideally they should uh be responding to

1394
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,260
you as soon as possible but I would

1395
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,799
start becoming a bit of a squeaky wheel

1396
01:00:55,260 --> 01:01:01,319
and making sure you're being heard and

1397
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:03,000
um you know again it can get complicated

1398
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:05,400
for a lot of our staff when it's

1399
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,900
continuous sign up because they just

1400
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:09,180
want to focus on here's what I'm working

1401
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:10,920
on at this point in time but in reality

1402
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:12,839
we need to be

1403
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:14,819
um consistently taking applications and

1404
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:16,559
consistently how helping people

1405
01:01:14,819 --> 01:01:18,660
thank you so much I just didn't want to

1406
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,799
seem like a nuisance but I've heard from

1407
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:22,079
you and I've also heard from Ellie

1408
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:24,240
thanks Ellie for your response

1409
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,520
kind of just one thing I'd add is that

1410
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,380
it's hard I know in New Mexico a lot of

1411
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,839
our offices are understaffed and there's

1412
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:33,839
like so and I work in an understaffed

1413
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:35,880
office so not nrcs but I feel for staff

1414
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:38,819
who's overwhelmed and we have to get

1415
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:41,460
responses but just you know because

1416
01:01:38,819 --> 01:01:43,680
we're often friends with our local folks

1417
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:46,440
in the offices it reminds us like Linda

1418
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:48,119
why aren't you going to talk to us we

1419
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,339
recently found out there was like a

1420
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:52,260
multiple month turnaround to get a Farm

1421
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:55,740
Service number which in my mind is like

1422
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:57,960
a week turn around kind of thing

1423
01:01:55,740 --> 01:02:00,540
um and then also I think Aaron it can be

1424
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:02,160
helpful now like depending on how things

1425
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:04,380
work in your state but it can be a

1426
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:07,380
couple months between when you put in an

1427
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:08,760
application their batching period And

1428
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,980
when they're actually deciding who

1429
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,500
they're offering contracts to so asking

1430
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:15,540
the office their timeline can help you

1431
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:18,119
have more clear expectations of when

1432
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:20,579
they're actually blowing you off or they

1433
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:22,920
just are like we have no information and

1434
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:25,799
I would just say you know echoing it's

1435
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:27,780
hard it's hard patience persistence game

1436
01:02:25,799 --> 01:02:31,319
y'all got this

1437
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:32,040
yeah and to add to that

1438
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:33,599
um

1439
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:36,480
as well

1440
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:38,460
um oh I lost my train of thought you can

1441
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,660
go ahead sorry whoever had questions

1442
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,579
next

1443
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,480
well could I just jump in here really

1444
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:44,460
quick

1445
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,559
um I just want to say I super appreciate

1446
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:48,299
that um everyone's being so

1447
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:52,200
straightforward about what we have to do

1448
01:02:48,299 --> 01:02:55,380
but um I I also just want to lift this

1449
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:59,819
up as a national policy issue

1450
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:02,160
um and that the the amount of

1451
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:05,220
gatekeeping on funding

1452
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:08,640
um is is hugely problematic and we need

1453
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:10,680
to untie the hands of our our friends at

1454
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:12,180
these offices

1455
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,500
um so that they can push funding out

1456
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:15,180
quicker

1457
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,400
um and we have an opportunity maybe on

1458
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:20,280
the farm bill or just any chance that we

1459
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:21,540
have I think to get in front of decision

1460
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,339
makers

1461
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:25,319
um we need to be talking about this

1462
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:26,819
because we shouldn't have to go into the

1463
01:03:25,319 --> 01:03:28,260
office we shouldn't have to wait months

1464
01:03:26,819 --> 01:03:29,760
and months like we're trying to Steward

1465
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:32,160
land and solve climate and address

1466
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:35,040
climate change and it we can't take

1467
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:36,480
excuses that people are just too busy

1468
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:39,119
um especially when you're a farmer

1469
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,540
someone giving you that is that excuse

1470
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:44,760
like falls on pretty like closed ears so

1471
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:47,099
like I said I appreciate Aaron and you

1472
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,960
know Sarah Gina being so honest but um

1473
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:51,059
yeah and and like Hector says the

1474
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,579
funding's there we just have to like

1475
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:56,760
make it flow

1476
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:59,700
yeah and just to speak to that as well

1477
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:02,099
we the field staff can only control so

1478
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:04,380
much when it gets to them and what my

1479
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:07,440
comment was going to be is timelines

1480
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:09,660
deadlines and all that information vary

1481
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,460
from state to state so you really need

1482
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:14,520
to be in contact with your local state

1483
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:16,740
but in general we post all of our

1484
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:19,740
information online of when our ranking

1485
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:22,200
deadline is so you can always go to the

1486
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:25,079
nrcs State website and see when those

1487
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:27,180
deadlines are and um

1488
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:29,400
from there

1489
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:31,440
um it also established application

1490
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,260
deadlines ranking deadlines and it gives

1491
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,299
you all that information so we have to

1492
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:39,180
post those deadlines you know 30 days

1493
01:04:36,299 --> 01:04:42,059
prior to when they occur so at the same

1494
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:44,640
time as nrcs needs to help

1495
01:04:42,059 --> 01:04:46,740
um some of the people applying need to

1496
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,540
be on the spot as well and understand

1497
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:51,059
what they're applying for and have all

1498
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:54,839
their Affairs in order so if information

1499
01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:57,119
is missing that slows us down but

1500
01:04:54,839 --> 01:04:59,579
um definitely you know we can only

1501
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:02,160
control so much of where money is spent

1502
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:04,500
and where it isn't and for people that

1503
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,000
feel like they're not getting funded

1504
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,500
um you really need to talk to your local

1505
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,079
work groups so a lot of those

1506
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:12,599
conservation districts that help nrcs

1507
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:15,180
establish where our dollars are spent so

1508
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:16,920
it's not as simple as we can just say oh

1509
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:18,599
you want to put in a high tunnel here's

1510
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:21,059
some money you know we do have to go

1511
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:23,520
through a process and sadly we're not

1512
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:25,559
able to establish those process

1513
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,200
processes

1514
01:05:25,559 --> 01:05:30,119
um to get you funding but um I know

1515
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,760
field staff isn't intentionally trying

1516
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:36,420
to ignore you or not treat your concerns

1517
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:38,460
but um please continue just to work with

1518
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:40,140
your local field staff and if it does go

1519
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:41,760
on silent years

1520
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:43,559
um you know eventually start looking at

1521
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:47,099
some of the highers higher up in the

1522
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:49,440
states and your State office employees

1523
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:51,960
and we'll also share a little more

1524
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,700
um at the end of this presentation our

1525
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,160
efforts to

1526
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:58,680
um really influence and push the nrcf's

1527
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:01,500
offices I did want to address and I

1528
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:04,799
heard it come up in that question and

1529
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:07,740
some of the responses I want to

1530
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:09,839
um before going to the person with their

1531
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:12,780
hand raised I think these questions

1532
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:15,420
could be answered maybe as you know

1533
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:16,619
they're along the similar line of

1534
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:19,260
thought

1535
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:21,599
um how often is funding made available

1536
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:24,200
and if you don't get funded when you

1537
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:27,480
apply are you able to the following year

1538
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:29,280
and then I guess along with that um

1539
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:32,640
Hector asked

1540
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:34,740
uh where do you find the grant cycles

1541
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,400
for all of the programs

1542
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,680
um

1543
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:41,400
and that way people can apply within

1544
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:43,319
those cycles and I think you know Aaron

1545
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:46,200
you partly addressed this in sharing

1546
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:47,579
that it really is State specific

1547
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:50,760
um

1548
01:06:47,579 --> 01:06:54,960
but if you could speak to ways that

1549
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:58,260
people can keep track of that in um so

1550
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,180
that they don't miss the application and

1551
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:03,900
Grant Cycles

1552
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:06,660
um and I think also along with that

1553
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:09,299
um how long do you have to be

1554
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:12,299
established to be able to apply for

1555
01:07:09,299 --> 01:07:14,220
those okay yep so I'll just go right

1556
01:07:12,299 --> 01:07:16,500
down the list of the comments of how

1557
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:19,020
often is funding made available so it

1558
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:21,480
really depends but in general we do

1559
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:24,240
funding applications individually for

1560
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:27,240
each program so it does happen every

1561
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:29,339
single year now in the scenario you

1562
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:31,319
don't rank high enough to get the

1563
01:07:29,339 --> 01:07:34,079
funding

1564
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:35,940
um you will be sent a letter asking

1565
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:39,359
would you like to defer your application

1566
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:41,700
into the next year so if you do choose

1567
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:44,039
to defer that application it will be

1568
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,720
rolled over into the following year but

1569
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:47,099
what I would encourage you if you're

1570
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,859
constantly applying and not getting

1571
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:52,440
funding talk to your field staff about

1572
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:54,119
treating additional or additional

1573
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:56,520
resource concerns that they found on

1574
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:58,500
your property because in general the

1575
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:01,680
more resource concerns you treat the

1576
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:04,200
higher likelihood you have to be funded

1577
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:05,940
so if you're uh just coming in every

1578
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:08,039
year saying all I want is a high tunnel

1579
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:10,500
I don't want anything else you're you're

1580
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:12,660
not going to have as high of options to

1581
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,760
get funding if you were planning a cover

1582
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:17,100
crop to treat soil health or if you're

1583
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:19,859
doing pollinator habitat you're treating

1584
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:22,380
more resource concerns so definitely be

1585
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:24,600
flexible in what you're willing to do

1586
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:26,400
and you know if you really need to get

1587
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:29,219
funded you might have to treat those

1588
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:32,100
additional resource concerns as well and

1589
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:35,819
then going into the next um

1590
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:36,540
question was on the grant Cycles

1591
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:38,460
um

1592
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:41,520
we have a continuous sign up as I

1593
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:44,460
mentioned so bring your application to

1594
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:46,620
the office right away uh when you want

1595
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:48,660
to apply for our programs and then if

1596
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:51,719
you are curious about when our deadlines

1597
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:55,020
are I encourage you to link to your

1598
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:57,660
local State nrcs website where we are

1599
01:08:55,020 --> 01:09:00,719
required to post when our deadlines are

1600
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:04,920
it's a federal law that we let everyone

1601
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:08,239
know when those occur and um you know

1602
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,239
they're publicly seen

1603
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:15,839
so when it comes to

1604
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:18,060
um officially established we don't have

1605
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:20,219
any requirements on how long you have to

1606
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:21,960
be in operation in order to be eligible

1607
01:09:20,219 --> 01:09:24,660
for our programs

1608
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:27,660
um regardless of type of operation the

1609
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:30,060
size of your operation location or the

1610
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:32,520
overall income of your operation that

1611
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:34,920
doesn't matter as long as you fill out

1612
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:38,100
our application you go and get eligible

1613
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:40,560
with the FSA you will be able to apply

1614
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:42,420
for our programs now specifically when

1615
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,819
it starts getting into uh work with

1616
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:47,580
irrigation we do have to identify

1617
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:49,799
irrigation history and you would have to

1618
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:51,900
have irrigated those

1619
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:53,400
um acres for two out of the last five

1620
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:56,340
years

1621
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:58,980
and specifically with that comment as

1622
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:01,020
well when it comes to cropland is it has

1623
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:03,420
to be active cropland it can't be just

1624
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:05,880
grassland that you're going to farm you

1625
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:07,980
need to be actively farming that land at

1626
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:10,980
the time you apply and then you'd be

1627
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:12,660
eligible for our cropland practices

1628
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:15,300
so I'm just going to emphasize what

1629
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:18,120
Aaron said If you're trying to break

1630
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:21,060
fallow ground and you want nrcs

1631
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:23,699
practices on that land you do that first

1632
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:25,320
and maybe wait a year so when they come

1633
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:28,260
to the site visit they're like yeah this

1634
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:30,600
looks like agriculture as opposed to it

1635
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:33,360
looks like foul land I want help on yeah

1636
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,520
yeah and to go in depth we can't convert

1637
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:37,380
land to something else that it isn't you

1638
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,420
know we do have set guidelines and we're

1639
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:42,060
not trying to you know put more acres

1640
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:44,880
into production because just

1641
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:47,580
um production by itself isn't a resource

1642
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:49,940
concern we treat

1643
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:52,800
foreign

1644
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:55,440
thank you and we have a

1645
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,920
we have a hand raise if you want to come

1646
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,920
off mute

1647
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:03,600
hi this is chido

1648
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:07,080
I'm the equity program manager from

1649
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:08,699
California Association of rcds

1650
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:11,880
I

1651
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:15,300
oh I'm located in San Jose in California

1652
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:16,159
Santa Clara County and in our County we

1653
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:20,040
have

1654
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:22,860
130 Asian farmers in most of those Asian

1655
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:25,500
farmers the Chinese Farmers Japanese

1656
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:28,199
Farmers Korea farmers and Vietnamese

1657
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:31,679
farmers and we are talking about a group

1658
01:11:28,199 --> 01:11:34,800
of people that is really isolated they

1659
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:37,100
don't speak any English and they produce

1660
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,840
they produce and then sell to the local

1661
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:41,820
Asian stores so there is no English

1662
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,640
needed for them to produce and

1663
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:47,580
successful for the farm they have never

1664
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,800
heard about anas yes they don't know

1665
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:52,380
those

1666
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:54,120
wonderful progress programs exists so

1667
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:56,940
for the past three years

1668
01:11:54,120 --> 01:12:00,239
I was working as an extension specialist

1669
01:11:56,940 --> 01:12:01,320
and I introduced this equip program to

1670
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:04,080
them and

1671
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:08,000
all of them are so interested and they

1672
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:10,620
want to apply so I'm asking here does

1673
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:14,040
nrcs have a

1674
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:16,440
kind of a brochure or kind of flyer for

1675
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:19,500
different kind of problems and the

1676
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:22,679
eligibility in different languages so

1677
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:25,340
that I can send in this information to

1678
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:28,380
those group to the group of Growers

1679
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:31,140
instead of me talking to them

1680
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:34,560
individually because I have my full-time

1681
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:37,159
job and I am too busy to talk to each

1682
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,159
farmers

1683
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,280
so

1684
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:49,860
and thanks for your questions

1685
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:51,480
nrcs does perform a lot of Outreach in

1686
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:52,920
those communities

1687
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,840
um you know actually on another

1688
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:58,080
leadership project I'm working on we are

1689
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:59,520
looking at ways to improve Outreach to a

1690
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:02,159
lot of those communities whether it be

1691
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,739
on the radio or specifically go into

1692
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:07,380
their meetings what I would encourage

1693
01:13:04,739 --> 01:13:09,840
yourself to do is reach out to the local

1694
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:12,719
field staff and have them come and give

1695
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,760
a presentation at you know I'm meeting

1696
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:17,520
you organized to reach those producers

1697
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:19,500
because for nrcs it's very hard to

1698
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,460
reduce or reach out to a lot of the

1699
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,960
people

1700
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:24,179
um you know because we're so busy with

1701
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,640
uh programs and other technical

1702
01:13:24,179 --> 01:13:30,060
assistance so work with your local staff

1703
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:32,400
to put on events and RCS can host events

1704
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,380
and we can gear it towards specific

1705
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:36,420
communities as well to improve that

1706
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:38,760
Outreach because I would agree and RCS

1707
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:40,380
does need to do a better job

1708
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:43,620
um you know letting people know that

1709
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:45,360
we're here and that we can help anyone

1710
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:48,440
yeah you know regardless of where

1711
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,440
they're at or who they are

1712
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:54,300
okay thank you Aaron for your uh answer

1713
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:56,820
and I have a small little answer uh

1714
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:59,400
question tip are those funding that the

1715
01:13:56,820 --> 01:14:00,719
Growers receiving do they have to pay

1716
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:03,480
tax

1717
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:05,940
yes they do technically they do got it

1718
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:08,820
got it yeah and real quick on that

1719
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:12,420
comment as well nrcs programs when it

1720
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:15,300
comes to equip we cost share

1721
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:19,140
um the cost share is meant to only be a

1722
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:21,840
75 cost share so keep in mind that when

1723
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:24,440
people apply for nrcs programs we're not

1724
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,820
necessarily going to pay for everything

1725
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:30,000
included we're only going to pay for a

1726
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:31,560
portion of that cost so it is important

1727
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,900
that um

1728
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:36,540
you're aware and who's ever applying is

1729
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:40,820
aware that there might be some monetary

1730
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:40,820
requirement on whoever is applying

1731
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:45,120
you guys have so many good questions and

1732
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:47,159
you're going to go so far with this I'm

1733
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:49,500
going to add One Word of Wisdom I was on

1734
01:14:47,159 --> 01:14:51,719
Medicaid when I first applied and I had

1735
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:54,480
to really calculate like will this 1099

1736
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:57,060
mess up my eligibility so I can stay on

1737
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,560
Medicaid no it didn't because that's how

1738
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:00,600
we're living at that point but for

1739
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,580
anyone who's you know a part of one of

1740
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:04,500
those programs you want to really Eyes

1741
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:07,620
Wide Open is my

1742
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:09,120
Mike um General phrase on how to

1743
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:12,420
approach all of this because there's so

1744
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:14,880
many benefits you just want to make sure

1745
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:16,380
um there's you don't get tripped up once

1746
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,179
you sign that contract you want to be

1747
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:21,300
really ready and know you can implement

1748
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:24,900
it because if you can't there can be

1749
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:26,699
penalties and challenges but overall

1750
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:28,140
we're hoping everyone finds a way to

1751
01:15:26,699 --> 01:15:30,480
have a positive experience and

1752
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:32,580
especially pre appreciate everyone who's

1753
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:35,699
getting this out to communities who

1754
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:37,199
don't have as much access so amazing

1755
01:15:35,699 --> 01:15:38,940
questions

1756
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:41,820
um we're going to move on to the next

1757
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:43,380
segment of our agenda but I just want to

1758
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:45,659

um how we are working to shift and shift

1775
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:33,659
the needle and see changes

1776
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:36,420
um in nrcs programming and alongside the

1777
01:16:33,659 --> 01:16:39,060
farm bill in USDA um so Aaron if you

01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:42,600

yeah thanks Anna and thanks so much to

1780
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:47,340
Serafina and Aaron and Ellie for being

here to share about these programs

1782
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:50,940
um like Anna said I'm just gonna be

1783
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:53,640
talking a little bit about the work that

1784
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:54,960
National young Farmers Coalition is

1785
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:56,280
doing

1786
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,640
um

1787
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:01,860
on nrcs programs on water and climate

1788
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:05,100
issues so I'm just gonna share a little

1789
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:08,280
bit about what we do we do have a water

1790
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:10,380
campaign called generations for water at

1791
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:12,900
National Farmers coalition

1792
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:15,120
before I go into that just wanted to

1793
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:16,860
share a little bit for those of you who

1794
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:19,800
may not be too familiar with national

1795
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:23,340
young Farmers Coalition just who we are

1796
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:27,920
and what we do we are a Grassroots

1797
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:31,679
network of over 200 000 Farmers ranchers

1798
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:34,380
uh supporters Advocates and we are

1799
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:37,380
working to shift power and change policy

1800
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:40,140
to more equitably we resource the new

1801
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:42,600
generation of working farmers and we

1802
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:44,760
envision a just future where farming is

1803
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:46,380
free of racial violence accessible to

1804
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:48,480
communities oriented towards

1805
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:50,640
environmental well-being and connected

1806
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,739
with health over profit

1807
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,000
so that's just a little bit about the

1808
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:55,560
work that we're doing at nationally on

1809
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,719
Farmers Coalition it includes our water

1810
01:17:55,560 --> 01:18:03,179
work we also work on land access

1811
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:04,980
climate economic Justice student loan

1812
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:06,000
debt so if you're interested in getting

1813
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:09,120
involved in some of those other

1814
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:12,300
campaigns we can plug you into those as

1815
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:14,640
well but I am going to focus uh just a

1816
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:17,659
bit on our water work which is most

1817
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:20,760
connected with these nrcs programs

1818
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:23,340
we believe that water systems should

1819
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:27,000
foster vibrant agricultural communities

1820
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:28,679
healthy ecosystems and water Justice for

1821
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,780
indigenous communities and other

1822
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:32,640
communities of color so when we're

1823
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:34,199
looking at public policy we want public

1824
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,840
policy that's going to be protecting

1825
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:39,179
water for agriculture supporting on-farm

1826
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:41,880
conservation I can get Serve and Protect

1827
01:18:39,179 --> 01:18:44,239
our Clean Water Resources programs like

1828
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:47,100
equip that Aaron has been talking about

1829
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:47,820
and ensuring access to clean drinking

1830
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:50,880
water

1831
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:54,840
so we do this in a number of ways water

1832
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:58,020
issues can be Super Hyper local it can

1833
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:59,760
be really International it's Global well

1834
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:01,679
we hear a lot the challenges that young

1835
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:04,500
farmers are facing are related to

1836
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:07,440
Drought flooding and water quality

1837
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:09,060
issues so we work on policy but we know

1838
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:12,120
that can't be solved through federal

1839
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:14,400
policy alone so we also work to build

1840
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:16,679
farmer leadership we put on educational

1841
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,420
events like this and foreign

1842
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:20,159
Partnerships to support Farmers to be

1843
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:22,199
leaders in water policy and

1844
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:23,699
conservations so I just want to tell you

1845
01:19:22,199 --> 01:19:26,219
a little bit about what that looks like

1846
01:19:23,699 --> 01:19:29,580
in practice for our farmer leadership

1847
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:32,880
work we run Fellowship programs I saw a

1848
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:35,460
few of our water fellows on here to do

1849
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:38,340
more in-depth training on water issues

1850
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:41,580
at the state and federal level and

1851
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:44,100
support young farmers and ranchers and

1852
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:45,719
bike farmers and ranchers to not just

1853
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,760
learn about these issues but step into

1854
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:51,000
leadership positions where they can be

1855
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:53,340
decision makers on our water policy

1856
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,380
we do educational workshops like this

1857
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:56,820
one we've got another one coming up next

1858
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:59,280
week that I'll talk a little bit more

1859
01:19:56,820 --> 01:20:01,800
about so if you just want some

1860
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:04,860
information on what are the resources

1861
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:06,300
available to you we'll be keeping in

1862
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:09,060
touch about different educational

1863
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:10,980
workshops that we have going on and then

1864
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:13,020
we do a lot of policy work right now

1865
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:15,719
we're focused on the farm bill I think

1866
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:18,239
Ellie mentioned that a little bit the

1867
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:21,000
farm bill is kind of the big big federal

1868
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:23,159
policy piece on food and farm programs

1869
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,500
that's happening this year Congress is

1870
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:27,239
starting to rewrite that so we're going

1871
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:32,040
to be working a lot on Farm Bill

1872
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:35,340
advocacy and then we also work on access

1873
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:37,020
and accountability to USDA so I heard a

1874
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:39,659
little bit of feedback here on how

1875
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:42,960
accessing those nrcs programs have been

1876
01:20:39,659 --> 01:20:46,080
going so we can help with that help hold

1877
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,820
USDA and nrcs accountable to the

1878
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,800
commitments that they've made and

1879
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:52,880
provide feedback on how those programs

1880
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,880
are working for young farmers

1881
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:59,400
um so here are some ways that you can

1882
01:20:56,699 --> 01:21:02,100
stay in touch with us

1883
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:04,800

01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:07,199
farm bill and in the offices across the

1983
01:25:04,739 --> 01:25:10,380
