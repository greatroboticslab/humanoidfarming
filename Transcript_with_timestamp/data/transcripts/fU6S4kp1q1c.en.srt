1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:04,319
what if one Zone on your sprinkler

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,759
system isn't coming on or isn't shutting

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,220
off but the rest of your system's

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,380
working just fine it could be your valve

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,840
it could be your controller or it could

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,179
be your wiring how do you tell which

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,160
today we're going to use a volt meter to

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,619
troubleshoot your malfunctioning Zone

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,660
Dwayne Smith here your sprinkler

10
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,350
Warehouse product specialist let's

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,479
figure out what's wrong with that zone

12
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,479
[Music]

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,180
troubleshoot some of the electrical

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,940
components you're going to need either a

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,219
multimeter also called a voltmeter or a

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,260
solenoid activator chatterer for this

17
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,059
video we'll be using the volt meter we

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,620
have an almost identical video to this

19
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,280
one where we go through the same process

20
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,020
using a Pro 50 activator chatterer if

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,120
you have an activator or chatter you

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,780
should check out that video instead of

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,360
this one so let's start troubleshooting

24
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,399
problem one a zone won't stop running

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,140
that kind of issue is something that

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,300
would probably not be caused by a

27
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,159
controller it's nearly certain that's a

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,680
valve issue let's talk about what that

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,960
looks like if your Zone should not be on

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,240
but the sprinklers in that zone are on

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,860
or they're sort of on by that I mean

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,560
maybe you've got water dribbling from

33
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,659
the top of several heads or a few heads

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,759
are popping up and not just for a few

35
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,520
minutes after the Zone shuts off it's

36
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,860
happening continuously then the valve

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,979
for that zone is not closing all the way

38
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,340
so in that case find and replace the

39
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,799
valve problem two one zone isn't coming

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,320
on all the way that may look like

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,520
several heads and not popping up perhaps

42
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,140
none of them are but there's water

43
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,360
seeping from the top of some of the

44
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,640
heads then most likely your valve isn't

45
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,979
opening all the way you probably need to

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,640
find and replace that valve problem

47
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,200
three one zone won't come on at all this

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,299
is the most difficult problem to

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,000
diagnose I have seen one case where

50
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,700
customers module was not seated properly

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,740
and there was an error code on the front

52
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,840
of the controller if you have a modular

53
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,540
controller make sure that the module is

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,640
inserted properly and locked into place

55
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,200
also make sure it's not a programming

56
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,879
error go through the program to

57
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,920
determine that the zone is scheduled to

58
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,959
run and for how long you can run a

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,000
manual cycle and Skip ahead to that zone

60
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,340
most controllers will have some sort of

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,800
indicator on the screen to show that a

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,239
Zone should be on if the controller is

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,040
showing that the zones should be running

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,959
but the sprinklers in that zone are not

65
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,239
coming on at all this could be a problem

66
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,640
with the controller itself the wiring

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,099
between the controller and the valve or

68
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,420
the solenoid on the valve you're going

69
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,000
to have to do some electrical

70
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,040
troubleshooting let's talk briefly about

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,200
what happens when a controller activates

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,660
a valve to activate a Zone the

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,060
controller sends 24 volts of electricity

74
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,760
through a lead wire to the solenoid on

75
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,640
the valve the solenoid is connected to

76
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,800
both a lead wire and to the common wire

77
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,959
common wire is also connected to all the

78
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,580
valves in your system and heads back to

79
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,400
the controller that completes the

80
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,800
circuit when the solenoid is activated

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,599
it opens up the valve sending water to

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,220
the sprinklers

83
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,379
so let's check to see if the controller

84
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:16,379
is working properly grab your multimeter

85
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:19,500
set it to test for around 24 volts ac

86
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:22,200
so we're testing for voltage here not

87
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,060
current and by the way testing the

88
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,800
voltage only works on a regular system

89
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,080
it isn't going to work on a battery

90
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,019
operated controller so set the

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,599
controller to run the problem Zone

92
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,519
and then you're going to place the black

93
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,739
rope to the common terminal on your

94
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,480
controller and then touch the red probe

95
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,099
to the Zone that's running you should be

96
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,000
getting a reading of somewhere between

97
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:48,360
20 and 30 volts here I'm getting around

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,739
25 so that's good if your reading is

99
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,720
really low your controller is

100
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,700
malfunctioning or if you have a modular

101
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,340
controller it could be that just the

102
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,860
module is bad you could try replacing

103
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,659
that module if you have another terminal

104
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,239
that's not being used you could switch

105
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:05,819
the wire from the non-working Zone to

106
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,879
the available terminal and reprogram the

107
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,620
controller to run that zone instead even

108
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,939
if you can't make that work you will

109
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,220
probably still have to replace the

110
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,260
controller eventually if you don't have

111
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,079
another terminal available and assuming

112
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,359
it's not a module issue you need a new

113
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,639
controller it's a great time to upgrade

114
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,139
if you've got a basic model you might

115
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,240
want to check out a smart controller

116
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,220
that can change its programming based on

117
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,020
local weather stations and you can

118
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,940
program it with your smartphone check

119
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,380
out the choices on

120
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,600
sprinklerwarehouse.com if however your

121
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,560
controller checks out fine turn off the

122
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,840
zone

123
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,759
turn the meter to measure resistance you

124
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,699
want to set it to the lowest resistance

125
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,680
range touch the common terminal and the

126
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,139
terminal of the Zone you're testing

127
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,840
touch or wrap the wires to the probes

128
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,300
the proper amount of resistance should

129
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,280
fall somewhere between 20 and 60 ohms

130
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,220
depending on the brand and model of

131
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,199
valve if your valve has a DC latching

132
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,720
solenoid which is what you will have if

133
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,639
your controller is battery operated you

134
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,919
should get a reading of around 5 ohms

135
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,199
depending on the brand if you get a

136
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,940
reading of 1 or ol that is you're

137
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,919
getting the exact same reading as when

138
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,740
the probes aren't touching anything or

139
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,080
you're getting something below 20 ohms

140
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,380
then you've got a broken wire an

141
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,479
unconnected wire or a bad solenoid so

142
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,880
let's narrow down the problem further

143
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,860
The Next Step will have to happen at the

144
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,039
valve you'll need to locate your valve

145
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,039
box

146
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,060
at the valve box unhook the wires on the

147
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,860
solenoid

148
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,680
with your multimeter set to test

149
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,900
resistance touch or wrap the wires

150
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,360
coming from the solenoid to your probes

151
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,979
does not matter which wire goes to which

152
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,919
probe

153
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:52,860
to have a reading of between 20 to 60

154
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,600
ohms if the reading Falls outside of

155
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,240
that you've got a problem

156
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,180
most valve manufacturers make resistance

157
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:04,380
specs available online once again if you

158
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,720
get a one or an ol reading or you get a

159
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,479
reading close to zero you've got a bad

160
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,419
solenoid now a solenoid by itself often

161
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,820
costs nearly as much as a new valve so

162
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:17,940
you might as well change out the valve

163
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,500
the valve will eventually wear out so if

164
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,180
you get a new valve in place you

165
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,720
probably won't have to touch the Bow Box

166
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,940
again for years

167
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,860
if your solenoid tested good you

168
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,500
probably have a wiring problem so let's

169
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,300
check that set the controller to run on

170
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,639
the Zone you're testing set your

171
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,280
multimeter to check for around 24 volts

172
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,139
ac touch or wrap the wires to the probes

173
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,780
on your multimeter and look for a

174
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,819
reading of somewhere between 20 and 30

175
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,300
volts if you're getting a reading of

176
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:50,880
somewhere around zero or pretty low the

177
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,639
problem is your wiring if your wiring is

178
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,039
bad check if a wire connector has come

179
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,500
off or see if there's a spot where the

180
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,240
wire has become corroded at the wire

181
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,120
connector hopefully that's your problem

182
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,520
if that doesn't fix it you may need to

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,460
run new wire if you happen to have

184
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,680
multi-strand wire coming into the valve

185
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,319
and one of the strands in the multi-wear

186
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,600
is not being used just swap to an unused

187
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,600
wire and swap the wire at the controller

188
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,880
running wire is a lot of work so if

189
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,300
there's another valve nearby maybe even

190
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,880
a valve in the same valve box an option

191
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,979
would be to purchase a doubler a doubler

192
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,560
will allow you to operate two valves

193
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,539
using only one lead wire so that's a

194
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,639
possible solution hope this helps
