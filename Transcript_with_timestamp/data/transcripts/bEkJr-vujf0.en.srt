amazing story to tell and he right now

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,080
um he he was going to go and become a

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,320
veterinarian back in the day and he

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,920
found his true purpose in life and he's

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,439
going to share that purpose with you and

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,360
how he took his purpose and made it into

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,960
a reality and so sander tell everybody a

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:40,079
little about yourself and what you do

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,760
thank you Stacy yes so when I when I was

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,600
younger I've always had a deep love for

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,039
animals so it wasn't a surprise to me or

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,160
my parents like that I wanted to do

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,719
something with animals growing up that

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,079
was always a North star for me so then I

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,600
wasn't sure if it was farming veterinary

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,920
medicine and and as soon as there was

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,920
any sort of doubts my parents like you

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,120
got to go explore veterinary medicine

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,680
make sure that like that you go down

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,320
that road first

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,879
because it farming is tough so you can't

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,680
have any doubts in your mind when when

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,200
things start getting tough in farming

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,640
and uh when you have bad days stuff like

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,080
that you can't live a life with regret

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,840
and what ifs and stuff like that so I

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,759
went to the veterinary medicine route I

32
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,080
went to University of wealth and I did

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,159
everything that I need to do to get my

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,280
application ready and instead of sending

35
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,720
it in I changed my mind I came home to

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,320
the dairy farm instead so then that was

37
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,799
2010 when I graduated

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,040
and basically

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,479
we farmed together my parents for four

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,079
or five years and then 2015 we moved our

41
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,880
our cows into a new Dairy facility which

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,960
was very exciting because I found it

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,680
endlessly frustrating in our old dairy

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,840
facility because that Barn was built in

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,320
in

46
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,280
1987 and they didn't really know much

47
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,200
about how a barn should be built for a

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,560
cow to thrive and they didn't they

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,640
didn't Thrive so it was endlessly

50
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,439
frustrating for me being as passionate

51
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,360
about animals as I am so when they

52
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,520
we moved the over to the new barn the

53
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,520
cows thrived they did better they they

54
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,160
produced more milk they they lived

55
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,440
longer they had better body condition

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,920
they seemed happier like it was it was

57
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,760
amazing but right around that same time

58
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,800
as the cow's Health improved ironically

59
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,560
my own

60
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,680
health um took a hit and my hormones

61
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,080
crashed and I had to look around like

62
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,360
what am I doing wrong what am I missing

63
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,000
why all of a sudden now is at the age of

64
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,840
25 has my testosterone crashed to

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,080
nothing basically to like 9-year-old man

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,560
levels and then I started looking around

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,319
and I was questioning everything I was

68
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,760
questioning the Health Care system

69
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:42,800
because I was bouncing around from

70
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,599
Doctor to doctor and no way was able to

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,440
figure out what was that actually wrong

72
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,440
I had doctors telling me that I need to

73
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,640
just accept my condition and move on

74
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,239
stop trying to look for things that I

75
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,840
can change or improve or things like

76
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,200
that it's just I just need to accept it

77
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,440
and and move on with my life and

78
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,959
naturally I wasn't willing to do that

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,519
but then it took me about six years

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,879
though to finally figure out enough

81
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,120
things where I was able to improve my

82
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,319
own health to the point where my

83
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,920
hormones

84
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:14,319
returned and um and then but that same

85
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,400
time I was questioning my life I was

86
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,640
also questioning the way we farmed and

87
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,599
as I was looking for ways that I could

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,760
improve the lives of our farm animals

89
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:27,840
and do things better and going down that

90
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,239
rabbit hole is what led me to regener

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,640
culture is uh it's a lot a lot of the

92
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,920
goals are aligned when it comes to

93
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,519
trying to improve animal welfare and the

94
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,159
the goals of regenerative agriculture

95
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,840
and and getting the cows back outside in

96
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,959
the environment where they can have a

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,519
positive impact on the environment and

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,760
so where we are now is like I I have my

99
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,120
commercial dairy farm which I still have

100
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,400
lots of plans lots of dreams of

101
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,840
transitioning that to regenerative

102
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,920
agriculture as well but in the meantime

103
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,439
I'm trying to build that customer base

104
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,519
and I have the pasture turkeys that I

105
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:04,000
have on our pasture that fall behind our

106
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,280
Grass Pad beef is kind of mimics the the

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,959
ways that the the massive herds of Bison

108
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,319
used to roam North America and then

109
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,120
there'd be Birds fallowing behind there

110
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,079
and they complement each other really

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,079
well which is a common theme in regener

112
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,759
of Agriculture where you're kind of

113
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:19,320
treating your farm like an ecosystem and

114
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:22,160
it's a lot of give and take and and and

115
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,320
uh a lot of complimentary traits between

116
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,680
the different animals and and the goals

117
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,199
of uh of producing food on your

118
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,759
farm you know I I don't think people

119
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:36,199
realize how common um you know problems

120
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,360
with hormones um how many people go

121
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,720
through it how many people go through

122
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,160
low testosterone or low progesterone or

123
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,199
they have low estrogen or their estrogen

124
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,880
is too high and people are really

125
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,759
imbalanced in our society and it does it

126
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,320
could start at any age when people think

127
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,600
about um low testosterone they

128
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,800
immediately associated with later in

129
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,560
life but it's not really true like I

130
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,960
started having problems with my test

131
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,520
testosterone at age 39 and I didn't even

132
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,400
know what was going on I just started

133
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,880
getting symptoms out of the blue and you

134
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,080
know I went to the doctor and my doctor

135
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,240
was the same as yours you know just you

136
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,039
know didn't have an answer yeah just

137
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,160
take birth control you'll be fine and

138
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,360
I'm like I'm not taking birth control

139
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,600
you know and then later on I I went to

140
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,800
other doctors that were more natural and

141
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,160
you know and they you know did test and

142
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,600
they figured out what was going on but a

143
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,479
lot of it you know in our society people

144
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,319
don't realize what a lot of it has to do

145
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,120
too with the foods we eat you know in

146
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,919
America cuz you know especially you know

147
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,759
a lot of foods are injected with

148
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,960
hormones and you know nowadays you see

149
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,800
children at the age of eight starting to

150
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,880
develop breasts and starting to go

151
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,720
through menstruation at an early age

152
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,000
because they're injecting you know

153
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,680
they're injecting the chickens with

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,800
hormones and they're injecting certain

155
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,280
animals with hormones and and they're

156
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,600
injecting you know cows with hormones

157
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,240
and those hormones are going into your

158
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,080
body and they're changing in the whole

159
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,160
chemistry of your body and you know and

160
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,759
like we discussed before you know

161
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,360
everybody's body is different we all

162
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:12,080
come from different DNA so you know for

163
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,639
some people going through you know low

164
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,919
testosterone at a at a young age is can

165
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,759
be normal and it does it can happen at

166
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,080
any age you know and that's what people

167
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:24,199
have to be aware of and you know

168
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,080
problems like you know low liido or

169
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,960
erectile dysfunction is so common in our

170
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,520
society worldwide it's just not talked

171
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,919
about but you know as we were discussing

172
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,280
before you were talking about

173
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,800
regenerative egg and you were talking

174
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,840
about how the different foods and how

175
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,360
you know eating certain foods and and

176
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,280
how to take care of the animals and and

177
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,120
take care of your bodies can play such a

178
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,720
huge role can you explain a little bit

179
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,560
more about agre AG um

180
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,080
regenerative a you know and explain to

181
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,319
people what it is and how it could have

182
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,199
such an impact on your health

183
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,759
very simply regenerative agiculture is

184
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:08,120
just farming in a way that maximizes

185
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:10,039
soil health and that's in contrast to

186
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,000
just trying to maximize profits or

187
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:15,000
maximize

188
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,639
efficiency but if you take that like a a

189
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,919
layer deeper a little more complex what

190
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:24,280
you're really trying to do is you're

191
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:27,240
trying to create a thriving ecosystem of

192
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,160
microorganisms in the soil and it's a

193
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,680
you have when it done properly you have

194
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,879
a a very complex food chain of these

195
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,440
microorganisms you have your bacteria

196
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:40,199
you have your fungus you have protozoa

197
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,599
Nemos arthropods and it's a real it's a

198
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,440
crazy amount of biomass underneath the

199
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,280
soil that we don't even realize is there

200
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,000
but when you have that and it's done

201
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,879
correctly what you what the plant then

202
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,560
can do is that it can excrete a sugar

203
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:57,319
into the soil and trade those sugars for

204
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,879
nutrients so then you don't need the

205
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,680
synthetic fertilizers because the plant

206
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,319
can ask for nutrients from the

207
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,479
microorganism in the soil and they'll go

208
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,319
out and they'll mine these nutrients

209
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,720
from the rocks and from the silt and

210
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,159
sand and then they'll they'll trade

211
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,360
those and then they'll be able to for

212
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,919
the sugars that so that the

213
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,919
microorganisms can Thrive that that's

214
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:21,879
their food source and it's

215
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:23,599
um and like what's really important in

216
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,240
this whole system like a keystone

217
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,000
species is the micro risal fungi which

218
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,800
is basically a long filament that

219
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,360
actually embeds into the root of the

220
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,880
plant and reaches out into the soil and

221
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,919
transports these nutrients and these

222
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,800
sugars and

223
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,080
um what actually happens is is when

224
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,760
we're when we use these synthetic

225
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,800
fertilizers or we use things like large

226
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,399
equipment to drive over our land these

227
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,480
fungus are the first to die off they're

228
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,440
very sensitive so we have to be careful

229
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,680
with how we treat our land but

230
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,000
then what we can do is is we we we

231
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,800
follow these five principles of soil

232
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,440
Health which are very important because

233
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,920
you can if you follow these five

234
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,519
principles then you you you don't have

235
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,440
this negative impact on the soil and you

236
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,399
don't you don't kill all this diversity

237
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,800
in your soil because if you don't have

238
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,720
that diversity you end up being addicted

239
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,279
to synthetic fertilizers there's really

240
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,120
no other way to grow crops because

241
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,120
without this this uh relationship

242
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,320
between the microorganisms and the

243
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,600
plant the plant can't get the nutrients

244
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,480
without fertilizer and it's not just the

245
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,000
fertilizer and the nutrients that the

246
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,360
plant is missing it's missing the

247
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,839
defense chemicals from all the all the

248
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,040
the the insects and stuff like that so

249
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,680
then if it doesn't have these defense

250
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,760
chemicals from these healthy insects

251
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,839
will then becomes vulnerable for pests

252
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,760
and then you end up spraying with

253
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,720
pesticides and it's the same story with

254
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,720
weeds if you don't have the diversity

255
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,760
not only of the microorganism but also

256
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,320
just the the plants that are are living

257
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,519
in the soil you it's the one of the main

258
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,240
downsides of these monocrops is that

259
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,800
you're missing that diversity it's

260
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,920
missing in the soil and the nature

261
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,200
doesn't like that monocrop so then

262
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,440
that's when the weeds come in you start

263
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,399
spraying for weeds and then and it's

264
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,920
it's a a vicious cycle really and yeah

265
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,560
it's a hard thing to break free from and

266
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,320
when you're following five these five

267
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,839
principles which is like you need the

268
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,680
biodiversity you need to minimize the

269
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,560
impact that you have on your soil you

270
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,160
have to have armor on the soil in the

271
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,800
form of plants or pasture or whatever

272
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,920
else and you need to have living roots

273
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,320
in the soil all year around and the last

274
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,000
thing is you need animal impact and if

275
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,200
you have those five things you can have

276
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,279
that diversity where you you can break

277
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,800
free from that addiction and then you

278
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,240
can have that beautiful relationship

279
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,760
between these microorganisms and the

280
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,920
plants and it's not just oh now I don't

281
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,240
need synthetic fertilizer it's it's it's

282
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,160
a much you end up with a much more

283
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,000
nutrient dense food because you can

284
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,720
never fertilize for absolutely

285
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,519
everything that the every micronutrient

286
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,440
that the plant wants and needs that it

287
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,320
can find in the soil you can never

288
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,000
fertilize from all those tiny

289
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,680
micronutrients so like you end up with

290
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,959
much like with food that has less

291
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,720
nutrients in it for that reason so it's

292
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:25,920
it's it's a it's a beautiful system and

293
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,200
the end result as as a nutrient healthy

294
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,880
nutrient-dense

295
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,160
food you know it's it's pretty amazing

296
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,880
because it it seems like when you do

297
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,440
regenerative you know agriculture it

298
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,680
seems like you're for one you're balanc

299
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,560
in your gut because you're you're you

300
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,160
know you have the good bacteria the bad

301
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,040
bacteria you have the healthy soil and

302
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,920
you're you're you know that helps your

303
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,920
digestive system work which entail helps

304
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,519
everything it helps you know because gut

305
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,320
health is really related to everything

306
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,880
including your brain and you know the

307
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,519
fogginess the way we think our Clarity

308
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,160
you know overall health and that's one

309
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,880
of the components that it seems like it

310
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,560
really helps and you know CU When you

311
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,959
think about it you know if when if you

312
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,320
if once you start adding those

313
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,560
pesticides and those weeds and all those

314
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,360
toxins into your body your body doesn't

315
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,320
know what to do with them so it stores

316
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,560
them and it stores it in our body and

317
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,120
what happens is is that our body you

318
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,399
know our our our organs become sluggish

319
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,320
it affects the way you know we feel it

320
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:32,320
you know it could cause illness you know

321
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,839
after after so long and people are going

322
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,399
to the doctors they don't understand why

323
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,120
they don't feel good and it all has to

324
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,399
do with the root cause of how the food

325
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,360
is made how it's grown how it's taken

326
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,160
care of and people are getting sick all

327
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,680
over you know the United States and and

328
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,120
I don't know what the regulations are in

329
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,800
other countries but for the United

330
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,760
States there's so many illnesses and and

331
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,760
illnesses the percentages have grown and

332
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,480
grown and grown and so many people

333
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,760
you know have realized that a lot of it

334
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,480
has to do with gut health leaky gut

335
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,000
syndrome not having enough of you know

336
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,639
good bacteria versus bad bacteria and it

337
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,720
all has to do with a lot of the way we

338
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:16,600
take care of ourselves we take care of

339
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,040
the food that we're growing and it's

340
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,600
it's really you know it's really hurting

341
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,279
our society it's you know we talked

342
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,639
about you know our hormones and we

343
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,279
talked about you know gut health and and

344
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,320
and illnesses and it's really it all

345
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:33,279
draws back to really we need to have

346
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,639
concern of how we are growing our food

347
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,880
and really how you know what we're doing

348
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,120
because it's affecting our society as a

349
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,480
whole and it's really it's it's

350
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,360
destroying the healths of people you

351
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,760
know Nationwide and and and any other

352
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,079
countries that are doing similar

353
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,120
things absolutely and and like there

354
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,399
you're right there there's a um a huge

355
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,480
issue with autoimmunity in our day and

356
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,800
age today and

357
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,320
a lot of it comes back to the food we

358
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,160
eat but also like a lifestyle of

359
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,920
Sanitation where we're obsessed with um

360
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,399
putting alcohol in our hands and

361
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,240
cleaning everything making everything

362
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,560
perfectly clean disinfected and and um

363
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,560
and it starts with the food and like the

364
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,920
soil because like the soil we Farm it in

365
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,560
a way typically with commercial

366
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,680
agriculture where it's it's almost a

367
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,839
sanitary soil there's bacteria but

368
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,360
there's such there so so devoid of life

369
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,160
it's almost like a sanitized growing

370
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,839
environment and then it's this those

371
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,720
this lack of diversity comes up through

372
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:40,160
the food chain so the plants don't have

373
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,240
a healthy microbiome on it as well so

374
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,120
then it's like because there's not the

375
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,839
microbiome there's a void there so then

376
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,440
there's as soon as you have something

377
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:53,360
growing some coli or some some sort of

378
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,160
unhealthy bacteria it'll explode in

379
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,759
population because there's not the

380
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,240
competition of the healthy BAC the

381
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,680
healthy microorgan orms on that food so

382
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,040
then it becomes even more important that

383
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,680
we sanitize our food so like yeah it's

384
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,160
and and like like people talk about too

385
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,680
like how it's important like you eat

386
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,360
your food dirty food and stuff like that

387
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,079
with some dirt on it so you have those

388
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,120
those microorganisms but like it's not

389
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,560
that simple because you got to make sure

390
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,800
it's the right dirt it's the dirt with

391
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,880
the healthy diversity the healthy

392
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,880
ecosystem of microorganisms in it and

393
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:30,720
then and then we can like fix the whole

394
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,920
the not only the food system with the

395
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,199
with the microbiome and but also just

396
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,839
like our our our culture of Sanitation

397
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:39,000
because like it's it's incredibly

398
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,600
important because if you look at our

399
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,240
body we are more bacteria than we are

400
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,279
human we vessels for carrying this this

401
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,839
diverse population of of bacteria in our

402
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:52,680
Po in in our in our body so we have to

403
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,639
be careful too with like a lot of these

404
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,079
pesticides and and and herbicides or

405
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,160
sprays that we put on our food or or

406
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,720
sanitize our hands with or whatever else

407
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,160
is like it might not affect our human

408
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,880
cells but like it could very well be

409
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,800
affecting our microbiome and and issues

410
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,160
yeah you know and and they they've come

411
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,839
out with you know information about you

412
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,920
know everyone with you know hand

413
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,920
sanitized especially during covid and

414
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,120
everybody's using it but you know too

415
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,319
much hand San hand sanitizer is not good

416
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,959
for you you know it's really we the

417
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:26,880
germs are good for you you know people

418
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,519
don't realize it but we need germs we

419
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,360
need to grow you know our antibodies we

420
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,800
need we need you know just like when

421
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,839
they say take a probiotic you should be

422
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,160
taking a Prebiotic too because good

423
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,759
bacteria versus bad bacteria you need

424
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,079
both you need both in your body and you

425
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,040
know people don't realize that and then

426
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,399
you know in America we have you know

427
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,120
chickens are getting shot up with

428
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,120
nitrate and they getting shot up with

429
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,680
all these different you know chemicals

430
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,720
and things and and you know we as a

431
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,600
society really need to try to go more

432
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,639
the pure route like you were talking

433
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:03,000
about regenerative egg and and be able

434
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,640
to have a cleaner you know way of living

435
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,520
because if we don't we're we're going to

436
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,000
our our country healthwise is going to

437
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,720
be destroyed it's already you see stats

438
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,480
of of how much you know PE illnesses

439
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,559
have gone up in so many different

440
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,439
categories and the question is why you

441
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:22,000
know and you know our society is not

442
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,520
looking at what they're putting in their

443
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,760
bodies and we were talking about before

444
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,959
the show you really need to treat your

445
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,600
body as a temple and maybe you can

446
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,600
expand on that explain to people why it

447
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,200
is so important that we just don't throw

448
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,760
things in our mouths and we just don't

449
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,400
take anything that we see over the

450
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,960
counter you know but we we treat our

451
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,600
body as a

452
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,840
temple yeah it's something that uh I

453
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,640
believe in very strongly is because like

454
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,080
you you gota look after your meat bag is

455
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,600
how I like to think about it because

456
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,360
like it's it it it makes you more

457
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,799
effective at everything you do in life

458
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,400
makes makes me a better dad a better

459
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,039
husband it makes me a better farmer

460
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,159
gives me more energy more clarity and

461
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:06,080
thought allows me to dream of of

462
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,080
directions I want to take my life like

463
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,360
like with with more Elites and make an

464
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:15,000
impact on agriculture and improve animal

465
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:16,320
welfare and and and and also like move

466
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,360
bring the the movement of regenerate

467
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,120
agriculture forward like it all that

468
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:25,039
health is is absolutely critical to uh

469
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,919
just to be

470
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,159
ourselves but like 100% ourselves not

471
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,520
just

472
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,919
walking through life and and and waking

473
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,559
up and and hitting the snooze button and

474
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,760
going through life as as a zombie and

475
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:41,080
just hit being on repeat like it's it's

476
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,679
absolutely critical yeah and like and

477
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,960
the food that we eat is a big part of

478
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:49,320
that it's um it's we almost gota like

479
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,320
it's it's we gota go back to eating a a

480
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,720
simpler diet kind of it's like it's not

481
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,440
all these complex ingredients and

482
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,520
packages stuff like that it's like it's

483
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:01,000
just your one ingredient and and uh and

484
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,559
and that's real food and then the Step

485
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,679
Beyond that is like the food that you

486
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,559
eat that's simple it's just one

487
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,600
ingredient is just your Whole Foods it's

488
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:10,120
nothing packaged A Step Beyond that then

489
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,840
is like okay now that I've made that

490
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,400
massive leap away from processed

491
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,320
foods the next step is okay now the food

492
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,960
that I'm eating is that top quality food

493
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,440
is that also food that's raised in a way

494
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,000
that makes it it's it's nutrient dense

495
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,960
it's healthy and it has it's not only

496
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
healthy but it's it's improves welfare

497
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,720
or and improves the environment like it

498
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,960
it's it's a it's treated in a way that

499
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,640
is that is is is healthy for the whole

500
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,679
ecosystem as us as a whole and our

501
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:47,440
planet as a whole oh 100% I I agree with

502
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,240
you totally and and and it you know it's

503
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,799
a lifestyle change it's not just

504
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,080
something you're going to do temporarily

505
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,240
and then you know okay you know like

506
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,559
just like people go on these fad diets

507
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,960
yeah after a while they get sick of

508
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,480
doing it and they go back to their old

509
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,280
way of living it's something that you

510
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,880
have to incorporate into your life and

511
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,960
and and stay consistent you know I don't

512
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,520
think of you know I don't look at it as

513
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,640
as a things as a diet I don't look at

514
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,400
things as you know this is the way it

515
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,400
has to be I I call it a lifestyle change

516
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,320
do you want to be healthy do you want to

517
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,559
feel good do you want to prevent illness

518
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,039
from occurring do you want to sustain

519
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,120
your illness that you have right now do

520
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,480
you want to keep it at a level where you

521
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,360
could be productive and happy you know

522
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,360
do you want to be a ble to live life the

523
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,960
way you you've always dreamt of being do

524
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,000
you want to have goals in the future and

525
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,520
be able to reach those goals well people

526
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,120
don't realize it but it all stems back

527
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,360
on how we take care of ourselves and

528
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,840
what we put in our bodies and it's so

529
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,440
important that people realize that every

530
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,400
little thing whether it's a supplement a

531
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,400
vitamin you know the food that we eat

532
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,120
you know whether it being natural or

533
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,000
processed you have to really think about

534
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,679
what am I putting in my body and how is

535
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,120
that going to affect me

536
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,600
and you know and and make it so natural

537
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,720
that you do it so consistently that you

538
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,120
don't even have to think about it

539
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,840
anymore it's just you you're just doing

540
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,440
it you're just doing it you know and I

541
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,679
think people have to really seriously

542
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,840
think about that how is it affecting

543
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,760
their life people have stomach issues

544
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,840
and they and they're not digesting food

545
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,080
well and they're going to a gastrologist

546
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,200
and I'm having all these problems oh

547
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,159
what are you eating well I had a pizza

548
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,440
yesterday and then I you know in the

549
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,400
morning I had a bowl of cereal and had

550
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,480
like you know you know this enormous

551
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,640
amount of sugar in it you know and and

552
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,039
you know people don't get it but we

553
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,960
really have to focus where we're getting

554
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,720
our foods and what we're putting in our

555
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,400
mouths and and think about the more

556
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,760
natural way of living and how that could

557
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,360
benefit us in the long run I think what

558
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,760
are your feelings about that I yeah I

559
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,279
completely agree and we have to be

560
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,960
careful that we're not trapped by normal

561
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,799
like all the normal ranges for your

562
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,880
blood all the normal diet that can't be

563
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,520
what's causing you that's that's a

564
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,200
normal diet for you to be eating but you

565
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,919
know what it's also normal to die at the

566
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,600
age of 60 75 80 from a cardiovascular

567
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:11,000
disease cancer and all these chronic

568
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,120
diseases that um are arguably

569
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,240
preventable with a healthy lifestyle and

570
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,480
exercise and a healthy diet and like you

571
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,559
gota almost beware of normal because if

572
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,240
you really look at what normal is that's

573
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,559
not a happy road to walk down I don't

574
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,919
want to start losing vitality by the age

575
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,159
of 65 because that's retirement age and

576
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:36,080
it's normal to have a sore body and an

577
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:37,440
achy body and a and and be incapable of

578
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,120
doing the things that I want to do with

579
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,919
my life now and it's it's normal to now

580
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,200
take a step back and no longer have Big

581
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:49,720
Dreams because that that's what normally

582
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,760
happens like beware of normal and and it

583
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,720
starts with every single day with your

584
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,080
daily choices like are you eating the

585
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,880
with the normal diet that's leading

586
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,360
people down this road this that this

587
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,760
unhappy Road really are you making the

588
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,840
normal choices that's going to lead you

589
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,440
down that road as well or should you now

590
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,360
do an overhaul of your pantry and have

591
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,760
instead of your your packaged food for

592
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,000
snacks you have some piece of fruit or

593
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,840
something like that like has some

594
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,559
healthy habits and it all comes back to

595
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,400
habits yes and like it it becomes easy

596
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,919
Once you these you form these healthy

597
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,960
habits these the these things that

598
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:28,480
become normal for your your new life

599
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,840
where you're cooking your own food

600
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,880
you're buying food from the perimeter of

601
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,000
the grocery store and like you're having

602
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,679
simple snacks that are just one

603
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,840
ingredient there's nothing in a package

604
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,559
and you don't stop and and buy that take

605
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,640
out because it's convenient it's like

606
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:47,679
it's now normal that oh I can just fast

607
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,600
like you can fast and not eat for a

608
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,559
couple days and and you'll be fine it's

609
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,640
crazy and and and like you don't have to

610
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,480
stop as soon as you have a hunger pay

611
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,799
you can you can drive and you can wait

612
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,760
till you come home you can have a piece

613
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:01,720
of of fruit and then you can cook

614
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,840
something up that's healthy right these

615
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,640
are all habits that you can form and

616
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,000
then like you said it's not a diet it's

617
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:12,640
a lifestyle it's it's a way of life

618
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,960

when you know our whole body is run by

682
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,679
hormones so you have to be very careful

683
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,120
just like we talked about treating your

684
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,200
body like a temple when you play around

685
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:52,159
with hormones you have to be really

686
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,919
really careful you know I I want to a

687
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,360
functional medicine doctor you went to a

688
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,559
natural path you know we we were

689
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,480
monitored by a profess professional I

690
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,600
know that I had to take consistent blood

691
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,440
tests and you know they had to make sure

692
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,919
everything was leveled properly and

693
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,840
because you know what if you have too

694
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:12,840
much of something it could throw your

695
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:14,679
whole body off in many ways and you know

696
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,240
I don't know how you feel but when you

697
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,000
went to the Natural path that was the

698
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,679
finally you know everybody else told you

699
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,279
don't worry about it just live with it

700
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,960
you know suck it up you know but what

701
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:26,279
was the turning point when you went to

702
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,520
that that natural path that helped you

703
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:30,880
you know get your life back in that area

704
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,880
of your

705
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,120
life the real thing that the naturopath

706
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:41,080
gave me was optimism because everywhere

707
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,039
else I spoke with it was it was just

708
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:47,240
hormone therapy hormone replacement

709
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,840
therapy and and there was never any T of

710
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,880
Lifestyle it was just these are the

711
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:55,600
drugs that you should take and you

712
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,039
should accept that and move on and and

713
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,760
the the unique thing about the naturop

714
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,399
path is like they they said I asked them

715
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,640
like this is what what I'm dealing with

716
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,600
this is what the doctors tell me do you

717
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,240
think I could fix this and they were the

718
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:10,159
the only people that said yeah you could

719
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,120
you could totally I I they saw a road to

720
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,080
recovery and like it gave me a glimmer

721
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:18,799
of hope when I wasn't really getting

722
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,880
much of that from anywhere else so and

723
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,640
they help me with like with like a

724
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,399
little more concrete things too like I

725
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,559
had digestive issues and along with dig

726
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:29,480
digestive issues is is I had a B12

727
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,720
deficiency because you I couldn't absorb

728
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,399
those B vitamins from my food yeah so

729
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,600
took some B12 for a short period of time

730
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:38,440
and that helped a little bit um and then

731
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,760
they also like pointed out to me like

732
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,720
hey these are probably the foods that

733
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,200
you're are reacting to you can try avoid

734
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,960
these certain foods that are causing you

735
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,960
to to flare up your immune system and

736
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,960
have this inflammation throughout your

737
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,880
body and I tried that too and and it

738
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:58,000
definitely helped and then uh I it just

739
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,039
got me down walking down that path and I

740
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,919
started reassessing everything as far as

741
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:05,200
health like my sleep habits like I was

742
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:08,200
definitely um I grew up in a household

743
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,320
of of of three brothers and um and and

744
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,799
no sisters and and and a hardworking dad

745
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,600
so it's like it was a real the

746
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,200
environment of just like go get it and

747
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,120
work hard and and um to H the

748
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,480
consequences kind of thing like you're

749
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,360
now go fight for the for the future that

750
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,519
you want to have like I was all for it

751
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,600
like that that mindset came naturally to

752
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:31,360
me as the way I grew up you that grit

753
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,480
and that hard work and push through and

754
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,760
tired doesn't matter I can I can handle

755
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,320
it kind of thing and um and that's just

756
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,760
it it came so naturally to me and I

757
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,760
think that's part of the reason why I

758
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,679
struggled I didn't have this opposing

759
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,919
Force this whole other part of my

760
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:50,640
personality wasn't

761
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:52,720
being wasn't being developed to the same

762
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,919
degree as the hard part of my of my

763
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,480
personality the softer side of myself I

764
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,440
I was not developing to the same same

765
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,960
degree and and that's a real inflection

766
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,919
point in my life when I when I got sick

767
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,000
is like what am I missing and then

768
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,200
that's when I started looking at these

769
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,200
Sofer sides of my personality and

770
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,720
surprisingly enough exercise for me was

771
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,880
part of that because it felt like a form

772
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,679
of self-expression yeah exercise before

773
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,279
because I had a physical job any sort of

774
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,399
exercise was a waste of energy that

775
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,840
could be energy that could put to

776
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,880
getting work done physical work like

777
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,440
taking the time to to really focus on

778
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,320
myself and like and like improve my my

779
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,120
my movement pattern so that I wouldn't

780
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,000
have all these achy joints my body hurt

781
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,279
and like all my joints hurt I couldn't

782
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,039
walk without pain anymore I couldn't

783
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,720
even run at all anymore it was so

784
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,559
restricting all this pain that I was

785
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,600
constantly trying to force my through

786
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:46,399
force myself through my day through all

787
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,559
this pain and discomfort and just tired

788
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,880
and brain fog and and it's it's just

789
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:56,080
like it it's it's tough because it's not

790
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,440
one simple feeling or one simple

791
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,080
diagnosis or one simple

792
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,240
issue that you're having it's like you

793
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,240
said the hormones they affect your whole

794
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,240
body so it's it's a long list of

795
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:11,399
insignificant symptoms that add up to

796
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,919
like I feel like an old man yeah and

797
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:14,480
have my energy levels like my immune

798
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:16,080
system is not working I had warts in my

799
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,799
thumb and like I tried treating it it

800
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,519
wouldn't go away it would just spread

801
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:22,320
right and then so like yeah I I was

802
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,279
focusing all I was trying a lot of

803
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,320
different things things that really

804
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,880
helped was like really improving my diet

805
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,039
simplifying my diet get eating those

806
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,799
whole foods and uh getting enough meat

807
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:34,919
in my diet made a difference too because

808
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,799
I got sick the the vegan movement was

809
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:39,799
massive and it seems hypocritical as a

810
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:41,000
Dairy Farmer to try the vegan diet but I

811
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:45,440
was desperate I was willing to try

812
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,639
anything so I did and and there's things

813
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,279
that uh did

814
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:51,480
improve with with like my diet did

815
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:54,600
improve to some degrees because I had a

816
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,240
lot of the whole plant foods but I

817
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,240
really started feeling much more

818
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,519
Vitality when I I started adding a lot

819
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,039
of those animal products back in and and

820
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:05,120
eating a lot of meat and a lot of dairy

821
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,039
raw dairy because I'm one of the few

822
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,799
people in Canada that can have raw dairy

823
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,399
because I produce it myself it's legal

824
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,880
for me to consume it and because like

825
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:17,559
the the pasteurized more processed Dairy

826
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,840
I was reacting to right it was it the

827
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:20,559
thing that was triggering my immune

828
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,639
system but I can drink liters and liters

829
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,000
of raw milk without issues so that's

830
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:27,159
added that back to my diet and that

831
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,919
really helped as well as well as fasting

832
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:30,760
my

833
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,799
hormones never returned for six years

834
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,639
straight and and it's frustrating

835
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,880
because I was I constantly was building

836
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:38,559
these healthy habits and my hormones

837
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,919
haven't returned yet and it's

838
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,000
almost can be tough to keep going when

839
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:44,080
you're in that place but it's like when

840
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,720
you're sick you almost have to push your

841
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,840
body to the extreme and and to to allow

842
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,720
it the permission to to relax and

843
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,919
recover and allow you to bring your

844
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,039
hormones back but like for me is like

845
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:58,559
the last

846
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,880
triggering moment that allowed my body

847
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,200
to relax was I did a prolonged fast the

848
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,720
first one I ever did after that it was

849
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,679
it was two and a half to three days

850
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,639
something like that I'm never really too

851
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:10,039
picky dogmatic about it or too strict

852
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:12,279
but it's like two and a half three a

853
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:13,639
that and after that my hormones improved

854
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:14,960
they came back and I wasn't taking

855
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:18,200
hormones anymore

856
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,320
and it never gets old being healthy like

857
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,960
because like you can you can have all

858
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,240
sorts of Dreams in your life but like as

859
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,399
soon as you get sick you only have one

860
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,519
so like it's such a a weight lifted off

861
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,600
my shoulder

862
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,559
and uh to to be healthy again you know I

863
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,480
it's it's it's wonderful once you start

864
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:38,200
feeling better again because I I went

865
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,279
from you know being so young and feeling

866
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:43,039
so old I couldn't even get myself out of

867
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:45,880
bed I was so fatigued and I I couldn't

868
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,440
focus my moods were all over the board

869
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,799
everything was changing about me and you

870
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,240
know it was amazing because like you

871
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,279
know there are so many tests out there

872
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,960
now they got DNA tests they got hair

873
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:59,159
tests they have certain food you knowest

874
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,880
test where they could tell you you know

875
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,559
what foods you can eat what foods you

876
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,639
can have moderately and what foods you

877
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,600
need to stay away from because your body

878
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:07,919
might not be agreeing with certain foods

879
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,480
but you're not having a physical

880
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,440
reaction you know you're not getting

881
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,359
bumps or a rash but you're you're

882
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,520
getting all these symptoms inside and

883
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:18,359
you don't understand why but your body

884
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,919
is not agreeing with the foods that

885
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:24,040
you're putting in your body and you know

886
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:26,240
I I did for me personally I did hormone

887
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:29,359
therapy and then they tested all my

888
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,720
vitamins and they tested all my um you

889
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,399
know what I was lacking and they put me

890
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,480
on certain supplements and they put me

891
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:39,399
on certain vitamins that I was deficient

892
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,480
in and I also started to do different

893
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:44,240
supplements that rejuvenated the cells

894
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,639
in your body and because the old the

895
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,560
older you get and when you start to go

896
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:50,040
into like the par menopause and you

897
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,960
start to slow down your libido your body

898
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,320
is not the same anymore and your cell

899
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,960
production is is slower everything is

900
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,280
starting to get deficient and you know I

901
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,520
was taking pomegranate I was taking the

902
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,640
the you know both both extract and and

903
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,119
the and the and the pomegranate itself

904
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,200
and that helped with the Rejuvenation of

905
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:12,680
of cells and and a lot of other little

906
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,280
things and just eating certain foods and

907
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,079
like you said sleep people don't realize

908
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,040
it but sleep is a huge factor and so is

909
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,520
stress learning how to cope with stress

910
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,079
and I love how you brought up about

911
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,200
exercise because exercise is not just

912
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,800
about you know gaining muscle strength

913
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,200
you know you could let out a lot of

914
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,000
steam and you can and it makes you feel

915
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,480
good about yourself and it really can

916
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,640
help you you know it makes you feel good

917
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,480
about yourself you get less you know it

918
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,079
takes that stress level down and you

919
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:47,079
start to feel more focused and it it

920
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,200
also gives you a good you know um view

921
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:52,280
of the day like wow I accomplished this

922
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,720
I got this done I feel good you know and

923
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,480
you know it puts you on a different

924
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:59,839
pathway of of mentally thinking so you

925
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,680
know I think exercise and and and sleep

926
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,160
are two major factors because I I

927
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,240
started to make sure that I got I

928
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,040
Incorporated enough as sleep and some

929
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,359
people don't even realize it but when

930
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,599
they're going through this stuff a lot

931
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,319
of people suffer from insomnia so then

932
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,319
you know there's different ways that you

933
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:17,560
could focus on to try to help with

934
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:19,599
insomnia that are natural that are out

935
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,880
there as well but sleep is important you

936
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,520
need those eight hours of sleep and and

937
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,800
just a little bit of exercise and

938
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,520
walking around a lake or just you know

939
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,280
going outside and taking a walk down the

940
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,359
road things like that is is all you need

941
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,880
you don't have to be like w lifting you

942
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,960
know 60 lb weights and you know going on

943
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,520
the exercise bike for an hour and a half

944
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,079
you could be doing simple things and

945
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,079
they could have a huge impact on your

946
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,000
body so I think it's like you know I

947
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,040
learned what my body needed and I

948
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,880
learned what my body didn't want and

949
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,720
once I started staying away from what my

950
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,119
body didn't want and I started

951
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,119
incorporating everything that I needed I

952
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,240
started feeling the change was that

953
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,240
something similar you know that that you

954
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,160
felt as well yeah for me it's the same

955
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,880
but different like it's uh like I was

956
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,920
saying before like like the path with

957
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,280
the natural path like it's uh they told

958
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,640
me the B12 they told me the foods I

959
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,319
needed to avoid and those things helped

960
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,800
a lot um but eventually the B12 didn't

961
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:16,079
make much of a difference anymore as I

962
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,520
was trying to like had less inflammation

963
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,520
and stuff like that and the things that

964
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:24,240
made the biggest impact on my health was

965
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,119
just the very simple things like like

966
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,839
like the sleep like and my sleep's not

967
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:31,720
perfect now I got four young boys and

968
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:34,000
they keep up hours the day and night and

969
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,440
um but it's it's I have enough other

970
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,280
healthy habits I think that now I I'm

971
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,920
able to handle a little bit of uh lack

972
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,680
of sleep but I prioritize my sleep

973
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,640
whenever I can and I I have the Naps

974
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,920
when I need to and um and I'm getting

975
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,920
through with with not as much sleep as I

976
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,400
would like but like for me the big

977
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,079
things was just like and and there's

978
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,359
clues in your life as far as what to

979
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,760
focus on

980
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,400
um for example like the things that you

981
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,319
dread the most quite often that's a hint

982
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,480
like why do I dread that for example

983
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:11,839
like when I was in in the depth of of of

984
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,040
uh of feeling like an old man like I was

985
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,319
almost fearful of being cold which is a

986
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,680
problem because I live in Canada it gets

987
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:18,880
pretty cold

988
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,560
yeah I I dreaded getting out of the

989
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,599
shower and it's like my bi is often cold

990
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,760
I have um in my family there's a a long

991
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:28,280
line of of rhinos like where you're your

992
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,440
blood circulation shuts off in your

993
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,480
extremities and it gets a little bit

994
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,560
cold then it gets extremely cold because

995
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,720
the blood circulation is shut off

996
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,079
painful and and uh you can have all

997
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,400
sorts of damage to to your to to your

998
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:41,720
skin and stuff like that with a lack of

999
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,520
blood flow but like that's something I

1000
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,920
struggle with constantly and it got to

1001
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,920
the point I almost had symptoms of

1002
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,440
anxiety around going outside and and and

1003
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,960
and doing the work that I need to do on

1004
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,079
a daily basis so I started doing cold

1005
00:38:53,960 --> 00:39:00,079
showers and believe me the amount of

1006
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:03,760
stress that I felt getting that water is

1007
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,960
is insane but I stuck with it and like I

1008
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,800
learned so much about my body in the

1009
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:12,800
meantime not only did I get healthier

1010
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,800
and and um because like the the benefits

1011
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,480
that people often talk about like I

1012
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,520
Revitalize the mitochondria in my body

1013
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,839
because the mitochondria are the heat

1014
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,960
producing parts of your

1015
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:25,760
cells and like and like like they

1016
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,839
produce heat and energy so I had more

1017
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,240
energy throughout my whole day because

1018
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,960
of it but like also things like once you

1019
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,160
get into that cold water you have to try

1020
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,079
to control your your stress response

1021
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,960
control your breathing and I was never

1022
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:42,800
really aware of my breathing before

1023
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,960
right and and so like when I took what I

1024
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,520
learned trying to get into the cold

1025
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,359
water and to to what stressed breathing

1026
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,440
felt like and how to control that and

1027
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,680
now what relax breathing feels like I

1028
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,720
started noticing I'm just working just

1029
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,720
do my normal work throughout the day I'm

1030
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:03,920
I'm stress breathing for no reason right

1031
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,480
to your body that's stress yeah it's

1032
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,760
throughout your whole day just the way

1033
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,319
you're breathing you got to breathe into

1034
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,680
your through your diaphragm into your

1035
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:13,079
belly and I was breathing up in my chest

1036
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,640
constantly just shallow breathing and

1037
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,520
that's signaling to my body that that

1038
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,240
we're in a stressful situation when I

1039
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,720
wasn't I was just going about through my

1040
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,119
daily routine and and like so that was a

1041
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,480
huge hint like why I'm so fearful and

1042
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,599
and almost anxious of the cold it's like

1043
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,440
that's a Direction needed to go and that

1044
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,920
made a massive difference bigger almost

1045
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,800
than a lot of other things and then like

1046
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:37,280
in fasting I was like it I never it

1047
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,800
never occurred to me as I especially

1048
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,839
when I was younger but like growing up

1049
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,359
and like I'm I'm six feet tall I had

1050
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:45,280
huge grow Spurs I couldn't do without

1051
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:46,800
food I need to grow and and fuel my body

1052
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,280
kind of thing and like and then later on

1053
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,079
in life I gotta feel the work I got to

1054
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,960
do I got a physical

1055
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,800
job it never occurred to me to do it

1056
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,200
fast but when I did like I said that was

1057
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,119
a triggering event that brought my

1058
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,560
hormones back and and not only that it's

1059
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:05,200
surprisingly easy and later on I I

1060
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,359
listen to other people about fasting you

1061
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,400
take some salt while you're fasting it

1062
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,160
curbs your hunger and it keeps your

1063
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,040
strength up so I can do a physical job I

1064
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,599
can pick Stones all day fasted as long

1065
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,520
as I have enough salt if I start feeling

1066
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,720
shaky and weak I consume a little extra

1067
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,599
salt and I'm good to go again like it's

1068
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,520
and it's like the power that you feel

1069
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,040
realizing that you control over your

1070
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,160
diet because if you're out traveling

1071
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,359
whatever else that you you know I can go

1072
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,000
two three days without food no problem

1073
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:33,880
right so I don't have to eat this

1074
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,640
Convenient Food that's around at the

1075
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,720
airports or wherever else or or or at a

1076
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,560
party something like that and you're

1077
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:43,400
feeling some H things like you can you

1078
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:44,880
can wait you won't die yeah exact yeah

1079
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,440
there like there's really much focusing

1080
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,440
on simple things and looking at my own

1081
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,880
life for hints of what I should focus on

1082
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,280
first but like the really the simple

1083
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,960
things like eating the Whole Foods

1084
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,599
getting some doing some some some

1085
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,680
exercise it doesn't have to be crazy

1086
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,000
like you said like the most important

1087
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,440
thing about exercise is doing it

1088
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,480
consistently so just do what you love

1089
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,800
and for me more like the like the the

1090
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,240
animal type movement stuff like that

1091
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,760
just felt freeing for some reason and it

1092
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,640
wasn't in a masculine way it was much

1093
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,520
more in a softer way that just the

1094
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,599
self-expression only in an artistic way

1095
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,800
but for me it built my body it got me

1096
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,240
strong it was easy for me to stay

1097
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,640
consistent and is a lot of healthy body

1098
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,800
move movements which applied really well

1099
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,240
to my physical job surprisingly enough

1100
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,800
to um all the critics especially my

1101
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,920
father out there seeing me do exercising

1102
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,839
saying like why you wasting all your

1103
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,079
energy because like allow me to learn

1104
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:43,599
how to move properly move at least less

1105
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:46,720
joint pain less body aches and things

1106
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,480
like that so then yeah it made a made

1107
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,720
that made a really big difference too

1108
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,720
and all these all these habits that that

1109
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,920
I focus on one at a time then you make a

1110
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,240
habit around it becomes becomes easy and

1111
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,280
normal to do those things on a day day

1112
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:01,079
to-day basis and now you maintain those

1113
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,280
habits becomes much easier so like

1114
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,079
building those habits and and then uh

1115
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,880
for me like the the final straw was was

1116
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:08,319
the

1117
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:11,079
fast that's great you know what when you

1118
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:13,640
brought up the breathing I you know that

1119
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:17,240
is so important like when I started to

1120
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:19,640
learn how to do slow breathing and I

1121
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:22,160
took some lessons and they taught you

1122
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:26,200
how to control your stress how to

1123
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,000
control your body through breathing wow

1124
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,800
what a difference it made you know you

1125
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,800
can be anywhere you can be anywhere and

1126
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,160
if you are conscious of the way you're

1127
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,319
breathing you can change the way you

1128
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,599
feel you can change the way your mind is

1129
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,240
thinking you can change the way your

1130
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,680
body is feeling just by the way you're

1131
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,200
breathing you know people have done like

1132
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,200
you know I've showed people how to do

1133
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,800
methods of of relaxation breathing and

1134
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,160
as they're sitting in their seats at

1135
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,720
work when they're all stressed out and

1136
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,359
you know it's amazing how impactful it's

1137
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,440
so important to know how to breathe CU

1138
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,760
most people don't pay attention but if

1139
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,960
we're in a stressful situation or if

1140
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,920
we're not feeling well we should focus

1141
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,520
on our breathing I think and really

1142
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,400
learn the right way to breathe and

1143
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,720
that's something people should look into

1144
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,400
I think what do you

1145
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,960
feel yeah it's it's always like if you

1146
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,559
told me that 10 years ago I thought that

1147
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:24,319
sounds hokey I'm not gonna worry about

1148
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:26,119
that like it made a big difference in in

1149
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,559
uh in the the average stress I felt

1150
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:29,720
throughout the day just and it's not

1151
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,240
just like yes you you got your breathing

1152
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,599
and like being able to focus on that but

1153
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,359
it's just like the the awareness of what

1154
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,480
relax breathing feels like and what

1155
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,520
stress breathing feels like that was

1156
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,079
massive for me just having that

1157
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,480
awareness yeah and like so like for me

1158
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:45,480
that was the biggest impact I got from

1159
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,160
cold exposure is just the self-awareness

1160
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,040
of what stressed feels like and what

1161
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,880
relaxed feels like yeah it's I don't I

1162
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,599
don't naturally have that much

1163
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,680
self-awareness I'm not really very

1164
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,119
naturally very self-critical and and is

1165
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,920
good some bad things to that like I'm

1166
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,160
not really I don't I don't feel the

1167
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:05,000
impact of of uh of pure pressure the

1168
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,359
same way some other people do but like

1169
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,200
yeah it the downside like I I I could be

1170
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,760
horribly stressed and have no

1171
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,599
idea that that awareness made a big

1172
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,240
difference and and just yeah like being

1173
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:19,559
aware and then being able to change your

1174
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,920
breathing because you practiced relax

1175
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:22,839
breathing and just be able to switch

1176
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,480
over and like for me too like other

1177
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:27,800
things like that I I learned that

1178
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,599
techniques that I also use during those

1179
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:32,960
stressful cold uh periods is like I

1180
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:34,520
would smile even though like I'm I'm

1181
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,559
struggling I would just force a big

1182
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,880
smile on my face and it's like it's

1183
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:39,240
hilarious some of the research that are

1184
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,800
out there people just putting pencils in

1185
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,880
their mouth which kind of f forces a

1186
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,599
smile and like you feel better like it

1187
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,319
it works yeah like you wouldn't think so

1188
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,359
and especially people especially like

1189
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,880
myself are just like go getters it's

1190
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:53,440
like yeah like I don't got time for that

1191
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,720
kind of hokey stuff but it's

1192
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,400
like it does it it makes it makes a

1193
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,760
difference

1194
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,359
it makes a difference and I feel like

1195
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,319
you know I hear people use that excuse I

1196
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,960
don't have time I don't have time but we

1197
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:05,880
do have time you know all you need is

1198
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,480
five minutes of the day 10 minutes of

1199
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,720
the day somewhere if you can spare 15

1200
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,119
even better but all you need is a few

1201
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,480
minutes here and there and just little

1202
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,640
tweaks can make such a big difference in

1203
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,720
your life something better than nothing

1204
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,160
and then what I always tell myself is

1205
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,880
that it's never a lack of time that's

1206
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,280
your issue for not making this change

1207
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,440
it's a lack of priorities like how

1208
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,079
important is it maybe you got to

1209
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,319
something in your life that's very

1210
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:31,800
important to you like you got a wedding

1211
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:33,720
coming up and you want to get a healthy

1212
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:37,359
body or like you have your your kids or

1213
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:39,000
your grandkids or or or a massive dream

1214
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,559
that you might have like chasing your

1215
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,079
dreams or creating that business like

1216
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:44,200
and like that's that's that's a real

1217
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:46,440
thing for me I'm trying to improve the

1218
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:49,119
lives of farm animals like it's like you

1219
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,400
gota tie these little habits that you

1220
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,319
say I should add this to my life I don't

1221
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,599
got time or but it's not that at all

1222
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:57,079
it's a lack of priorities like what can

1223
00:46:54,599 --> 00:47:00,040
I give up like I don't golf anymore

1224
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:02,839
don't play video games forever but like

1225
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,240
it's like it's like things that you can

1226
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:07,720
give up or like or you look on your

1227
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,680
phone it it gives you a a number every

1228
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,640
so often of the average amount of time

1229
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:15,040
you spend on on your phone screen day

1230
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:18,480
like cut that in half and you can have

1231
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,680
hours more time exactly exactly you know

1232
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,280
I you hit it right on the nose it's

1233
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:25,520
really just an excuse because you don't

1234
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,040
prioritize what's important in your life

1235
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,160
and you have to really think about

1236
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,319
what's important to you you know what do

1237
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,160
you really how do you really want to

1238
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:35,079
feel how do you really want to look how

1239
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,440
do you really you know when you wake up

1240
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:38,119
in the morning you look in the mirror

1241
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,160
are you happy with who you see are you

1242
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:42,599
happy with the way you feel and then you

1243
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,400
got to start just stop making excuses

1244
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:47,480
and just make little you know prioritize

1245
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,559
your time just a little better and all

1246
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,359
you need is just a few minutes and

1247
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,359
miracles could happen it's not going to

1248
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:56,680
happen right away of course you know but

1249
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:57,920
baby steps you know that's part of the

1250
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,599
problems because usually the things that

1251
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,240
we need to give up give us immediate

1252
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,599
gratification and the things that we're

1253
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:07,359
trying to add in requires that delayed

1254
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:09,160
gratification but those but that that

1255
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,720
that delayed gratification the impact is

1256
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,839
massive so like that's the problem so

1257
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,000
you got you got have a lot of

1258
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:16,640
self-control in your life to to make

1259
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,200
that happen but if you if you stick to

1260
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,720
it it it pays back for sure oh it

1261
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,599
definitely does it definitely does now

1262
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,359
if you had to give a couple takeaways

1263
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,559
before we go what are some important

1264
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,280
factors that you want people to realize

1265
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:31,480
from this whole conversation because we

1266
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,880
tapped into a lot of important things

1267
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,440
and we you gave such such great advice

1268
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,240
today thank you so much for all the

1269
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,200
great advice you gave but if you had to

1270
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,119
like sum it up what are some things that

1271
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,520
you just want the audience to realize

1272
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,520
from this

1273
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,760
conversation big big picture is yes you

1274
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,640
need to look after your body look after

1275
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,440
yourself to make yourself more effective

1276
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:00,400
at everything you do

1277
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:03,280
and I think just just thinking now like

1278
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,440
if you are in that place where you're

1279
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,920
sick your body has an amazing capacity

1280
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,920
to heal and I think that that is I think

1281
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,040
maybe the the biggest takeaways like

1282
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,400
your body can heal if you get out of the

1283
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:20,640
way and stop feeding it junk and

1284
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,640
stop Doom scrolling and stop sitting on

1285
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,799
the couch like these simple habits that

1286
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,400
you hear is is not rocket signs every

1287
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:28,480
basically everybody know knows what you

1288
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,760
got to do to be healthy like you got to

1289
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,040
sleep enough you got to exercise just a

1290
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,599
little bit it doesn't have to be a whole

1291
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:36,400
lot it's just start that habit eat your

1292
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:38,440
Whole Foods stay on the prim and the

1293
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,960
grocery store and then like and then

1294
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:45,720

1299
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,280

much sander for coming on the show today

1377
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,319
and sharing all this valuable

1378
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,200
information I think you really you know

1379
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:53,440

00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,920
share today how important it is to you

1381
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,319
know really focus on what we put in our

1382
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,559
bodies how we take care of our overall

1383
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,760
health you know and really about putting

1384
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:05,160
oursel on a pedestal because it's time

1385
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,160
that people show each other not just

1386
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:10,040
show other people but show themselves

1387
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,640
some self-love because really you know

1388
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,119
without taking care of yourself you'll

1389
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,480
never be able to take care of the people

1390
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,720
around you so you really have to focus

1391
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,480
on number one and then you could focus

1392
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:22,559
on whatever else is important in your

1393
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:24,920
life but you know health is so important

1394
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,599
and it really goes down to what how

1395
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,480
we're treating our bodies and what we're

1396
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:32,599
