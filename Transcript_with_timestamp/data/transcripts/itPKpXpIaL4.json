  "text": "you know it's amazing that we've actually expanded to a bigger space in ekkenov where we partnered with the tlc children's home and we've managed to form an agreement with them to use their farming space which is about nine hectares [Music] [Music] welcome to the farming podcast my name is your host um once again right here on the private property channel today we're joined by a friend of the podcast who has been on the show before and we spoke about hydroponic farming rooftop farming because she had her own rooftop farm in johannesburg cbd but she joins us today on a different level where she's going to tell us about her agribusiness online platform that she has started with the women's organization and that promotes and showcases agribusinesses regarding hydroponic farming and organic farming so if you are interested in hydroponic farming how to diverse into organic farming i believe this conversation would be quite beneficial to you because she is a farmer herself and so she knows a thing or two about hydroponic farming and so yeah if you have any questions please feel free to comment like and share subscribe to the podcast and reach out to our guests over an abava conversation today because this podcast is for you and we're here to help you learn everything about agribusiness so i'm getting into the conversation right now i'm joined by ooh how are you doing and thank you so much for coming on to the podcast once again i'm blessed thank you my sister bali and it's actually a pleasure and i'm really grateful for the opportunity to share with fellow farmers the developments that have taken place and in building these communities that we are surrounded with because we always say we want to be the ones that see the change in our communities and we go all out to actually make sure that we impact communities absolutely so let's just start off by giving us a rundown of where you are right now with your farming business i remember the last time you spoke you're farming in the rooftop is everything going well and we also touched based on um how covert had impacted you um in our previous conversation so how's the farm looking are you harvesting any crops at the moment you know it's amazing that you've actually expanded to a bigger space in ekinoff where we partnered with the tlc children's home and we have managed to form an agreement with them to use their farming space which is about nine hectares so we set up in hydroponics which takes now fourteen thousand uh crops and we are also doing an incubation then we set up a class and we working as a group of five of us now in a collaboration called african women in agriculture okay so i've got four dynamic women that i'm working with is janus schechter agnes hawaii and i've got veronica aswany and we're also working with bia at black so as the five of us we've started that incubation now and also the farming business and the platform called i am citizen so it's been a great move because now it has given us an opportunity to now impact communities surrounding the akanov area where we recruit young women who want to do hydroponics farming and do also organic farming and we also give them business skills and they're also taken to a point where they're able to start their own businesses using farming as a way of of entering markets because the challenge has been that they say as young people farming hasn't been easy so we said no you can join and see that there's there's actually so much that you can do within the value chain of farming so we we we started with the first incubation last year and then this year we've got the second cohort which we're doing up until july then july we're taking the next intake where we're encouraging them to go also and impact their communities where they come from and and we evaluate their community projects we profile them on i am citizen which is the online platform digital platform that we have started as aware yeah so tell me more about the incubation that you formed with aria how long does it take and why did you decide that there's a need for an incubation with a current situation where most of the challenges that were faced by women was access to land and access to finance and also looking at how do we make sure that we we empower them on starting just starting because the key thing is that people want to be into farming but they're not starting so with that nine hectares that we we listen from the children's home we're able to get them to start and practice and also learn from a space where we are set up and then we also assist them in incapacitate them to a point of them starting up their own businesses where they come from so the incubation is actually on incapacitating women to to be able to start and farm and they have access to having like trainings that they don't have to do just online but they can come and do practicals at the farm where we are at the tlc children's home yeah and how long do you train the woman around farming um is it just a few months a few weeks and then what happens thereafter it's actually six months because the first cohort we got them for the whole year last year so this year we split it into six months so we we we've got the first call second cohorts that we started in feb they're finishing in july and then we'll take the next cohort up until november so what what happens there we train them on the practical side of farming and also we we have classes where we have personal development we're also looking at at training them on finances how to manage their finances how to have access to markets and then we invite guest speakers on various topics in agriculture to come and address them so we understand that there's more farming than just farming the land we say you can actually be in in in any value chain within the farming sector so we encourage them to also look at how they can come in we've got new intakes that some of them are looking at being retailers and starting their own businesses where they will actually uh be acting as aggregators to to to aggregate from farmers and then supply the communities where they come from yeah so am i correct in saying that the incubation right now is purely focused on crop farming and not necessarily livestock we we've we've included poultry this year because we've had three intakes of young ladies that want to do poultry so we've we've included poultry and we're looking at expanding also to piggery and also looking at sheep farming and goat farming and rabbit farming because we interview them and then they tell us what what space they want to be in we also guest speakers on the various topics like with poultry we had a young farmer that has just opened an abattoir in akinov to come and speak to them and encourage them that there's more you can do within the value chain of poultry so thomas bong and it to be part of the incubation do i need to be a farmer that has access to land for example but maybe need a bit of technical information or technical skill in how to cultivate crops etc and that is when i would apply into the occupation stay there for six months and then go back onto my land and farm or can it be anybody who's just interested in farming exploring the different commodities that are available in farming whether it's crops poultry even adding a value add in terms of an abattoir so can it just be anybody or do i have to have land on or an already existing business where i can up up skill and improve my knowledge in farming we we're actually encouraging even those who don't have land why because we're saying there's lots of people who say they don't have lenta they're not maximizing the spaces that they have where they are because there's a new project also that will be starting very soon in may where we're using pyramids to show them how to grow in their own backyards because with the current situation of food shortage we cannot leave those backyards to life fallow so there's a friend of mine veronica who's also part of the of the women in agriculture she's designed a a pyramid that you can use as a vertical farm to to plant in in a small area about 120 plants at a goal so we're pushing that to train people on that and then we assist you to get to it we give them a fundable business plan that they can now go back and use the land where they come from okay so now moving on to the online agricultural platform you mentioned that you're promoting businesses that are doing hydroponic farming and organic farming so just tell us a little bit more about the platform and how it works so this platform will work as a community as well because we've got a page where we invite communities to come and learn and say like for example ask an agronomist and then there will be an agronomist that will answer questions for people who want to be informing but they've got lots of questions that they're not certain about and then we've got a site where we do profiling of farms and also profiling of of of stakeholders like if there's uh your your your people that supply inputs they will be profiled on on that i am citizen so that people have access to the full network of not just farmers network of of also suppliers and also stakeholders within the agricultural space when did you decide to when did you develop and launch the im citizen platform and what success stories can you tell us thus far that have come out of the platform with the i'm citizen we started in in 2021 and the success stories has been that we've been able to build a network of farmers but even the incubators that we had for a year last year they're also profiled on that when they're able to do their business on that platform and network amongst themselves we we encourage them to say you you need to collaborate and work together because with farming you cannot operate in isolation so we're encouraging them to say please work together and with the second incubation that we have the second cohort we've also onboarded them to say do your business on the platform because digital space you're not limited to where you are you can actually network with women from different regions different places because we're going global and we cannot be operating just locally and confirming uh that you did say that the land that uh the incubation and the platform is is is is highlighting is for the farmers who are being incubated in akanov have you received any requests for people who've seen successes in your incubation program to maybe replicate what you're doing in other areas particularly in khao deng over and above the other provinces yes we we've had so many requests because even now we we're basically communicating with people in in the area of iguruleni they actually saying can we replicate this in in in the east as well because we want to take it within communities we've been counting then also we've had in inquiries from the eastern cape to actually replicate this ip in the different areas right and just summing up engagements with with them so we're open to to replicating this model in different areas yeah i i think a critical question also to find out spoken is that how many intakes can you take at a time okay at the moment because we're in partnership with idc and we we were looking at 12 cohort which is six months we're looking at 24 in in in in one year but now with the other portion that we've included we're looking at using the the new isa vuno which we've named as isi vunaway will also look at impacting communities at larger scale where we'll have saturday classes for them to learn about this is the new one that we're doing where we are training them on how to maximize their spaces in the urban areas especially the ones that back gardens and i mean on my back garden which is 20 by 20 i've managed to grow plants as well so i always say to them there's no way you can leave that land follow and and then you say you don't have food because we still have that project called farm in a box where we we donate seeds to to to to communities to start their own food gardens at their back yards right you did say that the the the incubation is a non-profit so what happens to all the crops that you uh that you produce part of the incubation program do you sell that um with the revenue do you apply it back onto the farm or do you give the crops to nearby communities as part of food security yes on the on the one for farming enterprise because within the the area we've got the farming enterprise which is the one where we're planting the crops and we've partnered with ebb and fresh they are our off takers they come and collect and sell and then the profit is it's it's plowed back into the area npo so the the other one it's impacting like the very same children's home they they actually get produced from because when we started we started with them and we started as a food garden that we were doing for them and then they saw the way it was done and this that we've got len that's available can you partner with us and set up something in in in the tlc children's home so part of the impact that we make it's actually ten percent goes to protect of communities locally and then the rest we we plow back into the npo from the sales made with the partnership we have with ebb and fresh who are aggregators yeah it sounds like you guys have really thought about it quite uh extensively you know uh making sure that you're covering all the blocks that really farmers face as a big challenge or a barrier to entry into uh the agricultural sector um i know you are a farmer as well and now you've transitioned into a a a space where you're helping other farmers teaching them um exposing their businesses and obviously transferring skills to aspirant farmers what have you learned um throughout 2021 and going into 2022 over since you've started helping um all the cohorts in the various stages of their businesses what have you learned from it from from starting um your incubation program as well as i am a citizen uh program what have you learned around the farmers and more so just uh um in general within agriculture from a farmer's perspective and wearing my head as a farmer this has been an amazing time because now as a farmer we always wanted to start in isolation and run your farm there on your own but now with moving to african women in agriculture where i collaborated with five dynamic women it it has actually opened my eyes to a point that collaboration is key if we want to build communities we need to collaborate and the networking that takes place as farmers has actually grown to a point that i'm even networking with women as far as the northwest because we we didn't leave it to saying we are in counting we need to address issues and how they it has actually opened up for us to actually network with with people as far as india because i've just won the global award for women in in in agriculture addressing the sdg goal number two of zero hunger and i'm finding myself speaking to women in india who are doing and how they and this has opened up a door because like i said with with with networking we're not limiting it to the whatsapp we're now saying let's work with apps where we can empower each other and reach other actions and countries surrounding us as south africa well that's fantastic and congratulations on your award i think it definitely shows um of the efforts and the work that you're doing on the ground but before i let you go swangela what three points can you give to aspirin farmers who want to venture into farming whether it could be crops livestock poultry what advice would you give maybe top three things that you'd give to an aspirin farmer who wants to venture into agriculture thank you my sister you know i always say to to farmers that as a farmer you must have the tendency to continue despite all challenges that we're currently facing and and the second one is to actually be there as someone who's a solution see yourself as a solution what are you bringing into the agrispace be a solution in a community and also the third one would be start wherever you are what is the that's in your hand do not limit yourself to say i'm waiting until i have 10 million or i have a funding from start as little as at your back garden move on let your communities know that you are farming in your air if you say you are a farmer no one knows where you come from that you are farming it's a challenge so start where you are and use as little resources that as you move on and you're speaking to other funders they always want to know have you started something where are you uh where are you currently where are you moving to what are your futures and don't be scared to dream big i always encourage people to say dream big don't limit yourself i left my profession as an accountant to do my passion of farming and i've never stopped i never stopped i started living with a small garden at my backyard to actually let me eat from the garden just outside my house and then move on so i really encourage people to say start where you are and don't despise humble beginnings because we always want to see things happening at a higher level without starting where you you you have your footprint wow so that's my my treatment to say start where you are don't limit yourself and dream big and definitely have the tenacity to farm thank you so much for joining us we thoroughly enjoy your inputs and your presence within the farming podcast and thank you for the work that you're doing in agriculture because a lot more people need training a lot more people need exposure into the realities that a farmer faces every single day and thank you for just you know pushing those individuals and holding their hand training them transferring skills making them understand how the whole value chain of agriculture works and congratulations once again for winning your award thank you so much my sister and stay blessed we're really touched and thank you that you you you taking these stories too because these stories need to be heard by the next generation i'm always looking at the seventh generation because i'm already with grandchildren so i want them to know that we didn't i would tell them we were busy i won't be with this farming it never stopped you need to you you just need to take the dayton forward yeah so i'm really and thank you and god bless you for for all the work that you're doing thank you i really really appreciate it that was mongerella who's one of the founding members of african women in agriculture the organization is called aria a w i a they're based in akanov where they are incubating farmers for a period of six months teaching them how to produce crops how to understand the value chain and they're working with an aggregator who's able to take those crops and just show the farmers basically the basics around farming what goes into farming and how the valley chain works from a spec requirement to an input perspective and when you have to cultivate your own land so they teach you how to formulate a business plan how to just get started and get going and working with other farmers and just understanding the realities that a farmer faces each and every day they're not only focused in crop production but have moved into poultry and have aspirations into moving into rabbit farming livestock farming as a whole so i think if you are looking to start a farm or just maybe grow the area in which you're producing food in i think uh the we are team is is a team that you should get in touch with so reach out to and her team based in akanov and i believe once they have their cohort applications open you should definitely apply uh if you have any questions please feel free to comment um on our youtube channel we make sure that we could reach out to um too small on your behalf and maybe share her contact details as well but yeah that's it from the farming podcast today's topic was agribusiness online platforms how we start agribusiness online platforms incubating farmers teaching farmers transferring skills and yeah i hope this conversation was beneficial to you and i will see you next time thank you thank you awesome thank you my dear have a blessed day you",
