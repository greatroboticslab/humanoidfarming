  "text": "yeah thanks for the introduction and uh thanks to the organizers for inviting me it's really pleasure to be speaking here today um yeah i'll be talking about the hidden forces underground soil biodiversity for agricultural production and environmental integrity so i think we all know that there's organisms living in the soil and it's actually a huge variety of creatures living there and they're all doing things so they are eating organic matter they're feeding on plant material they're feeding on each other and they bury through the soil they poop in the soil they eat each other's poop so there's this whole complexity of things happening and together these actions um result in certain ecosystem functions um and these ecosystem functions can result in ecosystem services that we as humans also depend on so um soil organisms are important for organic meta decom composition for example they can improve soil structure and water infiltration they can store nutrients release nutrients improve plant nutrition provide pest control and so on however it's been increasingly increasingly shown in recent years that with increasing land use intensification a lot of these organisms are actually negatively affected so they get reduced in their diversity and abundance and can even go locally extinct in certain fields and now the big question is if we lose these organisms do we also lose these important functions that we depend on or if we phrase it more positively if we promote organisms and find ways to promote these organisms in soil can we actually improve our ecosystem functioning and get more sustainable cropping systems so to put this in a theoretical framework when we look at a natural ecosystem we we have usually relatively high plant diversity we have a rich and diverse soil life and we have very efficient internal resource recycling processes that keep this system [Music] alive over long time spans so it's a very sustainable system but it's not very productive in agricultural terms when we compare this to an intensive agricultural system we often have a huge amount of external resource inputs you have crop monocultures and soil life is not doing so well so we have less well developed internal resource recycling processes and we also have much more losses of nutrients for example to the groundwater or as gases emissions into the atmosphere so these systems are very productive but they are not sustainable so ideally we want to combine aspects of both to create a sustainable system where we have less external inputs required we have an intermediate diversity on the field and we have a rich and abundant soil life so we have very well developed resource recycling processes and little losses to the environment so we have a productive and sustainable system but first of all we we have to answer the question how important are the soil organisms actually for ecosystem functioning and to find that out i performed an experiment a couple years back in so-called lysometers so lysometers are basically big pots um placed in the outside in free air and each lysometer can hold the sole volume of 230 liters um we filled these lysometers with sterilized soil and then added two different soil biological treatments one we call the enhanced soil life treatment containing soil organisms smaller four millimeters and the other one was the reduced soil life treatment that only contained organisms smaller 11 micrometers so basically microorganisms but nothing else these lysometers have a hole in the bottom where the water running through the soil profile can be collected and later analyzed for nutrients and we also performed gas measurements of nitrous oxide and n2 gas into the air to look at nutrient losses so we planted the mace crop in these lysometers and let them grow to maturity so they got big mace plants as you would find it in the field and when we look at the data so we see these dark bars the enhanced soil life treatment and the light gray bars is the reduced cell life treatment what we found was that with reduced soil life crop yields when we're significantly lower and we found a similar pattern for nitrogen uptake and for phosphorus uptake the effects were strongest so actually it was more than half the phosphorus uptake with reduced soil life looking at the nutrient losses we found the opposite pattern so with reduced soil life nitrogen leaching losses went up massively and the same was the case for nitrous oxide emissions and important greenhouse gas and also n2 another gas being emitted was massively increased so this study shows that soil organisms have a great potential to enhance the nutrient use efficiency and support crop growth in cropping systems but it is a model system and actually most knowledge we have about soil biodiversity and how it affects ecosystem functions is derived from such model systems that often use sterilized soil so we have to re-add organisms and yeah we actually do not know how well these results transfer to um the real world to an agricultural field so i was trying to get um yeah closer to that and get some some some answers in real world settings i did a postdoc in california at uc davis and there went to 30 different field sites differing in management intensity so i selected 10 grassland sites and 10 more sustainable tomato rotations that received cover crops over the winter and compost applications and then 10 intensive tomato rotations that only receive mineral fertilizers and synthetic pesticides and so on so i expected reduced abundance and diversity of soil organisms with increasing management intensity so i went to all these sites and we sampled and analyzed the soil communities and we also extracted soil cores from all these fields placed them in a greenhouse planted tomato crops there and [Music] yeah measured nutrient leaching losses and gas emissions and looked at crop yield also so when we look at the data for the soil communities you always see the grasslands on the left and the intensive systems on the right so we found that with increasing management intensity indeed most parameters for solar organisms showed a negative trend the more intensive the system was the less diverse and less abundant soil organisms there then we related this data to some ecosystem functions that we measured so here we see the relationship on the left with microbial biomass in the soil and tomato yield we found a significantly positive relationship so with more microbial biomass we had higher tomato yields similarly we found for the more nematodes we had in the soil we also found higher crop yields looking at nutrient leaching losses we found some relationship with the ratio of fungi to bacteria in the soil so the higher this ratio was the lower the nitrogen leaching losses there which is something that has also been shown before and hypothesized that a fungi dominated system has a more close sustainable nutrient cycling compared to a bacteria-dominated system so um yeah taken together this study could partly confirm what we found in a model system which was very nice and then i performed a different study focusing on a vascular mycorrhizal fungi or short amf we heard about mycorrhizal fungi before savarina was managed mentioning them and yeah these fungi form symbiotic relationships with the majority of land plants and including many major crops like may sweet potato tomato and so on and they are mostly known for improving plant growth and nutrition and there are also other benefits that have been shown to be provided by amf so the way this symbiosis works you see here microscopy picture of a plant root and the blue structures is the amf structure and actually enter the plant root even the plant root cells and develop there then they spread a network of fungal hyphae into the soil so here we see the plant fruit and then we see these fine root structures spreading out in the soil so basically they extend the root system and you see that they are much finer than the plant roots so they can enter soil pores that the plant cannot access and then they take up nutrients from the soil and give them to the plant the plant in turn performs photosynthesis and gives carbon back to the fungus so both partners benefit from this association so i i did a postdoc then at uc berkeley and there we looked at this mycorrhizal fungi in a long-term field trial the century experiment at russell ranch in davis where since more than 25 years different cropping systems are compared and we were interested in the communities of microwaval fungi in these systems and how they affect crop yield so we selected four management systems there and we planted two different tomato plants in these systems so one is a normal tomato plant called 76r that forms regular associations with mycorrhizal fungi and then we had this tomato mutant called rmc that has a mutation that prevents it from forming normal amf association so they only form yeah very reduced associations with amf so we planted them there and then we looked at tomato yields to basically find out um yeah how yield is affected if we remove the mycorrhizal association from the crop and we see here the data for the biomass on the left hand side under the crop yield dark bars are the normal tomato plants and the light gray bars are the mutant plants with reduced mycorrhizal colonization and we see some differences here depending on the cropping system but importantly we see that when we remove mycorrhital associations from the system we get up to a 30 percent decline in yields and also overall we found a positive correlation the more mycorrhizae we found in the plant roots the higher tomato yields where so i think this study also impressively shows that that soil organisms can really or really do support agricultural yields and matter so to sum up these studies we saw that sole organisms possess the great potential to increase crop yields and simultaneously reduce nutrient pollution to the environment and we could confirm um these results in field settings so soil life is a crucial factor for sustainable agriculture and substantially supports crop yields and supporting your soil life is good for the environment good for the plants and good for you if you're a farmer so you have more money in your pocket and need less fertilizer for example so this is all very nice but we have to get this information out to the public and we don't have much time because soils are threatened so we lose soils globally at an alarming rate um and there's like problems like soil compaction so salinization desertification and soil erosion through wind and water and also soil sealing through human activities that are major problems and also harm soil life and most people or the general public is maybe not really aware that soils harbor an entire below ground universe so actually one quarter of the global biodiversity is found in soils and one teaspoon of soil contains more living organisms than we are humans on this planet so there we got this idea we have to do something to spread the word about these facts and this is where the underpants come into play so we trying to make the soil life visible because it's very hard to see soil organisms we saw the presentation before so you need a microscope and then also you you yeah it's hard to see them but we try to make soil life visible by making underpants invisible because if you bury an underpant in the soil it's cotton it will be decomposed by solar organisms and over time disappears so we started um a citizen science project called bavais gunderhose in english it's a proof by underpants where we wanted to bury underpants together with the swiss population with the goal to raise the awareness about the importance of soils and also to perform some scientific assessments of soil biological activity and soil health across switzerland and also we want to develop recommendations for best management practices to support soil life and i have to mention that we did not invent this idea of burying underpants so this was actually a group of farmers in canada that started with this in 2015 and it has already been done in several parts of the world currently there's also project in hungary going on in australia yeah um so how did we do it we put together a soil lab kit diy soil lab kit so we provided standardized underpants to all the participants we also included tea bags to look at the teabag index which is a scientifically more established method to look at decomposition processes in soil and so we put these things in the package and shipped it to all participants and then they got instructions on how to bury the underpants then they take a soil sample which they ship back to our labs and they place the tea bags in the soil and each participant received two underpants so one will be retrieved after one month the other one after two months then we also together with this partner spotterron we've developed an app where people can enter management data and information about the field where they buried the underpants and can also upload pictures of the underpants and then they ship after the two months they ship the soil sample and the underpants back to us to microscope and we analyze them so we um aimed for 1000 participants and actually all the available spots filled up before we officially announced the project so there was really a huge interest um and we aimed for 50 farmers and 50 non-farmers being private gardeners or just regular people um we we told them they can bury the underpants wherever they want can be in the forest can be in some reuteral spaces in the city can be in their community garden in the rooftop garden or in agricultural fields and here you see a map from our webpage and everyone in each of these dots actually represents several spots where underpants are buried so you can zoom in and see all the details and look at pictures and look at site information on our web page which is available in three swiss national languages yeah then we had the goal to raise the awareness and we had an event for the media for the start of the project and actually it was overwhelming how well this was picked up so we were in the media globally with this project um in in ghana in india china the u.s and so on and um we also had several television features in swiss and german television and um importantly all these media releases talked about that soils are alive soils are important and souls are threatened and we have to take care of them so they really got our message across which made us very happy um we also put together a picture book about soil life called the jungle on soil but it's only available in german and french if we think about releasing an english version we'll see how that goes um yeah it's actually very entertaining and interesting can learn a lot there and it's available in bookstores in switzerland germany austria or you can also directly order it through us you can write me an email then you get also a special prize when you get it through us yeah and then there's still the scientific assessments to be made so the research questions we're trying to answer with this project are um how sole biological activity distributed across switzerland and is this biological activity linked to soil biodiversity soil quality crop yields and also how does management affect the soil biological activity and um yeah we also want to assess whether underpants can really serve as a meaningful and easy to use indicator for soil health that everyone can use in their backyard or wherever they want because this method has never been scientifically assessed so um yeah we really hope to get answers here how useful the underpants actually are so right now we're dealing with the samples we have almost 900 soil samples 1 600 underpants 10 000 tea bags we have a subset of soil samples where we look at soil microbial diversity 800 questionnaires with site information management data so we are really busy in the lab right now so the underpants they are photographed and then with imaging software we determine the amount of degradation of the underpants the tea bags are weighed and yeah we hope to be able to make recommendations for for best management practices in spring of this year what we can tell already or what we have already is data that the citizens actually entered in the app so they could assess how strongly the underpants were degraded so we see here the results of the one month so orange means the underpants are not very degraded green men means they're strongly degraded so what we see so far after one month months there's less degradation than after two months and we see that there are no large-scale spatial patterns so um yeah looking at the details will be interesting hopefully so there's more to come if you're interested you can subscribe to our newsletter on our webpage it's on the landing page you have to scroll to the bottom to find it or you follow us on facebook and instagram yeah and with this i'm at the end so um quickly acknowledge acknowledge people involved in this research plan soil interactions group at agroscope and my colleagues the project team of the underpants project people at uc davis and berkeley and i thank you for your attention i'm happy to take questions thank you very much um for your talk and now we also know what's how how it was all conducted regarding the pants and very um inspiring you want to say yeah maybe i'm start collecting some pants now from now on it's okay um i will start right away with the question of felix um he's asking how was the soil soil uh sterilized and how was uh ensured that it was sterile um we sterilize the soil with x-ray rear irradiation so there are these companies that provide a service mostly for medical equipment and yeah depending on the dose of the irradiation you can determine how how sterile the soil is because there is always some bacteria that can survive such processes um so we made sure that we did not have fungi in the soil anymore no mycorrhizal fungi and insects arthropods and so on there might have been still some bacteria have been sorry alive in the soil but um yeah but we um also saw in our control treatments that they were mostly free of mycorrhizae for example we had some contamination probably through the air because it was outside and for the greenhouse we often sterilize the soil with autoclaving thank you very much can you please stop sharing this screen yeah sure i mean i love the biodiversity of the of the pants but thank you um okay uh the next question will be by laying that um using two domain tomato varieties introduce more differences than equals minus amf only so how do you know the yield differences are amf based so these uh the this mutant is actually derived from this 76-hour wild type that we used so they are directly related and it should only be this one mutation that that causes differences in mycorrhizal colonization and this pair of wild-type and mutant has been used in in several studies already there have also been tests planting them in sterile soil to look at growth differences without mycorrhizae and they show fairly similar similar growth even in sterile soil thank you the next question by italia is how deep have you buried their panties and how do you account for the differences in land use because there is a huge difference in arable land and a heavily irrigated home garden yeah that's um so first first part of the question we buried the underpants vertically in the soil so that the the seam on the top looks out of the soil surface so it was yeah probably from 0 to 15 20 centimeters they were buried in the soil um and yeah of course there's a huge variation and that's why we also tried with this app and questionnaires to get as detailed information as possible about what's happening on these field sites is it irrigated or not how often is it irrigated which fertilizers do you use do you apply compost do you apply pesticides which crop is growing there and so on and with all this information we hope to really get meaningful answers thank you and how did you create the treatments with reduced and enhanced soil life and maybe the first part of the other question of italia um yeah so we we used um sievings basically so we sift the soil through four millimeters and then we had an additional step in the greenhouse so we put the sift soil into sterile soil in the greenhouse and planted some plants in there and let them grow for three months to yeah to let the soil organisms propagate in these pots and yeah and for the for the reduced soil of treatment we filtered the soil through 11 micrometer filters and also added this to steroid soil in the greenhouse so we had both treatments growing in the greenhouse in in sterile substrate and only a small part of of the two filtrates was added so we tried to really make sure that that yeah the difference are similar except for the different organisms present okay and another part of the question was where do you where do the microbes come from and how much did you apply um so we went to a agricultural field like a pasture [Music] here close to our research station from a farmer and yeah use just native soil organisms we found in that soil what was the second part of the question um this i have to i'm already um the second part but one moment um yeah how much did you apply uh yeah um yeah so we we produced this inoculum in the greenhouse and then i think we if i remember correctly it was about 10 of the soil volume in this lysometers was um was the inoculum from the greenhouse or maybe was five percent or so of the volume i'm not sure right now i would have to look it up thank you uh a little interruption um i want to remind everybody you don't have to do it now but all the participants uh you have to refresh the browser because otherwise we will drop out by five i mean maybe there will be maybe we will be finished by five but maybe it take a little bit longer we just that it's not like a really quick end so maybe you just refresh the browser when you have time within the next uh five minutes okay and um i would continue with the questions michaela she's asking is intensive cropping always combined with bad soil life or is intensive uh range from overuse like the degradation soils from us to special use cropping systems with crop rotation and cover crops um yeah i probably there's also intensively managed systems where soil life is doing well i think there's a lot of factors that play a role and it's always difficult to make these generalizations and we also saw on the data that there's a huge variability in the data so some dropping systems are doing better than than others um and i didn't don't remember the rest of the question yeah yeah is it um or is it in intensive range from overuse to special use cropping systems with crop rotation and cover crops that's like the second part of the of the question yeah uh so i think probably if i understand correctly if there's like a gradient of of um yeah soil soil health from from more sustainably to more intensively managed systems um which i would say yes so you you can't cannot really put them in categories so this is good this is bad or the soil life is going bad good here and bad there so it's it's really a gradient and it really depends on on lots of details that we also don't underst understand at this point i guess okay thank you uh she's asking who paid about sending back soil samples t-bags and pans participants or your organization yeah actually the university of zurich was kind enough to sponsor the shipment so we sent the packages already with a return shipment label they just have to have to put on the on the box and they could use the same box so we try to make it really easy for the participants to return the shipments another question by marianne which results would you think the license trials had shown if also slurry had been added um yeah that's a difficult question i don't i don't know i think i i would guess that in general they they would have probably gone in a similar direction but um yeah yeah i can't really say a lot about this okay and then what's the question about this how the soil was sterilized and how was it ensured that it was sterile yeah yeah but i answered this already right yeah yeah that that's the thing like because it was not um showed like that it was answered but it was already answered right yeah so um [Music] actually all questions in the chat are answered now so um the final question is you know it may be already what are the two uh main take-home messages or the or one two things you want to share with us before you or we leave the participants by five we try um yeah i think my main message is make taking care of your soil a priority it's really the basis of human existence and then also of the functioning of planet earth so we really have to take care of the soil and get away from only focusing on yields but really focusing on feeding the soil and keeping it healthy and alive so that we can rely on them also in 100 years from now okay thank you very much wow we are on time thank you france",
