31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,759
asked with different people

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,960

not only to people who want to invest in

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,640

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,600
also for other people who are living in

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,159
other areas

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,159
and they want to do agriculture mostly

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,200
in east africa and africa

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,840
you can use just these few techniques

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,479
they might help you in one or different

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,320
way so

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,320
let us go together and enjoy

48
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,880
first thing you need to consider is not

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,360
just the matter of starting farming

50
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,880
but you must choose a kind of farming

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,439
that you are capable of

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,879
and you are interested in what do i mean

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,520
saying this

54
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,480
people they are just entering to farm

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,000
just because

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,239
they are just told that when you do

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,480
farming you might get rich in order to

58
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,800
be

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,080
a successful farmer you just not you

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,280
should not just drag

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,520
into farming just this way you must have

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,520
an

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,959
interest and capability to start that

64
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,599
kind of farming

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,280
that is very important thing because

66
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,800
success or failure

67
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:39,040
starts from that point

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,360
second thing you which you need to

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,560
consider you must have knowledge

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,879
on what you want to farm people

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,239

in order to to know every step of maize

80

far you are

85

going as planned

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
but it's very important for you to have

94

to farming this will help this is

101
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,000
important in cost management

102
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,519
hope you got what i mean right another

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,439
important thing

104
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,840
is good fun management this starts from

105
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,400
the

106
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,159
person or expert you're using from the

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,400
equipment you're using

108
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,000
from the inputs you're using all of

109
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,519
these must be good

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,720
and must be done correctly so make sure

111
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,439
you invest much in good practice

112
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,359
because when the fan practice not good

113
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,959
you can just end up in getting losses

114
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,120
which are not necessary

115
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,160
for example when the farm is not clean

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,960
you can just

117
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,120
welcome some pests and diseases for

118
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,440
example when you don't put

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,960
all requirements for example seeds when

120
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,520
you're not practicing on time when you

121
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,840
not put

122
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,360
fertilizers on time when not cut wet on

123
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,919
time all of these will be

124
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,720
problems so you must have a good farming

125
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,400
practice

126
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,240
starting from the good expert you are

127
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,400
using so as to take care of your firm

128
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,520
last but not least you must plan your

129
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,840
market you must

130
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
know how you deliver your products to

131
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,199
the customer

132
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,600
you must know who you are your target

133
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,520
customers you must know how you will

134
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,639
do your business how you sell your

135
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,560
products

136
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,919
and much more because when you're not

137
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,560
planning you might

138
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,919
just you obtain a lot of years but you

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,520
don't know where to sell them

140
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,600
so you just end in selling them by

141
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,240
losses or buy cheap prices

142
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,720
or many of the products might be rotten

143
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,479
so

144
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,479
in order to be a successful farmer you

145
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,600
must do off of this but

146
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,199
also be good in planning your market

147
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,080
be good to know where you sell your

148
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,479
products and whatever

149
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,000
for today let's just end up hope you

150
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,680
