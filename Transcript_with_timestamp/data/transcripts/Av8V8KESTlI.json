  "text": "it's one week after planting now and i'm back at the field here lee has gone off to the beach i've just come back from the beach so for a few days nobody was watching the crop but it's now about the week after planting and it's the time to apply the first dose of fertilizer because we didn't apply a pre-plant application normally during the first one or two weeks or before planting you should apply a little bit of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium to help the crop establish so that's what i will do now and hopefully that will help then also with the further early stages then of course development and tillering so what i've done is just like i did last year so i used the fancy mobile phone application that we have developed over many many years here at erie nutrient manager for rise and the only difference is that this year we have a new version for the philippines version 2.2 so it has a few more refinements but what it does it walks you through a series of relatively simple questions about your field what you've done previously in the management how you manage your organic metal what you do with your crop residue what your source of irrigation water is what your variety is in all of these things that basically one way or another influence the nutrient input output budget of this particular field and so we come up with field specific fertilizer recommendation so i can do this directly here in the field on this smartphone or i can do it before that at home either on a smartphone or on a tablet computer or on a desktop computer that's actually what i've done so before i came here i ran through this and i came up with actually two fertilizer recommendations because if you may remember one half of the field this over there we planted with an inward variety and this half we planted with a hybrid so this is all normal and well-known principles of crop nutrition and rice that are reflected in this software and what i really like with it in particular is that it comes out with a very concrete prescription so it's printed out and i'm given the the window of when i should apply it pretty precisely and i'm also given a very clear recommendation of what to apply so my main challenge is now to apply it and also make sure that i apply it relatively uniformly so i have a bag of fertilizer here which is 14 14 14 14 nitrogen fourteen percent p205 fourteen percent k200 that's my if you wish startup fertilizer for this uh first application and basically since our recommendation is four bags per hectare and our field is about a quarter of a hectare it means i have to spread this one bag more or less uniformly over this field and what i will do is if i have a little bit left over i will put it on the hybrid strip not on the invert strip that's the only adjustment i will make other than that it should probably not take me more than maybe half an hour i hope what i learned last year is there are a couple of tricks to apply this one is that i've you know imagined to divide this strip into four strips each of them about six meters wide but the the trick is not to walk in the middle of each but a little bit to the side because that way you can throw better and then the other uh tip they gave me last year was that you have to really swing with your arm wide and keep walking and not sort of looking down and try to sprinkle it like powdered sugar you just go and throw yeah here is something i wanted to show you because it's always bothered me you know when you apply fertilizer in most traditional rice growing systems and you don't have a machine basically this is what you see so you have tiny little young rice plants here in this case because spaced quite wide because we use the mechanical transplanter and they're not really at a stage where they have a big root system that can capture much of the nutrient supply and then you throw this by hand broadcast and you see where most of the fertilizer ends up in this case on the surface in between so even if i had incorporated it would still be in between so i keep wondering wouldn't it be nice if on that planting machine that we had we would have been able to already apply some of the fertilizer at least disperse those right away closer to the road so that it can be captured by the plants and doesn't end up fertilizing the soil something has always been bothering me because i'm pretty sure that with this kind of system here our efficiency is not as good as it could be so hopefully in the future those machines can be improved for this purpose particularly even the small one they used you",
