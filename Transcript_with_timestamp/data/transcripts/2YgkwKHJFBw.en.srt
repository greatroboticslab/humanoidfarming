00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,921
So in the spring if you're thinking about
testing your soil in the garden you have a

2
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:12,080
couple of options.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,070
One is to collect a soil sample and send it
into the lab for analysis, and the second

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,110
is to buy one of these simple kits that allows
you to analyze your soil at home and get some

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,630
general recommendations for either adding
fertilizer or adjusting your soil pH.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,480
They are all based on adding soil and water
to a tube and then adding a reagent, and then

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,430
matching the color in the tube to the color
on a card.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,540
So they're a simple test and will give us
some general information about the status

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,620
of our soil.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,520
Once you've put the soil in and the reagent
and the water, and followed the instructions,

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,380
you will match the color to one of the color
cards.

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:51,250
So for the pH test you'll match it to the
pH card, phosphorous, nitrogen and potassium.

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,790
It's a pretty simple kit, it's putting the
reagents in the water and the soil into the

14
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,360
tube and matching the color.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,130
So these kits are all available generally
for under $30 at most garden stores or you

16
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,280
can order them online.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,170
There are also other kits available.

18
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,080
These results won't be as precise as sending
them into the lab for analysis, but for most

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,960
of us in the garden it will get us close enough
and it will help us determine how much fertilizer

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,759
we might need to add or if we need to adjust
our pH.

21
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:16,659
