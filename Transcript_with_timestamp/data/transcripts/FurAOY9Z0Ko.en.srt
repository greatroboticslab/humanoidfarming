00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:15,010
birch of cropping group and I coordinate

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:18,070
the GRDC funded southern pulse extension

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:20,410
project this project is delivered by a

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,960
consortium of researchers agronomist

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,760
farming systems groups growers and pulse

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,859
experts to increase the knowledge of

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,109
growers and advisers on sustainable

11
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:31,330
pulse production improving the southern

12
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:33,780
regions capacity to maximize future

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,520
growth and profitability opportunities

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,410
the purpose of today's webinar is to

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,840
give you an existing lentil growers a

16
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:43,059
snappier overview of what to consider

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,940
this season to best set you up for

18
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:48,520
success now before we start the

19
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,219
presentation just a couple of quick

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,289
housekeeping items in relation to using

21
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:55,809
the webinar software I've muted

22
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:57,370
everyone's microphones so please keep

23
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:59,680
yourself on mute so that there's no

24
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:03,190
background noise that might distract the

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,139
presenters and we will have a

26
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,509
question-and-answer session at the end

27
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:10,600
of today's session but please feel free

28
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:13,240
to submit questions at any time you can

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,759
do this by clicking on you should see a

30
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,649
speech bubble icon it should be at the

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,240
bottom of your screen but it might look

32
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:21,039
different depending on the device that

33
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,619
you're accessing this webinar on today

34
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:26,109
if you hit that a text box will appear

35
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:29,649
and you'll be able to type in a question

36
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:32,469
and from there you can either send that

37
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:34,990
through to myself if you want it to be

38
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:38,619
anonymous or you can send it to everyone

39
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:41,020
and it can be answered publicly now this

40
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:42,969
webinar is being recorded if you can't

41
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,279
stay for the entire thing or if you have

42
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:48,069
any technical issues or if you'd like to

43
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:50,380
share this and then the recordings will

44
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:53,049
be made available on the GRDC website

45
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,209
next week but you can also flick me an

46
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,529
e-mail or give me a call my contact

47
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:58,569
details will be at the end of the

48
00:01:56,529 --> 00:02:00,549
webinar and we can get you a copy of the

49
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:01,209
recording a little bit earlier if you

50
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:02,979
would like

51
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:05,679
now just to quickly help our presenters

52
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:08,439
I've got two quick questions that I'd

53
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:09,459
like to ask you to get a gauge on who's

54
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,330
joining us today

55
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:13,940
now hopefully you should

56
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,110
popping up on your screen some questions

57
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,450
that you should be able to click an

58
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,730
answer if you can't see them you get to

59
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,500
take a little break for now but it's

60
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,540
just two questions asking your

61
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,970
experience with lentil growing and where

62
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,680
you're dialing in from today so we'll

63
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:32,470
just give you a quick moment to have a

64
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,470
look at that and answer those questions

65
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:43,280
we've got some agronomist joining us

66
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:45,230
today and got some of the lower EP your

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,380
can did nor we've got a few from the

68
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,810
miscellaneous category we've got some

69
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:57,560
high rainfall zone growers from southern

70
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:59,450
bit core sa a few more agronomist and a

71
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,100
couple people who either can't see the

72
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:05,600
question or aren't wanting to

73
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:07,850
participate I'll give you a few more

74
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,110
moments and then what we'll do I'll just

75
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:13,120
share the screen and we can start

76
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,120
straight into our presentation for today

77
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:36,080
okay now I'm going to introduce you all

78
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,120
for our first presentation is dr. Jason

79
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,459
Brown - it was agriculture Victoria

80
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,410
you've baked in Horsham Jason heads up

81
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,480
the GRDC southern pulse karana me

82
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,330
program and has over 20 years experience

83
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:52,420
in the pulse industry over to you Jason

84
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:54,530
I'll just turn your microphone on and

85
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,100
Jason will provide us always in a grotto

86
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,100
my update

87
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:12,170
are you there Jason just having a little

88
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:27,590
bit of trouble with Jason's audio right

89
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:31,400
now are you there Jason alright what we

90
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,650
might do is we might skip forward while

91
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,510
we sort out Jason's audio issues we

92
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:40,400
might skip forward and go on to our next

93
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:42,789
presenter who is unless Jason unless

94
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,789
you're there now

95
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:56,070
no okay Jason will try and sort out your

96
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:58,850
audio and that meat we'll just make sure

97
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,530
that was your audio are you there

ah just let me quickly provoke through

100
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:10,830
your slides and we will just revise the

101
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,660
order ever so slightly and we'll come

102
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,160
back to Jason a little bit later

103
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,630
all right so dr. Navin eat over was is

104
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,490
drivers from siding today and his

105
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,650
research centers on improving weed

106
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,350
management in high intensity break crop

107
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,000
farming systems and today is going to

108
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,930
give us an update on controlling rye

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,210
grass and lentils nap net over to you

110
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:37,800
thank you so much Poole good morning

111
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:40,110
everyone good it can I just interrupt

112
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,360
for a moment you're very very quiet can

113
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,150
I ask you to speak very loudly and very

114
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,170
close to your microphone please

115
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:51,140
okay yeah good morning everyone today it

116
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,300
is my pleasure to share my research

117
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:57,030
experiences with you regarding rye grass

118
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,580
resistance and its management in hi

119
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,370
break crop intensity rotations including

120
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,760
lentils first of all I would like to

121
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:10,890
thank GRDC and sorry for jointly funding

122
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,800
this research work next like this next

123
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,680
slide please

124
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,070
my talk today will be focused on

125
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,070
previous like this

126
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:27,160
previous slightly is proof previous

127
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,160
previous

128
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:35,940
then the previous slide - yeah yeah

129
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,640
thank you today my talk will be focused

130
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,300
on where we are heading for controlling

131
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,200
ryegrass

132
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,700
in hi break crop intensity rotations and

133
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,980
secondly what are the potential options

134
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,220
for controlling rye grass in break crops

135
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,380
I will extend this information based on

136
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,990
my results from the results research

137
00:06:52,380 --> 00:07:00,200
trials on lentils next slide please

138
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,200
next slide please

139
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:07,500
as we all know that there has been a

140
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,080
significant increase in area under break

141
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,510
crops including canola and pulses in

142
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,800
South Australia in the last one and a

143
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:19,050
half decade as is shown in this graph

144
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,170
this has resulted from improved

145
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:25,200
agronomic practices higher our harvest

146
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:27,420
efficiency availability of new herbicide

147
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,920
tolerant varieties like TT canola

148
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:36,620
Clearfield canola and xt lentils and

149
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,620
higher pulse prices next slide please

150
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,710
in particular like the combination of xt

151
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,900
lentil varieties and its high market

152
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:49,130
price have become appealing to many

153
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,440
South Australian growers with a record

154
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:55,410
185 thousand Hector's area sown -

155
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:59,930
lentils in 2019 and which was almost

156
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:03,320
double than what was 5 years ago in 2012

157
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,320
next slide please

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,510
slide please this change in cropping

159
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,570
system has raised new industry

160
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:16,670
challenges for us heavy reliance on

161
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:19,790
Group A chemistry which includes

162
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:22,100
plethora in particular in Bray crops has

163
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:25,090
contributed to increase dry grass

164
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,680
resistance to these Group A herbicides

165
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,540
consequently herbicides with different

166
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,140
modes of actions which includes

167
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:36,140
herbicides from Group D J's and case are

168
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:39,710
used to manage dem resistant ryegrass in

169
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,539
break crops therefore there is a need

170
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:44,570
for careful management of these

171
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:46,970
alternate pre-emergent herbicides to

172
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:50,180
minimize selection for resistant build

173
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:53,360
up to any single mode of action in hi

174
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,720
break crop intensity rotations next

175
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,720
slide please

176
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,170
to have better understanding of

177
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,270
resistance in ryegrass in high break

178
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:09,230
rock presentations a focus paddock

179
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:11,930
survey was initiated in 2019 in that

180
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,030
survey a total of 45 paddocks were

181
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,730
selected across different regions of

182
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:19,880
South Australia and these selected

183
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,940
paddocks had either either at least two

191
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,950
and next slide please

192
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,480
this slide shows the results of

193
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,480
herbicide resistance screening from

194
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,420
these focus paddocks here blue bars

195
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,690
represent confirmed resistance and green

196
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,910
bars represent ryegrass populations with

197
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,190
developing resistance as this graph

198
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:08,210
shows rye grass was found to be

199
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:12,770
resistant to sulfonylureas and dense in

200
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:15,560
almost all the paddocks further high

201
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,660
level of resistance to inter VIX and try

202
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,930
flora Lane was also recorded in rye

203
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:24,530
grass populations but the key concern is

204
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:27,020
that a total of 46 percent of rye grass

205
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:30,440
populations were confirmed resistant and

206
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,570
another 21 public 21 percent populations

207
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,610
were developing resistant to plutonium

208
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:37,880
in these high break rock intensity

209
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:40,190
paddocks such resistance levels limits

210
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,330
the effectiveness of break crops as

211
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:46,690
useful rotational tools in our systems

212
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,690
next slide please

213
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:53,120
further this graph shows that one

214
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:56,900
quarter of the rye grass populations

215
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,240
were resistant to boxer gold and one

216
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,220
third populations were found to have

217
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,380
started developing resistant to another

218
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,620
important herbicide Sakura in these

219
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:09,680
systems the only positive outcome was

220
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,250
that all the ryegrass populations were

221
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,339
sensitive to

222
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,339
Group D prappas amide next slide please

223
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:24,290
so when I look back into the history of

224
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,990
herbicides usage in those paddocks the

225
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:30,829
ranked first paddock in resistance to

226
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:33,440
group J&K herbicides had two times boxer

227
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:36,620
gold and three times sakura used in the

228
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,829
last five years and the second rank

229
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,829
paddock insistance had three times boxer

230
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:45,890
gold and one time sakura is used in last

231
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:49,040
three years itself so this is the scale

232
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:51,050
of those group and j herbicides being

233
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,430
used in those high intensity play crop

234
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:57,680
systems which is really concerning in

235
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:00,350
the net shell i would say that the

236
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,630
concerns for i grass control have now

237
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,390
not limited to group a and group b

238
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:07,940
herbicides in break crops distance

239
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:10,630
development in rye grass to boxer gold

240
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,709
and sakura is even more concerning for

241
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,260
sustaining these pre-emergent

242
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:20,149
chemistry's in our high break crop

243
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:22,480
intensity systems including lentils next

244
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:22,480
slide please

245
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,950
next please sorry

246
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:34,320
now I would like to discuss results from

247
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,540
research trials conducting during last

248
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,520
two years for ryegrass management in

249
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,520
lentils next like this

250
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,180
next slide please

251
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:54,360
in 2017 to research previous light these

252
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,360
previous

253
00:12:54,590 --> 00:13:01,760
yeah in 2017 to research trials were

254
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:04,210
conducted at heart in Mid North and

255
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,180
Maitland in short Peninsula

256
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:10,640
investigating potential new herbicide

257
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:13,880
ultra with active ingredient kharbut

258
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,820
amide and this service ID is a dimer

259
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:20,270
product and belongs to new group ii and

260
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:24,130
is currently in development so the

261
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:28,610
result shows that all true provided

262
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:31,100
similar level of ryegrass control as

263
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:34,600
achieved with pro pisa might Sakura and

264
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,880
boxer gold and further ultra provided

265
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:42,339
98% reduction in high grass seed set

266
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:45,320
over unweeded control at both asides

267
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:46,460
further I would like to mention that in

268
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,670
both our trials

269
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:55,060
I had P be a hurricane xt lentil variety

270
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:55,060
at both the locations next slide please

271
00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:03,949
similarly in 2018 at heart ultra proved

272
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:07,970
as effective as propose amides for

273
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:10,300
controlling ryegrass in lentils next

274
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,300
slide please

275
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:21,040
next slide please yes this is a very

276
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:25,330
interesting slide in the second research

277
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,610
trial at Maitland in 2018 ultra proved

278
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,940
to be the best herbicide for I grass

279
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,940
control followed by propecia amide

280
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,020
however box of gold and Sakura did not

281
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,020
control ryegrass

282
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,959
effectively and were not different to

283
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,360
unweeded control for rye grease rye

284
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:48,279
grass seed set as shown in this graph

285
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:51,130
see this trial side paddock was the

286
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:54,910
second-worst paddock for resistance to

287
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:58,720
group J&K herbicides in my focus paddock

288
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:01,510
survey discussed earlier so this

289
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,149
illustrates that the magnitude of impact

290
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:06,490
can result from the loss of these

291
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:09,370
important herbicides box of old and

292
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:15,209
sakura in lentils due to resistance

293
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:15,209
buildup in rye grass next slide please

294
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:26,660
so Al and I would like to conclude that

295
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:29,750
it is confirmed that resistance to the

296
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,940
in addition to distance in history

297
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,250
herbicides rye grass has started

298
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:37,190
whelping resistance to group J&K

299
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:41,600
herbicides in high breaker of intensity

300
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:44,750
systems and expected registration of all

301
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,540
through in 2020 will make it an

302
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:50,390
important tool along with group deep

303
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:55,100
rope is amide for controlling regressing

304
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:58,220
break off phase especially lentils and

305
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:04,220
we need to make it sure that rotating

306
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:06,200
mode of actions which we use in high

307
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,390
context to break crop rotations we need

308
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,540
to rotate those herbicides to delay the

309
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:13,760
herbicide resistance build-up and

310
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,220
especially we need to use group D

311
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,600
professor MIDEM break prophase and save

312
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:22,850
group J and case for cereal crop phase

313
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,339
at the end I would like to thank all the

314
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:29,300
participants for listening to my

315
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:31,460
presentation thank you so much thank you

316
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,140
very much nav nation my apologies for my

317
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,330
poor driving at the beginning of your

318
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,190
presentation there it was a bit crazy in

319
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,200
the control room with some audio issues

320
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,880
and my phone and other bits and pieces

321
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,339
so thank you for putting up with that

322
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,580
there now Jason we're going to try for

323
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:49,520
you again can we hear you this time

324
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:51,100
Tunisia it is Sun yes we can go from

325
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,780
that fantastic

326
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,380
sorry now that and I've got me no idea

327
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,440
why

328
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,450
close it dump it outside Jim a what I'll

329
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,360
take full responsibility for it and say

330
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,600
it was my fault Jackson no I wouldn't do

331
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,470
that

332
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,900
that's right all right straight Oh what

333
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:13,679
about them I've done wrong

334
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:16,500
okay great anyway okay

335
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,850
we take such other steps back and just

336
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,510
look at a bit of an overview of the

337
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,579
season

338
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,919
the other thing slide when we get there

339
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,299
we're going to just show you a bit of an

340
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,120
overview of some of the trial work that

341
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:30,000
we were running up by in Manali so the

342
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,590
12 side up at Olien last year we'll go

343
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,070
back to the openings like this a nice

344
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:38,610
one to the highlights the other one

345
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:41,630
before that through we're jumping too

346
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:45,510
fast you still with us

347
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:51,080
yep see come back okay we'll start here

348
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:51,080
and okay we keep jumping

349
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:55,860
well am i the first slide we're just

350
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,600
talking about is we're going to trial

351
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,309
them and there's a particular interest

352
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,010
obviously as we move up into the Mallee

353
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:04,200
to see how we can better produce lentils

354
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:07,500
across sandy soils and the image on that

355
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,080
original first slide was just looking at

356
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,820
an overview of the site and then some

357
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,260
child we're running on ten fuels where

358
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,059
we're looking at a whole range of

359
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,820
options from herbicides through to

360
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:20,010
nutrition and even potentially

361
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,970
amendments working with Michael Moody up

362
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:26,640
there at am and that plot you can see in

363
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,529
the foreground here is actually one of

364
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,570
the new potential lines being tested and

365
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:32,490
really highlights where lentils have

366
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:36,990
gone to an accent and ability to have

367
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:40,250
and that ability to grow in malli type

368
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,250
conditions next slide please

369
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,880
so interview 2018 I probably can be

370
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:50,700
summarized in a couple of words as dry

371
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,279
and frost for us certainly in Victoria

372
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,200
but I cropped a lot of a lot of southern

373
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,740
Australia there were some good patches

374
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,230
obviously but pretty much a summary here

375
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,820
Victoria was dry and frost so the photos

376
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,890
on the left-hand side they're actually

377
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,500
from the wind rap and some high value

378
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:10,409
ground down in the Weaver and that is

379
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,899
what our lentils look like and reflect

380
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:15,779
on the yields in just a moment and then

381
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:18,299
over on the right hand side of the slide

382
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,470
we're just highlighting some of the

383
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,149
frost issues then I've got some

384
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,039
chickpeas in the photo there but time

385
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:25,440
obviously the price down instead of the

386
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,750
lentils down bottom there and you know

387
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,909
this is from a third alien and you know

388
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,250
we were dealing with 80 90 percent frost

389
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:34,380
damage in many of the trials one of the

390
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,419
key that came out of this prosper that

391
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,720
was really really interesting in that

392
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:42,390
photo there you can see two lines and on

393
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,490
the left there you can see a line with

394
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,649
that real yellow and you get from the

395
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:49,440
vegetative cross damage similar to what

396
00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:52,320
we've seen in PD a hurricane many times

397
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,240
over the last few years and there were

398
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,000
some questions going around in industry

399
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,169
is that related to the anytime straits a

400
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,139
particular transformation event that is

401
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:05,220
being utilized to provide us with any

402
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:06,780
tyrants

403
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,640
well the two lines you've got there

404
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,309
photos have any tolerance in them as you

405
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,200
can see on the right hand side the line

406
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:15,630
that we've got there is showing pretty

407
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,100
much no vegetative damage from frost I'm

408
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,289
not sure the actual impact the

409
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,900
vegetative frost is is actually huge on

410
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:24,120
yield but certainly looks a lot better

411
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,400
at least many plants remain green after

412
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:30,570
a frost event during the vegetative

413
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:34,190
phase so despite that yodels a huge

414
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,190
amount of frost damage next slide please

415
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:40,260
so just a quick snapshot of the season

416
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,930
lower yields generally across the board

417
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,720
for us so to give you an idea

418
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:49,860
Victorine yields alien and courier in

419
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:53,280
that point 1.2 up 2.5 range and Horsham

420
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:57,380
went to a 26 so nothing really exciting

421
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,000
to speak of low lower prices obviously

422
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:03,870
everyone knows what their prices give

423
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,510
jump up a bit through December and

424
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:10,020
January and so there were the occasional

425
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:11,940
good catch on prices but certainly the

426
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,710
overall trend was on the lower end of

427
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,880
lentil prices which generally follow the

428
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:20,280
long term average for prices low disease

429
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,600
pressure throughout the industry and

430
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,790
something we've always got to maintain

431
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,410
and watch but generally the especially

432
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,970
but also girls doing a great job in

433
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:30,450
terms of managing at this point of time

434
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:34,230
and obviously due to the frost events

435
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:36,270
poorer grain quality although again it's

436
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,160
amazing how well things got cleaned up

437
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:41,340
with seat cleaners and also in the

438
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,070
harvesting operations so even if you see

439
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,840
a sample like we've got there which I

440
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,490
think we estimated to be about 50

441
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,080
percent across now means we're able to

442
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,360
bring that back to about a five or ten

443
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:55,710
percent frost damage just through and

444
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,480
simple cleaning equipment so so yeah and

445
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,580
what's really great by the industry to

446
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,030
clean up or you have let's move on to

447
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,030
the next slide

448
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:12,210
so I decided to highlight this and just

449
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,130
to remind ourselves of what the value of

450
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,410
some of these crops are over longer-term

451
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:19,050
and this is just based on our malli site

452
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,970
so it doesn't include the Wimmer and so

453
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:24,240
the lentil numbers would be much higher

454
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:27,840
again if we looked at land tools in the

455
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,370
Wimmer long term so it's just a reminder

456
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,190
that obviously there's a huge variation

457
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:35,040
from year to year based on price and you

458
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:38,880
and so the figures you see here are

459
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:41,180
based on the prices received in December

460
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,950
January of the year of crops grown and

461
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:45,630
based on the average view of that site

462
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,520
not based on the highest yielding

463
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,580
variety but on the average yield of that

464
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,270
site in that particular year and Theriot

465
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:56,520
is a low rental or medium low medium

466
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:59,970
rental center and owns a bit lower than

467
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,500
Korea and so obviously highlighting the

468
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,560
variation we'll go over the years then

469
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,030
and last year was the only negative year

470
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,360
we've really had in terms of gross

471
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:11,820
margin on lentils in that time period

472
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,450
we've been up there so just a reminder

473
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,520
that if we just click on to the next

474
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,260
flick and if you look at the long term

475
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,630
averages there so lentils and chickpeas

476
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:25,050
stack up rather well in terms of the

477
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,760
economics because sometimes yeah we tend

478
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:29,580
to just remember the last couple years

479
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,800
and or remember some of the issues that

480
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,440
we might have had in just even just in

481
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:37,350
last year and forget about the longer

482
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,810
term story and how well we've done out

483
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:42,620
of these pulses in the longer term move

484
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,620
on to the next one please

485
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:52,900
today in terms of new varieties we have

486
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:56,650
PD a hallmark this will be a really good

487
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:58,540
replacement for PD a hurricane fits into

488
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:01,059
that medium seed size category has a

489
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,010
same tolerance to group their size but

490
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:05,590
with improved vigor and botrytis grade

491
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,690
mold resistance so certainly has a good

492
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:10,480
fit there and some improvements in terms

493
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,910
of tolerance to soil types so may even

494
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,800
provide additional benefits in some of

495
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:17,530
the malleus all sites will run into

496
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,220
Quarren assault issues and overall

497
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:23,920
higher yields so higher than hurricane

498
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:26,380
less than jumbo two but certainly a

499
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,230
great replacement in terms of the any

500
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,450
tolerance coming through and the photo

501
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:33,160
down here so that's not meant to say PDA

502
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:36,400
debo to the top there that's just an any

503
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,690
herbicide applied across those two two

504
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,670
plots and obviously you can see the

505
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,750
damage here in jumbo two compared to the

506
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:44,920
hallmark in a season light last year

507
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:46,660
just highlighting the differences that

508
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,679
we're going to have so let's move on to

509
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:52,900
the next slide so if you right

510
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:54,309
opportunities I just wanted to bring

511
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,929
this one forward because it's actually

512
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:57,190
highlights hallmark as well so if you

513
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:59,650
look towards the left hand side of the

514
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:02,800
graph there this is some longer term

515
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:04,750
Mally granules across Ian and curry a

516
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,040
further two thousand and sixteen to

517
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,510
eighteen Joe encompasses a wet year a

518
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:13,929
drought and something somewhere in

519
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:16,450
between so quite a variation there and

520
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:18,220
you can sort of see where how much sits

521
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:21,100
out in terms of the percentage of the

522
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,960
site mean doing really well compared to

523
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,340
other varieties and also highlights the

524
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,080
opportunities that there are with

525
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,929
breeding lines coming through with that

526
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:33,210
CPR 16:04 coming out at the top of the

527
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:33,210
chart there with a next slide please

528
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,880
so moving up to 2019 considerations and

529
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,880
obviously we're going to highlight

530
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,780
disease because if it does rain we're

531
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,360
going to get it again

532
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:49,730
so if we start over on the right hand

533
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,260
side we try to frame old obviously

534
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,060
varieties fletching can come in pretty

535
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,830
important there so you can get some

536
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,830
quite big differences between the

537
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,660
variety of jumbo two which has got full

538
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:02,150
resistance to try to screen off as

539
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,610
compared to a bolt but that doesn't mean

540
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,620
the disease can't be controlled so

541
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:10,250
there's some really good strategies out

542
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:13,640
there now utilizing carbon ISM and other

543
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:15,550
products to control botrytis grain order

544
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,840
and happy to chat about that later on

545
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:20,800
obviously a spectator blight but again

546
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,970
most of our varieties these days have a

547
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,980
reasonable level of a skew quite a blow

548
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,960
the key thing that we want to message

549
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,870
our industry there is to keep an eye on

550
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,450
what's going on so have a look at the

551
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,400
varieties out there and if it is a

552
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,200
resistant or a moderately resistant

553
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,210
variety and you're seeing too much s

554
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,810
excited by the net make sure it's being

555
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:43,700
reported back to the state body so here

556
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:45,260
in Victoria obviously with us in

557
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,300
agriculture Victoria and Josh Manning

558
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:50,480
and then in South Australia through

559
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:53,210
Jenny Johnson and her team there at SIA

560
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,680
T so it's about watching what's

561
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,390
happening with that's toccata blight

562
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,520
because we are seeing some changes

563
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:01,550
obviously with the varieties out there

564
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,230
and I just wanted to touch on we do

565
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:06,680
occasional accessibility Nia and those

566
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:08,890
high disease high diseases next slide

567
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,890
please

568
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,630
you

569
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:20,370
so here side damage in some regions this

570
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:23,040
will be more relevant than others so if

571
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:25,140
we've had a dry summer six a summer you

572
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,450
carryovers from a group like RIT B type

573
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,990
chemistry particularly Group B if you're

574
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:34,070
not growing any time for lentils like

575
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:37,190
hallmark or hurricane group I've

576
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:39,390
certainly seen that many times

577
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,770
particularly in the Malley environment I

578
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,480
remember going through some of those

579
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,880
drought years with two and three years

580
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,180
afterwards we were seeing group I

581
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,260
residue damage in lentils so I know many

582
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,450
people are well aware of these issues

583
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:54,240
but it's worthwhile reminding myself and

584
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:56,850
looking back in the paddock history you

585
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,210
know and even up in trial where we came

586
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:01,500
unstuck last year in a paddock where

587
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:05,610
we've been told that group eyes weren't

588
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:08,040
a major issue but then when all the

589
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,750
records came out we found out that they

590
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,450
were a bit more of a major issue and

591
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,850
certainly a limiting factor for us even

592
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:17,910
the winter last year and then obviously

593
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:21,470
group C damage particularly around the

594
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:24,210
post on pre immersion or IBS application

595
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:26,400
it's an ongoing issue at Landstuhl so

596
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:29,250
it's all of our sowing depth placement

597
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,770
all those sub issues at the moment

598
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:34,200
obviously we don't have significant

599
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:37,160
levels of torrents to group C chemistry

600
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,160
next slide please

601
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:46,040
the other thing I haven't touched on in

602
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:48,140
terms of 2019 considerations obviously

603
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,830
is price and just being aware of the

604
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:55,820
price Janene like other kind on that in

605
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:58,190
as part of her presentation coming up so

606
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,530
like all pulses have selection and

607
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,650
management are absolutely critical to

608
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:06,290
growing successful lentils where

609
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:08,810
possible growing them into a paddock

610
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:12,560
where there is retained stubble they do

611
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:15,260
benefit from retain residue and in

612
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,030
particular standing residue improving

613
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,580
harvest ability but also improving

614
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:22,250
yields we've got data going back several

615
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:24,500
years which indicate you know growing

616
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:27,710
into stable versus burns double can

617
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:30,590
potentially result in yields increased

618
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:32,810
by 20% or more particularly mentals and

619
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:35,090
that's not including hub stability

620
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:37,580
benefits you get from standing residue

621
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,870
so paddock selection is critical knowing

622
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,700
your background history in terms of

623
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:45,140
herbicides and then yes I'll fight

624
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:48,050
understanding of cell types and she

625
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,970
walked varieties my village site so that

626
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:52,070
leave naturally on into variety choice

627
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:55,550
and what you're trying to achieve so

628
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:57,560
obviously is very Fiorini chemistry has

629
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:59,510
been in the background that paddock it's

630
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:02,570
probably going to be the good offices is

631
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:04,190
stick to your group feet of tolerant

632
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:08,690
lentils or eating entire mentors like

633
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:10,640
year hallmarks and hurricanes and but

634
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:13,430
obviously getting into some of the more

635
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,160
high disease risk areas jumbo to its

636
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:17,780
strongly into that and but then if

637
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,340
you're confident in terms of controlling

638
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,470
disease now it's a lower risk

639
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:24,650
pba both has a strong feed some of the

640
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:26,480
more mixed soil types and a type of fit

641
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,580
in certain regions we've certainly

642
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,910
system benefits on some of the acid

643
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,590
soils so yeah there are it's worthwhile

644
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,750
thinking through variety choice very

645
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:39,950
carefully before you jump into growing

646
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:41,630
lentils obviously starting out of season

647
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:43,910
how do disease strategies in place

648
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:45,760
before season really important to make

649
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,200
sure that those fungicides are locked in

650
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,060
before we start season you've got a

651
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,160
product on hand the last thing we want

652
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,780
is to get canopy closure you

653
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,420
wanting to put out a spray of control

654
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,640
try to spray mold and you can't get

655
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,040
product because you know there's no

656
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,440
supply in Australia we haven't run into

657
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,600
those issues in the past so just keep

658
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,650
that in mind

659
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,620
obviously pre-emergent herbicides have

660
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:12,410
touched on previously setting rates the

661
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,150
longer-term lesson there is that with

662
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,580
some of these newer varieties like a

663
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:18,890
jumbo two is another more bulky more

664
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,140
vigorous we can get away with slightly

665
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:23,570
lower setting rates particularly on the

666
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:26,510
wide array spacing so when we're out of

667
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,980
12 and 16 inch row spacings but a lot of

668
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:31,250
guys actually are operating on in

669
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:33,680
Victoria now dropping back to in that 80

670
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,960
to 100 plants per square meter

671
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,880
certainly we haven't seen too many your

672
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,230
losses it's when you get below 80 parts

673
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,330
you start to see a bit more of a

674
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:46,820
drop-off in terms of AM yields and

675
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:48,440
inoculants and nutrition so look we know

676
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,820
a lot of girls don't always inoculate

677
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,740
but if we're going to grow lentils in a

678
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,530
new area where we haven't grown them

679
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,360
before on sandy soils or even started to

680
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:58,460
push on some of the more marginal acidic

681
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,940
soils then these things are absolutely

682
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:05,060
critical and nutrition goes along solid

683
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:07,880
with that ultimately working on-site a

684
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,970
good agronomist is essential for a

685
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,790
lentil crop so I'd really encourage

686
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:16,100
growers to the yeah getting in touch

687
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:18,890
with their local agronomist and working

688
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,660
closely with them and learning what

689
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:23,020
works in their regions because it's very

690
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:26,540
hard to sort of sit here and talk

691
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:29,780
broadly we can give you the broad ideas

692
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:32,750
but there are tweaks for each region and

693
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,970
that's where the agronomist come in and

694
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,410
then I'm always open for a phone call I

695
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:39,030
love learning about other parts of the

696
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:43,710
industry so well

697
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:46,380
that will make me you're not true sex is

698
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:49,909
very appreciated now we'll move on to

699
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:53,850
our very last presenter for today and

700
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:56,070
next we have Janine's a mess Janine is

701
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:58,500
the commercial manager at PVCC near

702
00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:00,240
Horsham and PDC specializes in the

703
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,610
production of seed and grain processing

704
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,320
and packaging through to marketing sea

705
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:05,130
and grain both domestically and

706
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,890
internationally

707
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:10,590
Janina I'll turn your microphone on also

708
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:13,890
I think I'm experiencing a significant

709
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:15,690
lag between that between me hitting the

710
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:17,880
next site slide button the next

711
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,530
appearing on the screen so just give me

712
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,440
a couple of seconds for the next slide

713
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:29,270
to pop up and hopefully should all work

714
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:33,720
are you there to me yes it's my music

715
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:40,980
hello you're mister guy good to go

716
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:44,549
hello crew okay I'll just there we go

717
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:46,679
all right good morning everyone just

718
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:49,169
before I start I just might follow on a

719
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,919
little bit from Jason having mentioned

720
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:55,850
about the new hallmark XT lentil just a

721
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,679
bit of a quick update on seed supply

722
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:01,710
there was we had significant seed crops

723
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,600
across New South Wales Maui Wimmer and

724
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:05,159
in South Australia as well adults here

725
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,679
was bit of a challenging year for seed

726
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:10,500
production but overall we reason with

727
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,310
frost at the end reasonably happy have a

728
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:16,950
good supply to suit everybody's needs

729
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:19,589
but it was we're just managing a bit of

730
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:22,169
juggle with a number of stores that do

731
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:23,760
cover orders and just confirming final

732
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:25,830
quantities so we thought we were sold

733
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,310
out in January but then we were right in

734
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:31,619
February and perhaps we're down to about

735
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:33,119
five ten percent of supply left so if

736
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:34,950
there's anyone who's still interested in

737
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,830
that particular variety of there's

738
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:39,929
potentially a little bit of seed left

739
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:42,389
they look main Lots just to do orders

740
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:44,550
fairly soon as we're working through the

741
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:45,540
lists and dispatching the moment so I

742
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:50,399
just thought I'd give you a quick update

743
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:52,710
on that one to the minute and yes I will

744
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,779
move forward into

745
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,879
talking about where the markets at and

746
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:59,880
just a bit of a background I just touch

747
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:02,190
a bit more as Jason's mentioned our

748
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:06,029
current situation in Australia with our

749
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:09,210
lentil production supply if you look put

750
00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:11,339
on the slide there there's a graph of

751
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:13,640
the last couple of decades of how the

752
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:16,440
Australian lentil area has grown

753
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:19,260
particularly in the last say five years

754
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,960
with the introduction of the new PV a

755
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:25,799
lentil varieties which has enabled

756
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,619
expansion into a range of areas and high

757
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:32,910
prices certainly drove the uptake of

758
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:36,180
lentils from the sort of 2014-15 familiy

759
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:38,880
to double the area in 2017 with the high

760
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,579
prices got everyone excited we've

761
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,710
certainly dropped back a bit this year

762
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:45,390
to two hundred and sixty five thousand

763
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,279
hectares there's still the third largest

764
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,750
area for Australia so we still got a

765
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:53,359
significant area of growing to lentils

766
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:55,880
an important crop in our region that

767
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:59,339
certainly the production will be down

768
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,490
going to market this year with generally

769
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:04,470
low yields so I'm not just sort of put

770
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,390
perhaps an estimate of 1.2 tonne per

771
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:10,049
hectare overall I'm looking at a bit

772
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:12,450
over 300,000 tonne potentially supply

773
00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:15,539
sort of various guesses around that so

774
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:17,069
that's sort of a rough idea and it's

775
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:18,960
always been hard to know exactly what's

776
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:21,630
on farm in terms of old season tonnes

777
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,130
but certainly a crop the people store

778
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,609
for good reason when the prices are low

779
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:29,099
so there's any guest emits about what

780
00:36:26,609 --> 00:36:30,990
might be there but even if I mean it's

781
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:33,859
probably immaterial until people sell it

782
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:37,589
as to how important that quantity is

783
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:38,970
when they're prepared to sell it ok so

784
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:43,300
next slide please

785
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:45,070
proof so

786
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:48,760
looking ahead to I guess the world

787
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:52,080
situation when certainly is strong into

788
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,760
strong effects on pricing and demand

789
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,670
we're seeing in I mean Canada's are big

790
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,890
competitor with red lentils producing

791
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:03,130
very large quantities and having a big

792
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:05,260
impact on the market and they've

793
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:07,000
actually had fairly strong exports over

794
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,340
their winter period because if they've

795
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,820
got from the previous few years I've

796
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,570
certainly stored a lot have a lot of

797
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,090
stockpile

798
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:18,580
so same sort situation they're produced

799
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:20,500
a lot people their productions gone up

800
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,480
as prices went up a few years ago and

801
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,250
they've got a bit of surplus to move and

802
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:29,050
they've certainly been actually moving a

803
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:31,480
bit over their winter months and into

804
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:33,520
the market the US has been seeing a bit

805
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,250
slower a little bit been a bit slower

806
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,170
people not prepared to sell and our the

807
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,720
percentage of exports going out of

808
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:43,120
lentils from Australia has been a lower

809
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,160
percentage then perhaps we would we've

810
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,220
seen in the past from the sort of

811
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:51,970
October to January period whether we're

812
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:54,310
down at about just a small percentage

813
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,930
whether it's 20 percent or depending

814
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,580
what the total volume is at the end

815
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:00,280
whereas sometimes at this time of year

816
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:02,490
where anywhere between 30 40 plus

817
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,270
percent of exports have happened so

818
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:10,840
obviously people don't want to sell that

819
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:18,760
fair enough so little move on to the

820
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:21,370
next slide please print is so without is

821
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,630
a low prices of harvest we didn't know

822
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:26,140
where that was going to go but there was

823
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:28,480
some upward movement and coming into

824
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,370
January and it was interesting just

825
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,440
talking to growers that were you know

826
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:34,270
finding out the prices we're at and when

827
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,700
they're at 500 that I know won't sell

828
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,500
maybe wait till 600 I might sell but

829
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,620
when they got to 600 grows it on all

830
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:44,860
wait close to 700 but never did' so drop

831
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:46,780
back down just yet the market is what

832
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,870
the market is it wasn't prepared to make

833
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:53,530
that folk sort of process and so girls

834
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:57,850
prefer happy to store for a while in

835
00:38:53,530 --> 00:39:01,480
those in those periods we saw that

836
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:04,750
the jumbo type was often sitting at a

837
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:07,690
premium 20 40 dollars or so above the

838
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:11,740
medium-sized lentil just the variety

839
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:15,190
that was selling and was required and

840
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:17,860
then again there was another proof that

841
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:20,200
the small lentils were at a discount to

842
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:22,810
that down on that as well though I was

843
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,900
sort of maybe 80 hundred dollars off the

844
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:29,050
jumbo type in terms of what was being

845
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:32,650
offered at the time over the past two

846
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:36,550
months so we certainly have a lot of

847
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:38,200
product stored some moved markets just

848
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:41,590
very slow there's not really much

849
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,120
happening there is I guess anything that

850
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,760
is happening whether it's were we've had

851
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:48,430
had we have had frost events causing

852
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,210
some you know high damage as Jason

853
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:54,400
mentioned in some areas of you know

854
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:58,180
maybe up to 30 percent effective with

855
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,760
frosted so very poor quality lentils and

856
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,980
I guess I mean there's some currently

857
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:07,090
selling for stocks that maybe around 420

858
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:09,490
mark has been up to 450 per turn but

859
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:11,080
this is really it's not a typical

860
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,910
situation we will get these sort of

861
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:15,400
prices the top feed lentils often it's a

862
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,740
bit lower in other years but because

863
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,480
we've been underpinned by this higher

864
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,700
stock feed market I mean really we've

865
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,770
got cereals being sold for about 400 or

866
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,410
so the stock foods as well so that

867
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:29,260
they're pretty pretty I guess it worked

868
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:31,540
in fairly well those sort of quality

869
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,890
lentils that aren't normally going to

870
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,880
export that they've been able to have a

871
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:39,360
market to go to okay next slide please

872
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,360
proof

873
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:45,560
so just thinking about you know if

874
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,360
you're storing illegally we've got new

875
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:50,450
season lentils old season lentils

876
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,450
sitting from previous year or years just

877
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:55,370
be thinking about they're going to be

878
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:58,520
preps in quality storage silo storage

879
00:40:55,370 --> 00:41:01,130
keep them in good condition if there's

880
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,290
some product in silo bags that's that's

881
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:05,390
not much of a long-term option whether

882
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:07,490
they can keep the quality right or not

883
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:11,570
I'm just going to think about those

884
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:12,800
considerations and when we're going with

885
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,480
if we're not sure when going to the

886
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,770
market we never know don't have a

887
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,980
crystal ball to sample the market is

888
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:21,560
going to do and think about when we do

889
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:25,870
market it we've got the the lentils do

890
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:29,090
slowly start to turn color over time

891
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:32,420
which is they're just a visual indicator

892
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:34,280
to the market that well what how does

893
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,800
what are the quality of lentils going to

894
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,620
be so visually you know you're fresh

895
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,190
season off the header it looks really a

896
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:46,550
nice clean bright lighter brown color

897
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:48,320
and after about six months they start

898
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:50,590
they just start to turn a little bit

899
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:53,180
sort of that six to twelve months

900
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:54,980
they come more in line with the product

901
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,700
that's you know up to maybe two and a

902
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,740
half years old

903
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,150
that and when they start getting bit

904
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,340
over two and a half years old oh really

905
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,260
there's another sort of significant

906
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,960
change in that color so it's just

907
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:09,010
thinking about if your marketing old and

908
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:11,150
new season not mixing them together and

909
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:13,970
perhaps marking them as a separate

910
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:15,800
parcel because really it's about how the

911
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,900
market will how they present the market

912
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,980
in as appearance and at the end of the

913
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:24,080
day the red lentils are milled and it

914
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,820
comes can come down to how uniform they

915
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,140
split so if you've got new season all

916
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:30,290
season you'll have different properties

917
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,880
in terms of split ability I'm occurring

918
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:37,610
so that's why the market would like it

919
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:40,840
separate to go into the middles and just

920
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:43,070
dealing with off grade lentils just

921
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,460
taste indicated before you know the

922
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:47,290
potential for cleaning up to a

923
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,820
potentially up to higher grades

924
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:52,430
depending how much frost you can get out

925
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:54,170
if there was frosted quality in there if

926
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:56,059
it was 30% has only got 210

927
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:59,269
might not make much of a difference into

928
00:42:56,059 --> 00:43:01,220
a market but if it got it up to 5% or

929
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:02,809
under might make more of a difference in

930
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:06,829
terms of finding a better market than a

931
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:08,930
10% off grade so just need to

932
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:10,279
investigate - those are the products

933
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:13,190
whether there is cleaning options that

934
00:43:10,279 --> 00:43:16,670
will improve it significantly or not and

935
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:18,230
you know how we're a market option might

936
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,329
be or how long you might have to store

937
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:24,410
it to make that make a higher-quality

938
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:30,140
grade okay next slide please

939
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:31,839
fruit so in the global terms where the

940
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,849
market is going to go it's on everyone's

941
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:36,049
chatter it's talked about a lot what's

942
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:37,789
happening in India what's going to

943
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:41,119
happen I think it's month months of

944
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:43,849
chatter and speculation and because it

945
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,319
is a very important market it is the

946
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:49,789
second largest country in the world

947
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:53,539
population wise and their key food item

948
00:43:49,789 --> 00:43:55,700
is pulses or including a large amount of

949
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:58,640
lentils which up so I put those pictures

950
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:02,569
on the side lentil dials is a key food

951
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:05,410
they eat every day and that it says it's

952
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:09,079
a large population also produces

953
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:11,750
reasonable quantity of themselves but we

954
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:14,630
over the years of cent percent all of

955
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:15,980
our product to that market and then so

956
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,059
at the moment politics is getting in the

957
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:21,980
way

958
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:23,809
some time ago they the Indian country

959
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:28,279
had imported a lot of lentils they had

960
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:30,740
huge stocks and in the end they impose

961
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:33,259
some tariffs to reduce the quantities

962
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:35,630
coming in and protect the local local

963
00:44:33,259 --> 00:44:40,309
farmers from a lot of imports coming in

964
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:41,839
higher quality imports and so that sort

965
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:44,329
of put up a bit of a barrier to our

966
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:47,900
price into those markets and continue

967
00:44:44,329 --> 00:44:50,660
our bit of uncertainty now in exports to

968
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:52,750
that country so it's all just on hot

969
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:56,509
seems like it's all just on hold until

970
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:58,789
so this at the government election which

971
00:44:56,509 --> 00:45:00,680
happens in late May and to the

972
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:03,049
government the local farmer vote is very

973
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:07,700
important so I don't want to upset the

974
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:09,320
farmers before the election so this

975
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,480
almost be a bit of a hold this space

976
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,220
until that happens and clears everyone's

977
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,860
wanting that to happen and be done with

978
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,660
and but who knows what happened how long

979
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:21,440
it might take up the election for things

980
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:22,970
to change but at the end of the day the

981
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,910
balls got at the considerations will

982
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:28,070
start coming to play that do they need

983
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:29,810
to keep both it's a well we're going to

984
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:34,300
start needing to books and lentils and

985
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:38,030
buy some but when because price is king

986
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:40,820
their harvests will happen sort of April

987
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:42,560
May the area production is area is

988
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:44,510
little bit down there's speculation

989
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,850
about their production is their drought

990
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:48,950
effects or not tool what are their

991
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:50,780
supply stocks at so there's many

992
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:54,380
different factors that are sort of all

993
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:55,940
in the air at the moment so it's bit of

994
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:00,170
a hold this base to where the market is

995
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:02,480
going to go until all these things come

996
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:03,830
to light but at the end the day as I

997
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,980
said though people still need to eat

998
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:10,100
lentils and other pulses but it's at

999
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:11,990
what point the buyers say well we're

1000
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:15,880
going to be running short a product or

1001
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:19,040
we need to buy my side things in and

1002
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,650
whether the market will turn then time

1003
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,280
will tell

1004
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,280
the next slide please

1005
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:32,580
so just lastly I just thought I'd just

1006
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:37,080
put up a ten year of just priced lentil

1007
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:42,360
price trend it's just a if an idea that

1008
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:46,020
as in all pulse markets products that

1009
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:48,120
the dollars work in cycles and it's just

1010
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,890
hell on the cycle takes and Alicia gives

1011
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,630
be an idea that we always say well what

1012
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:54,120
goes down must come up that then must go

1013
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,740
down again and same with growers

1014
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,960
production when the prices were going up

1015
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:01,020
everyone produced increased area are

1016
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,670
here and in Canada the US response to

1017
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,350
high prices and then the next year they

1018
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:07,080
dropped down again so production drops

1019
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:09,900
and the supply and demand cycle

1020
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:11,400
continues so I guess at the moment I

1021
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,830
guess there's a closing comment would be

1022
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,420
well we've been ratted down on the cycle

1023
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:19,710
so at some stage it will go up it's just

1024
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:23,880
a matter of time thank you thank you

1025
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:27,630

later on in the growing season and we
