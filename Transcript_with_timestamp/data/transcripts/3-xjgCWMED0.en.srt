5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,440
farming to manage a good soil health is

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,080
a sound crop rotation of great

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,150
importance how you do that and

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,990
everything that comes with it you can

see in this best for soil video a good

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,060
crop rotation can help to prevent crop

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,719
damage by pests and diseases while also

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,730
increasing and maintaining soil health

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,790
beside prevention of pests and diseases

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:42,809
it plays a major role in soil fertility

15
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,030
and structure crop rotation is a planned

16
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,940
order of growing specific crops on the

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,250
same field the succeeding crop belongs

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,100
to a different family in order to press

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:56,430
soil borne diseases and nematodes a

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,710
rotation can be kept very simple but the

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,320
more diverse the more benefits can be

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,539
utilized under the precondition that the

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,479
specific crops are used in the right

24
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,640
sequence and ratio to design an

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,470
appropriate crop rotation it is

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,220
important to understand the underlying

27
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,439
processes and to follow the right steps

28
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,409
soil borne diseases and nematodes

29
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,619
require a susceptible host plant in

30
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,920
order to survive and multiply they can

31
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,110
multiply in or on the infected

32
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,900
susceptible host plant

33
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,970
after harvest crop residues and dead

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,630
plants will potentially contain huge

35
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:39,060
amounts of pathogens and nematodes with

36
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,610
the decomposition of the crop residues

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,100
and plants they will be retained in the

38
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,229
soil thereby increasing the level of

39
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,479
infestation in the soil

40
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:52,030
this increases the pressure on the next

41
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,340
crop to the point that its cultivation

42
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:58,270
is possibly not economically feasible

43
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:00,700
anymore this continuous cycle can be

44
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:04,060
interrupted by growing a non host crop

45
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:07,080
that is not susceptible to the diseases

46
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:10,179
and nematodes present in the soil

47
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,870
this action harnesses natural factors

48
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:15,549
such as starving of the pathogen or

49
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,310
antagonism by beneficial soil

50
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:20,590
microorganisms meaning that the

51
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,769
populations of the pathogens and

52
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,319
nematodes will decline to the point that

53
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,599
potentially susceptible crops can be

54
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,989
grown successfully again in the same

55
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,989
soil

56
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,730
crop rotation prevents pests and

57
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,829
diseases reaching a population density

58
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,590
in which they affect crop yield and

59
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:43,590
quality resulting in an economic loss

60
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,410
for the farmer

61
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,870
it increases or preserves soil health

62
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,819
and thus helps to maintain the prof

63
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,249
ability of the crop

64
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:55,810
of all a sound crop rotation is adapted

65
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:58,359
to the local conditions

66
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:01,329
apart from market opportunities and soil

67
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:04,120
type the infestation level of already

68
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:07,010
present diseases and pests determines

69
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,409
the rotation scheme

70
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,230
determination of the soil infestation

71
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:14,659
level by nematodes is relatively easy

72
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:17,680
and in many countries public or private

73
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:20,150
laboratories offer such services in

74
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,540
contrast only a few of such methods

75
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:27,590
exist for soil borne fungal pathogens

76
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:30,170
for example for verticillium and this

77
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,920
analysis is only available in a limited

78
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,080
number of countries

79
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,450
therefore a sound rotation is especially

80
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:41,290
important to manage fungal soil borne

81
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:44,230
diseases the host range for soil borne

82
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:47,380
diseases and nematodes has to be taken

83
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,930
into account some diseases and nematodes

84
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,350
have a rather narrow host range for

85
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:56,380
example potato cyst nematodes while

86
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:59,599
others have a wide host range such as

87
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,939
Trick odorous spp

88
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,310
the design of the crop rotation is

89
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:06,799
highly dependent on the crops and which

90
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,859
diseases or nematodes are already

91
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,650
present in the field here we will design

92
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:16,160
a sound crop rotation with the help of

93
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,500
the best for soil database one example

94
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,039
is a field on a sandy soil in northern

95
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:28,840
Europe we have a rotation of 8 years the

96
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:28,840
main crops are potato onion and carrot

97
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,160
typical soil borne diseases and

98
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:38,390
nematodes for these crops of

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:42,830

and turkey doris SPP within this

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,800
rotation we grow potato two times and

105
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,530
the other crops are sugar beet cabbage

106
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,719
and winter wheat with rye as green

107
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,209
manure crop

108
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,669
a general rule for the frequency is to

109
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:10,549
grow a crop no more than once in the two

110
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:13,610
or more years for many crops however a

111
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:16,039
longer period is required in this

112
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,979
rotation for example the main crop

113
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:23,149
potato is alternated by three sequences

114
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:25,729
of other crops soil analysis and

115
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:28,039
observations from previous crops show

116
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:31,369
that the following nematodes are present

117
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:34,159
in the field the nematode pretentious

penetrance and the nematode trick

119
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:40,519
odorous SPP the level of nematode

120
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:43,579
pretentious penetrance is above the

121
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:46,279
damage threshold therefore we look into

122
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:49,720
the best for soil database to see which

123
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:51,790
non host plants we can grow

124
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,040
after filling in our proposed rotation

125
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,320
the scheme shows at which level a

126
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,630
nematode could multiply on the chosen

127
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,180
crops and at which level the crops

128
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,940
suffer from the nematode

129
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,699
as we see here trick odorous is not

130
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:09,030
always harmful but multiplies on all

131
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,010
crops

132
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,320
therefore we decide to introduce the

133
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:15,780
cover crop target is Petula

134
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,150
since target Asst releases a substance

135
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,780
deadly for pretentious when these

136
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:23,850
nematodes entered the plant we see that

137
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,830
another weakness of our plan is the

138
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,790
sequence of winter wheat and the choice

139
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,580
for Rye

140
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:33,180
because pretentious multiplies strongly

141
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,940
on rye while only a little on sugar beet

142
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,120
even better options instead of rye our

143
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,310
Japanese oat and summer barley so we

144
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,610
decided to switch sugar beet with summer

145
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,900
Bali and replace rye by Japanese oat and

146
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:50,540
target is as green manures

147
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:53,900
this is an example of an improved crop

00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,020
discussed in this video

157
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,780
some crops are grown after each other to

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:22,380
complement each other's needs a lei Xun

159
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,449
forage crop which fixes nitrogen can be

160
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,639
grown before a crop which demands high

161
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:29,490
nitrogen levels

162
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,009
a deep-rooted crop such as summer barley

163
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,110
can be grown after crops such as sugar

164
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:37,069
beets to improve the soil structure and

165
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,069
water infiltration

166
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:44,340
deep rooting crops bring back nutrients

167
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:46,350
which were leached to deeper soil layers

168
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,690
instead of leaving the soil bare after

169
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:51,449
harvesting the main crops you can grow

170
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:54,559

later than October the first

172
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:59,539
be aware that also for cover crops you

173
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:03,340
should consider the nematode levels in

174
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:04,990
relation to host and non host plants

175
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,630
other crops prevent leaching of

176
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,630
nutrients leave residues to maintain

177
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:13,120
soil organic matter levels they protect

178
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:16,360
the soil surface and feed the soil food

179

formation of highly stable soil

181
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,599
