  "text": "with the rise of food prices and glow production we are seeing it more and more how essential it is to grow your own food to have a garden today we're going to show you how easy it is to take the back breaking work on having a vegetable garden if you have a vegetable garden you know exactly what is going into your food so no tractor no problem here is a plot of land that's never been plowed or tilled before except for about 85 plus years ago and my grandfather did it with a mule so we can consider that this land has never been plowed or tilled before here on to the east coast we have not had any cold weather this has been about one of the coldest days we have and you see i have a flannel shirt on but saying that the grass has not died it's got a lot of greenery this is a lot of thick grass so it's definitely going to have to be plowed up now you should this is january you should have it piled up at least you know maybe two months prior to january it would be a new ground but nevertheless it's not about the time frame it's about going ahead and getting it done today that's what we're going to do so a gentleman is going to come in and help me get this plowed up it was supposed to been played up two months ago but uh you know i just had to pull him in and so he's going to take care of that after we get it plowed up after you get your ground plowed up and tilled up then what you want to do is do a ph test you want to put lime in there you want to put fertilizer in there of course you're going to have to get some rocks maybe and some sticks and some roots out you know get it out but the next year it'll be so much easier i have a garden i've had for four years and last year it was so productive i had hardly any grass into it because the soil is so good so rich but i don't have to deal with the rocks and the sticks and it's just really easy once you get your garden going it's not as hard as you think but you do have to put time in it what you put in it into it is what you get out of it how much time you put into it is how much you're going to get out of it you put some time into it you're going to get a great harvest if you're not able to have a garden plot maybe it depends on where you live or maybe a smaller one you wouldn't believe how much food a smaller little raised bed would put out but maybe you're considering a greenhouse so let me show you my greenhouse that's under construction only thing is lacking is the wiggle wire and the plastic so here's the greenhouse and this is good for like you know when our time growing when you can't really get outside you're unable to really get outside this is this will be a really good benefit so check out my video how to build a low side wall greenhouse now some people may say this is overkill but i live in a hurricane zone so within that we got to make sure that the uh greenhouse doesn't go rolling so with this being such a thick grass here and never been plowed tilled anything done for it for years and years so it is pretty much new ground um many people take roundup and they kill the grass before they go in and plow now i would not advise that because you are what you eat that roundup goes in the soil yes it'll kill the grass but it goes into the soil and your plants get all its nutrients from that soil and it goes into your plants so the easiest route is really to take a tractor if you don't own a tractor then you hire someone like i did to make it so easy and so practical that you can just move forward with it then after you do your ph put your lime in your fertilizer in you can cover it up and finish smothering out this grass the reason of enlarging my garden plot is because last year i ran into the problem because we're running into different seasons now we don't really know how the season is going to do but here onto the east coast of north carolina we got enormous amount of rain and it rotted the garden peas and the potatoes and it took three times for the garden piece me to get them even come up now garden peas they do not like the heat so when the heat starts rolling in they quit at the same time the potatoes you know they was two months late and so with time they were supposed to be out of the ground it was time to plant something else also so i run into a little problem there so i feel like i need to expand my garden out so the possibility i won't have that little problem there if there is a problem what i did with the garden peas it was time to plant rattlesnake beans and like i said check out that video on how to plant rattlesnake beans the most productive bean i have ever grown and definitely will grow them again got some dry beans got some seeds for this year and they were just awesome but when the garden peas was coming up of course garden peas you have them on the trellis somehow a trellis because they're going to run in so is the rattlesnake beans with the rattlesnake beans it was time to plant them they was two weeks late getting into the ground so what i did i just went on the other side of the the garden peas and i planted some seeds and with tom the garden peas couldn't take the heat anymore it was time to get them out the rattlesnake beans was about four to five inches tall and then suddenly they took off but if you have a bigger space then you don't have to run into problems like that another good idea i did was also is that i made my garden like a raised bed i planted my rows closely together no more than about two feet now within that you have to go in there constantly and trim out the leaves which i did and you throw them to the soil which it goes back into the soil which goes back into your plants it's just a matter you just got to keep up trimming the leaves but also with that benefit what created was that the grass there was no grass it just was pretty much smoldered out any grass smothered out any grass that was trying to come up with the soil being really healthy and nourishment it was just it didn't really take on the grass but once you get your garden going once you get your plot going and you get the grass out many people don't understand you have to keep the grass out how much time you put into it is how much time you're going to get out once you really get all those grass roots out then you're not going to have a big big problem or if you don't have the time you can put row cover down and that will help smother out the grass now the gentleman is on his way and he's rolling in soon to bring in the bring in to help me to get this situated so i can show you how easy it is to get your garden started no tractor no problem [Music] hey guys i got somebody i want you to meet bryce rogers so i've been called out to cami's farm her homestead to help her prepare a garden on ground has not yet been tilled at least uh there's no record of it ever having been tilled 75 plus years ago my grandfather did it actually 85 plus years ago guys and that's predates me yeah i wasn't around yeah me either but you know what guys it's still new ground it's for all practical purposes this is new ground yeah he actually plowed it up with a mule so back in the day they had to grow their own food if they didn't grow up grow it they didn't get it we're going to be plowing with approximately 23 mules today oh wow there's a little more than your grandpa oh yeah absolutely absolutely he would be amazed to see this so uh we have new grass we've got uh a soil that hadn't been turned for many many years and we're going to do it with a a machine a john deere tractor 23 horse john deere 10 23 e and an economic piece of tillage a disc a four foot wide disc they cost about a third the price of a of a good tiller and uh obviously a a pto driven tiller is preferred it's the the right tool for the job but it's not economical so we'll do it today and a few more passes a little bit more time but just as well in the end result so actually this ground was supposed to should have been plowed about two months ago and um so we're in january right now but thank god that he's coming in to get this straightened out but one of the things that amazed me when you was talking about roundup because i don't put like to put round round up into my soul because you are what you eat but you told me something about roundup and the seeds what the farmers do can you talk about that sure sure to some degree farmers will frequently use a roundup ready plant a seed that allows for the use of roundup to kill off the weeds the undesirable plants while the desired crop grows through the roundup wow wow so i'm i'm very much into i want to say organic but sometimes what you think is organic is not organic that's why it's so essential for us to start growing our own food don't you agree well sure sure right you you know what you have when you've grown that product from uh from a seed yeah to a fruit to a vegetable yeah so what is your experience on growing um gardens have you what is your experience i was always the laborer i was the uh hard worker the mule the mule from many gardens yeah so i've been gardening all my life ever since i can remember one time i said i'd never have a garden because we we had to raise what we ate and uh but there's something about it when it when you are a true homesteader or you're a true gardener it's into your blood and you cannot get away from it somehow way another you got your hands into the dirt so today guys we're getting our hands into the dirt so let's get started what do you think sounds good sounds good the first thing i'm going to do is create a border i could do this with paint with string or i'm not doing either one of those today i'm just going to use the disc i'm going to draw a straight line from end to end to end [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Applause] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys we're at the end of the day and you've seen him doing his job here and i want him to explain to you what he was doing yeah so my name is bryce rogers i i work with intelligent design we just picked up a tractor and not very much equipment we were trying to get a job like this done with really cheap equipment or at least cost effective the soil was super hard and it just wasn't getting it done so we had to pick up a tiller and a tiller on the back of a tractor like this took care of this in a little over an hour yeah yeah we tried to hit it up again today we had a lot of rain over the past few days about 100 percent 100 and uh you know we're gonna get stuck we can't even steer so our lines are going all crazy and stuff and we can't even steer because it's so muddy um but a tiller took care of even the roots it acted almost like a stump grinder i had no no problem with the roots and i was i was really pleased with that a frontier tiller so the the old disc arrow will work on soft soil uh not the hard compact soil so what areas do you actually work out of how far do you go out you know what is your expansion of your work predominantly i work out of jacksonville jacksonville is my home base uh so i'll hit up the surrounding areas of jacksonville north carolina i got a couple customers in wilmington that have been really good customers so i come down to wilmington frequently and uh and i try to work in multiple jobs when i end up driving this far it's an hour and a half drive so yeah an hour and a half to come out and until the garden probably wouldn't be profitable for either one of us yeah but i'm already in the area right and i'm in castle hanging north carolina onto the east coast of north carolina so um but yeah so he you know you got to work it you know hey guys this is the end result and i'm so pleased his telephone number will be down into description so what is your telephone number yeah my telephone number 765-242-6833 and i just started a facebook business page intelligent design i don't know how you find that other than facebook search yeah they can find it they're good i'm probably smart yeah yeah absolutely well guys thank you so much for watching please subscribe and hit that like button and hit that bell so you'll know when the next video is rolling up and i appreciate you so much for watching thank you so much all my subscribers and i'm so happy with this situation now this is my second garden i've been working on my other garden getting it amended getting it ready to plant possibly potatoes and peas and this one would be this first year so we're gonna test the ph into it see how it's gonna roll this year i think it's gonna do awesome but your first year you just gotta get the planting just put it out there and see what it does and in the second year you'll know exactly what you're up against and i think it's going to turn out well because this soil here looks pretty good i just got to find out what i'm lacking and what i need into it and just put the seed in the ground so i advise you get the growing thank you so much for coming thank you so much i'm so happy y'all i got i got a garden i got it going it's going on is going on at the homestead love y'all guys see you on the next video bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey everybody i am so excited for this day we are breaking ground here onto the homestead and i want to meet hey everybody i am so excited for this for this [Music] hey guys i am so excited for this day we are breaking ground here onto the homestead and i want you to meet somebody and i want you to give him a shout out in your area okay just bear with me just introduce me see hey everyone i am so excited about this day we are getting what happened did you see that i don't know what happened today you",
