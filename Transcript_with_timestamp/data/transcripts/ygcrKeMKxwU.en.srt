growing we need new ways to feed

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:11,040
everyone traditional farming needs lots

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,360
of land but what if we could grow food

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,559
anywhere even in the heart of a city

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,720
vertical farming offers a solution it's

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,720
about growing up not out imagine fresh

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,199
this is the promise of vertical farming

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,640
and it's changing the way we think about

13
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,640
food production vertical farming uses

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,360
less space than traditional Farms it's

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,960
perfect for crowded cities or places

16
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,600
with little land and because it's

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,320
indoors you can grow food all year round

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,879
regardless of the weather no more

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,320
worrying about droughts floods or pests

one of the most exciting things about

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,760
vertical farming is Hydroponics it's a

22
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,719
method of growing plants without soil

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,640
instead plants get their nutrients from

24
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,120
a water-based solution this makes

25
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,559
Hydroponics very efficient it uses less

26
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,199
water than traditional farming and

27
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,399
there's no need for pesticides or

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,719
herbicides vertical hydroponic farming

important Concepts Hydroponics and

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,880
vertical farming Hydroponics is like

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,360
giving plants a special drink instead of

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,479
soil their Roots dangle in a

41
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,320

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,479
using space cleverly imagine a

46
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,320
skyscraper filled with plants growing on

47
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,240
shelves stacked high above each other

48
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,600
that's vertical farming in action we can

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,640
grow more food in less space now combine

50
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,000
these two vertical hydroponic farming

nutrients in the world of vertical

163
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,240
farming light water and nutrients are

164
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,479
the Holy Trinity of plant growth unlike

165
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,360
traditional farming where nature

166
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,240
provides these elements we become the

167
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,680
architects of our indoor ecosystems

168
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,759
light plants need light for

169
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,000
photosynthesis the process of converting

170
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,639
light energy into chemical energy since

171
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,120
we're growing in indoors we need to

172
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,120
provide artificial light LED grow lights

173
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,960
are energy efficient and emit the

174
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,759
specific light wavelengths that plants

175
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,800
need to thrive water water is essential

176
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,599
for plant life transporting nutrients

177
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,840
and maintaining cell structure in

178
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,880
Hydroponics we deliver water directly to

179
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,800
the roots through the nutrient solution

180
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,039
it's crucial to monitor water levels and

181
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,919
ensure a consistent Supply nutrients

182
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,720
just like us plants need a balanced diet

183
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,440
to grow strong and healthy in

184
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,080
Hydroponics we provide these nutrients

185
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,400
through a specially formulated solution

186
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,120
dissolved in water the nutrient solution

187
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,120
should contain all the essential macro

188
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,520
and micronutrients that plants need

189
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,199
monitoring and adjusting these three

190
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,240
