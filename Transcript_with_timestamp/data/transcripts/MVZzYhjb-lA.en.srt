small-scale irrigation otherwise known

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,310
as the hill C project has been

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,250
responding to the major challenges

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,320
relating to agriculture nutrition and

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:34,200
health across Africa

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:36,390
for the last three years through

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,579
research and leveraging agricultural

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,160
innovations the project is uplifting

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:45,570
lives of smallholder farmers across

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,120
Ghana Tanzania and Ethiopia and also

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,700
demonstrating potential for scaling up

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,000
from individual farms to a national

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,899

17
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:05,449
in Ethiopia the work of the lab uses a

00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,700
combination of research training and

19
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:10,670
innovative technology for use in the

00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,920
field to improve food production enhance

25
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,070
adequate and sustainable water delivery

26
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,890
is the core component that will

27
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:36,820
ultimately allow the Ethiopian farmer to

28
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:39,310
grow and prosper the water lifting and

29
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,189
delivery systems used in the field and

30
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:45,159
supported by the LC project ranged from

31
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:48,220
manual water lifting such as rope pulley

32
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:51,820
and tanker based implements to motorized

33
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:53,619
these or pumps and now an instrument

34
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,350
that can be directly sourced from one of

35
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:58,840
Africa's most ubiquitous resources the

36
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,330
Sun solar power pumps provide

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,670
cost-effective power sourcing and a

38
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:08,200
reliable method for farmers in remote

39
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:10,599
areas the solar panel has proved very

40
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,489
useful before we used a lot water

41
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,470
manually and put it in the hand

42
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:16,209
now with the new solar pump the water

43
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,060
goes straight into the tanker and I'm

44
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,590
able to other the high steps

45
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,049
this new method has saved me quite a lot

46
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,580
of time energy and money and I will

47
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:26,830
recommend this type of working technique

48
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,109
to all other farmers to make the best

49
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,750
use of the system I learned that it is

50
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:33,910
important to save and conserve water and

51
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,910
we now store all the water from the

52
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,829
winter season in tankers this method has

53
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:40,840
also allowed us to increase our yields

54
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:42,850
we are now able to produce meat up to

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,950
three times a year so I definitely

56
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,829
suggest that solar technology be made

57
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,380
more widely available the majority of

58
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:52,959
the components for the SSI innovations

59
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,329
can be made and more crucially to be

60
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,910
maintained locally allowing cost

61
00:02:55,329 --> 00:03:01,630
effective and productive usage of all

62
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:03,760
the primary irrigation tools a one of

63
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,470
the tool that helps them to manage their

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,209
water resources is the wetting front

65
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:13,150
detector so this tool is our indicator

66
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:15,370
of when to stop the derogation when the

67
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,220
yellow flag within this wetting front

68
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,590
detector pops up and we also installed

69
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,470
some instruments that measures the soil

70
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,209
moisture status of their their plot so

71
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,000
that you know when to irrigate and when

72
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,980
to stop the irrigation the

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,140
all of the Innovation Lab is to define

74
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,310
the most effective irrigation systems

75
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:38,290
and practices from water lifting

76
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,700
distribution and monitoring methods that

77
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,070
will enhance the Lawrences of

78
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,950
smallholder farmers like Girma Johanna

79
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:47,260
and his family in Ethiopia and present

80
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:51,240
the opportunity to transform the lives

81
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,240
of the next generation of farmers
