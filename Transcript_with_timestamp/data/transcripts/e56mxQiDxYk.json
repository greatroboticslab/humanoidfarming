  "text": "uh Dakota lakes research Farm you know one of the things as I go through today I think I I really want you guys to think about where you want to be in a 100 years because you've got to get in gear and get the agricultural research system working to get you there if we if we had the system we have now if we' have had that 30 years ago we would not have Dakota lakes and you wouldn't know any of this stuff okay so you really need to start paying attention to what's happening at all the land grant universities in the United States because they're just totally being taken over and and it really isn't applied research a lot of it so there's the CES research Farm it's owned by Farmers both irrigated and dry land we've been 100% low disturbance snow till um production Enterprise profit supports the research and that's why we've been able to continue if you're not a member of Dakota lakes you should be if you haven't visited Dakota lakes you should I have people from all over the world come to visit us there and they have a lot of people in South Dakota never been there which is kind of interesting uh and we're building an addition on our shop so if you want to really get involved you could make a donation to that so there's our native vegetation this is one of the most exciting days I've had my time at Dakota lakes this is not quite a year ago January last year this is Colin SC he's from Australia he's a green and grays guy I've talked about it's kind of a perennial cover cropping system in Australia that works really well this is Ralph derps I think a couple people mentioned Ral uh he's from Paraguay and this is durug Goan we call him duracel cuz he always goes these from Brazil as well and they came through now these guys you notice Brazil Paraguay and Australia was about 23 below that day and they wanted to take a picture by the sign because they'd come to the Dakota lakes research farm so they wanted the sign so we're standing out there we found all the coats we could and then we went out and showed them some of what we did this is irrigated corn on corn we plant between the cornrows uh we'll do a 2-year stack and then and then this past year we planted canola right in this little spot here uh and we dug around uh dersu is much more excited than Ral and and you notice Colin isn't even there he's in the damn truck he's had enough of this okay so a little bit of biodiversity growing there um anyway 1979 I've shown you this before the average wheight price in in in in 1970 is $137 the average price of Bar Oil was $3.39 so you just do the math for today it's about 89 bucks for a barrel of oil today uh but n bucks for wheat Minnesota where tillage is King it takes slightly under 10 gallons of diesel fuel prak for tillage seating and harvest so that's not a lot four bucks a gallon that's 40 bucks it's not a big input if you're looking at price of land in Minnesota for for whatever so uh to take no till is not about taking out the energy cost it takes the energy one gallon diesel fuel to manufacture transport to pipe 5 lounds of nitrogen so that Minnesota farmer puts on 150 pounds of AC per acre of an the energy is three times 30 gallons they had to use for tillage seeding and harvest so the big energy input is nitrogen fertilizer the big problem with doing tillage is it screws up all the things these guys talked about had one guy come up and said boy you're how conventional tiller you're really making us conventional tillers feel bad and whatever and I said well you better go home before [Laughter] 3 so 80% of the total input cost in agriculture can be traced directly to energy we all feel really good about how we how good a farmers we are 80% of that's due to energy 120 years ago that was Zero 120 years from now it has to be zero again because we're going to be out of fossil fuels now some people say I'm going to use biodiesel if we took and we are cold pressing our oil seeds and stuff right at the farm because we're going to be fossil fuel neutral by 2026 but if I took all the oils and fats in the United States beef Tallow pork lard all the corn oil soybean oil and whatever and made them into b00 we would have about 20% of our road diesel plus home heating needs and that's it we'd have nothing for agriculture nothing for electrical generation nothing for industrial and we still need 80% it's not the answer okay it's a way for us to have diesel fuel in case we can't get it to run our combines but it's not a long-term solution so I'm a farmer I take sunlight water and carbon dioxide and make them into products I can sell you notice I didn't say anything about energy and iron and whatever how well do we do this one of the things we do is we get hung up on these terms Randy England was over here running all these terms by I mean I had this put together already Randy and they sat there and smiled at you right sustainable no till regenerative organic zero Tails Drex seed what the hell you want to call yours R I don't know yeah I got another name right the new one is soil Health okay but you have a hell of a time defining that too we had nrcs had a whole soil health Team right remember all the boys out in Colorado they showed up one day and they're trying to write a definition this is what you do got to do to have a healthy soil you got to and you and I took them out of one of my fields and I dug up a little soil I said smell this and they smelled it and they said now you know if you get something that measure that smell that would work but I also challenged him I said define a beautiful woman or a handsome man how tall how what size hair what color hair what size different things right you can't write a definition for but we all know one when we see one okay mine mine happens we had 20 our 25th wedding anniversary about two weeks ago she needs a sympathy card not a not an one I get a really kick out of it I was traveling in Canada last year they came up with this turb ethical oil it means that the oil from Canada even though they they dig it out of the tar Sands and heat the he 11 hell out of it and do all this stuff at least their women are well treated and they get educations and whatever whereas in some of the Saudi the the Eastern Middle Eastern Nations they aren't treated as well right and they have human rights and whatever so thorough oil is better it's ethical oil and I'm yeah okay that works okay we spend lots of time trying to find what we should do and should not do and little time focusing on where we want to be where do you want to be consequently much of the research and management effort is devoted to optimizing a single component like canola or corn you know how can you better manage what how can you kill that what event do you have in that corn and when you're resistant to that corn you got to get another event right spend all this time looking at these little tiny details and we're using more and more specialized treatment we're really focusing on the end instead of acting to get where we want to be we're reacting reacting from going where we do not want to be be instead of focusing on where we want to be it's a little bit like trying to drive your car Down The Highway by looking at the edge of the ditch okay that works in a blizzard for you boys from the south that don't really understand how to drive in a blizzard Ray see all these South Dakota guys know how to do this when you're drunk driving a blizard in the old days it's really fun but it's not ideal way to get home now there's no better time than now we've never been more profitable you know I can tell by all the four-wheel drive pickups around people have some spare cash right so where do we want to be where do you want South Dakota to be in 200 years what do you want to look like we keep doing what we're doing what's it going to look like okay so what 30 years of noil and crop ration work have taught me remember that I'm a slow learner if you don't believe that ask my wife I've learned more from Farmers than they have learned from me and I've learn more from Farmers because they call me up and say how would you do this or I did this and this happened and my advantage is I've talked to a lot of farmers that have made a lot of mistakes and we all learned and I've also had 30 years to make mistakes of my own I've learned more from observing nature than trying to change it and I gave a talk last spring at SDSU to a bunch of really young faculty members that don't know South Dakota about where Dakota lakes came from and I started with the LA Andre Brothers how many people here know who the LA Andre brothers are yeah people from real Pier do okay they are the French fur Traders sons from Winnipeg that came across the Continental Divide from the Red River Valley to the the Missouri River Valley looking for a Westward passage and also to claim this area for France and the reason we bought it in the Louisiana Purchase from France were those guys but they're also looking for beavers and then Lewis and Clark we looking for beavers to kill and once we killed the Beavers we no longer had the beaver that kept the water from flooding the Missouri River and white man wasn't smart enough to build his houses up on the Hills they build them in the river bottoms and we start flooding so then we had to build big ass dams and we built the dams we had to take water from Pier to Redfield to irrigate because you couldn't possibly grow corn and soybeans in the gim rer Valley without irrigation duh right I've learned more from observing nature them prying to change it I thought hell we can do this we can grow corn so in Jimmer Valley if we know till we can grow corn at Pier if we no till if we better use the water because Mother Nature could do just fine doing that noil is just one tool among many that we use to help us manage our ecosystem but if we do tillage we got everything so screwed up we can't manage it anymore so the first step had to be quit doing tillage and then you do adjust all these other things and you guys have seen this before but a lot of guys just quit doing tillage didn't change anything else oh we're just going to do corn beans like we always did and it collapses okay so cultural practices technology and management we have to till is a cultural practice we have to replace it with other cultural practices not with technology technology is fine but if you try to replace what you did with tillage with only technology there's not enough technology available if it were available we couldn't afford it you know it's not available because we get resistant if it were available we couldn't afford it and if it even if it were available we could afford it you got to sell it to the consumer and they frankly don't want us doing that nature tillage is a catastrophic event so when we take it out let's do this rotation sanitation comp competition proper intensity using this water and cover crops is part of that adequate diversity Mother Nature tends to produce lots of diversity when giving her way and we try to Crunch this down to do one or two species and she's trying to have all this diversity we're just going against what she's trying to do and trust me she's had several million years of doing this and no matter what them Jean jockies at SDSU think she's better at it than they are okay and so they can keep doing it that's fine but she's just going to say oh oh I see what you're up to here try that and if we can get this part right then we're going to be stable and sustainable the other way to look at it is water cycle Are We Cycling the water the way it was cycled before we start farming if not we're leaking stuff and we're leaking nutrients out and they're going like Ray said to the golf for Mexico or whatever okay if we put drain tile in we really screw these up energy flow how much of the energy that's falling there are we catching I'm going to Manitoba tonight they used to do summerow last week I was in Montana with with Paul and they still do summerow what percentage if they're doing spring wheat summer fallow what percentage of the sunlight that falls on the ground in two years do they catch well everything from May June and July why one year out of two 3 months out of 24 not very good and Community Dynamics what happens with how many species do you have there farmers and ranchers Harvest sunlight carbon dioxide and water right some of this is human food we need to be aware of nutritional issues and offsite impacts when you raise food in different ways wheat for instance it has different qualities people are starting to become interested in that Cod Lakes right now is having long discussions with the people who buy buy Grain and things for kog and Kashi and Starbucks and whatever based on this factor and they initiated it not us if we want to eat beef that's great maybe we should concentrate on producing beef instead of trying to grow corn and barley that feeds beef and feed Lots know just if we all want to grow some beef out here let's figure out how the best way to do that weeds and diseases are Mother Nature's Way of adding diversity to system that lacks it so the more you try to concentrate on one species the more she's going to try to offer Alternatives nothing new you've seen these before for me savings might be expected in the amount of fertiliz and irrigation water used in a three-year rotation he's talking about wheat because of healthy or more functional root systems that could be corn when you have a drought year like this year was your plant root healthy was it in a healthy soil that had all these macropores so it could explore the whole root Zone because that's part of what has to happen biological control of soil and residue inhabiting past of weed is accomplished by not growing eat more frequently than every third year second or third year a change in cultural practices not pay may not pay off at first one or two years R was talking about that might take a while so did Paul but we'll pay off in time each future wheat field or corn field is treated to the extent possible as an ecosystem to be nudged rather than shocked in a desired Direction right now everybody's trying to shock the thing we throw this fungicide on but that kills his beneficials and if you put fungicide on there F fungus is what the earthworms eat bad ones and good ones so you're going to starve them to death we haven't used an insecticide at Dakota Lake in 12 years not because I'm saying gee we don't want to use insecticide because we don't have to we have predators we use some seed treatments and things but we don't use the high rate Cruis and stuff either it kills our Predators the shest way for me to guarantee that I'd have to use a poster insecticide is to put some insecticide with my herbicide just because it only costs a buck okay crop rotation is the single most critical Factor affecting the health and productivity of future crops in general crop ation allows time for natural enemies to destroy the pathogens of one crop while unrelated crops are growing this is not hard choose a sustainable economic approach that optimizes productivity while taking maximum advantage or at least not getting in the road of Mother Nature's contribution to the health of a crop over Reliance on herbicides leads to resistant weights and maybe disease problem is there anybody in this room that was in Denver in 1994 at monsanto's Big conference out there where I did the clothes 1994 I did the closing talk in a Monsanto conference in Denver 2,000 people and I predicted Roundup resistance I have the tape not a popular position to take in a Monsanto conference in 1994 it's simple you hadn't know that was going to happen unless you were just totally brain dead monsano knew they were just hoping that their patent ran out before it happened and it's not their problem it's your problem it's because we misused it right and maybe disease problems if we use surfactants too frequently may increase disease issue have we seen an increase in bacterial blight and goss's we those used to be associated with hail and wind and things which weaken the LA wax on the leaves but if we go out and spray Fung surfactants with fungicide surfactants with herbicides surfactant with whatever we weaken the wax on the leaves makes it easier for the bacteria get in there it also kills beneficial bacteria that attack fungi in Saskatchewan they found that if they spray fungicides early on wheat they increase the amount of ferium because because they kill a beneficial fungi early go the web it's there been published real science fungicides and insecticides cause collateral damage they are disturbance just like anything else so we're going to use them but we're going to try to use them judiciously so we look at some other things like chloride soil testing can be used to minimize the need for early SE seasoned fungicide if you have a chloride deficiency it makes you susceptible to Le spotting diseases rotation interval and weeds if we want to prevent weeds this is U if you have a resistant weed 10 of them here with 10 seeds per per weed and you do a rotation that's every other year like corn Bean you have 10 million of them in seven years and that's assuming that you kill it during the bean year so Roundup resistance this doesn't count that's more like a whatever if I go two years out it never happens if I'm going to do half corn and half beans I'd be better off to do a stack where I do two corns two beans okay here's a study that we did years ago where we did 12 years of different rotations on the 13th year I just planted the whole thing to Spring week and Randy Anderson from ARS came out and he counted the weeds that came up okay so we he counted the weeds we sprayed sprayed round up and then we planted our spring wheat and then we just didn't put any more herbicide on he counted the wheat where we had wheat chickpea and that's could be corn soybean if you want to he had 94 weeds per square yard wheat corn chickp 40 P wheat corn soybean more diversity 7 Now High disturbance techniques increase web pesture and cause tillage erosion this is 97% weed control by the way with no herbicide case you case you're wondering uh High disturbance techniques increase weed pressure and cause tillage erosion he did the same count in a tilled site with a two crop rotation there's 225 versus 94 four crop rotation 7 versus 44 this is due to the tillage causing more weed somebody talked about that earlier today was it you right yeah God he's good isn't he worth all the money we spent getting him here no you're not we're all taxpayers we all we all paid for you to come here I knew you were going to say that you you may be cheap but you're not free right till age dist servance and poor rotation 225 weeds per square meter no till good rotation 7 there's your 97% weed control tillage was good at eliminate weeds the damn thing should be all gone by now especially in Iowa and Illinois right best weed is a good crop canopy we keep this old crop canopy in place or a cover crop canopy or anything like that in place until a new crop canopy forms that's one of the things with a cover crop you just go out there and put another crop canopy there instead of trying to kill it with a nervous ey this one we had an a to steer we have an auto steer now but this is when we had an ought to UT to steer better and and you you don't pull in straight but this is no herbicide on wheat with a with a spot there that's left and no competition that's what you want to be able to see but there's tillage erosion we took the dirt from here pulled it down here started out looking like this then it medium term it's got this bear that's about where we're at if we keep doing that we're going to take the CRA happy soil and cover up the good soil down the bottom and we're all going to use variable rate technology so we fertilize the top of the hill and drag the down the bottom down here now in Canada they do bail grazing they put their Bales up here and turn the cows out and the cows poop and eat and whatever and you restore fertility and organic matter back to top of the hill it makes a lot of sense it put put a fence around the Bales really kind of a good system sanitation rotation and competition are the primary methods of pth control herbicides are part of competition they're part of Sanitation they're part of rotation they're I don't use herbicides for Pest Control I use them as Tools in this other little goal pesticides are only part of these fertilizer placement residue distribution are part of competition going Place some fertilizer maybe move a little residue we're much less gung-ho about moving residue them before but if I put my crop here and I put fertilizer there and nothing out here then my weeds don't have a chance so again I can get this guy going before these guys have any nice warm conditions and before they get any fertilizer this guy's got to learn to drive on the other side of the field so this blows away if you get a 45 foot head from somebody like John Deere and say you know if you make a head 45 foot wide you should make a thing in the back that spreads it out 45 ft right should be a requirement we use a lot of stripper heads for that reason John Deere hasn't figured that out neither's anybody else place a fertilizer you know strip Tail's hot but basically it's a fertilizer placement thing and here's that bar that somebody was talking about today this is the cheap bar just now some guys want corn heads that chop it all up and whatever but then it blows away and floats away you leave it tall and you use this thing to lean it over put a little fertilizer and plant this is Mike Arn's planter from whatever so what we do is some s pee with the seed other nutrients place near the row at seeding time or on the soil Surface after crop canopy if you broadcast fertilizer before at seating it encourages weeds three key factors available nutrient moisture and Roots all three in the same place the same time and Ray Ward will tell you how much available nutrient you have there estimate it give you his best guess how many of you guys know Ray wart yeah okay do you know that he got PhD from SDSU he used to run the soil testing lab his major professor and his PhD was the same guy as my major Professor he ran the Redfield farm at one time we're like twins okay maybe not he's hell a lot better looking than I am okay we don't kill our coyotes they can't figure out why everybody wants to kill their damn coyotes they eat they eat mice we don't kill our rattlesnakes right one of the reason we kill a rattlesnakes is somebody who does organic comp and they say well you're using these terrible chemicals and I said well what's what do you use we only use natural stuff it's not dangerous it's good I got rattlesnake need to move cuz he's not going to hurt you obviously he might cuz it's natural proper nutrient cycling is important ecosystems that leak nutrients for extended periods of time become deserts if you ship your wheat out and don't bring back the nutrients in terms of fertilizer you have a desert you're exporting you're leaking we had a Taiwanese Randy was there right had this time when need trade delegation one of the things about being close to Pier right were just handy for these trade delegations they got meet with the governor and they got to stall them for an hour and a half so let's go see some wheat we're going to sell you wheat so I'm talking to him and I got this wheat coming up and the cover crop is dying and I'm talking about how it's feeding the nutrients the wheat and everything and the guy goes oh you don't need to use fertilizer and he said well yeah I do need to ferti use fertilizer if I'm going to ship you the wheat to Ty pay because I'm sh shipping you nutrients unless you're willing to take the poop from Tai pay put it in a container and ship it back and he got this real stunned look on his face and I okay I started a diplomatic problem here and then all of a sudden he gets it and he starts laughing and he translates and then they're all making a little Scoopy sailing seeps are symptoms of improper nutrient water cycling if it wasn't salty when it was in the prairie it's you'd done something nutrient placement is part of cycling try to make it go into the plant developing proper water cycling information is important you need to know soil's water holding capacity characteristics long rainfall and covering forage crops are useful to help fine tunes so here's my North unit Pier Shale Drive promised soil and opal soils uh pretty crappy don't hold much water went to web soil survey which you have in the United States how many people have been to web soil survey good good on you go home go to web soil survey get a map this is coro's Bucking Horse pasture if if you're watching the National Finals you see my neighbors you know CU corco takes my neighbors takes them to Las Vegas and I don't get to go and this shows you how much available water holding capacity this is three in this is 5 in total water holding capacity in that really heavy soil it's like a sand with a really bad attitude there I use cover crops a lot because it gets full very quickly I'm not going to talk about a lot of what we do there there's a main Farm there's my good soils that's about 12 in available water holding capacity okay those are my good soils then we take some place like Onida which is kind of dry there's your rainfall from October to September I use October one to September take the E out of ET yeah Paul I know you can't get it all out of there but it sounds better you know taking take part of the E out of ET you can't take it all out I'm so from October to June from the time you would harvest corn until sunflowers would start using water Onida way the hell out there gets 10.36 in of rainfall if you make it go in the ground and you keep it there and you have a promis soil you're saturated and you're getting saine seeps and you're screwed now if you have a good soil if you were way dry when you harvested the corn which you usually aren't you're going to be we full okay so you can do that kind of exercise half of normal is usually a drought this year is a little bit more than half a little less than half a normal and then this is one and a half that wet year okay and you can do that for different time periods right the long phow the wheat long phow they used to do it a Ida one crop of winter wheat every two years they tried to put 24 in of rain into soils that hold somewhere between 7 to 12 is there any wonder they had sailing seeps duh no till does make saine seeps worse because it makes the water go in the ground unless you do something beneficial with that water why is land sell for more in Iowa than it does in South Dakota they get more rain but yet we have guys here trying to get rid of their water so if you put this rain in here with no till you got to use it here or it becomes a saine SE here and what's in a saine seat Ray calcium salts what else is in there sulfur is that a fertilizer and calcium's a like lime yeah what's the other one that's in there chloride chloride oh we use that for fertilizer yeah nitr nitrates do we use that for a fertilizer yeah who said salt but it's these really good salts sometimes you get a little sodium but most of the time what's in there is the good guys your fertilizers that you're paying the hefes for and what they really want to do is get you a drain tile so you can get that damn stuff gone quicker so they can sell you more [Applause] duh cover and forage crops provide opportunity increase both intensity and diversity in situation where production of grain crop would not be possible so where you can't do a double crop like the guys in Kansas you start doing some of this stuff and add biological diversity in human environments tall grass prair or weather which is kind of here in East the goal should be have something growing all times where we have limited growing season this will require use of cover crops and forage crops or double crops so that's here you don't have a long enough season like the guys in Kansas in subhuman to the west of here semi Aid environments cover crops are utilized less actually but it gives us a chance to add organic matter and biological activity sometimes we have to keep our powder dry uh so here we're adding carbon this is going to go to beans next year versus not doing anything so here's stripped wheat stubble here's adding hay Millet and oats in there and then here we have some feed that we can graze for our tall cows and our short cows uh I like that joke uh now here's a real mixture of stuff and that's what we look for is this diversity they grow at different times we'll start with like cow peas and the brassas and the lentils and the cow peas will grow early when it's hot and then when it gets to be first night it's 36\u00b0 they go oh damn this isn't Oklahoma and they just die and then you got the next step same way with the forage torgs I use oats and forage torgs and the and and the hay millets and when they get it gets too cool for them they die and the oats comes so that's what we looking for is filling these different Niche so there's there's a cowy that comes early this stuff back here I actually got this in the wrong order this comes later okay does it work kind of here's a study we did where we had a a cover crop of lenel chickp uh chickling vetch and turnup between a wheat a wheat wheat corn corn soybean soybean so right in here between the wheat and the first corn if we put no nitrogen on the next spring we got 176 belel of corn with 36 lbs of nitrogen we got 236 bush corn was 72 lb we got 214 no sometimes you get you know what we got to do is start figuring out how to predict that's going to happen but the good thing in South Dakota is if I want to use this nitrogen I cons soil test and I'll have it again next year just get it in the pool it doesn't hurt to have it there so this is what I call Catch and Release nutrients and a lot of people use this and we should give the credit for that to Jeremy Wilson from Jamestown North Dakota really good young no tail farmer from Jamestown North Dakota and he used this term and I walked up after he' used it at a meeting I said Jeremy can I use that oh sure he didn't know that everybody else is going to start using it right so anyway we need to acknowledge that if you get stranded in rain in the back 40 you drive home across a child a tilled field or pasture that's that soil structure thing that Jim Horman talked about okay it doesn't get there if you do tillage every other year or whatever okay but at least some components of a rotation do not fail in excessively dry years it's an indicator there's not sufficient intensity so if you failed on something this year you did good okay some of us did better than others the rotation does not but I'll give you an example we we do a third of our Dryland corn at Pier in soybean or sunflower residue a third because I call my mother-in-law corn or my banker corn because they come to visit in June that's my corn that looks good and then two-thirds of my Corn's in wheat stubble and if my banker comes in September or August I to show them the stuff in wheat stubble right but in a good year that's my cheapest corn in soing stubble I don't have to maintain the wheat stubble right I just harvest the beans the first thing the spring I plant the corn that's it pretty easy to manage last year I had 140 bushel corn there this year I had zero on average we're about 110 okay that's okay it's not as consistent as the stuff in wheat stubble but if I don't fail in the really dry year I haven't taken full advantage of this normal year when I get 108 bushel and I fail badly in wet years and that's what a lot of us did early on we're so afraid of being too damn dry that we get too conservative in terms of pushing the rotation and we fail because it's too wet if you're failing cons what you want to do is fail parts of the rotation when it's too wet fail parts of the rotation when it's too dry in most years they all work pretty good we all we also harvested 100 Bush of wheat so uh 99 eight or something like that average on the main farm so we had a good year from that standpoint crop insurance regulations impact risks associated with different rotational intensities and also make sure that your crop insurance rules fit what you're doing with cover crops so we got a guy in Kansas that basically lost his whole payment because he did a bunch of stuff with cover crop and they came out and said that's not approved there should be no need for a ground engaging component to seed and fertilize crops we should be able to shoot them in the ground with something like this so all this St about trying to cut residue and do all that kind of stuff if we just have a seed in a thing that looks like a gol tea and just shoot it in the ground it'd be great go out there with our floater and put it on Ray talked about one straw Revolution using clay seed ball same idea seed Stakes would do the same thing and basically what he's doing is he spreads his seed balls out drains the the rice fields spreads the seed balls out for his wheat crop the wheat crop takes off and grows after the rice and he's before he harvested the wheat he put seed seed balls out grow cover crop and then he throws his rice out and floods a field and the rice grows I read the book livestock integration will be needed if if you're want a cycle nutrients cows help it gives you better nutrient Cycles it gives you more rotational flexibility more crops you can grow we need to work on automating that and making a multispecies and we're working or hope to be working on these selfpropelled grazing cells but we have the technology now you just have a cell out there you call it up on your smartphone and go how my cow's doing oh looks like they're out of feed push a button and the thing would move we could do that now the technology is there somebody says this makes sense we've automated them in feed Lots we haven't automated them in the field and there's way less disease pressure and stuff we kept them in the field it gives us a chance with these high price we have for land to get young people back into the business so best biomass digestor has four legs and goes move right and I like this one we're soil testing and then they're going to apply the fertilizer right I couldn't resist that one that was too good uh but here the Canadians do a lot of this they SWA the residue and and whatever and the reason they do is they have they have had more BSE mad cow so if you have a cow over 24 months old is basically worthless in Canada and for you guys that came to the conference in year on several years ago we had guys talking about doing this kind of thing perennial sequence or perennial cover crops will probably be necessary because annual crops don't go deep enough to bring the line back to the surface okay in Australia they have a huge problem with this and that's where Colin sizes thing works but I was in a sorghum field one time where they thought it was drought problem with sorghum but the only place the Sorghum looked good was right around the tree and then Ray Ward can tell us what that is what nutrient deficiency symptom looks like drought problems there you go see how good he is so when we test it what the tree does is it brings the potassium up and puts it back at the surface so in high rainfall areas that's our cycler in Prairie areas it's a deep rooted grass because we don't get as much rainfall that's enough need a tree where it rains more they get the rainfall in the winter time so what happened is we had 100 parts per million potassium around the tree five parts per million where we're away from the tree so the drought wasn't a drought it was a potassium deficiency I'll be D nutrient cycling rotational flexibility building organic matter we need to do all those things we might if we're going to do fuel we might want to do biomass Fuel and our new building we're building we're going to heat it with solar wind and biomass biomass only when we need to because we like to keep organic matter and feeder cows the austr the Argentine used to have systems that were seven years of pasture and seven years of grazing so here's cover crops no cover crops but this field would have been in seven years of pasture and then probably about its fifth year of of of crops look at the soil structure that's 1997 and then the Argentine government outlawed the export of beef and they said it was so the poor people could afford to own bee to buy beef because they atat twice as much beef per capita as we do great place to visit if you're a young single male guy especially pretty girls wine and beef I mean it's doesn't get any better than that um but Ruth said are they pretty and I said yeah and but I said it's kind of like a dog chasing a car deer I wouldn't know what to do with it if I caught it anyway so but when they outlawed the the real reason for out outlawing the export of beef is they wanted more soybeans because the way they collect taxes in in Argentina is they take 32% of the soybeans that leave through the port go to the government so we have the IRS and all these rules and everything right brick buildings cars computers they got one guy an auger and a gun but anyway so everybody went to doing lots of soybeans because we can't do cows can't do the pastures we're going to do soybeans and I finally in 2006 got to go back to the same field because I've been there a couple times I was noticing I thought they were losing soil structure but unless they went back to the same field I couldn't tell you that's the same field in 2006 that happened in 10 years soybeans on soybeans on soy beans there's not enough carbon there's not enough residue your carbon nitrogen ratio is all screwed up you're just going to totally destroy structure very fast it's like doing tillage over and over and over again and this is a plate plate type structure here's one that we're doing right now we have elala this is our long-term 23-year corn field but we planted alala in half of that and we're keeping the elf alive and the corn alive and so far so good but we'll find out next spring so the idea is kind of Colin SC is doing a warm season grass as a grazer like a looks like switch grass or or big blue stem and then he grows canola and wheat during the winter time during the dormant phase here during the dormant phase of the Corn the fall and the winter we're going to have this perennial guy okay we'll see if we can keep them both alive organic matter is the most important factor in determining the productivity of soil small amount of organic matter by weight has a big impact on for space within all texture groups is we go from 1 to 3% the available water capacity doubles go to 4% at 60% your water does not hold as much your soil does not hold as much water as it did when Grandpa got here because he's taking out the organic matter so if you had a soil like on a a soil web that says okay it holds 8 in now it maybe holds six what's that mean a rainfall makes you saturated sooner and then when you get a crop planted there you get dry sooner you have less resiliency your bucket is smaller the best thing to do is get a bigger bucket okay the other thing that happens is we might be changing carbon dioxide level in a canopy because if residu these cover crops that de decompose after crop canopy is established or the residue that decompos them can feed carbon dioxide to especially C3 plants cook and vth talked about that perhaps some of the improved water use efficiency results can be attributed to enhanced carbon dioxide concentration so here's an example of our you've seen before probably but here's two rotations that look almost exactly the same corn pea winter wheat this one though has another soybean in there so it's half broad leaves this one up here is only a third broadleaf look at the difference in a dry year 60 versus 29 with 7.9 Ines of rain in from July to July in 2006 in a good year 92 ver 57 that's when we had 23 in of rain here we had .4 56 versus 28 that tells you the difference in resiliency there's what it look like this is the low residue rotation there high residue rotation there that's what it looks like in an aerial photo when you take off half of 150 Bush acre corn crop you're taking off 50 pounds a acre of Van 5 lbs of P 100 lb of K and 3,000 lb of carbon I had a guy last week we when I was traveling to Montana somebody called me on the phone wanted to buy my baales that we had spread out to do some bail grazing and stuff I'm going you can't I it took me like 20 minutes to convince him I didn't want to sell my damn residue you can't have it you know like well I'll pay you good for it you can't have it don't you want to know how much no you can't have it a friend or guy from South Dakota no tilling it's not about no till it's about residue doesn't have any residue doesn't do any good to not do tillage because it's all sealed up right Ray it's all screwed up there there's no residue it looks like Paul yaz's organic thing where' the residue go Abdul took it and he took the roots along with it because in mlim culture if you leave anything out there belongs to the community so you take it all and you put it on your semis or your straight trucks and you and you take it to the building but we laugh but that guy if that's the residue he's going to feed to the goat that's going to give milk to his children it's not because he's a greedy bastard that just wants a bigger four-wheel drive pickup okay there wouldn't be anybody in this room that would do that take the E out of e and take the T out of can't go to the South dakota.com and we've got like a good thing for doing rotations or different styles of rotations that you might have fun reading okay thank you [Applause]",
