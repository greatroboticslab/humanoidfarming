  "text": "[Music] We're JC and Holly Habber and we live uh just south of Bell, South Dakota and we started with JP's family operation. So I'll let you start the story. Uh in uh 2009, Holly and I got married and started M&H Land and Cattle. And uh we've been on this place for uh since then, I guess. And uh when we got married a little bit before that, JP and his brother had operated together. And Jake and I took over the operation. Our main parts of the operation are cow calf pair. Uh we background cattle and we're working getting ready to feed cattle fats and we also uh do row crops. That's kind of GP's area. So we raise corn, soybeans, uh winter wheat, spring wheat. Uh this year we grew food grade oats for Gerber baby food. Um we do hay production. Um we have alalfa uh cover crops. So this year uh well previous years JP had had this idea to bio strip till because in our area a lot of aronomists uh push strip till and so we and for the kind of ground that we run it just doesn't really work that well. um because we have have what JP calls prairie potholes and it truly is prairie potholes. Um and so we didn't feel comfortable putting that dollars and that fertilizer out there not knowing that we would or wouldn't be able to use it. So a few years ago JP said, \"Hey, what do you think about using cover crops to try to do what strip till does, hey, I think it sounds good, but it was really dry for a couple years when it came time to plant them. So we waited it out and this year it worked out perfect. And so that's what we we did. And so hopefully that'll that'll prove out for us in in our rotation. All right. What we have here is some noil soil cloud here and we have some conventional soil cloud here. And we're going to run a demonstration on soil aggregate stability. As we drop these in, we're going to notice some bubbling out of the no till, but not near as rapidly as the conventional. conventional till is starting to fall apart rapidly. And so what this is stimulating is is a a heavy rain scenario that this soil here will erode and kind of run down the furrow maybe along with your high dollar seed or fertilizer where this is holding together and actually absorbing taking in that that moisture. here. Oh, wow. Now, look at it go. I I'm surprised that that I thought I'd be able to pull a chunk out of there in 2 minutes and break it in half and it would still it would be dry in the middle. Oh, wow. It's pretty much it's wet all the way through. I mean, there's definitely moisture pretty well all the way through. And this one's completely gone. This soil can hold this soil can hold moisture. And this soil, that's what we need is we have to we have to have the ability to to conserve moisture. And that's a integral part of that. We say especially in our area, which it's true, especially in our area, but I mean, you think about across the nation, California, they're putting water restrictions on. I mean, it's just a matter of time. It moves across the country. So, it really is important no matter where you live. Thanks a lot for uh joining us with that little experiment. Um, like we said, we're we're located in east central South Dakota and right uh south of Zel, South Dakota. And and keep looking for these little guys and these little guys. Uh, I'm Holly Haver. This is Haven. And I'm JP. And Harley's taking a nap. Stop in if you're near Zel. Thanks, [Music]",
