hundred feet above the tree line here on

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,890
pesticide on my farm this is a

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,219
government mandated pesticide spray

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,020

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,140
flying back and forth back and forth

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,969
over my farm all morning long and I'm

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,410
afraid to go outside I'm afraid to

21
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,239
breathe this stuff in I don't want to

22
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,890

24
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,699
garden update and I'm gonna show you

25
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,920
this plane that's flying over spraying

26
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,260
pesticide across my farm it's something

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,809
something's not right about that I had

28
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,700
no choice no choice in this matter at

29
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:16,340
all

30
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:18,510
[Music]

31
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,920
guys before we get started I want to

32
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:24,840
show you some cool new additions to the

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,520
farm family check them out guys we ended

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,350
up getting six little baby ducks for the

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,170
farm here and this is our little mobile

36
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,200
coop idea basically it's just a rope

37
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,640
right here and we just move this coop

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,300
basically every day or every other day

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,400
and the back of it is on snow skis so

40
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,500
pretty cool little setup you just lift

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,210
up on the front and you pull this coop

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,890
from different paddock to different

43
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,479
paddock little squares and that's so the

44
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,940
baby ducks get fresh grass every day

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,820
cool basically every morning my routine

46
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,290
when I'm not working is to get up go out

47
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,880
in the garden do a little bit of work in

48
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,050
the garden for an hour or so and I'll

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,310
take you through and I'll show you what

50
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,220
we're doing I've got some interesting

51
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,680

was doing this morning when I walked

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,920
outside I'll just walk over here in the

59
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:18,810
garden show you so these are our tomato

60
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,970
plants these are beef eater tomato

61
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,070
plants and this is our trellis system

62
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,070
posted a video about that a couple days

63
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,830
ago and these are more Tomatoes I've got

64
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,880
a nice decent little line of gourds out

65
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:35,040
here more Tomatoes out there squash

66
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,220
different squashes and corn over here

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,840
you know just a simple garden guys I've

68
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,760
doing a lot of weed control as you can

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,230
tell look at how nice that is

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,000
just no weeds whatsoever all natural so

71
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,290
I'll show you what we're doing on weed

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,810
control this area here looked like that

73
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,420
right there that's how many weeds were

74
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,850
growing up through all of my squash

75
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,739
plants so we went through with a hoe and

76
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,780
just hold them out and cleaned up the

77
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,170
weeds all natural no sprays no nothing

78
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,730
like that now my corn it's another story

79
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,959
I haven't been in there and weeded yet

80
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,299
but we'll get in there in the next day

81
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,010
or so now we've got a beautiful row of

82
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:15,630
green beans going right here and this is

83
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,600
again the trellis system that we're

84
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,430
using and we've got some cucumbers and

85
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,380
that's our orchard that you can see out

86
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,440
there I think we have about sixty fruit

87
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,910
trees growing and our honeybees these

88
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,859
are our cucumbers here and we have a

89
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,490
little trellis system and we have a

90
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:31,950
couple

91
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,900
rose that we're just gonna weed and

92
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,760
we'll be planting some okra right here

93
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,200
so we're leaving a few extra rows just

94
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,820
in case we want to plant some extra

95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,110
goodies in the garden this year so

96
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,540
everything here in the garden is

97
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,030
symbiotic symbiotic meaning everything

98
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,370
works on everything else the honeybees

99
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,140
are right back there they are there for

100
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,150
fertilizing our fruit trees which are

101
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,800
there and for our garden and we also

102
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,360
have our chickens closeby so we can

103
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,720
spread chicken manure here on the garden

104
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,790
too

105
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,470
now once the garden Peters out at the

106
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,390
end of the season well fence this whole

107
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,160
area in and leave the chickens in here

108
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,810
and let them munch down all the goodies

109
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,000
and put down some good but fertilizer

110
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,440
for us manure that good old but

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,960
fertilizer this will be a wonderful

112
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,430
garden for us to feed our family on most

113
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,290
of the time when we plant stuff like

114
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,670
green beans we'll do a lot of canning so

115
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,680
there'll be a lot of canning videos to

116
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,570
come soon but I really just want to come

117
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,660
out here show you the garden to show you

118
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:25,200
what's going on and talk to you about

119
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,850
this government mandated spraying that

120
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,230
I'm just not comfortable with I'm just

121
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,880
not comfortable with it guys

122
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,800
post a comment down there tell me what

123
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,170
you think soon as this plane flies over

124
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,050
again he must have went and reloaded

125
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:39,450
with spray but I mean I can taste it in

126
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,310
the air I can taste it on the back of my

127
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,410
teeth and when I was out here working

128
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,400
this morning I actually had to go back

129
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,660
into the house shut all the windows and

130
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,100
you know I was just afraid that

131
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,890
breathing that stuff was gonna make me

132
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,300
sick not cool not cool let's get you a

133
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,430
shot of this plane when it flies over

134
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,560
it's literally skimming the top of the

135
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,390
trees so here on the farm channel we use

136
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,640
a drone sometimes when we fly the drone

137
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,790
around and we have to stay below 400

138
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,440
feet now this plane is clearly below 400

139
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,050
feet

140
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:13,920
that's my airspace that's the air that I

141
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,810
breathe I don't know again I asked you

142
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,590
post a comment down there should I have

143
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,210
to go inside for fear of this chemical

144
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,760
spray that's being released into the air

145
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,740
over my farm are 200 acre farm here it

146
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:36,570
comes here comes the plane

147
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:36,570
[Music]

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,980
I don't want to breathe this that's

149
00:05:48,759 --> 00:06:03,579
flying right over my field over there

150
00:05:50,980 --> 00:06:03,579
[Music]

151
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,040
I shouldn't have to breathe that I

152
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,090
shouldn't have to breathe this man I

153
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,760
shouldn't have to breathe this in a free

154
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,920
country I didn't vote for that I didn't

155
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:21,210
vote for some airplane to be flying over

156
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:23,070
my farm spraying for a gypsy moth now it

157
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,930
might be for the best if any of you guys

158
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,820
know about this stuff leave a comment

159
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,830
down there we're gonna actually hop on

160
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,910
the Gator here and we're gonna run over

161
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,190
and I'll show you one of these little

162
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,080
gypsy moth traps okay it's a big orange

163
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,660
trap all right so I'm over here on the

164
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,030
other side of my farm and this chemical

165
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,960
spray it just feels like it's coating my

166
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:45,060
body so right here is one of the gypsy

167
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,700
moth traps so you can see a little flag

168
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:51,260
from the road and right here is one of

169
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:55,260
the traps it's like a corrugated plastic

170
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:58,050
trap that's set up for these gypsy moths

171
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:01,530
now the whole area here just has a foul

172
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:04,590
smell of spring going on I don't know

173
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,960
exactly what the what the spray is but

174
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,760
we all received a letter from the

175
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,450
government saying that the spray was

176
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:16,740
safe and then it wouldn't harm you I

177
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:18,240
smell it if I smell it they can harm me

178
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,650
I don't know I'm gonna I'm gonna get

179
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,240
over here in the middle of my field and

180
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:27,240
get a shot of this plane coming over

181
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:29,190
here I mean I could so bad it's so bad

182
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,509
that I'm underneath where the plane is

183
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,069
flying and my neighbor's kids are

184
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:35,400
outside playing and I just want to tell

185
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:37,949
them to go inside the basic gist of this

186
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:42,479
is that the government can come in and

187
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:44,250
do whatever they want to do I guess guys

188
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,250
I really hesitated to make this video I

189
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,720
stood about it and I've stood about it

190
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,490
enough to where I think it's probably

191
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,259
just about quitting time for this spray

192
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,759
crew that's flying over I don't know

193
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,419
tell me what you think they're dropping

194
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,750
pesticide on my land on my trees on my

195
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:03,090
honeybees on my garden I don't know what

196
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,490
this pesticide is it's supposed to kill

197
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,810
the gypsy moth or the gypsy moth larvae

198
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,610
I don't know a whole lot of history on

199
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,039
the gypsy moth I hear that they attack

200
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,630
the ash tree and we have ash trees

201
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,250
around here but not very many of them

202
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,919
there's just a smell there's just a

203
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,720
chemical smell in the air you can feel

204
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,099
it in your in your mouth you can field

205
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,000
in your nose you can feel it on your

206
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:26,099
skin and to me something's not right

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,139
about that I couldn't work in my garden

208
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:30,889
this morning for fear of being sprayed

209
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,599
by government-mandated

210
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:35,219
airplane there's just something not

211
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,959
right about that if any of you guys know

212
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,459
anything about the gypsy moth or if

213
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,050
anything like this has ever happened to

214
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:42,120
you post me a comment down there and

215
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,919
just tell me what you think even if this

216
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,020
hasn't happened to you tell me what you

217
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,970
think I don't know whether they're

218
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,470
organic farms around here I do know that

219
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,910
they're organic tobacco farms around

220
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,899
here and they're flying over them

221
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:57,570
spraying them too so I don't know does

222
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,670
that ruin the organic miss of of your

223
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,079
garden of your tobacco farm I don't know

224
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:05,100
I was torn about doing a video about

225
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:07,470
this because I guess it's for the best I

226
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,120
guess it's for the greater good but to

227
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,920
me I should be able to work out in my

228
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,810
garden in the morning and not worry

229
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,490
about an airplane flying over spraying

230
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,410
me with pesticide from the government

231
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,940
