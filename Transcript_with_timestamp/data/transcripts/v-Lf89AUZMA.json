  "text": "it's the end of summer and as crazy as it might seem now is actually the perfect time to start planning next year's magical garden hey they're saplings welcome back to esoteric moments I have been spending so much time this year focused on magical gardens and gardens in general getting the land plan for our farm kind of figure it out and I wanted to share some of the resources that I found really compelling for this project the first book is cultivating sacred space by Elizabeth Murray this is mostly a personal kind of memoir book of the author's garden finding her husband losing her husband and that whole process there are different gardens that the author describes and shows which might give you some ideas for your own garden there are some general like correspondences listed in general it's a nice book but maybe less design or plant focus the pictures even are like kind of small and not as inspiring as some garden both solid lots of good stuff in here but definitely more for someone who's looking for a book with gardens but kind of about other things spiritual gardening by Pegg Streep was really great it's kind of what I hoped the other one would be like this one has massive pictures giant ones on almost every page and they're beautiful a really wonderful inspiration book for the winter month this one talks about the different ways to approach spiritual gardening and has about ten or twelve like example gardens that are really well described you can tell the author enjoys gardening knows what she's talking about and is keen on sharing the spiritual aspects of gardening with others one of my favorite example gardens in here is the Gaia garden which happens to be in Wisconsin but it's a good combination of food and plants and community and spirits it just works really well and I definitely took inspiration from that garden on some of our own plans here magical gardens by Patricia monoghan was a great read and clear written for the pagan druid or witch in mind this book spends a lot of time talking about spellcraft ritual how to utilize your gardens for your pagan practice if you're like I'm not really a gardener but I want a magical garden this might be a good place to start because it's really coming at this whole idea from a magical perspective there are also some garden designs in here which have like a diagram and a plant list and then they describe the intention and use of that garden gives you some really concrete ideas for your own magical space I have the 15th anniversary edition and what I really wish would have happened is to have some pictures of how these garden plans had adapted and grown in real life it would have been beautiful to like see how the person living and working and practicing in that spiritual space how that had translated over the years and what had changed but that's the only downside really is that there wasn't that year long or actual photographic evidence of those gardens garden awakening by Mary Reynolds was probably like this is almost number one I couldn't decide really such a great book I found Mary Reynolds on Pinterest of all places and had no idea about her work with Wilde Gardens winning the Chelsea Flower Show all of that was very foreign to me here in the US her book is just packed with land spirits and wildness and real concrete understanding of how to work with a landscape to create sacred space there is hardcore plant lists and gardening ideas and garden diagrams that are very in-depth but still this feeling of like you are working with the land this is how you communicate and do that I think it's a great read for anyone who likes to like walk the land and connect with the land or just enjoy garden it's very fascinating read there's also a bit of permaculture in this book forest gardening describes kind of the different ways that that might work not in depth permaculture by any means but definitely a nice tidbit and you can't beat the garden diagrams in this book she does like an earthworks version and then this version where you see all the plant and kind of above typical garden plan and like plant lists it's really detailed it would be hard I think for the average gardener to recreate this type of plan does give you like go bold go big do what you want for your magical and spiritual space finally number one creating sanctuary by Jessie bloom this one wins out mostly because I think it's the most approachable for many people it talks about permaculture and design ethos it talks about how to utilize all those elements in daily practice as food as medicine it's not just about design it's not just about magic or spirit it's also about like what you do with it afterwards which is perfect and beautiful a friend of mine had this on their coffee table a book club and I just like fell in love with it on that day when I purchased a copy I sat on my garden bench and devoured it in like a whole evening it was just such a fun read so inspiring and just like good for the soul kind of reading it has enough pictures too that you get a real understanding of like what the author is doing in their garden and how you might recreate it in yours but still very approachable very down-to-earth all right there you have it my top 5 books for magical gardening I am so curious let me know in the comments what book looks the best to you have you read any let me know your thoughts this week's application all goes out to thank you so much for your comment if you want to be a sapling shout out definitely talk to me below or over on Instagram that's how I can get ahold of you and learn about your practice and your gardens and whatever you're up to thanks for watching and as always may find peace in the sacred grove [Music]",
