00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,040
hi this is leo bartolon i'm extension

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,559
cropping systems specialist based in

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,040
minot

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,000
today i'm gonna talk into

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,359
how we can build and increase our

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
resilience into cropping systems

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,400
as you may know notice this cropping

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,400
season was very tough on north dakota

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,400
especially in the north central region

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,279
we got extremely drought we under d4 for

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,559
a

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,960
long long time and the crops were

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,520
suffering a lot during this time

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,760
if we look at medium term and long term

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
into the cropping systems there are some

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,120
options that we can

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,520
take into account

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,879
to diminish the problems with the dry

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,000
conditions

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,239
so one of this is how to increase

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,280
organic matter in our in our cropping

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,840
systems

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,079
so we have an environment that

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,280
is very

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,760
challenging

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,000
to grow crops and to

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,799
increase organic matter but with the

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,400
right decision into the crop rotation we

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,479
can increase the organic matter so one

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
thing that we should do is increase no

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,240
till

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,439
so reducing the tillage we can conserve

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,240
more water into the soil and then reduce

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,680
the evaporation because we can

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,920
leave the soil

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,799
surface soil surface covered for a long

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,280
time

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,720
and then we can increase our water

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,400
storage

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,119
another important thing to do is how we

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,560
fit cover crops in our

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,560
cropping systems

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,159
so it's very challenging

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,280
here in north dakota

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,520
to

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,360
introduce the cover crops especially in

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,640
the north central and western part of

49
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,040
the state

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,920
but there is a lot of options that we

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,159
can rely on to increase

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,799
the use of cover crops

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,840
especially in the late summer and in the

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,159
fall

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,960
and then the cover crops can grow

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,160
in that period before the frost

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,120
and then we have the benefits of living

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,160
plants

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,959
growing in the short period of time

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,400
so these benefits will translate it into

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,440
increase over time the soil structure

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,000
we need living roots into the soil

63
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,760
to increase soil aggregation

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,640
soil structure and then over time not a

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,519
short period of time but it takes time

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,879
so we can increase our water storage

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,959
capacity

68
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,080
so there is a lot of options that have

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,480
been researched for north dakota for

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,920
grover crops you can look at our

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,319
publications

72
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,440
so try to fit the cover crops in your

73
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,599
system

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,800
another important thing

75
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,200
that we have saw

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,400
this season here in the dry conditions

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,200
so

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,360
a lot of farmers try to seek moisture

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,519
during the planting time

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,800
seek moisture i mean

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,920
plant deeper than the recommendation

82
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,319
so

83
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,560
we have seen a lot of problems doing

84
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,879
this practice

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,440
you know we should plant like two inches

86
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,319
depth and a lot of farmers trying to

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,040
plant three inches depth and we saw a

88
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,080
lot of problem for emergency uneven

89
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,000
fields

90
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,599
the soil was crusted

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,760
it's a practice that should be avoided

92
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,519
and another issue

93
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,840
that prevents

94
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,360
your cropping systems to be more

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,680
resilient

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,920
is one thing related to

97
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,720
speed of planting

98
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,000
we came across with several fields with

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,400
a

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,519
speed planting problem

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,680
so it developed the growth in the soil

102
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,680
surface that prevent the proper

103
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,239
emergency of the crops especially

104
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,680
soybeans the most common problem up here

105
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,760
in the region

106
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,439
there is not an easy fix

107
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,959
for building resilience into the

108
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,760
cropping systems

109
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,799
but there is a medium and long term very

110
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,239
feasible options to build your

111
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,320
resilience into cropping systems so

112
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,720
my final message is

113
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,720
try as much as possible to feed cover

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,840
crops into your

115
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,440
into your

116
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,479
rotation

117
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,800
scheme

118
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,560
for you get this all this beneficial in

119
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,520
the medium and long term

120
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,580
thank you
