00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,720
today i am going to demonstrate a simple

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,680
way to attach drip tape to a header pipe

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,599
and to plug the end of the drip tape

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,440
the first thing that you will want to do

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,599
to attach the lathe flat to the header

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,639
pipe is attach the drip tape to the

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,320
fitting

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,760
twisting the fitting to the right will

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,680
tighten it so that it won't come off

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,840
when you turn the water on

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,160
then take a phillips head screwdriver

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,400
and punch a hole in the lay flat header

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,720
we are doing this part with the water on

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,119
it makes it easier to punch the hole but

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,880
you will get wet be careful to use a

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,640
screwdriver with a head that is slightly

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,120
smaller than the fitting so that it

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,520
doesn't leak around the fitting

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,600
then push the fitting into the hole you

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,760
should be able to hear or feel a pop

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
when the fitting slides into the hole

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,920
with the water on it will flow through

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,600
the tape and out the other end if you

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,760
haven't plugged it yet

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,760
to plug the tape make sure the water is

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,199
cut off

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,600
cut off a 1 to 2 inch piece from the end

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,359
fold the tape over twice then inhale so

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,399
that it will easily slip inside the

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,399
piece you have cut off

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,240
now your drip tape is ready to go to

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,080
sure it stays in place turn the water on

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,000
and get all the kinks out so the water

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,600
is flowing to the end of the drip tape

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,759
and you have your place where you want

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,759
it

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,680
then take a regular garden hose and

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,920
place soil every foot or so on top of

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,320
the drip tape to weigh it down so that

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,920
it won't get displaced by high wind be

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,320
careful not to hit the tape with the

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
hole you'll be able to apply water

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,400
directly to the plant without getting

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,479
the plant or fruit whip this is a great

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,119
way to conserve water reduce plant

46
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,840
disease spread and reduce food safety

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,000
risk we hope this video was very useful

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,000
please check out our video series to

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,079

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,799
simple irrigation system on a small
