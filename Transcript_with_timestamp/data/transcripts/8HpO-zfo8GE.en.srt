00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,799
good morning and welcome to wholesome

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,160
roots today i'm going to give you some

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,719
tomato tips

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,639
today's tomato tips are going to be

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,639
pruning your young tomato

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,359
plants my advice

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,020
may differ from some of the other advice

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,920
that you've received online

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,480
[Music]

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,320
i have been growing tomato plants for

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,359
over 40 years

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,520
literally it was my job as a young child

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,600
to take care of the tomato plants

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,160
and the very first thing i planted when

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,520
i moved away from my mother's homestead

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,280
was tomatoes they are my favorite

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,280
and so i'm very passionate about

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,680
tomatoes there are many myths

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,239
surrounding tomatoes and how to care for

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,920
them one of the biggest that hurts my

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,120
soul the most

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,879
i think

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,840
is the fact that

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,840
tomatoes are often said to have suckers

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,440
i'm about to burst your bubble people

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,320
tomatoes

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,119
don't

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,799
have

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,159
suckers

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,200
what people are calling suckers

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,799
on tomato plants is actually

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,400
lateral stems

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,640
lateral stems produce just as much fruit

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,600
as the main stem

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,600
there is

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,280
no reason that these need to be removed

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,799
a true sucker

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,960
is going to be

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,079
something that is draining energy from

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,320
the plant

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,479
and this is usually associated with

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,880
trees that have suckers coming out from

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,920
the roots around the base of the tree

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,840
this is not something that we see in

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,920
tomatoes at all

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,439
so every one of these

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,880
suckers

49
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,119
is just something that's going to

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,320
produce more fruit so scientifically

51
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,040
speaking

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,880
tomatoes don't have suckers some people

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,759
might say that when you remove the

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,399
suckers you get more fruit but you're

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,399
not gaining any more fruit by removing

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,200
suckers you actually are going to have

57
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,360
less fruit the fruit may be bigger

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,680
because there's fewer of them so the

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
energy of the plant is going into fewer

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,080
fruit

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,560
so your pounds of tomatoes at the end

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,560
may be close to the same but your actual

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,280
number of tomatoes does not increase at

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,200
all in fact when you leave your suckers

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,160
they're going to grow you far more

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,480
tomatoes on the plant and the reason why

67
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,480
this is a good thing to have is because

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,080
if you have a bird or a squirrel come

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,080
along and take a bite out of one tomato

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,440
and it's only one of three tomatoes on

71
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,720
your plant

72
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,519
you've just lost a third of your crop

73
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,160
whereas if a bird or squirrel comes

74
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,519
along and takes a bite out of one of

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,720
13 tomatoes you still have plenty more

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,319
to harvest no big loss okay now that

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,400
i've gotten that off my chest let me

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,200
step down off of my soapbox

79
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,519
and teach you about how i do prune my

80
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,500
tomato plants for better health and

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:11,759
better harvest

82
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:11,759
[Music]

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:24,389
the sky is blue the sun is high

84
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,389
[Music]

85
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,280
this tomato plant here in the middle is

86
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,400
a little bit on the large size for the

87
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
pruning

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,799
and some of these shorter smaller ones

89
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,200
are more ideal

90
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,640
so i've been waiting to prune so that i

91
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,400
could make this video and i needed a

92
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,319
good day that i could do that so today's

93
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,280
that day and i'm going to show you how i

94
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,360
do this first off i got a steak to find

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,760
my center trunk and make sure it was

96
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,000
facing up so that i could find

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,519
which parts of this plant need to be

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,439
pruned off

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,560
i do prune in the beginning of the

100
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,599
plant's growth i prune everything off of

101
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,159
the bottom foot but right now we don't

102
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,000
have much more than a foot of growth so

103
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,640
it's only going to be a third of the

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,760
plant until we reach that foot mark

105
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,239
and that

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,439
is about at three feet tall so

107
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,920
everything

108
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,880
that i'm cutting off is going to be

109
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,799
leaves that come off the side

110
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,000
and lateral

111
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,600
stems

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
not suckers

113
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,520
that come off the side at the joint

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,479
between the leaves

115
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,479
and the main stem

116
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,440
tomatoes are vines they are not meant

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,080
to have

118
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,880
just one stem they are a vine

119
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,199
so

120
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,280
it is important that you give them that

121
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,800
opportunity to do what they want to do

122
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,520
tomatoes are going to naturally do it

123
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,639
anyway why fight it the reason why i

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,880
prune everything from a foot down is so

125
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,440
that there's no splashing on the leaves

126
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,600
that could introduce blight into the

127
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,639
tomato plant from the soil the good

128
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,919
thing is is that these bottom

129
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,680
suckers

130
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,280
or lateral roots

131
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,800
can be rooted so as i trim this plant up

132
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,840
i'm going to put each one of those

133
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,080
lateral stems into a container of water

134
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,479
they will root in that water and i will

135
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,479
have new plants to grow in another area

136
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,120
in the garden it is important that the

137
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,120
pruners that you use are sanitized you

138
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,600
don't want to introduce any disease to

139
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,080
your tomato plants all right so this one

140
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,240
is an ideal size for beginning our

141
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,320
pruning transformation i don't want to

142
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,199
remove more than a third of the plant

143
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,680
from the bottom portion so i'm going to

144
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,520
come in here and i'm going to remove

145
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,600
that leaf

146
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,280
and that leaf

147
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,840
and i'm going to dispose of my tomato

148
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,080
leaves in the trash because i don't want

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,880
to carry any blight into my compost now

150
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,280
you notice i left these lateral branches

151
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,199
the reason why i'm leaving these

152
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,440
is because they are so small at this

153
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,160
point that i actually can't really get a

154
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,479
good root on ones that are that tiny

155
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,479
and that leaves us about two-thirds of

156
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,400
the plant total

157
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:11,440
material of green leaf behind

158
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,800
okay so then we get to this slightly

159
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,800
bigger plant

160
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,319
i'm going to remove

161
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,319
all of the leaves first

162
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,520
that are coming off of that main stem

163
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,840
making sure that i dispose of them

164
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,720
properly

165
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,240
and because i have

166
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,639
a lateral stem

167
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,199
down low that's a good size i'm going to

168
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,800
cut that one off this one is going to

169
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,960
get cut off as well

170
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,960
because it's so low to the ground

171
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,960
and i'm going to

172
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,639
i might leave that one for one more go

173
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,280
but i'm going to remove this leaf above

174
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,479
it so i cut my lateral branch and place

175
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,000
it into water

176
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:55,120
and while i'm in here i noticed that the

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,120
container that i planted

178
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,880
these tomatoes from must have had some

179
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,599
weed seeds in them

180
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,199
so i'm going to go ahead and pull that

181
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,160
and make sure that there's no

182
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,479
competition in my root zone

183
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,120
we want to keep it weed free so that the

184
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,000
roots can develop and grow beautiful

185
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,520
fruit

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,120
all right now this one is a prime

187
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,800
example of

188
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,199
letting it go too far

189
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,160
so i'm going to be pruning this one much

190
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,960
more heavily i'm removing

191
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,599
all of the bottom leaves and lateral

192
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,840
growth look at the size of that lateral

193
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,840
stem that will grow a new tomato plant

194
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,599
all of those

195
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,120
nice fat lower lateral stems

196
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,120
will become new plants for us

197
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,479
so look at that

198
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,120
who knew

199
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,879
as you can see i have left

200
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,840
this lateral stem

201
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,160
right about where the first bloom starts

202
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,440
is usually when i start leaving those

203
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,120
lateral branches so this plant does need

204
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,879
to be continued

205
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,319
in proper staking

206
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,319
and i'll save that for another video

207
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:19,180
[Music]

208
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,400
so now that i've got one bed done

209
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,720
i just have a few more to go

210
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,840
make sure you get those

211
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,000
newly cut stems out of the sunlight or

212
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,159
they will wilt very fast

213
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
all right so that's how i prune my

214
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,039
tomato plants i gotta get busy pruning

215
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,800
the rest

216
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,800
as you can see they look beautiful and

217
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,120
healthy as it is and i'm going to

218
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,760
continue to show the progress as we grow

219
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,440
if you have any questions or tips let me

220
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,640
know down in the comments

221
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,519
we'll see you next time on wholesome

222
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,880
roots another fun fact for you

223
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,800
this is a tomato leaf not just one of

224
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,920
these single

225
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:04,000
leaves on the side here but this entire

226
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,000
structure is one leaf
