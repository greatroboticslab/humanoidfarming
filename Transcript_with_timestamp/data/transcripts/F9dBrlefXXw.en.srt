00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,160
hello my dear students and welcome to

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,120
this week overview during this week we

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,719
are going to be talking about the soil

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,480
degradation and conservation so we are

5
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,480
going to be stared talking about the

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,560
erosion the process by which material

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,519
such as top soil is moved from one place

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,039
to another caused by natural processes

9
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:29,279
and human activities often occurs faster

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,520
than soil is formed depleting fertile

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,840
top soil crops trees and other plants

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,840
communities protect soil from

13
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:43,760
erosion so in conclusion erosion is the

14
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,600
movement of stuff like dirt from one

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,600
spot to another it happens because of

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,719
natural and things people do sometimes

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,960
it's quicker than soil can be made which

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,039
is not good because it takes away the

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,719
good Rich dirt from the top plants like

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,719
crops and trees help keep the soil safe

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,200
from erosion they act like a shield

22
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,439
making sure the dirt stays where it

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:14,560
should be this way the soil stays

24
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,560
healthy and can keep supporting plants

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,159
life then moving to Farmer practices

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,600
that reduce erosion so farmers use

27
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,240
various techniques to loosen erosion on

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,960
their fields one method is intercropping

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,880
where different crops are grown together

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,439
another approach is crop rotation where

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,640
different crops are planted in

32
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,040
alternating Seasons shelter bels involve

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,000
planting tall plants to block strong

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:53,079
winds reducing soil movement

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,159
conservation is a practice that minimize

36
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:59,920
the amount of soil turn over during

37
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:03,079
planting to racing transforms steep

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,560
slopes into steps to slow down water

39
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:09,440
flow and prevent soil wash out Contour

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,800
farming is a method where crops are

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,800
planted perpendicular to the slope of

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:20,160
Health helping to trap water and prevent

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,400
erosion these farming practices help

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,840
protect the soil ensuring its long-term

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,920
fertility and

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,920
sustainability so in summary we have the

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,200
intercropping which different crops

48
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,400
mixed together we have crop rotation

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,440
which crops are alternate we have

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,440
shelter belts that tow plants block wind

51
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,840
we have conservation that soil turnover

52
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,959
is reduced we have ter racing which

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,040
steep slopes turned into steps and then

54
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,840
we have Contour forming which planting

55
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,000
perpendicular to Hill

56
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,159
slope then we have ranching practices so

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,040
we have ranching is the raising and

58
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:04,360
grazing of livestock overg grazing

59
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,480
causes and worsen many soil problems

60
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,640
range managers encourage grazing limits

61
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,440
and enforce them on publicly owned land

62
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,519
so we have here overg grazing so compact

63
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,159
soil and damage structure we have

64
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,599
removes native grass and expose bare top

65
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:25,040
soil then moving here we have that it

66
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,319
allows invasive species to outcompete

67
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,040
Native species because of alternate

68
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,959
environment then we have decreases pores

69
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,920
of

70
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,480
air and decreases pores for water so all

71
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,000
of that will cause to decreases in Grass

72
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,239
growth and survival and leads to wind

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,439
and water erosion we are going to talk

74
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:48,000
about this in detail as we are going to

75
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,480
be creating posters research problems

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,480
and connect that to real life

77
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,480
situations
