tons these countries play a crucial role

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,400
in supplying onions to Major markets

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,400
particularly in Asia Europe and the

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,680
Middle East the the Journey of an onion

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,520
begins in the fields where it is

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,400
cultivated and cared for through an

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,280
agricultural process tailored to its

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,640
specific growth needs onions thrive in

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,960
well- drained nutrient-rich soil

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,600
requiring plenty of sunlight and

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,600
moderate water to develop vigorously in

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,520
modern agriculture

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,399
Farmers have embraced the use of

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,680
automated onion planting machines to sew

33
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:42,040
seeds efficiently significantly reducing

34
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,479
the amount of manual labor required and

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,520
enhancing overall productivity these

36
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:52,200
State of-the-art machines are designed

37
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:55,240
to place seeds or small onion sets into

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,520
the soil with remarkable Precision

39
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,759
ensuring they are positioned at the

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,240
optimal depth and space at consistent

41
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:08,000
distant intervals guarantees that each

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,679
onion plant has adequate Room to Grow

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,680
minimizing the risk of overcrowding and

44
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,480
promoting healthier more uniform crop

45
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,920
development throughout months of careful

46
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,080
tending onions grow strong beneath the

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,640
ground with roots reaching deep for

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,440
nutrients while green stems rise above

49
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,239
to support this growth automated

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,560
irrigation systems provide the exact

51
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,120
amount of water needed keeping the soil

52
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,480
consistently moist without over

53
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,200
saturation during this time farmers use

54
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,120
a combination of organic and traditional

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,040
pest control methods to keep the onion

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,800
plants healthy and thriving after

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,879
approximately 3 to 4 months from

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,239
Planting onions is ready for Harvest

59
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,879
choosing the right timing is crucial as

60
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,560
harvesting too early will yield immature

61
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:08,280
onions lacking flavor while a delayed

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,159
Harvest may lead to spoilage typically

63
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,319
when the green onion tops begin to fall

64
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,799
over onto the ground it's a clear sign

65
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,080
that the onions are ready to be

66
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,280
harvesting onions with Machinery marks a

67
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,000
remarkable advancement in agriculture

68
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,000
saving significant time and

69
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,280
labor modern harvesting machines are

70
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,239
designed to lift onions with Precision

71
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,319
gently removing them from the ground

72
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,640
without causing damage the machines then

73
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,840
clean off excess soil and neatly arrange

74
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,159
the onions for Easy Transport this

75
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,640
automated process is not only

76
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:55,519
accelerates the Harvest but also ensures

77
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,519
that onions are collected clean and

78
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,959
intact ready for further processing and

79
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,760
storage after being high harvested the

80
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,400
onions are transported to processing

81
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,760
facilities where the transformation into

82
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,079
onion juice Begins the first step is

83
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,519
cleaning where the onions are placed on

84
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:20,280
a conveyor belt and thoroughly washed

85
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:23,560
Under Pressure nozzles and soaking tanks

86
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,720
to remove any dirt or remaining

87
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,240
impurities once cleaned the onions are

88
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,840
prepared for the juicing process these

89
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,039
preparation steps not only ensure

90
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,280
hygiene but also optimize extraction

91
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:41,240
preserving the natural flavor and

92
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,960
nutritional nutrition of the onions in

93
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,039
the final product after completing the

94
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,720
cleaning process the onions are

95
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:51,199
transferred to Industrial juicing

96
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,080
machines here the fresh onions are

97
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,400
crushed and pressed to extract pure

98
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,960
juice this pressing process must ensure

99
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,360
that the juice is efficiently filtered

100
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,880
retaining all the natural nutrients from

101
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,280
the onions to improve the texture and

102
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,120
smoothness consistency of the juice

103
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,680
workers may add a small amount of

104
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,880
natural powder such as rice or corn

105
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,720
flour this powder not only enhances the

106
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,240
mouth feel but also helps keep the

107
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,360
product stable preventing separation

108
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,199
during

109
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,680
storage additionally a small amount of

110
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,280
sugar syrup may be added to create

111
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,560
create a harmonious color making the

112
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,360

114
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,319
nutritional values after juicing the

115
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,240
juice is heated to sterilize it

116
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:49,240
