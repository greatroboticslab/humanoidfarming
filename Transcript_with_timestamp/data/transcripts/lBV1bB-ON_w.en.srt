1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,429
since the West was settled farmers have

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,160
been turning rangeland into fields to

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,719
produce food for a growing population

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,969
many used a method called dryland

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,699
farming or agriculture without

6
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,740
irrigation dryland farming is an

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,449
agricultural practice that involves the

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,330
use of drought tolerant crops and

9
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,849
banking soil moisture it is common in

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,640
areas that have a wet season usually in

11
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,279
the winter or early spring in Wyoming

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,649
for dryland farming to be successful the

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,440
area must receive at least 15 inches of

14
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,450
precipitation annually and most of this

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,899
must come in the late winter or early

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,520
spring as heavy wet snow

17
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:47,309
moisture from the wet period is stored

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,920
in the soil the crops use that moisture

19
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,840
to germinate and grow traditional

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,390
dryland farming in Wyoming

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,600
uses a technique known as strip farming

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,899
one strip of land is planted and another

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,539
strip of land is left fallow fallow is a

24
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,880
period of no tillage where stubble from

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,729
the last year's crop is left to protect

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,369
the soil from erosion each year the

27
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,340
planted and fallow strips are rotated a

28
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,280
more modern form of dryland farming

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,830
requires no tillage each year the new

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,930
crop is planted into the stubble of the

31
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,479
fallowed strip and tillage does not
