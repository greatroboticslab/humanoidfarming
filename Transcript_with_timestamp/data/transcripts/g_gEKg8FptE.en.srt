00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,879
with the dawn of every harvest season

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,800
comes the influx of invasive weeds and

8
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,719
insects to the Navajo Nation these pests

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,239
invade and Destroy healthy productive

10
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,280
crops sometimes pest population control

11
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,960
is a necessary step to assure that crops

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,160
survive and are as plentiful as

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,480
possible natural enemies will take care

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,399
of some of the pests but the rest is up

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,600
to the farmer timely crop r ation

16
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,799
removal of the food that pests eat and

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,640
planning the timing of planting growing

18
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,600
and harvesting will get rid of some of

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,439
these pests but pesticides are often

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,600
still needed to achieve economic control

21
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,000
the single most important step in using

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,159
pesticides is to always read the label

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,880
and follow the directions on the label

24
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,920
exactly you are responsible by law for

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,439
any damage caused by pesticides to

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,439
people or property by reading the label

27
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,880
on the pesticide container you will have

28
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,280
all the inform information you need to

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,799
protect yourself and

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,880
others first determine the pest you need

31
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,320
to control and which chemical is best

32
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,159
fit to control it selective pesticides

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,880
will kill only the weed or insect that

34
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,240
is its Target non-selective pesticides

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,479
can kill more than just the

36
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,360
target there are many different types of

37
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,040
pesticides each is named based on the

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,560
pest it is designed to

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,799
control once the type of pesticide is

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,240
determined the formulation can be

41
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:03,719
selected formulations are either liquid

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,600
or dry there are four types of liquid

43
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,719
formulations solutions are one

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,280
formulation that comes ready for use and

45
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:13,000
require special application equipment

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,160
flowables must be mixed with

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,560
water aerosols in low concentration are

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,400
often used indoors as a fine spray or

49
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,400
Mist liquefied gas fumigants turn into

50
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,599

otherwise pesticides can be

104
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,800
lethal breathing Vapors or skin contact

105
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,520
is one of the most common methods of

106
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,160
pesticide poisoning pesticides can enter

107
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,960
your skin in Greater amounts than you

108

could swallow or inhale

109
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,240
pesticide drifts can be dangerous so

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,160
when mixing and pouring pesticides keep

111
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,759
them below eye level and work with the

112
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,520
wind to your side operate equipment so

113
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,560
that the pesticide drift is away from

114
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,880
you keep unauthorized people and

115
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,440
children away when using pesticides this

116
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,120
will help avoid accidental eating or

117
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,280
drinking know the signs and symptoms of

118
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,639
pesticide poisoning so that first aid

119
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,240
can be administered

120
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,199
immediately a person with mild pesticide

121
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,000
poisoning will exhibit signs of fatigue

nose and difficulty breathing if

135
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,000
pesticide poisoning occurs call the

136
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,440
paramedics immediately then read the

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,039
label for any first aid information

138
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,240
pesticide labels contain practical

139
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,400
treatment

140
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,160
information if skin contact has been

141
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,840
made remove the pesticide quickly if the

142
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,520
pesticide has been splashed in the mouth

143
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,639
or swallowed rinse the mouth out

144
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,240
immediately pesticides can be used

145
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,680
safely if labels are red proper

146
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,360
equipment and protective clothing is

147
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,759
worn and directions are followed

148
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,000
precisely p pesticide users must also

149
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,479
take their environment into

150
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,560
consideration when wind drifts occur the

151
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,919
pesticide is moved outside of the target

152
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,840
area and can be harmful to non-target

153
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,039
plants animals water and people do not

154
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,759
apply pesticides in moderate or strong

155
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:21,520
winds use a low pressure spray to avoid

156
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,240
drift pesticide runoff can kill fish and

157
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,639
wildlife and leech through the soil

158
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,759
contaminating

159
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,440
groundwater one of the most important

160
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,599
ways you can protect your environment is

161
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,160
with the careful storage and

162
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:33,440
transportation of

163
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,199
pesticides the recommended way to carry

164
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,680
pesticides is to place the container in

165
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,240
a plastic tub or bucket this tub should

166
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
be large enough to hold the contents of

167
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,759
the original container should it leak or

168
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,240
break secure the plastic tub in the bed

169
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,520
of a pickup truck store pesticides in

170
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,919
its original labeled container the

171
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,319
storage building should have a cement

172
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,280
floor always store pesticides away from

173
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,560
water or streams always store pesticides

174
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,400
in a cool dry place out of direct

175
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,800
sunlight if pesticides are spilled can

176
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,759
find the spill by building a dyke or by

177
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,599
soaking up the spill with sawdust or

178
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,440
soil once soaked up shovel into a leak

179
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:13,000
proof container for disposal into a

180
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,199
special pesticide landfill wash

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,440
containers at least three times before

182
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,199
disposal all containers must be

183
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,160
destroyed or buried after

184
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,960
use pesticide use is a safe and simple

185
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,160
way to control pests just remember that

186
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,879
the most common mistake in pesticide use

187
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,840
is made by ignoring one or two safety

188
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,560
procedures or pieces of equipment every

189
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,680
procedure and piece of equipment listed

190
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,840
on the label is

191
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,160
important as long as they are properly

192
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,000
used pesticides will help produce
