  "text": "South Dakota's educational effort to raise awareness about the importance of soil Health continues the USDA natural resources conservation service entered into a Cooperative agreement with the South Dakota noil Association and igro South Dakota State University extension for delivering these seminars with the latest soil health and productivity technology to South Dakota farmers and Ranchers okay well our next presenter Dr Cheryl ree was raised on a farm near Hancock Minnesota she received her undergrad and master's degrees at the University of Minnesota and her PhD in Agronomy from SSU Cheryl currently teaches soil science and Agronomy production courses and advises undergraduate and graduate Agronomy students at southa State University and her topic today is going to be salien in sodic soils understanding the difference and manag solutions everybody hear me hey thank you for um inviting me to speak in Mitchell here today my topic is going to be a little bit different from a lot of the other topics on the agenda you're going to hear a lot about cover crop from Dr Peter seon and D Wayne other people are going to speak but today I'm going to talk about something a little bit different I'm going to talk about s and soda soil management right so how many people have problem with solve here okay okay so I see a lot of people have Sol okay so and we've done a lot of work on this we've done work here we've done some work by and I'm going to CL here so here's my outline I'm going to talk a little bit about the caus of the problem I'm going to also talk about testing for Sol what should you look for in a soil test I'm going to talk about sampling for a little bit about how deep should you go what do you need to look for there and then I'm going talk about some management that we have and of course it's going to involve some cover CS it's also going to involve PL C Sy as well too so I have quite a few slides here um I know we're running ahead of time I won't take more time if you guys Ruth how do you guys want to do question do you just a little B is that better is that better no you can hear me now yeah now can hear me okay so Ruth how do you want to handle questions at the end or did you want people have questions what during when I'm speaking whatever is more comfortable for you you want okay I teach uh the college so I'm used to getting questions so if you have questions if you really want to if you see something on the slide just let me uh know I'll try to watch the audience here um so let's get going here okay so salt problems we have a lot of salt problems and they seem to be getting worse every year uh especially you know these spots they in a field they start out small and then each year they grow a little bit bigger right and so what's going on there so we've had a lot of changes in the climate since the mid 80s I mean um from North Dakota you guys haven't seen the rain your father probably didn't see the rain that you guys have seen in the last say 15 years you're kind of up in that Northeastern you know South Dakota area by wave where we've had all this rain a lot more rain Okay so we've had a lot more rain these last few years um we also in the 70s and stuff ' 80s we did corn and soybeans we did a lot of tillage all right we did a lot of tillage there uh tillage is going to destroy our soil structure right so we're doing with the tillage we're doing something bad for the soil we're destroying the what you've seen with your water and everything we're destroying that soil structure that allows water to go down into that soil profile all right the other problem is that we have Sals that are indigenous to this area okay when it wasn't wet when we weren't tilling okay those salts were down in the soil profile but they weren't coming up uh the salts have always been deeper in the soil profile okay so here let's just take a look at South Dakota right here a very good pointer okay so here's South Dakota right here all right here's where you guys are up by Lisbon up there in North Dakota we're all underlaying there by what we call the pure Shale all right and there's different formations underneath here the very top one is called the Bearpaw shale it's the upper deposit of the pure Shale so we have this Shale here that's below the majority of our state okay here that to go supposed to come out there there we go okay so here we look in the Upper Midwest right up in here all right so this is a precipitation map right here so here's South Dakota right here here's North Dakota we can see that and then you look at your decades here if we look up here in the ' 80s and the '90s we've had just a massive increase in precipitation okay so what have we done we changed our our cropping system from typically it would have been you know something like wheat uh you know grazing phow we've done a lot more tillage and we've added you know corn and soybeans in there okay corn being a short or soybeans being a short season cop sorry here right here okay so here's the pure shell this is in spank Colony right here so this is a geologic map right here and this is spin County up by Redfield South Dakota what they did here is they came through here and they did some sampling this is done with the uh South Dakota Geological Service and they came through here and they sampled across the county site one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and so what they did is they did some deep sampling here and what they did is at each of these sites one 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 10 there were what what type of formations do we have underneath there all right so that red line right down here the KP is the pure Shale and if you look along the left hand side here it says elevation and feet above mean sea level and here's the ground surface right up here so you can see right up here on a lot of this just across this one transect here in spank County you have a lot of that pure shell that's close to the surface well those salts are all in that pure Shale that's where they are those salts are indigenous in that pure shell okay and so what we do here is um seasonal use of the Tall Grass Prairie water was greater that and corn and especially soybeans and wheat rotation okay we also had very very deep roots with these prairie grasses that remove the water from deeper in the soil profile and I'll show you that here at the end how those uh perennial grasses really can pump that that water out so here's what's happened basically we've had this abundance of precipitation the '90s through the 2000 we have those salts that are indigenous down there okay they're not very far down what we do is in in soil and when I teach my soil science classes we call this capillary rise all right so lots of soil science terms here for you guys today because I teach soil science all right so capillary rise right here what happens is is that groundwater comes up it dissolves those salts from that Old pure shell the calcium the Magnesium the gypsum the sodium salts that are there it dissolves those salts from that pure shell and then what happens is based upon what your soil texture Is So based upon if you have a silk a silty LOM soil if you have a silty LOM soil those salts become dissolved in that water down there from that groundwater and now they start creeping up due to capillary rise it's kind of like if you look at like a really thin tube or if you look like look at a um a thermometer and it has water in there you'll see that it has a meniscus in there so it's climbing up in the soil because it would rather be more attracted to the soil uh above the surface that's in the groundwater so capillary rise occurs it comes up against ravity okay depends upon your text depends up on your texture and your soil Pro and your and your paracity so a soil that has a lot of play in it okay you're not going to get water creeping up as much a sandy soil you're not going to get water creeping up okay it's in these intermediate textured soils like these silt LOM and these types of soils where we see that water start to creep up the waterers the salts are dissolved in there the water comes to the Surface starts to warm up in the spring the water evaporates where are the salts where they're on your Fields right they're right on your fields and that's how they get there okay so that's a little bit of a background about how these areas develop okay so now that we know how they develop what can we do to manage them how do we figure out what do we have okay so now what we have to talk about is the type of salts that we have all right we have calcium magnesium salts and we have sodium salts all right so with the Sodium salts sodium means just like your table salt sodium all right what that means we call that a sodic soil and we call that a sodic soil we have the problem that plants will not grow and the soil is dispersed so dispersed means that you don't have that nice soil structure out there you walk out there and it looks like pavement okay there's no the the the the the the the agnet stability is not there all right so that's what it looks like this is a field up by Pon so you get a rainfall or something like that and you get this you get this it'll it'll start drying out this has a high clay t some of this does on the surface and nothing's going to move through here it looks just like caves right plants will not grow in the soil as dispersed okay with uh staline soil you have calcium and magnesium now you have plants that well you're enj plant problems but usually in a saline uh situation with calcium and magnesium salt usually your water will move through that area Okay so if you have an area out in the field where you don't have any water moving through it and nothing's growing there if it looks like concrete then you might want to look at testing for sodium all right saline uh problems typically we do have some structure there the problem is here is that no matter if it's a saline or sodic soil problem we have a high water table this is up by pant South Dakota here in we did some Field Days up by pure Pont we done some soil pits here this is a has a buried soil horizon but down right in here is about 6t feet down and we have water down here you can see how white that surface is there on that on those salts right there so that's where the that's where the problem comes from so what type of salts do we usually have here in South Dakota we have typically a lot of our salts are sodium uh uh sodium sulfate and depending on where you are you may have some gyps up we also have lime too as well okay but typically we're not when we look at the solubility here right there we're not as worried lime is usually not not a a salt problem because of the low solubility so what does solubility mean solubility means how much of that salt will dissolve in water okay so what is the solubility of that salt the salts that are really soluble are the ones that move up fast okay what happens is a lot of these sodium salts down here sodium chloride they have a high solubility so the higher the number here the more soluble the salt so the sodium will move up fast in the soil profile it gets up to the top it causes the soil to disperse it seals up now you have a big problem how you going to get that Sal out of there right um like I said typically we have these salts right here calcium magnesium salt and then of course we have our sodium salt salts but different problems and different management based upon if we have a calcium or magnesium salt based if we have a sodic salt there so when you're testing and looking at your salts and your soils you got to find what type of salt problem do you have first okay and this is what I'm talking about with this dispersion okay so what's going on here all right so when I talk that a sodic soil is dispersed it means that the soil the clay particles are pushed apart at pretty much equally spaced so that soil is so evenly dispersed there's really no paracity to that soil there's no channels for that water water to move down into that soil profile okay so you can't get anything to move through it the terms that we use are floculation versus dispersion all right floculation means that the soil is held together in Aggregates that there's pores between those individual soil pads for water to move down through it okay when we have sodium that aggregate stability is destroyed I okay said just some pictures here so saline straps calcium and magnesium you guys all have seen areas like this in your field all right high pH droughty conditions it's salty the so they salty water will not move into the those plant roads we can't get anything to germinate there poor germination poor growth but if you look at this soil here it's not great but there's a little bit of there there's a little bit of you can see a little bit of structure on the surface it doesn't look like pavement okay right here these are where we have these sodium problems right here pH typically higher than 8.2 a lot of dispersion no water movement anywhere into that soil profile okay we have erosion and we have limitation because this soil is so dense and so hard this is a field with a farmer that we work by up by pure Pont South Dakota um he's had a lot of issues with this field right here he does do no tail uh up here in this area here we have a a kind of a little bowl area here and he hasn't been able to get anything to grow here for quite a few years last may he had about 3in rainfall that came down washed all this out remember we have these sodic soils where we don't have any water moving in this the soil profile so what's it going to do it's going to run off as it goes down the slope it's going to increase in velocity you're going to pick up that speed okay so what happens here is you have a little bll shaped area up here trying to divert the water over to the ditch well now we have some problems here where uh it it uh some junk got in the ditch there so now it flows out over here flows into this area right here concentrated flow this is looking North right there from the area where we had the bull shaped area this is looking Sol this big here Gully right here was not here the previous year okay so lots of problems with managing these areas the big problem we get with these sodic soils is we have a lot of erosion problems okay so like I said just the difference between saline and sodic soil just to Define what these are so you guys have this definition in your hand okay salvs tend to help a soil flocculate okay a saline soil typically does not generally become a hard set we typically will get some water movement with that you can see those salts uh go a little bit farther down into that soil profile if we get some rainfall so that white area will appear and disappear based upon the moisture okay based upon where the moisture how much moisture you had rinf okay um water moves similarly compared to normal soils plants may be more negatively impacted in Saline soils sodium soils disperse or they swell they become hard step they come become like Pavements water cannot move there have a lot of huge erosion problem it can impact fertility because of this restrictive layer this high density and this low fertility so that's just a summary of what these soils are so we're looking at when we look at salts and soils we need to deci decide is it a calcium magnesium salt problem or is it a sodium problem what is the problem okay so in South Dakota you guys all know where your uh some the saline issues are but when we look at the sodicity here we see that up here by aine and County here 20 to 30% of these soils have sodic Horizon deeper down in the soil profile sodium in there here's Aurora County down here also a problem down here um more up here you know there's more coming up here we have not as much here but really you know the red and the yellow you know 10 to 30% of those soils in any given area have sodium deeper in the soil profile okay so is there any questions on what the problems are and how they differ before I go on doing questions okay all right okay so soil testing for salts uh some terms I'm just going to go through this I didn't know what my general audience would be so I wanted to Define these terms before I started talking about them uh electrical conductivity is the measure of the total salts in the soil we add salt to water it increases the conductivity same thing with soil we can measure that in the soil testing lab cation exchange capacity how many you guys remember that Okay C exchange capacity all right so that is going to be the soil's ability to hold on to positively charge cat Okay um s so the sodium absorption ratio it's a number that we calculate based upon the relative concentration of sodium to calcium and magnesium okay we typically do this from something called a saturated past and then the other one that we more the most more soil testing Labs use that you're probably going to see the exchangeable sodium percent okay we measure the sodium on the exchange sites from the uh P exchange typically here um I'm going to talk a lot about this right here today in South Dakota we in South Dakota the reason we did this project is because we we know these salty areas are getting bigger also when I would teach my soil science classes and I would get soil in from up by pure Pon these saly soils and I'd had my students go in there and and uh we test them and we come up with these SS that are are fairly low okay five or six s okay five or six s they are dispersed soil we try to run water through them they were dispersed nothing would work we've always used in South Dakota these guidelines right here all right so we use an S of 13 we say if it's greater than 13 it's a sodic soil well I never saw that when I bring my salty soils in and have my students try to run water through them the S was five or six that soil was dispersed I could get anybody to run water through it it's like what's wrong are these numbers wrong all right and then the ESP the same thing these numbers are very very similar so we uh we know this becoming a a lot bigger problem in South Dakota all right with the sailing areas I knew from working with the soil that I get from salty areas in South Dakota from my so from my class it's like what's going on here so we wrote Grant nrcs and we had some money to study these areas and so what we did is first thing we did like okay we need to test do these numbers work these numbers of determining the cut off values for Saline sodic soils were determined by the National cinity Lab out in California so we needed to do it for South Dakota so these numbers here are old numbers here from South Dakota or from from California the numbers that we look at now if our s is greater than four we consider it sodic if our ESP is greater than five we consider it sodic these numbers are too high for South Dakota okay so just a little bit of a review what's going on here okay so CAD exchange capacity so soil science here you know 200 so what's happening with can exchange capacity just a little bit of a review what happens why why do we have sodium problem okay um past recommendations said that when 15% of the cash exchange sites were occupied by sodium be classified it as a sodic soil so cation are are clay soils here are negatively charged due to how the formation process the geological formation process so we have negative charges that reside on these clay uh sheets here and of course we have positive cats that can be occupied on these sheets right so what happens is is when we get greater than now in our case we're looking at 5% South Dakota not 15% we're looking at 5% we're looking when we get greater than 5% of these exchange sites occupied by sodium these soils and end up just like a refrigerator magnet right so they're negatively charged and we need these positively charged cations on here to neutralize that charge and if we get calcium and magnesium but especially calcium we'll actually flocculate that we'll form a bridge negative charge on one clay iell negative charge on another throw a calcium in there positive to negative just like a refrigerator magnet what happens it's together we have Aggregates um stability form formation okay we hold that soil together okay when we put sodium in there okay sodium has a positive charge on it but the problem with sodium is that that positive charge is insulated it's completely insulated it's a small atom you put a lot of sodium in there you have that negative charge on those on those clay uh clay my cells those clay Aggregates what happens nothing in there neutralize it dispersed okay so that's why we have the problems that we have that's why we have the dispersion just like refrigerator magnet when we have too much sodium in there we have repulsion okay so what we how do we figure this out right so how do we figure this out what we did is we took large Columns of soil and we brought them in from the field from different places that was so and then what we did is we did we did some amendments as well we we worked some uh soil amendments I'm going to talk about that in just a minute but what we did here is we looked at okay based upon what the S is so down here it says initial soil S A initial sodium concentration so here is five here is 10 here's 15 and here's 20 then what we did is we started running water through this okay so permeability milles per or milliliters per hour is what we looked at here all right so what we saw here in southa that when we saw an s on these big soil columns that we brought in we brought in there about this big round about this deep our grad a student um did this work on part of his PhD and what he did here is he ran water through this these initial one so we saw slow infiltration um at an S of greater than four we're doing this work with Tom dutter you know tomter up in North Dakota the soil scien have you ever heard of Tom at all before or not okay he's doing a lot of the salt work up in South Dakota up in North Dakota we did this work with Tom dter he's looking at the number he's using for North Dakota is five so remember we said this used to be 13 it's way lower for our soils than than than 13 so right here uh considering 1 Mill per hour uh as a threshold the data suggests that s greater than four can be considered sodic because once we hit this much sodium in the soil we can just see how much oops sorry you can just see how much there that our water infiltrations blows down okay so that's the problem that's the problem and here here's how we're trying to give some terminology and describe the the extent of our problem with some of these soil testing values so in South Dakota here uh all numbers are soil e to measure the tot salt we used four with a saturated paste greater than four we call it a saline soil that's what saturated a past we talk about that in just a minute too okay s of greater than 13 with sodic ESP greater than 15 with soda these are old numbers we are going to we are rewriting all of this we're going to work with the nrcs to put out some bulletins on this new nrcs research project for North and South Dakota we're still going to go with four as saturated pce of the saline soil but here we're going to use in in North Dakota they're using five in South Dakota we're using four es of five okay so a lot of different numbers here than what we originally thought and that's why when I go get the soil the the soil samples uh from from these salaries from out in the field and I bring them in to my for my students to work on you're doing water infiltration I'd have an S or five or six and it's like that's why the water would go through it it's because there's too much sodium in those soils already at an S of four or five okay so now when you're testing for salts okay there are some questions you need to ask the soil testing lab because what we're going to do is we first of all we have to determine the total salt content and then we got to figure out how much sodium is in that total salt content all right so just a percentage so when they extract for salt soil testing Labs will either use most of you use a one to one extract so what does that mean that means that you take 100 gram of soil and you mix it with 100 gram of water and you mix it together that's a one to one extract okay then you let that sit for a little while and you'll put a a EC probe in there and you'll measure the electrical conductivity um with a saturated paste that is totally different with the saturated paste what we do is we take the soil and uh my kids love to do this all right you guys probably all did this when you're little your grandkids do it you take a cup of soil and you mix it with enough water just until it looks like melted chocolate okay and that's called the saturated paste you let that sit that settles out and then you measure what the EC is in the top of that saturated past so we have two very different ways of um determining EC here we have a much more dilute method than what we have over here if you're not going to if you take one to one take 100 gram of soil 100 Millers of water and mix that together you're going to get a fairly dilute solution here remember we're going for melted chocolate with the saturated paste okay why is this important because the EC is used to C estimate the total salt so if we're going to calculate their percent sodium we need to know the total percentage of salts that are there you can use our EC to do this okay but we have to make sure that we understand the method that we're measuring the total salt okay because if we look at concentration of sodium in the in in the on the top of the fraction and the concentration of total cations in the bottom if we have a different number down here that's going to make our percentage different right so um because EC is used to count the total salt is required for s or the ESP okay so here this is how this kind of goes if I'm reading a uh EC of four and that is aoic soil on a saturated past that is going to be equivalent to a EC of two in a 1:1 delution okay and remember we're looking at the the our criteria for a saline soil is EC = 4 on a saturated paste it's not EC equals 4 on a 1: one solution okay so here and if we go take that some Labs may do a 1 to five delution once again we're diluting that out an EC of four on a saturated paste equals an EC of two on a 1:1 delution equals an EC of 0.72 on one to five solution so understanding how the EC is calculated is very important when you're trying to determine the am total Sals that you have out in the store okay this needs to be taken into account when making management recommendations okay so here's a little graph and I also should mention too I have a very technical article uh it's available out on one of the tables there's only about 60 copies of it but a lot of this information that we are that I have here we are put in where we have a core manual that was very poor when it was initially made and we are rewriting that completely and we're going to have the the chapter for Saline sodic soil management that draft chapter Ruth you have that out in the right there I'll put them on the registration table we've got two two different ones but they'll both be yeah and there's also a really good one there from North Dakota so if you're interested in some of these the stuff that I'm showing here if you want some information about this to take home and read U Roose will have that back out on the on the table back there okay so just a little general guideline too texture is really important too when it comes to measuring our EC versus our uh we're going to do it with a saturated paste or one to one delution okay this Dave Franson did this back in 2007 soil scientist up at NTSU so keep that in mind that when you are testing for salt you're going to ask for the EC the EC is going to estimate your total salts in that soil okay what that number number represents is going to be different based upon your extraction method so when you talk to a soil testing lab you need to know their extraction method now we've contacted a lot of our soil testing labs around here about Iowa State is about the only one that's running the saturated pce so if you go to North Dakota University of Minnesota egg viice Ray Ward lab pretty much everybody's doing one to one right here now what type of sodium index are they calculating there what types of values are they looking at there well pretty much everybody egg Vice Labs up in North Dakota Minnesota Valley testing W lab pretty much everybody there is running pretty much everybody's running in ESP so that's what you're going to probably that's the type of dat you're going to get okay so now soil sampling for salts all right so where you going to stand the top 6 in you know is it going to be like phosphorus where it doesn't move is it like nitrate or chloride where it's going to move so what do you to think about soil sampling for yourself okay so when we look at soil sampling okay now I'm once again I teach soil so I got to use some soil terms here everybody okay all right taxonomy soil scientists you know when with Biology you know we have a taxonomic system where you classify you all the different types of organisms well soil scientists also have their taxonomic system as well too where they come up with this long name right here uh that describes kind of what the soil is I'm going to use an xline and an abine soil these soils are more common uh up in the up probably up north up by Red field and up in that area here you guys your soils down here probably be like a beetle soil or something like that down here your soil series name spinetic Fric leptic naad dool okay that's our xline soils it's the soil series name that you would see in your on the on the nrcs soil survey map and an aine fine IC frigid glossic natur doll so what does all this mean right here fine texture lot of clay whole climate differences are here all right natur natric uh sodium that means you have sodium in it where you have quite a bit of rainfall and this means that it was derived from a grassland soil okay so what is the basic difference between letip and glossic when we look at this okay lepic means that you have the absolute worst sodium conditions that you could have blosic would be the best tiic would be in the middle okay right here here is an example of leptic soil these slides are from Tom D Suter up in North Dakota because I didn't have any good as good of pictures as it as him okay so the sodium is very close to the soil surface with sodic soil you get this columnar structure so if you see something like this out in your field this kind of columnar structure that starts to form and the soil is really really hard and down you most likely have sodium there okay glossin means that that that that sodium is deeper in the soil profile so you get it down in here or something like that where you see pan in that hard pan anywh you get these hard pans forming here in South Dakota and a lot of times those hard bands are due to that sodium in there making that soil really dense so nothing will Groll through it okay like I said here and of course these areas are going to be interspersed between each other okay these areas you know in your field are small okay and they can they they're they're they're scattered out okay and the degree of of of sodium issues you can change in a very short short period of time so here's the lectic where that sodium is more on the soil surface right there nothing's going to grow there and here's that glassic over there so soil samples how deep why where and where are we in the soil sample okay agronomic is 2 ft typically that's what we're looking for okay now I know there's a lot of different opinions on tile uh tiling in the in in the audience here all right if you tiling with these sodium sodic Fields is is something that kind of tricky okay can cause problems okay at least 3 feet to figure out where that sodium is okay if possible to the depth of the tile why do we want to do that it's a lot of work why do we want to go that deep if we are going to tile we want to invest in that tile we want it to work what happens is if you're evaluating for a drain tile there then you need to look down at least 3 ft deep here's why okay so here's a picture this here are three different types of xline soils up by aine up in that area there um right here we have the S right here and then the surface below um the depth below the surface okay here's your X line right here okay so here we had not very high s at all all the way down all the way down to 30 in almost 3 ft down here on on the X line one we started about four okay so North Dakota says that five there dispersed we come down here well about 2 ft we're at 10 with this last X line right here you started about six 10 in down we're about s of 15 about 18 in down foot and a half 20 in or S of 25 and at almost 3 ft we're at an S of almost 27 okay so now you go put a tile line in here okay you put that tile line below that sodium Horizon think you're going to get water to flow in there get your sodium Horizon here get your tile line down here is water going to flow no yeah so why isn't going to flow what's what's that sodium doing to that subsoil surface what's this doing it's dispersing it right it's dispersing it okay so here's the problem right here that we see uh that's why I don't know if thaing is a very good idea in South Dakota with with the types of soils that we have so when we have uh it's a it's kind of like a balance you can think it's a teer pot so if we have quite a b bit of sodium in here okay in the soil and we have a high EC we'll have a dispersed soil all right because we have enough calcium and magnesium over here to flocculate that soil and have some soil structure there if we take and we start tiling and we start moving some of those other salts out of this water we start moving some of that calcium that magnesium out of that soil through that tile water remember the sodium it's going to move up and down pretty fast but once it gets up it's going to disperse the soil and still move if you get water through there you can't get water to go through there because it's dispersed okay so right here that's the problem so you know um May negative impact you know pull of water from a tile line you know water doesn't flow from tile uh from the tile if the F field Still Remains wet so that's why when it comes to tiling and South Dakota you need to know what your subsurface soils are you need to know what types of soils you have there you know because if you do have sodium down deep piling it is not really a good option so any questions so far about that stuff all right so soil management how can we manage this right and I have until how long do I have until like 15 minutes okay all right so it sounds good so how do we manage this so we've looked at this a couple different ways okay we've looked at this by putting soil amendments on and we've looked at this by putting perennial crops on and trying to put cover crops out there okay uh studies that we've done we've worked at Pier Pont we worked at an Andover we wor we had we're going to put in Falon so Pier pont's been Greg toppel I have to give credit to the farmers we're working with here pure PO is Greg toppel and over is Roger and Grant rips um Redfield is going to be we're working with Jim Miller craft consultant there and then uh Kenny Selman is the uh he Farms the land and Jerry West is the land owner that's who we've been working with here and then down in your area down here we've been working with David Gillan at White Lake so these are the farmers that we've worked with you couldn't do this research without them right so what we've done is we've looked at okay now if we have too much sodium there if we add some calcium can we improve that floculation okay so what we've done is we've taken and we put out our studies where we put all these plots out we design them so we can do statistics on it because we like to do statistics you know so um four blocks and the treatments that we put on are going to be calcium sulfate or gypsum Elemental sulfur calcium chloride or no salt those are the types of salt that's the treatments that we're putting out there okay and then what we've done is we've done two cover crop treatments of course we got you know there's no there's nothing growing out there okay because the salts are so high drilled into corn uh in Redfield we've had some luck we have more of a saline soil there you can but a lot of the cover crops we just put into the soil if we drill it into corn we're putting it into V6 but we're always putting the cover crops planting them probably about mid mid to end June uh with after these Sals ands have been put on okay so now you say I have salt you tell me to put more salt out there all right that doesn't make any sense right I have salt and now you're going tell me go put more salt up there okay well here's what's happening okay the salt most of them have a a component to an either sulfur or in the case of chloride okay where they're going to lower the soil PH all right so if we put anything with sulfur on so if we put an ammonium sulfate if we put gypsum on if we put Elemental sulfur on what happens is we lower the soil PH we release calcium from the lime and we hope to be able to exchange that with the Sodium on the exchange set so that's why I showed you that picture of uh C exchange that's what we're trying to do we have too much sodium on those exchange sides we're trying to lower the soil PH bump a bunch of calcium off flood the system with calcium and through cat exchange now we have more calcium in solution will promote the movement of the sodium off that exchange site get it in solution and now once sodium is in solution we can get it to go down if we get rainfall okay Elemental suer takes longer to work than gypson okay so if I'm going to put out when we look at this we we when we look at the tempar elemental sulfur and gypsum Elemental sulfur you need to oxidize that down to sulfate to form acid to get the calcium up so typically when you put amendments on if you're going to apply amendments you put them Elemental sulfur on it's going to take about 6 months to work compared to gypson so El but you need less of Elemental sulfur right so anything so what here's what we're doing any Amendment with sulfur lowers the soil PH releases the calcium cation into that solution to exchange with the Sodium okay and we have to have formation of that hydrogen of the acidifying of that soil to get that calcium off that Elemental sulfur when it's applied it's straight As we need the soil bacteria to oxidize that into our sulfate so we can have that acid formation so that's what we're doing I'm asking you to apply a salt but I'm really not asking you apply a salt I'm really asking you apply something that has an acid in it to lower that pH and get that calcium off okay so here let's take a look here I just did some study here so this is pure pant celic coder right here this is our there we go uh right here so I don't have a very good pointer in the red box up there here's my pure Pon site sodium right there 4,846 parts per million s of 19 bad soil okay that's the first thing I'm going to talk about uh what we did here is we had this is what the plots look like right here these sub PL this was put on um a year after after these photos were taken okay so here's site number one no treatment no salt Amendment no cover crop looks pretty ugly looks like it looks like concrete and those are the white salts on the surface so that's the first one right there this one here is calcium chloride we had some cover crop on the surface you can kind of sort of roll it right there we had a big rainfall that came down through here after we planted our cover crop kind of roll it a little bit there cover crop we planted with barley and sugar bead so that's that one right there here's gypsum down here so gypsum down here you can roll it a little bit better right there you can roll it a little bit better there that's the gypsum right there P salt on the surface and here's our Elemental solf for right here and if you look at this Elemental sufur right here you can see that that soil doesn't have quite it doesn't have the white salts on the surface if these other ones do so at least in this study with the conditions that we saw at pure Pont where we had the high sodium the high is now we have a lot of magnesium in this soil too okay that that has an influence as well too but at least here we saw we put an elemental so for a year before we came out and planted a cover crop in there a barley and sugar beads The Barley grew way better than the sugar beads did I agree and you know what Greg toel has a huge problem up there he's just like he I asked him I said can what can can we work in this field he says you can do anything you want is what he said so yeah and you know if we what would happen is if we start growing all these weeds for a cash crop then they start get diseasing and die yeah that's exactly what would happen okay all right so um right here Elemental sulfur you know Bary germinated go pretty well gypsum some of the barley germinated calcium chloride salt so how much should we put on we do these calculations based upon an S A lot of times we rather use EC or ESP to do the calculations um we drips them we put on to lower that uh almost uh you know 4 tons per acre right there cost 12 cents so it's not cheap uh calcium chloride works really fast okay you can put calcium chloride on calcium chloride is highly dissolvable in the soil you should not put calcium chloride on if corn is growing there I learned that the hard way um so but it came back I thought it was going to be dead I we we put some on I told the gradu soon I said make sure you put it down the middle of the row I said do not put it near the corn plant so what they didone broadcast it all over you came and looked at the corn plants of the kisum chloride they look like they were gone but they fortunately we had a big rainfall two days later all the calcium chloride went down the corn started looking a lot better so I felt a lot better about that so you know so mother nature interven um Elemental sulfur you don't need as much all right um so that's a little bit cheaper but it takes a a lot longer to react and of course no Sal that doesn't cost any money if you don't do anything now so how are these rates calculated so I'm running out of time I only have 5 minutes left I if you're interested in learning on how you calculate these the information you need from your soil cast is the C exchange capacity of the soil you need that measure and you need the ESP I would prefer the ESP versus the S and so what we would want to do is we want to reduce the ESP in that surface soil down to at Le at least 5% if not less okay so I'm not going to go through these calculations CU I'm running out of time here if you want to go through these if you're interested in this from a you know from a Consulting point for applying gypsum I can show you how to do it it's also in that guideline up there there's some nice boxes and step-by-step details on how to do it but there but this is the method where we used the ESP and what we're basically trying to do is we're trying to take that we know this is the total salts on the surface we know what our ESP is we test that we want to go down to five what's the difference between what our ESP is to go down to five that is going to be uh that's the the math that we work out to determine how much of an amendment that we put out okay like I said I'm going to run out of time okay now Bas since these amendments are a little bit different the word we use when I teach soil science is molecular weight the mass um you can put on just like with lime a different lime product you can put on different rates based upon what their math is so if I put on one ton of gypsum I can put on19 uh tons of sulfur um if I put sulur sulfuric acid I put 57 calcium chloride 86 and so on okay so last one I just want to mention is this here I know I'm almost have the time do I have five minutes yet or not three okay talk M okay right okay so here David gillet he's a great producer is he David Gill here I don't I didn't know if he's coming today okay so here's an area in his field right here white salt 2010 contacted us we got some money from the corn Council what can we do okay so s we did a field day down there 2011 tall wheat grass right here looks just beautiful that's this old white sight right here got a soil pit okay look at this here it it look like snow out there in August 4 in down very very few salts right there no salts on the surface right here down at the bottom of the pit soil scientist you like to talk about redo features okay redo features means that you have this Orange in here these orange colors like can't really see them but right in there right in there that means iron has been oxidized if you have a piece of old equipment that sits out in the woods you don't pay any attention to it what happens to it it what happens to it over time it will what rust okay when iron in the soil is in the present of oxygen it does the same thing it turns orange so I know that where I had those Sal problems that was the 4ot in my soil profile I have uh reduxx features that are orange there hasn't been water there for a few few years soil water water table is deeper down here here is a pit that we do right by his cornfield in his cornfield as a matter of fact sorghum corn a soybean rotation water at the bottom of the pit okay white salt right up by the surface up there okay so here's what's going on um oh shoot okay right here uh white great here's our soil White Lake right here that we did this in August right here the weat by this uh the S by the site right there uh I'm hting too many buttons right here the S was one sodium is 179 here the right in the the the pit in the cornfield Horizon 1 2 and three sodium 1296 s borderline right there he we have a we have sodium issues there okay so like I said I talk a little bit more about this but I'm running out of time Bruce KY did work with uh looking at n as soil scientist looking at water table depths here where is the water right here these lines are where the water table depth is based upon precipitation look at this where we had alala and grass 2010 we had all that rainfall we had the same problem with South Dakota you guys did okay too much rainfall even when we had all that rainfall where we had that and where we had that Al Alpa right there that water that um that soil that water table was considerably lower so I'm going to end there because I'm running out of time I'm going to go here and I'm going to give credit to all my the people that they help with our research then right there okay so like I said I really appreciate coming and talking to you about cell here I think it's an important subject we two quick questions if anybody has quick question be around yep I'll be around Y and so if you're interested in talking more about that I'd be happy to answer questions",
