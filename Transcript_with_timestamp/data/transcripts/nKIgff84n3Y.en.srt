1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,440
bedding is going to change with the

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,519
season and uh with cattle, at least a

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,320
lot of the individuals I'm working with,

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,120
we're feeding uh calves, calves in the

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,520
fall, maybe yearlings uh to get another

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,480
turn through there. Uh when we bring

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,560
them in in the fall, we're dealing with

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,039
smaller calves, probably start them out

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,880
on a a little bit uh less hot diet in

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:34,160
terms of nutrients and so forth.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,079
Um it's normally dry. Um the bedding is

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,160
the highest quality we're going to have

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,440
each year. So that we're probably going

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,960
to start out with using utilizing the

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,719
least amount at that time. As winter

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,800
goes on, hopefully the calves are

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,680
growing. The quality of the bedding

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,640
still good. We will have the the

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,520
occasional snowstorms that come through

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,039
and big openings on our buildings will

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,280
allow uh some of that to come in. Need

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,520
to adjust and then increase the amount

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,560
of bedding when that happens. Uh

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:13,280
spring we're dealing now with bigger

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,760
cattle. Normally if we have some uh rain

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,479
or so forth, the bedding is going to be

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,200
wet. So part of its usefulness has

28
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,439
already been used up. We have that thaw

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,960
period and high humidity. So we're not

30
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,520
going to get the the evaporation and we

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,960
do get the frequent rains. So again,

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,360
we're going to have to adjust our

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,880
bedding upward.

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,400
Now, uh, the last one is summer. And I

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,560
put this on here for the people that

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:47,040
have changed

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:50,320
from a open feed lot to a bedded barn.

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,720
They tell me that the biggest thing that

39
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,840
was a aha moment in terms of it is you

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,079
use more bedding in the summer than you

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,920
did the fall and winter, which is the

42
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,840
exact opposite. If you beded in an open

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,600
lot, you beded during the winter, but

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,720
you never did anything during the

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,360
summer. With these facilities to keep

46
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,400
things moving, one, you've got great big

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,720
cattle. You've got hot conditions. The

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,599
cattle are drinking more. Some of the uh

49
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,840
feed ingredients we have may contain

50
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,840
some additional sodium, some additional

51
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,720
things that cause the animals to drink

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,640
more. more drinking is going to produce

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,200
more urine needs to be soaked up and

54
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,040
often at the very end of the feeding

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,519
period we're dealing with deterior

56
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:48,560
deteriorated bedding. It's pretty much

57
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:51,440
used up. So they'll often times use 50%

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,599
more bedding in the summer than they do

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,959
in the winter. And they did not expect

60
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,360
that to be um when they started out with

61
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,360
the facility.
