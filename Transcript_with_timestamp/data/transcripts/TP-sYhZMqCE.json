  "text": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] going on a road trip going to get a big one what are we going to go get bow a bowl are you excited yeah good I too pretty excited in January Ryan was in a car accident and he injured his ribs pretty bad and could not work we went a couple of weeks without a paycheck and we went over a month without going grocery shopping and one of the good things that came out of it is we realized that we had enough meat and vegetables in our storage because we had raised enough from our farm and we were okay there the only thing that I had to have Ryan stop and get at the grocery store during that month was milk butter cheese and sour cream all dairy products and all I could think was we have got to make getting these cow's bread the top priority so after 2 years of trying to find a bowl locally to breed our Piney Woods and now our mini Jersey we have fin finally found what we hope is the perfect bow he is very young so we have a little bit of time to raise him before he's going to be ready for the job but it should be pretty minimal amount of time considering we've already waited 2 years so one of the challenges that we have faced with having our own cows is finding the proper B to breed them with originally we thought we were going to have access to a Pineywoods bowl that didn't work work out and we started searching for a bowl for our piny Woods 2 years ago well a lot of people don't realize is Piney Woods are actually a very short breed of cow they're usually under 45 in into the mini range and so what I was looking for was a mini bowl or a bowl 45 in or shorter like a Dexter um mini Highland mini jersey and because we have a small farm with small kids we really didn't want the bulll as a full-time Adventure we wanted to borrow a bull breed our cows and be done with it that did not work out at one point we had a texture lined up but he ended up getting sold before we had a chance to use him so the journey continued on searching for the right Bowl one that was small enough to breed our cows safely but also you know make Mak sure that they were disease test disease free tested good you know quality all of that became a very difficult Journey we looked into Ai and from everything in our research AI would be a very expensive way to maybe get our cows sprad looking into AI turned out to be something that I didn't think we could financially handle there were a lot of different reasons why I also was faced with AI technicians that said that they could not get the straws for the smaller bowls and nobody guarantees it it's not a guarantee even if I pay almost $1,000 to have my cow AI I have no guarantee that it would work and they don't come back and do it again for free so it didn't feel like the right fit for us in our situation we don't have a cattle shoot we don't have the infrastructure that would have made made it easy to do AI so we went back to looking at Bulls again we basically sat back prayed on it said you know all right let's see what the universe is going to bring us we we know that the right decision is ahead of us we know that we're going to get our cows bread we just don't know how yet and then I came across an ad for some beautiful miniature Jersey gold cabs [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh I tell you what this is nothing like a baby goat or sheep bottle this thing's huge baby calves are huge morning chap how are you doing buddy good morning are you ready for your Bubba yeah oh you know what time it is yes you do just about the cutest time ever on the homestead so this is trap he is our new Mini Jersey bull calf and he will be breeding in a few months when he's ready to our mini Jersey Daisy and our Piney Woods so we are very excited to have this opportunity for milk on our Homestead at a much higher volume than goats or sheep could ever provide he keeps running for the door even though it's closed it's like he almost knows it's not locked I'm trying not to get attached or overly affectionate with him because he is a bull and Bulls can be dangerous when they're older which is super hard cuz he is so so sweet he wants more milk I'm trying to break his bottles up into two feedings for my sanity cuz his bottle only holds half a gallon so yeah he thinks he's supposed to have more milk right now but we're going to break it up into two feedings a day instead of one oh no put it his head don't pit his head I have to keep telling myself that my cows love to have their head scratched so I'm trying not to do that cuz he's a bull and I don't want to encourage any off behaviors but he likes his neck scratched and he likes his body scratched so I'll do that it's hard not to love on him all day long but I also want to make sure that he doesn't get to be a mean Jersey so he's staying in the trailer today we got home late last night and it was dark so we said okay you just go to bed we'll we'll set you up with a cool little spot in the morning so when Ryan gets home in a little bit we're going to do just that aren't we but buddy I keep calling him buddy cuz he's like a buddy but his his other friend that we didn't purchase was named buddy so I'm like I'm hope I'm not confusing him but yeah he's doing good I shouldn't be letting him look on me probably huh that's what some of you probably going to be saying in the comments I'm going to take all advice that um is kindly delivered and I'm going to do even more research because I was actually thinking we were going to end up getting buddy who is already off of the bottle he was a month older and then when I met them it was obvious see how he just did that headbutt thing that's a I want my mama milk movement I don't want them to think I'm mama so I got to be a little more assertive with him using my knee to push him back when he's a little too pushy and I don't want to stop him from licking me I oh my gosh how am I supposed to not let him do that oh I can't let him do that it's bad I can't do this oh my goodness I'm going to get so much Flack for this God she's so sweet how do you people with bowls on a bottle handle this I don't know how to handle it but I'm going to do my best and it's going to be it's it's going to be good enough he's only going to be here long enough for his breeding and then we will offer him to a new home [Music] Daisy do you have pollen in your nose huh you got Pine poen all in your nostrils hi baby so Daisy is ready for breeding but we've had a hard time finding a bowl locally that is small enough for her so we had to take steps to get our very own all right come on I turned it on to show how good he was walking with me and he stopped okay come on he's such a good boy come on baby bringing him to his new shelter I decided to let him off the leash here in the quiet guine in the buck pan so he could stretch his legs get some exercise this is his new shelter over here until he's big enough to go in with the big girls good work daddy those cows are like what is that feeding time on the homestead everybody gets a little bit of grain even if they don't quite need it spoiled babies good job Daddy good job Liam yeah good job trap I'm going to go make you a bottle okay will you be will you be happy if I make you a bottle you got your nice bed you got lots of hay and water and food oops and you're super curious you're so sweet I'm not supposed to pet the head is that right I don't know he seems so young still like he needs a little bit more affection cuz he's so little I'm so little all right I'm going to go get you a bottle you're acting like you need a bottle you're doing that bottle thing that babies do who's a good boy huh who's a good boy trap what are you doing Liam I'm feeding the cat that's fun huh yeah a he loves oops careful like I said watch when he bumps that you don't bump your knuckles on the fence he is very excited to have his bottle you know there is one thing that I can say is that cows are a much different investment than goats you are going to spend four times as much on a single animal the inputs of milk are going to be four times as much the inputs of time are four times as much everything is just quadruples but it's so going to be worth it I just know it I can't wait till I'm just making cheese and butter and enjoying all of the fresh raw milk for our family one thing I know is that with three growing boys the goat milk was just not high enough volume and high enough cream to make all of the other sub products so this was the best decision our family could make and I do not regret it not one bit I don't regret the time or the money invested into this it is already filled my heart with pride and love and I am so glad oh that we could do this hi Daisy I heard you she wasn't there when I started recording she just showed up she loves her mama don't you Daisy girl don't you love mama she what girl this my Daisy Daisy is where my dream really began to come true never thought I would be able to get a mini Jersey [Laughter] heer but with the generosity of somebody gifting this one to us made it possible never could have done it otherwise",
