2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,520
well you've done all your planning you

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,760
know what where you can build a dam you

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,800
know how big a dam you want

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,280
you know you're sitting within

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,960
legislation uh you're right to go

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,119
there's three probably different types

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,199
of dams or construction you look at so

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,039
you've got a one wall or a single wall

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,800
two wall or a three wall we're looking

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,720
at here today

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,880
your landscape will determine what type

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,800
of dam you need and your your operator

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,279
or your designer will understand exactly

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,559
what is needed for that situation

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,520
everything you do when you're

17
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,600
constructing a gym is about longevity

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,320
good planning when you're pegging your

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,079
dam is is very vital and to consider

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
where your outlet's going to be and

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,160
where your trigger pipe's going to spill

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,640
the outlet is where the water leaves

23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,079
your dam so that outlet needs to match

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,239
the amount of water that's coming in

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,320
your dam so when you've got a storm the

26
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,640
water needs to be able to exit the dam

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,559
as much as it's coming into the dam so

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
they need to match each other

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,160
you want to see a good outlet you want

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,080
to make sure that outlet is outletting

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,240
free of the dam it's not running beside

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,799
a damn bank and causing damage to your

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,880
dam it's not causing erosion so you need

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,640
your spill area to go into nice grass

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,880
flat area

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,600
other considerations are do you need a

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,360
trickle pipe is it a trick or flow to

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,600
have that trickle pipe in your dam will

39
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,280
keep your outlet dry and it will keep

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,040
your paddock dry where that water's

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,840
leaving your dam so that trickle pipe

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,840
will

43
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,159
exit that small flow straight behind

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,159
your dam into the existing area of where

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,560
it would have naturally went

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,960
a bad outlet you'll see your damn outlet

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,840
will start to erode you'll start to get

48
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,600
channelizing of your outlet and your dam

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,600
is basically starting to break down or

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,759
deteriorating so a good outlet is vital

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,520
a key point when you're building a dam

52
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,680
is you want to make sure that all your

53
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,520
water is covering your excavation so

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,159
whenever you're excavating material to

55
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,640
build your dam water's got to cover that

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,119
if that's exposed and water can run over

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,920
it when it's filling that's a potential

58
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,520
point to start erosion

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,680
you want to make sure you've got good

60
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,280
clay coming up over your banks

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,440
you want to make sure they put a key in

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,920
so when you strip all your topsoil off

63
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,920
you take that to the back of your dam

64
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,400
and then you build your dam out of good

65
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,160
clay you want to make sure where the

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,560
clay is touching the ground they've put

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,720
what they call a key line in so it's

68
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,239
actually clay laying on clay

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,080
and when you're finished you bring that

70
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,120
topsoil back up over your dam and so

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,720
your dam can be grassed up in the future

72
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,000
if you've got a really good operator

73
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,000
they'll understand that you need good

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,440
compaction of your soil so when they're

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,319
building it they need to be compacting

76
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,400
that clay material as they build it

77
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,519
that's a determination of whether a dam

78
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,680
can fail

79
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,000
whether it'll leak

80
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,920
so in this example we've got a really

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
good well constructed dam this dam's

82
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,760
probably 10 to 12 years old and you can

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,760
see it's still in really good nick

84
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,280
you've got a good batter on the back and

85
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,040
a good batter on the front

86
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,440
you want to be seeing a three to one on

87
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,800
the front and minimum two and a half to

88
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,640
three to one on the back side of the dam

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
you'll have a crest so the width of the

90
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,080
top of the bank you want to be looking

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,239
at a good three metre so you're after a

92
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,159
big fat bank

93
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,599
the other consideration is what we call

94
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,000
freeboard so that's the amount of

95
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,920
material above top watermark to the top

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,920
of the bank you're looking at a minimum

97
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,280
of a meter free board and if you've got

98
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,920
all them aspects you're going to have a

99
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,760
well constructed dam

100
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,519
as you can see if you can get your dam

101
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,230
construction right you'll have a good

102
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,230
reliable dam into the future

103
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,230
